## Question

What is this a kit non-social fears

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "non-social fears" are and how to define them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core definition and how "non-social" contrasts with "social" fears. Then, I should verify examples across anxiety disorders and check for any exceptions. Next, I will consider developmental patterns and epidemiology. After that, I should review neurocognitive and psychophysiological distinctions. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful definition and note implications for assessment and treatment, making sure I anchor each point to appropriate sources.

> Let me first confirm the basic contrast: "non-social fears" are fears that are not about social evaluation or interpersonal scrutiny, whereas "social fears" center on being negatively judged, embarrassed, or rejected in social or performance situations. This distinction is explicit in ICD-11's organization of anxiety and fear-related disorders by the focus of apprehension, where social anxiety disorder is defined by fear of social scrutiny and specific phobia by fear of objects or situations unrelated to social evaluation [^112MyoKo].

> I need to check concrete examples to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. Non-social fears include fear of heights, animals, blood/injection/injury, enclosed spaces, flying, and contamination, which are classic specific phobias; they also include fear of panic-related bodily sensations in panic disorder and fear of being unable to escape or get help in agoraphobia, none of which require the presence of social evaluation as the core threat, even though social contexts can be involved secondarily [^1148xaR3] [^111KwRts].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about agoraphobia being "social". I initially thought agoraphobia might be social because crowded places are common triggers, but wait, let me verify the core fear. The defining feature is fear of situations where escape might be difficult or help unavailable if panic or embarrassing symptoms occur, not fear of negative evaluation per se, so agoraphobia remains a non-social fear domain despite frequent social-context triggers [^112MyoKo] [^111KwRts].

> Next, I should review developmental patterns to see if the social versus non-social divide tracks with age of onset. Specific phobias often begin in childhood and peak in midlife, whereas social anxiety disorder typically emerges in late childhood through adolescence; this timing supports the heuristic that many non-social fears appear earlier and social fears consolidate later, though exceptions exist and comorbidity is common [^1148xaR3] [^114XwiyD].

> I will now examine epidemiology to ensure the examples reflect real-world patterns. Large adolescent surveys show high prevalence of specific fears, with blood-injection-injury and animal fears among the most common, and a substantial proportion meeting criteria for specific phobia; this aligns with the notion that non-social fears are prevalent and often underrecognized clinically [^112Ux4kB].

> Let me consider neurocognitive and psychophysiological distinctions that might separate social from non-social fear processing. In social anxiety, observational learning and amygdala–prefrontal circuits show heightened responses to socially relevant cues, whereas non-social phobias may engage different threat-evaluation pathways; this helps explain why treatments emphasize different targets, such as fear of negative evaluation in SAD versus conditioned fear extinction in specific phobias [^111wAyzc] [^116b7dhi].

> But wait, what if the fear is "fear of the unknown" or a transdiagnostic process like intolerance of uncertainty? I should double-check that these are not themselves non-social fears. Fear of the unknown is a proposed transdiagnostic mechanism underlying multiple anxiety disorders, both social and non-social, so it is not a category of non-social fear per se, even though it can amplify non-social threat appraisals [^114Ryfe5].

> I should confirm the clinical implications briefly. Non-social fears are typically assessed with disorder-specific measures and treated with exposure-based strategies tailored to the feared stimulus or situation; for example, in vivo exposure for animals or heights, interoceptive exposure for panic, and situational exposure for agoraphobia, whereas social fears additionally target cognitive distortions around evaluation and often use social skills training or video feedback [^116b7dhi] [^111KwRts].

> Let me synthesize a precise definition, and I will keep checking it against the sources as I go. Non-social fears are fears whose primary focus of apprehension is not social evaluation or interpersonal scrutiny; they include fears of specific objects or situations (e.g., animals, heights, blood/injection, enclosed spaces, contamination), fear of panic-related bodily sensations, and fear of situations where escape is difficult or help unavailable, and they are distinct from social anxiety disorder, which is defined by fear of negative evaluation in social or performance contexts [^112MyoKo] [^1148xaR3] [^115bhSGJ].

---

Non-social fears are **fears of objects or situations** that do not involve social evaluation or interaction, such as heights, animals, blood, enclosed spaces, or natural disasters [^112MyoKo] [^1148xaR3]. They are typically classified as **specific phobias** and are distinct from social fears, which concern being judged or embarrassed in social settings [^112MyoKo]. Non-social fears are common, often begin in childhood, and can cause significant distress and avoidance, but they are highly treatable with exposure-based therapies and, when needed, medication [^1148xaR3] [^115bhSGJ].

---

## Definition and characteristics

Non-social fears are defined by the following **characteristics**:

- **Focus of fear**: The fear is directed at specific objects or situations (e.g. heights, animals, blood, enclosed spaces, natural disasters) rather than social interactions or evaluation [^112MyoKo].

- **Absence of social evaluation**: These fears do not involve concern about being judged, embarrassed, or negatively evaluated by others [^112MyoKo].

- **Physiological response**: Non-social fears often trigger intense physiological arousal, such as increased heart rate, sweating, and hyperventilation [^115bhSGJ].

- **Avoidance behavior**: Individuals typically avoid the feared object or situation, which can significantly impair daily functioning [^1148xaR3].

---

## Examples of non-social fears

Common examples of **non-social fears** include:

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Animals | - Dogs <br/> - Cats <br/> - Snakes <br/> - Spiders <br/> - Birds [^1148xaR3] |
| Natural environment | - Heights <br/> - Water <br/> - Storms <br/> - Thunder <br/> - Lightning [^1148xaR3] |
| Blood-injection-injury | - Needles <br/> - Blood <br/> - Medical procedures <br/> - Injuries [^1148xaR3] |
| Situational | - Enclosed spaces (claustrophobia) <br/> - Flying <br/> - Elevators <br/> - Driving [^1148xaR3] |

---

## Psychological and physiological mechanisms

Non-social fears are underpinned by **complex psychological and physiological mechanisms**:

- **Classical conditioning**: Fear responses can be learned through associative learning, where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a fearful event [^111fxUBz].

- **Cognitive biases**: Individuals with non-social fears often exhibit cognitive biases, such as overestimating the danger associated with the feared object or situation [^1122MUFn].

- **Neurobiological factors**: Fear responses involve activation of the amygdala, hypothalamus, and autonomic nervous system, leading to physiological arousal and avoidance behaviors [^notfound].

---

## Impact on daily life and functioning

Non-social fears can significantly **impact daily life and functioning** by causing avoidance of everyday activities (e.g. avoiding heights, flying, or medical procedures), impairing occupational performance (e.g. limiting career choices or causing absenteeism), and straining social relationships due to embarrassment or frustration. They also contribute to emotional distress, including anxiety, depression, and reduced quality of life [^1148xaR3].

---

## Treatment approaches

Effective treatments for non-social fears include:

- **Exposure therapy**: Gradual exposure to the feared object or situation is the most effective treatment, reducing fear and avoidance behaviors [^1148xaR3].

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: CBT helps individuals identify and challenge irrational beliefs and cognitive biases associated with their fears [^111ekqrb].

- **Pharmacotherapy**: Medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and benzodiazepines may be used in severe cases or when anxiety symptoms are significant [^115bhSGJ].

---

## Differences between non-social and social fears

Non-social fears differ from social fears in several **key ways**:

| **Feature** | **Non-social fears** | **Social fears** |
|-|-|-|
| Focus of fear | Objects or situations | Social evaluation or interaction |
| Examples | Heights, animals, blood, enclosed spaces | Public speaking, social gatherings, meeting new people |
| Physiological response | Intense arousal, hyperventilation | Blushing, sweating, trembling, nausea |
| Treatment emphasis | Exposure therapy, CBT | CBT, social skills training, SSRIs |

---

Non-social fears are **fears of objects or situations** that do not involve social evaluation, causing significant distress and impairment. They are highly treatable with exposure-based therapies and, when needed, medication, allowing individuals to regain functioning and quality of life [^1148xaR3] [^115bhSGJ].

### What explains the failure to identify replicable moderators of symptom change in social anxiety disorder? [^113s7YJM]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2023). Medium credibility.

Trials of cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for social anxiety disorder (SAD) have struggled to identify replicable moderators of treatment outcome. This could be due to a genuine lack of effects, or a spurious finding caused by methodological factors such as inadequate testing of theory-driven moderators, use of small homogenous samples, failure to model non-linear relationships, and over-reliance on significance testing. We probed explanations for the field's failure to detect moderators by testing whether 15 theory-driven and atheoretical variables moderated treatment outcome in a large heterogeneous sample treated with group CBT for SAD. Moderation was not assessed by only using p-values for linear models, but also by considering effect sizes, plots, and non-linear relationships. Despite using a comprehensive approach to assess moderation, only two variables - the baseline severity of SAD symptoms and fear of negative evaluation (FNE) - were found to moderate social anxiety symptom trajectories. FNE had a non-linear relationship with symptom change that would have been missed using common research methods. Our findings suggest both a genuine lack of effects and limitations of research methods have contributed to the field's inability to identify moderators. We provide suggestions that may increase the likelihood of future researchers detecting genuine effects.

### Reconsolidation-based treatment for fear of public speaking: a systematic pilot study using propranolol [^113xgE5t]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, this systematic pilot study did not achieve reconsolidation-like effects for public speaking anxiety. Consideration of why this was unsuccessful can be instructive. Although we suggest that alternative means of reactivating participants' social-evaluative fears could prove more fruitful, it remains possible that such anxiety disorders are not amenable to pharmacological reconsolidation-based procedures. The outcomes of placebo participants in this study also emphasise the importance of including control participants in studies of reconsolidation-based interventions, as it cannot be assumed that non-specific changes in clinically relevant measures will not occur even with very short interventions. Finally, our findings highlight that despite the great promise of reconsolidation-based interventions, clinical translation is highly complex.

### Social fears and social phobia in the USA: results from the national comorbidity survey replication [^113oCt9M]. Psychological Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Despite heightened awareness of the clinical significance of social phobia, information is still lacking about putative subtypes, functional impairment, and treatment-seeking. New epidemiologic data on these topics are presented from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R).

Method

The NCS-R is a nationally representative household survey fielded in 2001–2003. The World Health Organization (WHO) Composite International Diagnostic Interview Version 3.0 (CIDI 3.0) was used to assess 14 performance and interactional fears and DSM-IV social phobia.

Results

The estimated lifetime and 12-month prevalence of social phobia are 12.1% and 7.1% respectively. Performance and interactional fears load onto a single latent factor, and there is little evidence for distinct subtypes based either on the content or the number of fears. Social phobia is associated with significant psychiatric co-morbidity, role impairment, and treatment-seeking, all of which have a dose-response relationship with number of social fears. However, social phobia is the focus of clinical attention in only about half of cases where treatment is obtained. Among non-co-morbid cases, those with the most fears were least likely to receive social phobia treatment.

Conclusions

Social phobia is a common, under-treated disorder that leads to significant functional impairment. Increasing numbers of social fears are associated with increasingly severe manifestations of the disorder.

### Fear of the unknown: one fear to rule them all? [^114Ryfe5]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The current review and synthesis was designed to provocatively develop and evaluate the proposition that "fear of the unknown may be a, or possibly the, fundamental fear" (Carleton, 2016) underlying anxiety and therein neuroticism. Identifying fundamental transdiagnostic elements is a priority for clinical theory and practice. Historical criteria for identifying fundamental components of anxiety are described and revised criteria are offered. The revised criteria are based on logical rhetorical arguments using a constituent reductionist postpositivist approach supported by the available empirical data. The revised criteria are then used to assess several fears posited as fundamental, including fear of the unknown. The review and synthesis concludes with brief recommendations for future theoretical discourse as well as clinical and non-clinical research.

### Subtyping social anxiety disorder in developed and developing countries [^111L5pP7]. Depression and Anxiety (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Although social anxiety disorder (SAD) is classified in the fourth edition of The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) into generalized and non-generalized subtypes, community surveys in Western countries find no evidence of disjunctions in the dose-response relationship between number of social fears and outcomes to support this distinction. We aimed to determine whether this holds across a broader set of developed and developing countries, and whether subtyping according to number of performance versus interactional fears would be more useful.

Methods

The World Health Organization's World Mental Health Survey Initiative undertook population epidemiological surveys in 11 developing and 9 developed countries, using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview to assess DSM-IV disorders. Fourteen performance and interactional fears were assessed. Associations between number of social fears in SAD and numerous outcomes (age-of-onset, persistence, severity, comorbidity, treatment) were examined. Additional analyses examined associations with number of performance fears versus number of interactional fears.

Results

Lifetime social fears are quite common in both developed (15.9%) and developing (14.3%) countries, but lifetime SAD is much more common in the former (6.1%) than latter (2.1%) countries. Among those with SAD, persistence, severity, comorbidity, and treatment have dose-response relationships with number of social fears, with no clear nonlinearity in relationships that would support a distinction between generalized and non-generalized SAD. The distinction between performance fears and interactional fears is generally not important in predicting these same outcomes.

Conclusion

No evidence is found to support subtyping SAD on the basis of either number of social fears or number of performance fears versus number of interactional fears.

### The enhancing effects of testosterone in exposure treatment for social anxiety disorder: a randomized proof-of-concept trial [^112y46AM]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Fear

Next, we tested effects for the critical unenhanced session (2). Fear reduced over time 2: Estimate(linear) = −62.95(15.42), F (1,50) = 16.66, p < 0.001, Estimate(quadratic) = −48.32(11.03), F (1,50) = 19.18, p < 0.001, Estimate(cubic) = −36.76(8.90), F (1,50) = 17.01, p < 0.001. Critically, there was a group × time(quadratic) interaction: Estimate = 23.68(11.03), F (1,50) = 4.61, p = 0.037. Compared to participants having received placebo, the participants in the testosterone group showed a more reactive fear pattern (higher SUDs) with a steeper decline at the end of the session (Supplementary Fig. S2B).

The post-hoc observation that testosterone administration had resulted in steeper fear reductions in participants with high baseline testosterone (session 1) was again made in the second, non-enhanced session, with fear levels showing a similar time(quadratic) × group × Baseline-T interaction: Estimate = 1.53(0.74), F (1,47) = 4.22, p = 0.045. In the placebo group, session-2 fear levels followed the same quadratic pattern regardless of baseline testosterone: Estimate = 0.77(0.82), F (1,23) = 0.94, p = 0.357. In the testosterone group, they showed higher peaks followed by stronger reductions for participants with high baseline testosterone, whereas for those with low baseline testosterone peak fear levels flattened: Estimate = −2.29(1.27), F (1,23) = 3.26, p = 0.084 (Fig. 2B).

### Novel treatment approaches for refractory anxiety disorders [^113HYXYi]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

The Anxiety Disorders Association of America convened a conference of experts to address treatment-resistant anxiety disorders and review promising novel approaches to the treatment of refractory anxiety disorders. Workgroup leaders and other participants reviewed the literature and considered the presentations and discussions from the conference. Authors placed the emerging literature on new therapeutic approaches into clinical perspective and identified unmet needs and priority areas for future research. There is a relative paucity of efforts addressing inadequate response to anxiety disorder treatment. Systematic efforts to exhaust all therapeutic options and overcome barriers to effective treatment delivery are needed before patients can be considered treatment refractory. Cognitive behavioral therapy, especially in combination with pharmacotherapy, must be tailored to accommodate the effects of clinical context on treatment response. The literature on pharmacologic treatment of refractory anxiety disorders is small but growing and includes studies of augmentation strategies and non-traditional anxiolytics. Research efforts to discover new pharmacologic targets are focusing on neuronal systems that mediate responses to stress and fear. A number of clinical and basic science studies were proposed that would advance the research agenda and improve treatment of patients with anxiety disorders. Significant advances have been made in the development of psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic treatments for anxiety disorders. Unfortunately, many patients remain symptomatic and functionally impaired. Progress in the development of new treatments has great promise, but will only succeed through a concerted research effort that systematically evaluates potential areas of importance and properly uses scarce resources.

### The enhancing effects of testosterone in exposure treatment for social anxiety disorder: a randomized proof-of-concept trial [^112ggrQ6]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

Individuals with a social anxiety disorder (SAD) show hypofunctioning of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, which is linked to social fear and avoidance behavior. As testosterone administration has been shown to facilitate social-approach behavior in this population, it may enhance the effectiveness of exposure treatment. In this proof-of-concept study, we performed a randomized clinical assay in which 55 women diagnosed with SAD received two exposure therapy sessions. Session 1 was supplemented with either testosterone (0.50mg) or placebo. Next, transfer effects of testosterone augmentation on within-session subjective fear responses and SAD symptom severity were assessed during a second, unenhanced exposure session (session 2) and at a 1-month follow-up, respectively. The participants having received testosterone showed a more reactive fear pattern, with higher peaks and steeper reductions in fear levels in session 2. Post-hoc exploration of moderating effects of endogenous testosterone levels, revealed that this pattern was specific for women with high basal testosterone, both in the augmented and in the transfer session. In contrast, the participants with low endogenous testosterone showed reduced peak fear levels throughout session 1, again with transfer to the unenhanced session. Testosterone did not significantly affect self-reported anxiety. The effects of testosterone supplementation on fear levels show transfer to non-enhanced exposure, with effects being modulated by endogenous testosterone. These first preliminary results indicate that testosterone may act on important fear mechanisms during exposure, providing the empirical groundwork for further exploration of multi-session testosterone-enhanced exposure treatment for SAD.

### Is there a difference in fear-avoidance, beliefs, anxiety and depression between post-surgery and non-surgical persistent spinal pain syndrome patients? [^111r8UhB]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is one of the first studies that evaluates fear-avoidance beliefs and other associated psychological factors, such as anxiety and depression, in patients with post-surgery PSPS in a follow-up several years after surgery and compares with patients diagnosed with non-surgical PSPS. In this study, most patients in both groups had high scores in the FABQ domains, revealing sustained fear-avoidance beliefs in work and physical activities in these patients, but did not have a statistically relevant difference between groups. Fear-avoidance beliefs are derived both from emotional fears of pain and injury and from beliefs based on information about the spine, causes of spinal degeneration, and the importance of pain. They have a negative impact on the treatment of PSPS by increasing the deficiency and prolonging the rehabilitation period.,

Compared to this study, the literature on fear-avoidance beliefs in patients with planned lumbar spine surgery or short to mid-term follow-up after surgery, involves assessment in the preoperative period of lumbar spine surgery, as a possible prognostic factor for chronic postoperative pain, associated or not with an assessment in a postoperative follow-up, as a predictor of response to pain treatment.

Studies in patients with CLBP support the conceptual framework of the fear-avoidance model, which implies that fear of pain may lead to avoidance behavior. Avoidance behavior results in disuse, disability, and depression, and maintains the original negative appraisal in a deleterious cycle. In CLBP, high fear-avoidance belief scores were indicators of poor outcomes in the subacute phase and influenced the treatment response in conservative treatments. Patients with sustained fear-avoidance beliefs present better results when this behavior is approached in their treatments than when these beliefs are ignored, and they remain in a vicious cycle of social exclusion, making it necessary to adapt treatment strategies if this condition is identified.

### Clinical features and genetic mechanisms of anxiety, fear, and avoidance: a comprehensive review of five anxiety disorders [^116b7dhi]. Molecular Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment implications by anxiety groups

The classification of anxiety disorders into fear-dominant, mixed, and anxiety-dominant groups directly informs treatment strategies (Table 1). International treatment guidelines provide consensus-based recommendations, emphasizing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as the first-line treatment, followed by pharmacotherapy when necessary. The German guidelines for anxiety disorders recommend CBT as the psychological treatment with the highest level of evidence, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as first-line pharmacological options. Benzodiazepines are discouraged due to dependency risks, while treatment-resistant cases may benefit from switching antidepressants or combination therapy. Similarly, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) clinical practice guidelines recommend CBT and SSRIs/SNRIs as standard treatments, with combination therapy considered for severe cases.

In the fear-dominant group (SP, AG), exposure therapy is highly effective. Gradually exposing patients to feared stimuli helps reduce exaggerated fear responses and avoidance behaviors. CBT, which involves exposure, is beneficial for SP but focuses primarily on the behavioral (exposure) component rather than on cognitive restructuring. For AG, CBT combines cognitive restructuring and exposure therapy, helping patients challenge their fears and reduce avoidance. While SSRIs and SNRIs are not typically recommended for SP, they may be used to treat AG when comorbid with other anxiety disorders. However, some individuals remain resistant to standard treatments, requiring alternative therapeutic strategies.

In the mixed group (PD, SAD), CBT is the preferred treatment. It focuses on both exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring. CBT has demonstrated strong efficacy across both PD and SAD, reducing avoidance and fear responses. In SAD patients, CBT is particularly effective in addressing fear of negative evaluation and social avoidance. In PD, CBT helps patients correct catastrophic misinterpretations of panic symptoms and encourages gradual exposure to avoided situations. In addition to CBT, SSRIs/SNRIs serve as first-line pharmacological treatments, targeting both anticipatory anxiety and acute fear responses. However, residual symptoms persist in some patients, necessitating augmentation strategies and alternative interventions.

### Prognostic factors for perceived recovery or functional improvement in non-specific low back pain: secondary analyses of three randomized clinical trials [^117Bmjd4]. European Spine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to report on secondary analyses of a merged trial dataset aimed at exploring the potential importance of patient factors associated with clinically relevant improvements in non-acute, non-specific low back pain (LBP). From 273 predominantly male army workers (mean age 39 ± 10.5 years, range 20–56 years, 4 women) with LBP who were recruited in three randomized clinical trials, baseline individual patient factors, pain-related factors, work-related psychosocial factors, and psychological factors were evaluated as potential prognostic variables in a short-term (post-treatment) and a long-term logistic regression model (6 months after treatment). We found one dominant prognostic factor for improvement directly after treatment as well as 6 months later: baseline functional disability, expressed in Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire scores. Baseline fear of movement, expressed in Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia scores, had also significant prognostic value for long-term improvement. Less strongly associated with the outcome, but also included in our final models, were supervisor social support and duration of complaints (short-term model), and co-worker social support and pain radiation (long-term model). Information about initial levels of functional disability and fear-avoidance behaviour can be of value in the treatment of patient populations with characteristics comparable to the current army study population (e.g. predominantly male, physically active, working, moderate but chronic back problems). Individuals at risk for poor long-term LBP recovery, i.e. individuals with high initial level of disability and prominent fear-avoidance behaviour, can be distinguished that may need additional cognitive-behavioural treatment.

### A randomized controlled trial of the effect of D-cycloserine on exposure therapy for spider fear [^116JZig1]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2007). Low credibility.

Previous research [Hofmann SG, Meuret AE, Smits JA, Simon NM, Pollack MH, Eisenmenger K, et al. Augmentation of exposure therapy for social anxiety disorder with D-cycloserine. Archives of General Psychiatry 2006;63:298–304; Ressler KJ, Rothbaum BO, Tannenbaum L, Anderson P, Graap K, Zimand E, et al. Cognitive enhancers as adjuncts to psychotherapy: use of d-cycloserine in phobic individuals to facilitate extinction of fear. Archives of General Psychiatry 2004;61:1136–44] suggests that d-cycloserine (DCS) facilitates the reduction of clinical fear in humans. We used a well established intervention to evaluate the effectiveness of administering DCS as an adjunct to exposure therapy in a heightened, but sub-clinical, fear population. Over two studies, 100 spider-fearful participants were allocated to DCS or placebo before treatment and were assessed at pre-, immediate post-, and 3.5 weeks post-treatment. Significant treatment effects and return of fear was observed at follow-up, particularly in non-treatment contexts; however, both studies failed to demonstrate any enhancing effects of DCS (50 or 500 mg). DCS did not enhance the reduction of spider fears or the generalisation of treatment of a single session of exposure-based therapy. These results suggest that DCS may not enhance loss of non-clinical levels of fear in human populations.

### Anxiety disorders: a review [^115bhSGJ]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Anxiety disorders have a lifetime prevalence of approximately 34% in the US, are often chronic, and significantly impair quality of life and functioning.

Observations

Anxiety disorders are characterized by symptoms that include worry, social and performance fears, unexpected and/or triggered panic attacks, anticipatory anxiety, and avoidance behaviors. Generalized anxiety disorder (6.2% lifetime prevalence), social anxiety disorder (13% lifetime prevalence), and panic disorder (5.2% lifetime prevalence) with or without agoraphobia are common anxiety disorders seen in primary care. Anxiety disorders are associated with physical symptoms, such as palpitations, shortness of breath, and dizziness. Brief screening measures applied in primary care, such as the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7, can aid in diagnosis of anxiety disorders (sensitivity, 57.6% to 93.9%; specificity, 61% to 97%). Providing information about symptoms, diagnosis, and evidence-based treatments is a first step in helping patients with anxiety. First-line treatments include pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, eg, sertraline) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs, eg, venlafaxine extended release) remain first-line pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Meta-analyses suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with small to medium effect sizes compared with placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: standardized mean difference [SMD], -0.55 [95% CI, -0.64 to -0.46]; social anxiety disorder: SMD, -0.67 [95% CI, -0.76 to -0.58]; panic disorder: SMD, -0.30 [95% CI, -0.37 to -0.23]). Cognitive behavioral therapy is the psychotherapy with the most evidence of efficacy for anxiety disorders compared with psychological or pill placebo (eg, generalized anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 1.01 [large effect size] [95% CI, 0.44 to 1.57]; social anxiety disorder: Hedges g = 0.41 [small to medium effect] [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.57]; panic disorder: Hedges g = 0.39, small to medium effect; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.65), including in primary care. When selecting treatment, clinicians should consider patient preference, current and prior treatments, medical and psychiatric comorbid illnesses, age, sex, and reproductive planning, as well as cost and access to care.

Conclusions and Relevance

Anxiety disorders affect approximately 34% of adults during their lifetime in the US and are associated with significant distress and impairment. First-line treatments for anxiety disorders include cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs such as sertraline, and SNRIs such as venlafaxine extended release.

### Reconsolidation-based treatment for fear of public speaking: a systematic pilot study using propranolol [^115brB6Y]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

However, we remain largely ignorant of the parameters causing successful reconsolidation-based interventions for naturalistic and clinical fears. Prediction error can be easily operationalised in experimental studies where learning and reactivation are precisely controlled, but not in naturalistic fears. People with specific fears can express a wide range of expectations related to their fear, and it is not clear which — if any — should be focused on in an intervention. Nevertheless, our findings do suggest that merely provoking social-evaluative anxiety in individuals with fear of public speaking is unlikely to be sufficient for inducing reconsolidation.

Though we have focused on the idea that the current means of fear memory reactivation did not induce reconsolidation as the most likely explanation for the null effects, it could also be considered whether the pharmacological manipulation itself, or its timing, may be at fault. Research in fear-conditioning paradigms from our lab has consistently found 40 mg of propranolol to be an effective dosage for fear neutralisation, irrespective of participant body mass, and that the drug can be administered up to 1 h post reactivation. Administering 40 mg of propranolol shortly after reactivation was also effective in tackling a long-standing fear of spiders, and in reducing PTSD symptoms in a case series. However, recent research suggests that factors, such as the learning context's familiarity and the strength of learning, can affect the timing of the consolidation window. Different tasks might similarly affect the reconsolidation window, rendering our drug delivery approach suboptimal. Given this possibility, one option for future experiments might be to administer propranolol 30–45 min before reactivation, meaning that it would be unlikely to have any subjective effects during reactivation, but would be physiologically active more rapidly afterwards. Alternative drugs altogether have also been investigated for their reconsolidation-disrupting potential in clinical settings.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^111CHnJZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Evaluation and diagnostic criteria — Clinically significant anxiety must be distinguished from everyday worries and fears that are common and normative in specific developmental stages, and in DSM-5 mental disorders are defined as "a syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning". By DSM convention, a mental disorder is diagnosed if all or a threshold of diagnostic criteria for the given disorder are met, and included in most diagnostic criteria sets is the requirement for a specific frequency and duration of symptoms as well as clinically significant distress and functional impairment, along with the caveat that alternative mental, medical, and substance-related explanations for the symptom presentation must have been ruled out before the diagnosis is applied.

### How Do patients' fear prediction and fear experience impact exposure-based therapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia? A comprehensive analysis of fear prediction [^117ENyDE]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

2.3. Therapists

The therapists administering the treatment had completed their psychology degrees and were undergoing advanced CBT training. They attended a 3-day workshop on the manualized therapy and assessment procedures, which included role-play of core treatment components. Following this workshop, therapists were required to submit a recorded role-play, which was evaluated by experts. Only those who successfully passed the role-play were allowed to treat study patients. To demonstrate their proficiency, therapists submitted videotapes and example ratings. Furthermore, weekly supervision sessions were conducted to ensure adherence to the treatment protocol (for more information, see).

2.4. Participants

The study involved 369 participants. Three hundred one of them were randomly assigned to one of two active treatment conditions, while 68 participants were placed on a wait list control group. For the current analysis, only participants who completed at least one exposure session were included. Accordingly, 33 patients who dropped out prior to the first exposure session were excluded, resulting in a final sample of 268 patients. The mean age of these 268 participants was M = 35.3 (SD = 10.5) and 75% were female. Seventy-six percent of the participants had at least one comorbid diagnosis. The most common comorbidities were specific phobias (n = 127), depressive disorders (n = 104), somatoform disorders (n = 60), social phobias (n = 56) and substance use disorders (n = 49).

2.5. Assessments

The outcome measures required for the current study are described below. Refer to Gloster et al. for a complete assessment list.

2.5.1. Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ)

The questionnaire assesses the frequency of anxiety-related cognitions on a 5-point Likert-type scale. The ACQ's reliability is considered sufficient (α = 0.80, r = 0.79).

2.5.2. Bodily Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ)

The BSQ includes 17 body sensations typically associated with autonomic arousal. Respondents are asked to rate how much anxiety each of these symptoms causes on a 5-point Likert-type scale. The total score reflects the anxiety associated with the bodily symptoms. See for internal consistency (α = 0.87) and retest-reliability (r = 0.67).

### The classification of anxiety and fear-related disorders in the ICD-11 [^112MyoKo]. Depression and Anxiety (2016). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders are highly prevalent worldwide and engender substantial economic costs and disability. The World Health Organization is currently developing the Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-11), which represents the first opportunity to improve the validity, clinical utility, and global applicability of the classification in more than 25 years. This article describes changes in the organization and diagnostic guidelines for anxiety and fear-related disorders proposed by the ICD-11 Working Group on the Classification of Mood and Anxiety Disorders and the rationale and evidence base for the proposals. In ICD-11, anxiety and fear-related disorders that manifest across the lifespan are brought together under a new grouping, and are partly distinguished by their focus of apprehension. The focus of apprehension is the stimulus or situation that triggers the fear or anxiety and may be highly specific as in specific phobia or relate to a broader class of situations as in social anxiety disorder. The guidelines also clarify the relationship between panic disorder and agoraphobia and a qualifier is provided for panic attacks in the context of other disorders. A standardized format emphasizing essential features of anxiety disorders is intended to improve clinical utility. Guidelines will be further refined based on findings from two types of field studies: those using a case-controlled vignette methodology disseminated via the Internet to practitioners worldwide (http://gcp.network) and clinic-based field trials implemented globally at participating field study centers.

### Cannabinoid regulation of fear and anxiety: an update [^113b1Cfv]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Anxiety- and trauma-related disorders are prevalent and debilitating mental illnesses associated with a significant socioeconomic burden. Current treatment approaches often have inadequate therapeutic responses, leading to symptom relapse. Here we review recent preclinical and clinical findings on the potential of cannabinoids as novel therapeutics for regulating fear and anxiety.

Recent Findings

Evidence from preclinical studies has shown that the non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid cannabidiol and the endocannabinoid anandamide have acute anxiolytic effects and also regulate learned fear by dampening its expression, enhancing its extinction and disrupting its reconsolidation. The findings from the relevant clinical literature are still very preliminary but are nonetheless encouraging. Based on this preclinical evidence, larger-scale placebo-controlled clinical studies are warranted to investigate the effects of cannabidiol in particular as an adjunct to psychological therapy or medication to determine its potential utility for treating anxiety-related disorders in the future.

### Specific phobias [^1148xaR3]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2018). Medium credibility.

Anxiety disorders are among the most prevalent mental disorders, but the subcategory of specific phobias has not been well studied. Phobias involve both fear and avoidance. For people who have specific phobias, avoidance can reduce the constancy and severity of distress and impairment. However, these phobias are important because of their early onset and strong persistence over time. Studies indicate that the lifetime prevalence of specific phobias around the world ranges from 3% to 15%, with fears and phobias concerning heights and animals being the most common. The developmental course of phobias, which progress from fear to avoidance and then to diagnosis, suggests the possibility that interrupting the course of phobias could reduce their prevalence. Although specific phobias often begin in childhood, their incidence peaks during midlife and old age. Phobias persist for several years or even decades in 10–30% of cases, and are strongly predictive of onset of other anxiety, mood, and substance-use disorders. Their high comorbidity with other mental disorders, especially after onset of the phobia, suggests that early treatment of phobias could also alter the risk of other disorders. Exposure therapy remains the treatment of choice, although this approach might be less effective in the long term than previously believed. This Review discusses the literature regarding the prevalence, incidence, course, risk factors, and treatment of specific phobias, and presents epidemiological data from several population-based surveys.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrous [^113px1mm]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Social Anxiety Disorder

Paroxetine tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia, as defined in DSM-IV (300.23). Social anxiety disorder is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of 1 or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. Exposure to the feared situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which may approach the intensity of a panic attack. The feared situations are avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is marked distress about having the phobias. Lesser degrees of performance anxiety or shyness generally do not require psychopharmacological treatment.

The efficacy of paroxetine was established in three 12-week trials in adult patients with social anxiety disorder (DSM-IV). Paroxetine has not been studied in children or adolescents with social phobia (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials).

The effectiveness of paroxetine in long-term treatment of social anxiety disorder, i.e., for more than 12 weeks, has not been systematically evaluated in adequate and well-controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to prescribe paroxetine for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Non-invasive and minimally invasive management of low back disorders [^113GPmFj]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Non-invasive clinical treatment recommendations — activity levels, exercise, and directional preference exercises should be addressed; nonprescription analgesics may provide sufficient pain relief for most patients with acute and subacute low back pain (LBP), and if the treatment response is inadequate or limitations are more significant, prescribed pharmaceuticals and/or physical methods can be added. Initial care may include exercise, advice on activities, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, heat, cryotherapy, and manipulation; education about LBP should begin at the first visit, and fear avoidance belief training (FABT) is for those with fear avoidance beliefs. Comorbid conditions, invasiveness, adverse effects, cost, and provider and patient preferences help guide recommendations, and throughout treatment phases, any given treatment should be assessed for efficacy and ineffective treatments should be discontinued rather than accumulated. Chronically impaired LBP patients are believed to begin a course towards disability at, or before, their first clinical encounter; those who respond to appropriate treatment should have their treatment, compliance, and psychosocial factors assessed early, and courses beyond a provider's abilities should be referred. The literature largely lacks specification of clear inclusionary and exclusionary criteria for radicular symptoms; most trials do not report lower extremity symptoms or clarify "leg pain", and only a minority reported stratified analyses to detect if such patients responded differently.

### Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment adherence in migrants: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116Jb6Zk]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

Adherence rates among migrants on treatment for MDR-TB were estimated to be 71% (95% CI = 58–84%), approaching global treatment adherence targets, and exceeding previous reports estimating adherence rates in the general population as 49–63.5%. This raises questions about whether more ambitious targets should be set for MDR-TB treatment adherence globally, and suggests that adherence may be dependent on social risk factors and treatment context, not only migrant status.

Rates of MDR-TB treatment adherence and non-adherence were also found to be comparable between migrants and non-migrants (RR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.82–1.34 and RR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.70–1.36, respectively). These findings challenge previous assumptions that adherence to MDR-TB treatment is likely to be worse in migrants.

Social risk factors, for example social deprivation, vulnerable housing, mental health concerns or other comorbidities, have been shown to present barriers to care in migrant populations, and may contribute to poorer treatment adherence. Being a highly mobile population with poor access or entitlement to high-quality health care may also present significant barriers to adhering to treatment, as might language or health literacy barriers. The legal complexities of a migrant's status can also lead to non-adherence, although at times it is involuntary. For example, the right to stay within a country whilst receiving treatment is a facilitator of greater adherence. In some contexts, it may be that migrants may perceive that their adherence to treatment (and cure) may impact on their status (e.g. leave to remain) in host countries. However, there is also evidence to suggest that insecure migrant status is associated with non-completion of treatment, with migrants potentially hiding or absconding from treatment centres for fear of deportation. There are even cases of illegal and undocumented migrants with TB being deported, interrupting treatment and likely facilitating the spread of resistance. Practices such as the current sharing of patient data with the Home Office for immigration enforcement purposes in the UK may contribute to non-adherence, as patients are concerned that contact with health services may result in their deportation.

### Over the edge: extending the duration of a reconsolidation intervention for spider fear [^111hz2Dq]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Fear is highly adaptive: it guides our behaviour, protecting us from danger. However, the associative networks thought to underlie our learned fear responses (i.e. fear memories) are resistant to decay, and can affect our behaviour after their adaptive purpose has passed, contributing to anxiety disorders. When fear memories are reactivated, they can undergo an updating process called reconsolidation. Here they become vulnerable to certain drugs such as anisomycin or propranolol (i.e. amnesic agents), which abruptly reduce fear behaviour. There has been much interest in harnessing the disruption of reconsolidation of fear memories for therapeutic benefits (i.e. "reconsolidation interventions" — note that we use this term for treatments that are intended to disrupt reconsolidation, not to indicate that we know that the mechanism is reconsolidation). The appeal is clear: with a single memory reactivation followed by the one-time administration of an amnesic agent they offer the opportunity to target maladaptive memories, promising lower rates of relapse. Research on fears acquired in the laboratory (i.e. conditioned fears) indicates that reconsolidation depends upon the learning history, including the age and strength of the targeted memory, where older and stronger memories are more resistant to reconsolidation, and the interaction between what has already been learned and what occurs during the reactivation procedure (e.g. refs.). For clarity, throughout this article, we use the term reactivation procedure to denote memory retrieval procedures where the subsequent occurrence of reconsolidation is uncertain. In the laboratory, these critical factors can be closely controlled by varying the conditioning or reactivation procedures. Yet even working with such simple associations, there have been failures to replicate the reconsolidation effect. Almost all previous studies on clinical and pre-clinical reconsolidation interventions have used study-specific reactivation procedures combined with an amnesic agent or a placebo to determine whether that particular reactivation procedure triggered reconsolidation. The inconsistency in the results is unsurprising given the substantial variation in the procedures employed (e.g. Elsey & Kindt, 2021; see Walsh et al. for a review), and that the window to target the process of memory reconsolidation seems to be small and easy to miss. We currently do not have a validated, non-invasive, independent marker that can be used during reactivation procedures to indicate whether reconsolidation is triggered. Therefore, the current study aimed to find a behaviourally-controlled boundary condition of reconsolidation in a naturalistic fear, to inform the development of future reconsolidation interventions. Specifically, we focussed on the duration of the reactivation procedure.

### An investigation of whether patients with post-traumatic stress disorder overestimate the probability and cost of future negative events [^1122MUFn]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

1.1 Estimations of probability and cost

proposed that perceived danger or threat is substantially determined by the joint product of the subjective probability and cost of a feared event. Studies have shown that increased estimates of the probability and cost of certain types of negative events are present in generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, and agoraphobia. Some of these studies have reported content-specificity of these judgment biases. For example, people with social phobia overestimated the probability and cost of future negative social events occurring, but not negative non-social events. However, reported that traumatized adults with acute stress disorder (ASD) overestimated the probability and cost not only of dangerous external events, but also of negative social events and negative somatic events. They concluded that because the experience of trauma leads to the development of wide reaching and dysfunctional fear networks, the traumatized individual's sense of threat extends far beyond the context of the original trauma.

The only study that has looked at estimations of probability and cost in PTSD was carried out with children. It found that children with PTSD did not overestimate the probability of future negative events occurring, such as being bullied at school, in comparison to controls. Although this is in contrast toreport of overestimations of probability and cost in ASD, it is consistent with other studies where children failed to show the biases in probability and cost reported in adult samples.

A further line of research has investigated effects of treatment on biases in estimations of probability and cost. This research suggests that such biases in social phobia can be attenuated by cognitive therapy though not necessarily to the level shown by non-patients (e.g.). It is not clear whether reductions in the overestimation of probability or cost are most closely related to improvement in treatment, with some studies reporting reductions in cost of negative events being most closely associated with treatment outcome (e.g.) and others finding that reductions in the overestimation of probability are more closely linked to improvement in treatment. It is not know whether treatment outcome in PTSD is associated with corresponding changes in the estimations of probability or cost of negative events.

The current study has two key aims: first, to investigate whether adults with PTSD overestimate the probability and cost of being involved in future traumatic and/or negative non-traumatic events, relative to patients with other anxiety disorders and non-patients, and second to examine the extent to which these judgment biases are modified by cognitive therapy and whether changes in estimation of probability or cost are associated with improvement in treatment.

Medical & psychological treatment — acute low back pain (LBP) with fear-avoidance beliefs: In a trial using intention-to-treat analysis, disability and pain intensity improved in both groups, with fear-avoidance beliefs significantly improved in the fear-avoidance therapy group and lower than standard therapy at both follow-ups; the work group downgraded the study, concluding it provides Level II evidence that fear-avoidance–based physical therapy can improve outcomes more than standard physical therapy for acute LBP when baseline fear-avoidance is elevated. Assessments included the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ; pain intensity on a scale from 0 to 10) and the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ).

### Enhancing exposure therapy for anxiety disorders with glucocorticoids: from basic mechanisms of emotional learning to clinical applications [^111fxUBz]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

Current neurophysiological and psychological accounts view exposure therapy as the clinical analog of extinction learning that results in persistent modifications of the fear memory involved in the pathogenesis, symptomatology, and maintenance of anxiety disorders. Evidence from studies in animals and humans indicate that glucocorticoids have the potential to facilitate the processes that underlie extinction learning during exposure therapy. Particularly, glucocorticoids can restrict retrieval of previous aversive learning episodes and enhance consolidation of memory traces relating to non-fearful responding in feared situations. Thus, glucocorticoid treatment especially in combination with exposure therapy might be a promising approach to optimize treatment of anxiety disorders. This review examines the processes involved in aversive conditioning, fear learning and fear extinction, and how glucocorticoids might enhance restructuring of fear memories during therapy.

Although anxiety disorders present in many ways, they all share the key features of inappropriately high distress in the form of anxiety and fear responses to stimuli that are not actually dangerous and efforts to avoid or escape such stimuli. Problematic levels of fear and anxiety can result in many negative impacts on people's lives, across social, economic, and physical realms. Anxiety disorders as a whole are very prevalent in today's world, among both youth and adults.

### How Do patients' fear prediction and fear experience impact exposure-based therapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia? A comprehensive analysis of fear prediction [^113wt5RH]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

All analyses were conducted using the multilevel modelling approach implemented in Mplus. The base model was a bivariate multilevel model (with the dependent variables 'expected fear', 'experienced fear', and the 'difference between expected and experienced fear'). The analyses used to evaluate the research hypotheses are described in detail below.

Hypothesis 2 examined the relationship between the different kinds of fears. Estimates for expected fear, experienced fear and the difference between the two fear variants were calculated. The analysis was executed using the Mplus command ESTIMATOR = BAYES.

Hypothesis 3 analysed the relationship between different types of fears and treatment outcomes. We tested whether the treatment outcome could be predicted by each indicator (expected fear, experienced fear and difference between expected and experienced fear). Primary outcome measures were calculated as the change from between pretreatment and post-treatment scores and between pretreatment and follow-up scores. These analyses was performed with the Mplus command ESTIMATOR = ML.

In Hypothesis 4, regression analyses were used to examine the relationship between safety behaviour and expected fear, experienced fear and the difference between expected and experienced fear. This analysis was also conducted using the Mplus command ESTIMATOR = BAYES.

### Preventing the return of fear in humans using reconsolidation update mechanisms [^115wGWK3]. Nature (2010). Excellent credibility.

Recent research on changing fears has examined targeting reconsolidation. During reconsolidation, stored information is rendered labile after being retrieved. Pharmacological manipulations at this stage result in an inability to retrieve the memories at later times, suggesting that they are erased or persistently inhibited. Unfortunately, the use of these pharmacological manipulations in humans can be problematic. Here we introduce a non-invasive technique to target the reconsolidation of fear memories in humans. We provide evidence that old fear memories can be updated with non-fearful information provided during the reconsolidation window. As a consequence, fear responses are no longer expressed, an effect that lasted at least a year and was selective only to reactivated memories without affecting others. These findings demonstrate the adaptive role of reconsolidation as a window of opportunity to rewrite emotional memories, and suggest a non-invasive technique that can be used safely in humans to prevent the return of fear.

### World guidelines for falls prevention and management for older adults: a global initiative [^117T5jhX]. Age and Ageing (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendation details and justification

We recommend clinicians adopt a holistic approach, combining concern about falling with balance and/or gait assessment as this will help to put the degree of concern in context, when assessing older adults in the community. Concerns about falling — or the closely related notion of fear of falling — shows heterogeneous results in predicting future falls in the community. The rationale for including concerns about falling as part of a comprehensive fall assessment is that this is a measure of an older adult's perceptions about the falls they have experienced, the impact falls have had on their quality of life, their openness to various interventions (e.g. an older adult inappropriately very fearful of falling may be reluctant to increase their physical activity and follow an exercise programme if this is not dealt with), and as a treatment outcome in a subset of older adults.
The Falls Efficacy Scale International (FES-I) and the Short Falls Efficacy Scale International (Short FES-I) have a strong to moderate level of evidence for their use in older adults living in the community. There is evidence from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 59 studies that the FES-I and Short FES-I are reliable and valid tools when used with both healthy older adults and those with conditions that put them at a greater risk of a fall (e.g. multiple sclerosis, stroke, vestibular disorders, PD). Both instruments demonstrate good internal consistency, test–retest reliability, inter-rater reliability and construct validity in these populations.
The complexity of the terms used for fall-related psychological effects arises from their different underlying constructs. These terms include 'concerns about falling', 'fear of falling', anxiety, 'balance-related confidence' and 'self-efficacy'. More recent models are linking anxiety, fear of falling and self-efficacy.
While fear of falling is the term used in much of the available peer-reviewed literature, making enquiries about concerns offers advantages to fear of falling. It is 'less intense and emotional (and therefore may be more socially acceptable for older adults to disclose)', while fear has 'psychiatric connotations implying analogy to phobias which may or may not be accurate'.
The older adult panel we consulted about the recommendations preferred the term concern over fear. Based on this, we recommend that clinicians use the term concerns about falling when making enquiries. This is also congruent with the wording of the recommended FES-I questionnaires (Appendix 2, available in Age and Ageing online).
FES-I and Short FES-I are available free of charge in over 30 languages fromand can be self-administered or done as part of a clinical interview. The 7-item Short FES-I can be useful for clinicians for a rapid assessment.

### A multidimensional investigation of anxiety sensitivity and depression outcomes in cognitive-behavioral group therapy [^111VGiby]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

We examined how anxiety sensitivity - the fear of symptoms of anxiety due to their perceived harmful effects - and gender are associated with treatment trajectory and outcomes in a large outpatient sample (N = 278) who received 14-weeks of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) for depression. Three dimensions of anxiety sensitivity (cognitive, physical, and social concerns) and depression were assessed at pre-treatment, and the latter was assessed weekly during treatment. Latent growth curve models supported a link between cognitive concerns (fears of losing control over thoughts) and greater improvement in depression near the end of treatment (i.e., weeks 10–14); gender did not moderate trajectory. Gender (i.e., identifying as a woman) and greater physical concerns (fears of physical consequences of arousal symptoms) were associated with completion of < 8 sessions. Results suggest that those with more cognitive concerns might require greater time in treatment and/or benefit most from the focus on maladaptive assumptions and core beliefs in later CBGT sessions. Future research, including investigation of intervening variables, may elucidate the mechanisms through which greater physical concerns and gender are associated with treatment non-completion. Results supported differential associations of anxiety sensitivity dimensions with depression treatment outcomes, though further research attention is needed.

### Neuropeptide Y reduces expression of social fear via simultaneous activation of Y1 and Y2 receptors [^112VmTqu]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

NPY does not affect social fear learning when administered before SFC

To investigate whether NPY alters the acquisition of social fear (i.e. social fear learning), SFC + and SFC – mice were infused i.c.v. with either Veh or NPY 10 minutes before SFC on day 1.

All mice showed similar investigation of the non-social stimulus during SFC (Figure 1(a); F (3, 22) = 0.08; p = 0.97), reflecting similar preconditioning non-social anxiety. All SFC + mice received a similar number of foot-shocks during SFC (T (11) = 0.07; p = 0.95), reflecting similar distress. During social fear extinction on day 2, mice showed similar non-social investigation, reflecting similar non-social fear after SFC. SFC + mice showed reduced social investigation compared to SFC – mice, independent of treatment, reflecting social fear (Figure 1(b); conditioning effect F (1, 22) = 59.29; p < 0.001; conditioning×treatment effect F (1, 22) = 0.33; p = 0.58; stimulus×conditioning×treatment effect F (1, 22) = 2.81; p = 0.96).

### APA clinical practice guideline for psychological and other nonpharmacological treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain in adults [^113fPSvd]. APA (2024). High credibility.

Psychological and other nonpharmacological treatment of chronic musculoskeletal pain — shared decision making, validation, and education are emphasized. The panel recommends that PWP participate in all decision making about their care and treatment, and decision making about treatment needs to be a shared decision with the PWP as an active participant rather than as a passive patient. The panel encourages HCPs to educate the patient about the potential benefits vs. harms of treatments, and HCP can ask patients to identify their treatment goals. It is critical that HCPs believe PWP's report of pain, and with exercise, "fear of pain" or "fear of failing" are commonly identified impediments that may impact motivation to exercise.

All SFC + mice received a similar number of foot-shocks during SFC (T (16) = 0.00; p = 1.0), reflecting similar distress. During social fear extinction on day 2, mice showed similar non-social investigation, reflecting similar non-social fear after SFC. While Veh-treated SFC + mice showed reduced social investigation compared with all other groups, reflecting social fear (Figure 2(b); conditioning×treatment effect F (1, 32) = 26.41; p < 0.001; stimulus×conditioning×treatment effect F (8, 256) = 5.44; p < 0.001), NPY increased social investigation starting from the first social stimulus, reflecting reduced expression of social fear. However, NPY did not completely reverse social fear in SFC + mice, as social investigation reached levels found in SFC – mice starting from the second social stimulus.

### Social anxiety and agoraphobia symptoms effectively treated by prompt mental health care versus TAU at 6-and 12-month follow-up: secondary analysis from a randomized controlled trial [^1122ykry]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Social anxiety disorder (SAD) and agoraphobia are two of the most common and disabling anxiety disorders. Their large negative impacts are related to high prevalence (Lecrubier et al. 2000; Remes et al. 2016; D. J. Stein et al. 2017) and early onset (Jones, 2018; Kessler et al. 2007), but also by their wide‐ranging associated impairment across several life domains, such as sleep, social/romantic relations, and occupational life (Aderka et al. 2012; Fehm et al. 2008; Lecrubier et al. 2000; M. B. Stein & Kean, 2000; D. J. Stein et al. 2017; Stuhldreher et al. 2014; Wittchen & Beloch, 1996), seen both in diagnostic threshold and subthreshold cases (Fehm et al. 2008). Moreover, both are associated with an elevated risk of developing other disorders, such as depression and alcohol/substance dependence (Lecrubier et al. 2000) and to follow a chronic course if left untreated (Bruce et al. 2005; Steinert et al. 2013; Wittchen & Beloch, 1996). Agoraphobia often occurs comorbid to panic disorder (Goisman et al. 1995), and these were conceptually linked in DSM‐IV whilst are coded separately in DSM‐5 (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2016). Despite their massive costs, both for the individual and society, anxiety disorders are often undetected in primary care (Kroenke et al. 2007) if at all seen, as individuals with SAD, in particular, tend to avoid seeking help (Lecrubier et al. 2000).

### Over the edge: extending the duration of a reconsolidation intervention for spider fear [^1124gHjq]. Translational Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Contrary to expectations, we found that the length of the reactivation procedure did not affect the outcome of a reconsolidation intervention: both the brief and extended reactivation procedures resulted in an abrupt reduction in spider fear. Without a non-invasive marker for prediction error or reconsolidation, it remains unclear why we did not find the predicted effect. While this translation of the laboratory studies was based on just one clinical interpretation of prediction error, many other possibilities remain. Future research should explore other avenues, such as repeatedly approaching the feared stimulus (e.g. placing hands on the box in front of the tarantula), or leaving and re-entering the room containing the feared stimulus, to ensure that there are concrete distinct episodes of exposure. Our findings also demonstrate the importance of including placebo controls in such research to clarify the mechanisms of any treatment effects. Regardless, the marked improvement that followed a single brief exposure session combined with an amnesic agent gives a tentative promising message for the future of reconsolidation interventions. While approximately half the participants had a clinical spider phobia, all participants who completed the treatment improved on at least one outcome measure, and none experienced a significant worsening of spider fear. Our findings may indicate that the boundary conditions for reconsolidation are wider in naturalistic fears than the fear-conditioning literature indicates, or that treatments involving a combination of a placebo and exposure can yield large and stable effects via alternative mechanisms. Further, we tested an approach to uncover the boundary conditions of reconsolidation in naturalistic fears with unknown learning histories. Such translational efforts are critical to making reliable reconsolidation interventions a viable clinical reality, as spider fear can act as an intermediary translational step between fears conditioned in the laboratory and more complex emotional memory disorders.

(2) Marks Fear Questionnaire Social Phobia Subscale (FQ-SPS), a 5-item patient-rated instrument that measures change in the severity of phobic avoidance and distress, and

(3) CGI-I responder criterion of ≤ 2.

ZOLOFT was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the BSPS total score and fear, avoidance and physiologic factor scores, as well as the FQ-SPS total score, and to have statistically significantly more responders than placebo as defined by the CGI-I. Subgroup analyses did not suggest differences in treatment outcome on the basis of gender. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome.

In Study SAD-3, patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for SAD who had responded while assigned to ZOLOFT (CGI-I of 1 or 2) during a 20-week placebo-controlled trial on ZOLOFT 50–200 mg/day were randomized to continuation of ZOLOFT or to substitution of placebo for up to 24 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse was defined as ≥ 2 point increase in the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score compared to baseline or study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients receiving ZOLOFT continuation treatment experienced a statistically significantly lower relapse rate during this 24-week period than patients randomized to placebo substitution.

### Benzodiazepines versus placebo for panic disorder in adults [^11347y8h]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Panic disorder is characterised by recurrent unexpected panic attacks consisting of a wave of intense fear that reaches a peak within a few minutes. Panic disorder is a common disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 1% to 5% in the general population and a 7% to 10% prevalence in primary care settings. Its aetiology is not fully understood and is probably heterogeneous. Panic disorder is treated with psychological and pharmacological interventions, often used in combination. Although benzodiazepines are frequently used in the treatment of panic disorder, guidelines recommend antidepressants, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), as first-line treatment for panic disorder, particularly due to their lower incidence of dependence and withdrawal reaction when compared to benzodiazepines. Despite these recommendations, benzodiazepines are widely used in the treatment of panic disorder, probably because of their rapid onset of action.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of benzodiazepines versus placebo in the treatment of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR Studies and References), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950-), Embase (1974-), and PsycINFO (1967-) up to 29 May 2018. We handsearched reference lists of relevant papers and previous systematic reviews. We contacted experts in the field for supplemental data.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind (blinding of patients and personnel) controlled trials randomising adults with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia to benzodiazepine or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently checked the eligibility of studies and extracted data using a standardised form. Data were then entered data into Review Manager 5 using a double-check procedure. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, settings, and outcome measures in terms of efficacy, acceptability, and tolerability.

Main Results

We included 24 studies in the review with a total of 4233 participants, of which 2124 were randomised to benzodiazepines and 1475 to placebo. The remaining 634 participants were randomised to other active treatments in three-arm trials. We assessed the overall methodological quality of the included studies as poor. We rated all studies as at unclear risk of bias in at least three domains. In addition, we judged 20 of the 24 included studies as having a high risk of bias in at least one domain. Two primary outcomes of efficacy and acceptability showed a possible advantage of benzodiazepines over placebo. The estimated risk ratio (RR) for a response to treatment was 1.65 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.39 to 1.96) in favour of benzodiazepines, which corresponds to an estimated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 7). The dropout rate was lower among participants treated with benzodiazepines (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.64); the estimated NNTB was 6 (95% CI 5 to 9). We rated the quality of the evidence as low for both primary outcomes. The possible advantage of benzodiazepine was also seen for remission (RR 1.61, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.88) and the endpoint data for social functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.53, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.42), both with low-quality evidence. We assessed the evidence for the other secondary outcomes as of very low quality. With the exception of the analyses of the change score data for depression (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.48 to 0.04) and social functioning (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.88 to 0.24), all secondary outcome analyses showed an effect in favour of benzodiazepines compared to placebo. However, the number of dropouts due to adverse effects was higher with benzodiazepines than with placebo (RR 1.58, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.15; low-quality evidence). Furthermore, our analyses of adverse events showed that a higher proportion of participants experienced at least one adverse effect when treated with benzodiazepines (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.37; low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-quality evidence shows a possible superiority of benzodiazepine over placebo in the short-term treatment of panic disorders. The validity of the included studies is questionable due to possible unmasking of allocated treatments, high dropout rates, and probable publication bias. Moreover, the included studies were only short-term studies and did not examine the long-term efficacy nor the risks of dependency and withdrawal symptoms. Due to these limitations, our results regarding the efficacy of benzodiazepines versus placebo provide only limited guidance for clinical practice. Furthermore, the clinician's choice is not between benzodiazepines and placebo, but between benzodiazepines and other agents, notably SSRIs, both in terms of efficacy and adverse effects. The choice of treatment should therefore be guided by the patient's preference and should balance benefits and harms from treatment in a long-term perspective.

### Learning from other people's fear: amygdala-based social reference learning in social anxiety disorder [^111wAyzc]. Psychological Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Social anxiety disorder involves fear of social objects or situations. Social referencing may play an important role in the acquisition of this fear and could be a key determinant in future biomarkers and treatment pathways. However, the neural underpinnings mediating such learning in social anxiety are unknown. Using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined social reference learning in social anxiety disorder. Specifically, would patients with the disorder show increased amygdala activity during social reference learning, and further, following social reference learning, show particularly increased response to objects associated with other people's negative reactions?

Method

A total of 32 unmedicated patients with social anxiety disorder and 22 age-, intelligence quotient- and gender-matched healthy individuals responded to objects that had become associated with others' fearful, angry, happy or neutral reactions.

Results

During the social reference learning phase, a significant group × social context interaction revealed that, relative to the comparison group, the social anxiety group showed a significantly greater response in the amygdala, as well as rostral, dorsomedial and lateral frontal and parietal cortices during the social, relative to non-social, referencing trials. In addition, during the object test phase, relative to the comparison group, the social anxiety group showed increased bilateral amygdala activation to objects associated with others' fearful reactions, and a trend towards decreased amygdala activation to objects associated with others' happy and neutral reactions.

Conclusions

These results suggest perturbed observational learning in social anxiety disorder. In addition, they further implicate the amygdala and dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in the disorder, and underscore their importance in future biomarker developments.

### The validity of the brief version of the fear of negative evaluation scale [^112S9d7Y]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

The Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale [FNE; J. Consult. Clin. Psychol. 33 (1969) 448] is a commonly used measure of social anxiety. A brief version of the scale (FNEB) is available for convenient administration. Despite being widely advocated for use, the psychometric properties of the FNEB have not been evaluated with clinically anxious samples. The present study addressed the reliability and validity of the FNEB in a clinical sample of individuals with either social phobia (n = 82) or panic disorder (n = 99) presenting for treatment. Factor analysis supported the construct validity of the FNEB. The validity of the FNEB was further demonstrated through significant correlations with social avoidance and depression, and non-significant correlations with agoraphobic avoidance and demographic variables. The scale obtained excellent inter-item reliability (alpha = .97) and 2-week test-retest reliability (r = .94). Discriminant function analysis also supported validity of the FNEB. For example, individuals with social phobia scored significantly higher on the FNEB than those with panic disorder and a group of non-psychiatric community controls (n = 30). The FNEB was sensitive to pre- to post-CBT changes in both social anxiety and panic disorder, and changes on the FNEB correlated significantly with other measures of treatment responsiveness, such as reductions in somatic arousal, depression and other anxiety symptomatology. These research findings strongly support the validity of the FNEB and its clinical utility as an outcome measure in social anxiety treatment.

### Social buffering of human fear is shaped by gender, social concern, and the presence of real vs virtual agents [^111Yb5w2]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

The presence of a partner can attenuate physiological fear responses, a phenomenon known as social buffering. However, not all individuals are equally sociable. Here we investigated whether social buffering of fear is shaped by sensitivity to social anxiety (social concern) and whether these effects are different in females and males. We collected skin conductance responses (SCRs) and affect ratings of female and male participants when they experienced aversive and neutral sounds alone (alone treatment) or in the presence of an unknown person of the same gender (social treatment). Individual differences in social concern were assessed based on a well-established questionnaire. Our results showed that social concern had a stronger effect on social buffering in females than in males. The lower females scored on social concern, the stronger the SCRs reduction in the social compared to the alone treatment. The effect of social concern on social buffering of fear in females disappeared if participants were paired with a virtual agent instead of a real person. Together, these results showed that social buffering of human fear is shaped by gender and social concern. In females, the presence of virtual agents can buffer fear, irrespective of individual differences in social concern. These findings specify factors that shape the social modulation of human fear, and thus might be relevant for the treatment of anxiety disorders.

### Adapting to uncertainty: the role of anxiety and fear of negative evaluation in learning in social and non-social contexts [^113gcomD]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Navigating social situations can be challenging due to uncertainty surrounding the intentions and strategies of others, which remain hidden and subject to change. Prior research suggests that individuals with anxiety-related symptoms struggle to adapt their learning in uncertain, non-social environments. Anxiety-prone individuals encounter challenges in social functioning, yet research on learning under uncertainty in social contexts is limited. In this preregistered study, we investigated whether individuals with higher levels of trait anxiety and fear of negative evaluation encounter difficulties in adjusting their learning rates in social contexts with stable or volatile outcome contingencies.

Methods

We implemented a modified trust game (N = 190), where participants either retained or lost their investments based on their interactions with two players in volatile or stable environments. Participants also completed a matching non-social control task involving interactions with slot machines.

Results

Results from computational modeling revealed significantly higher learning rates in social compared to non-social settings. Trait anxiety did not affect the adaptability of learning rates. Individuals with heightened fear of negative evaluation were more sensitive to social compared to non-social outcomes, as reflected in their stay/switch behavior and, though less conclusive, in their learning rates.

Limitations

While transdiagnostic and dimensional approaches are important for investigating disturbed social functioning, the inclusion of clinical samples in future studies may contribute to a broader generalization of these findings regarding behavioral variances in uncertain social environments.

Conclusions

Individuals with increased fear of negative evaluation may demonstrate heightened sensitivity to learning in uncertain social contexts. This leads to heightened responsiveness to recent outcomes in their interactions with others, potentially contributing to their problems in social functioning.

(2) Marks Fear Questionnaire Social Phobia Subscale (FQ-SPS), a 5-item patient-rated instrument that measures change in the severity of phobic avoidance and distress, and

(3) CGI-I responder criterion of ≤ 2.

Sertraline hydrochloride was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the BSPS total score and fear, avoidance and physiologic factor scores, as well as the FQ-SPS total score, and to have statistically significantly more responders than placebo as defined by the CGI-I. Subgroup analyses did not suggest differences in treatment outcome on the basis of gender. There was insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome.

In Study SAD-3, patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for SAD who had responded while assigned to sertraline hydrochloride (CGI-I of 1 or 2) during a 20-week placebo-controlled trial on sertraline hydrochloride 50 to 200 mg/day were randomized to continuation of sertraline hydrochloride or to substitution of placebo for up to 24 weeks of observation for relapse. Relapse was defined as ≥ 2 point increase in the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score compared to baseline or study discontinuation due to lack of efficacy. Patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride continuation treatment experienced a statistically significantly lower relapse rate during this 24-week period than patients randomized to placebo substitution.

### Non-disclosure of HIV status and associations with psychological factors, ART non-adherence, and viral load non-suppression among people living with HIV in the UK [^116HyTC8]. AIDS and Behavior (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Disclosure of HIV status to family and friends is a selective and often planned behaviour, which balances risks and benefits. Important deterrents of disclosure include the lack of a social network, fears of stigma and abuse, subsequent disclosure of stigmatised behaviours (sexual orientation, injecting drug use), fear of conflicts with a partner, loss of social support, breach of confidentiality, and the need to not burden family members with one's health issues. Additionally, HIV positive people may need time to come to terms with their own diagnosis or may feel their health is a private matter. Although these responses are common, disclosure may also provide a way of obtaining social and psychological support to overcome a diagnosis that is in many ways more complex than other chronic conditions.

Over the last decade, UK studies among HIV-outpatient clinic attendees showed that the prevalence of non-disclosure is lower among MSM compared to heterosexual individuals. Economic and educational disadvantage along with belonging to a racial/ethnic minority were associated with higher prevalence of non-disclosure in UK and US studies. Compared to MSM, black African heterosexuals in the UK have been shown to have higher non-disclosure rates overall, and particularly for non-disclosure to their stable partner. Non-disclosure to a stable partner differs from non-disclosure in the social context as such a partnership usually involves a sexual relationship and concerns about the potential risk of HIV transmission. Additionally, disclosure within a relationship could be associated with a closer and more trusting relationship and improved social support.

Although studies show a significant minority of people with HIV choose to not disclose their status to family and friends and/or partners, the extent to which such non-disclosure impacts on psychological health, ability to adhere to antiretroviral treatments (ART), and virological outcome of ART is unclear. Associations of non-disclosure with depression or anxiety may be mediated by low social support. While HIV status disclosure has been seen as an important step towards enhancing mental health through increased social support, evidence remains mixed.

Evidence for a link between non-disclosure and non-adherence to ART is also limited. The relationship is likely to be dependent on specific socio-demographic groups surveyed, availability of ART, health care-related factors, and level of engagement in HIV care. Thus, the implications of non-disclosure of HIV status with regards to ART adherence and virological outcomes may be different in the current era of simpler treatments and excellent prognosis for HIV.

### How Do patients' fear prediction and fear experience impact exposure-based therapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia? A comprehensive analysis of fear prediction [^113hkvCK]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

The present findings support the habituation model, which posits that greater fear reduction during exposure enhances treatment outcomes. Maybe multiple mechanisms of action help explain the effect of exposure therapy, depending on whether patients are more afraid of anxiety symptoms or anxious thoughts. Furthermore, it should be taken into account that many patients fear the panic symptoms themselves. Therefore, future research should not only consider catastrophic events but also catastrophic internal expectations. Given the limited data available on expectancy violation and therapy outcomes, further investigation is clearly warranted.

There was no significant correlation between safety behaviour and prediction accuracy which was investigated in hypothesis four. In contrast to our findings, the prevailing evidence largely suggests that most forms of safety behaviours diminish the efficacy of exposure-based treatments. For example, a study by Salkovskis et al. indicates that the use of safety behaviours is associated with a smaller reduction in catastrophic beliefs as well as in anxiety. In our study, safety behaviours do not seem to influence prediction accuracy, though this should be examined in more detail for the following reasons. First, our measurement only provided a broad safety behaviour estimate, making only a rather general distinction between its utilisation and non-utilisation. Future studies will benefit from assessing safety behaviour more thoroughly. Moreover, as mentioned before different types of expectation could influence safety behaviour. For example, it may be important to differentiate between the expectation of a catastrophic event (inhibitory learning) or the expectation of intense fear (match–mismatch model). Anticipating a devastating event may lead to an increased fear response, triggering heightened safety behaviour. Consequently, it seems important to differentiate between safety behaviours aimed at reducing anxiety (e.g. distraction) and those intended to directly prevent a harmful outcome (e.g. monitoring people coming and going to avoid an attack).

### Sertraline hydrochloride (Sertraline) [^116gE1zv]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 menstrual cycles, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Social Anxiety Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia in adults.

The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of social anxiety disorder was established in two placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

Social anxiety disorder, as defined by DSM-IV, is characterized by marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations involving exposure to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others and by fears of acting in a humiliating or embarrassing way. Exposure to the feared social situation almost always provokes anxiety and feared social or performance situations are avoided or else are endured with intense anxiety or distress. In addition, patients recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable and the avoidance and anticipatory anxiety of the feared situation is associated with functional impairment or marked distress.

The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response in adult patients with social anxiety disorder for up to 24 weeks following 20 weeks of Sertraline hydrochloride treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. Physicians who prescribe Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY).

### Sertraline treatment of generalized social phobia: a 20-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^111C4fR8]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The authors evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sertraline, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, in the treatment of generalized social phobia.

Method

Adult outpatients with generalized social phobia (N = 204) from 10 Canadian centers were randomly assigned to receive sertraline or placebo in a 2:1 ratio for a 20-week double-blind study following a 1-week, single-blind, placebo run-in. The initial dose of sertraline was 50 mg/day with increases of 50 mg/day every 3 weeks permitted after the fourth week of treatment (dosing was flexible up to a maximum of 200 mg/day). Primary efficacy assessments were the percentage of patients rated much or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) improvement item and the mean changes from baseline to study endpoint in total score on the social phobia subscale of the Marks Fear Questionnaire and total score on the Brief Social Phobia Scale.

Results

In intent-to-treat endpoint analyses of 203 of the patients, significantly more of the 134 patients given sertraline (N = 71 [53%]) than of the 69 patients receiving placebo (N = 20 [29%]) were considered responders according to their CGI improvement scores at the end of treatment. The mean reductions in the social phobia subscale of the Marks Fear Questionnaire and in the total score on the Brief Social Phobia Scale were 32.6% and 34.3% in the sertraline group and 10.8% and 18.6% in the placebo group, respectively. Analysis of covariance showed superiority of sertraline over placebo on all primary and secondary efficacy measures. Sertraline was well tolerated: 103 (76%) of the 135 sertraline-treated patients and 54 (78%) of the 69 placebo-treated patients completed the study.

Conclusions

Sertraline is an effective treatment for patients with generalized social phobia.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^112BVyrE]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Mechanical low back pain prospective cohort findings identify baseline psychosocial predictors of physical health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and health service utilization: at baseline, each participant (n = 160) completed measures including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ); physical HRQoL was measured at baseline and 6 months after initial assessment using the UK version of the 36-item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Score (PCS), and health care utilization was measured for 6 months using the Client Socio-Demographic and Service Receipt Inventory (CSSRI). At 6-month follow-up, duration of pain (β = -0.18, p = 0.04), HADS score (β = -0.27, p = 0.003) and back pain related social difficulties (β = 0.42, p < 0.0005) predicted physical HRQoL, while Fear Avoidance Beliefs about work (IRR = 1.02, p = 0.009), back pain related social difficulties (IRR = 1.16, p = 0.03) and perceived cause of pain (IRR = 1.46, p = 0.03) were independent predictors of number of health care contacts; this study provides Level III evidence that SF-36 scores were improved in patients without fear avoidance behavior before treatment.

### Judgmental biases of individuals with a fear of blushing: the role of relatively strict social norms [^113YeWyS]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Blushing-fearful individuals often expect that others will judge them negatively. In two studies, we tested if this could be explained by having relatively strict beliefs about what is appropriate social behaviour. Study 1 used a student sample (n = 74), whereas study 2 compared a clinical treatment-seeking sample of blushing-fearful individuals (n = 33) with a non-anxious control group (n = 31). In both studies, participants were asked to read descriptions of common behaviours that could be considered as breaching the prevailing social norms but not necessarily so. Participants indicated (i) to what extent they considered these behaviours as violating the prevailing norm and (ii) their expectation of observers' judgments. Study 1 showed that strict norms were indeed related to fear of blushing and that the tendency of fearful participants to expect negative judgments could at least partly explain this relationship. Study 2 showed that high-fearful and low-fearful individuals do indeed differ in the strictness of their norms and that especially the norms that individuals apply to themselves might be relevant. These findings may provide fresh clues for improving available treatment options.

Key Practitioner Messages

Blushing-fearful individuals attribute relatively strict social norms to other people about which behaviours are appropriate and which are not and have stricter personal norms as well. Blushing-fearful individuals' tendency to expect overly negative judgments in ambivalent social situations can partly be explained by their relatively strict social norms. Having relatively strict social norms may (also) explain why blushing-fearful individuals report to blush often and intensely. It may be worthwhile to address strict social norms in therapy for fear of blushing.

Apathy

Apathy is defined as a lack of motivation characterized by reduced goal-oriented thinking and action, as well as reduced emotional expression. It is, therefore, a drive disorder that can have a negative impact on the motivation for self-care and is often a major burden for relatives. Meta-analytic data have indicated a prevalence of 40% for apathetic symptoms in PwPD, with the occurrence of apathy being associated with older age, cognitive impairment, the presence of depressive disorders, and more advanced PD symptoms.

Anxiety disorders and fear of progression

According to the ICD-11, anxiety disorders are defined as mental disorders characterized by excessive fear and anxiety and associated behavioral disturbances, with symptoms severe enough to cause significant distress or impairment in personal, familial, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Various diagnoses can be considered anxiety disorder diagnoses, including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobias, or social anxiety disorder. In a systematic review with a meta-analysis based on 45 studies with N = 2399 PwPD, a prevalence of 31% for anxiety disorders in general was identified, with generalized anxiety disorder being the most common type of anxiety disorder at 14%. Furthermore, the point prevalence for social anxiety disorder was 14%, 13% for unspecified anxiety, 13% for specific phobias, and 7% for panic disorder. During the course of chronic diseases, fear of progression has also been described. Fear of progression is a real fear that arises from the experience of a serious, potentially life-threatening, or disabling disease and its diagnosis and treatment. In terms of differential diagnoses, fear of progression must be clearly distinguished from anxiety disorders. In a study that compared chronic diseases in terms of the extent of their associated fear of progression, PD showed the second-highest values. In a cross-sectional study that Folkerts et al. conducted with N = 120 PwPD, moderate levels of fear of progression were found in 63% of respondents, while 18% showed dysfunctional levels of fear of progression.

### Anxiety disorders in children and adolescents… [^111ekqrb]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES For mild to moderate symptoms, strong evidence from randomized trials supports the use of cognitive behavior therapy, delivered individually or in group settings, as a first-line treatment. CBT has two components: modifying thinking patterns and changing behavioral patterns. Cognitive restructuring is an essential aspect of CBT that assists children or adolescents in becoming more aware of their self-talk, providing an opportunity to examine the accuracy of thoughts and replace them with more adaptive ones. The behavioral component uses strategies such as social skills training, relaxation strategies, and exposure techniques to change behavior. Exposure techniques are used to address avoidance behavior, which is known to maintain or worsen anxiety over time. One exposure technique that is commonly used is systematic desensitization, which is a gradual, progressive exposure to feared stimuli.
15.

PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY Although CBT is the preferred treatment for mild to moderate symptoms of anxiety disorders, pharmacologic treatment may be considered when the child or adolescent presents with moderate to severe symptoms, is unwilling or unable to participate in psychotherapy, or has shown a poor response to CBT. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are considered first-line medications for anxiety disorders and are generally well tolerated. COMBINED TREATMENT CBT and CBT combined with medication have been shown to be most effective in treating childhood anxiety disorders. A randomized controlled trial of 488 children with social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, or separation anxiety disorder found that the combination of CBT and sertraline was more effective than either CBT or sertraline alone.

21 The AACAP recommends that children and adolescents six to 18 years of age diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, specific phobia, or panic disorder receive treatment with CBT or an SSRI. 8, 10, 11, 13 The findings of the review were not sufficient to recommend a particular order of treatments; however, depending on symptom severity and patient response, a judicious approach starting with CBT may be chosen ahead of an SSRI. 22 Combination treatment could be offered preferentially over CBT or an SSRI alone. 8, 11, 13.

### Neuropeptide Y reduces expression of social fear via simultaneous activation of Y1 and Y2 receptors [^112jBR4u]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

NPY reduces expression of social fear via simultaneous activation of Y1 and Y2 receptors

To investigate whether the effects of NPY on social fear are mediated by the Y1 and/or Y2 receptors, SFC + mice were infused i.c.v. with either Veh, BIBO, BIIE or BIBO+BIIE 20 minutes before social fear extinction on day 2. After 10 minutes, mice were infused again with either Veh or NPY.

All mice showed similar investigation of the non-social stimulus during SFC on day 1 (Figure 3(a); F (4, 35) = 0.20; p = 0.94), reflecting similar preconditioning non-social anxiety. All mice received a similar number of foot-shocks during SFC (F (4, 35) = 0.21; p = 0.93), reflecting similar distress. During social fear extinction on day 2, mice showed similar non-social investigation, reflecting similar non-social fear after SFC. While Veh/NPY-treated mice showed increased social investigation compared to Veh/Veh-treated mice, reflecting reduced expression of social fear, BIBO and BIIE only partly blocked the effects of NPY (Figure 3(b); group effect F (4, 35) = 15.49; p < 0.001; group×stimulus effect F (32, 280) = 3.79; p < 0.001). As such, BIBO/NPY- and BIIE/NPY-treated mice showed reduced social investigation compared to Veh/NPY-treated mice and increased social investigation compared to Veh/Veh-treated mice. However, a combination of BIBO and BIIE completely blocked NPY effects on social fear expression, as suggested by the similarly low social investigation between Veh/Veh- and BIBO+BIIE/NPY-treated mice (Figure 3(b); p < 0.05).

### A qualitative study exploring experiences of treatment in paediatric rheumatology-children' s, young people' s, parents' and carers' perspectives [^114biRPT]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Social factors

Social factors were identified as experiences linked to social agents or actors, such as family, friends, social institutions (like schools or hospitals) and social norms (such as 'going to work' or 'out with friends'). Although 'being social' did appear to be linked to diagnosis (and represented 'wellness'), it was also used to appraise treatment adherence behaviours. These experiences oscillated between 'pro-treatment' trajectories and 'anti-treatment' trajectories. For example, participants reported being given information by healthcare professionals (such as doctors and nurses) in a child-friendly format made them feel cared for. Another reported being given time off work or and having good social support networks were 'pro-treatment' and support adherence behaviours. Participants also reported social factors which were linked with negative treatment appraisal, such as the cost of transport to the hospital, headteachers sending letters about school non-attendance linked to hospital appointments, missing social events with friends, and meeting demands of other family members, created a negative trajectory. This finding suggested every day social interactions with others about accessing treatment contributed to CYP and PC adherence behaviours.

Cognitive factors

Cognitive factors were feelings, emotions or strongly held beliefs experienced as peaks of relief and troughs of fear. Cognitive experiences linked to diagnosis were linked to fear of the unknown, which changed to relief when a diagnosis was given. Fear was also identified in relation to treatment formulations (injectable) or specific medications (methotrexate) which changed to relief once a first dose had been administered or medications were changed. Fear was described as negative and reduced treatment adherence behaviours, though participants did report input from psychologists and counselling about treatment formulation and specific medications had a positive impact on treatment adherence. Both CYP and PC in this study had beliefs and thoughts which appeared to have an overarching inclination to 'not-want-to-need' injectable treatment but 'accepted' injectable treatment as 'a necessary, but temporary evil' for the time being. Both CYP and PC believed that the effectiveness of their injectable treatments would eventually peak and then slowly reduce, which would mean treatment would be stopped and changed to another medication.

### Neuropeptide Y reduces expression of social fear via simultaneous activation of Y1 and Y2 receptors [^115ayh9F]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

SFC paradigm

To induce social fear, mice were conditioned during SFC, and social investigation was assessed during social fear extinction as a read-out of social fear.

SFC

SFC was performed with a computerised fear conditioning system (TSE System GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) as previously described (seefor a schematic representation of the SFC paradigm). Mice were placed in the conditioning chamber (45 cm×22 cm×40 cm), and after a 30-second habituation period, an empty wire mesh cage (7 cm×7 cm×6 cm) was placed as a non-social stimulus near one of the short walls. After three minutes, the non-social stimulus was replaced by an identical cage containing an unfamiliar mouse. Unconditioned mice (SFC –) were allowed to investigate this social stimulus for three minutes, whereas conditioned mice (SFC +) were given a one-second mild electric foot-shock (0.7 mA) each time they investigated (i.e. made direct contact with) the social stimulus. Mice received between one and four foot-shocks, with a variable inter-shock interval, depending on when direct social contact was made. The number of foot-shocks was assessed as a measure of distress. Mice were returned to their home cage when no further social contact was made for two minutes (average duration of SFC ~10 minutes). All SFC + mice investigated the social stimulus and could be conditioned. The time mice spent investigating the non-social stimulus, as a preconditioning measure of non-social anxiety, was analysed by an observer blind to the treatment.

Social fear extinction

One day after SFC, mice were exposed in their home cage to three non-social stimuli (i.e. empty cages identical to the cage used on day 1) to assess non-social investigation as a parameter of non-social fear. Mice were then exposed to six unfamiliar social stimuli (i.e. mice enclosed in wire mesh cages) to assess social investigation as a parameter of social fear. Each stimulus was placed near a short wall of the home cage and presented for three minutes, with a three-minute inter-exposure interval. The test was recorded and analysed using JWatcher v1.0 (Macquarie University and UCLA). Non-social investigation was defined as direct sniffing of the empty cage, whereas social investigation was defined as direct sniffing of the cage and/or of the social stimulus inside the cage.

### USPSTF recommendation: screening for anxiety in children and adolescents… [^111XtTQd]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

This recommendation applies to children and adolescents 18 years or younger who do not have a diagnosed anxiety disorder or are not showing recognized signs or symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety disorders are characterized by greater duration or intensity of impairment of a stress response. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders recognizes 7 different types of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, specific phobias, separation anxiety disorder, and selective mutism.
2. Anxiety screening instruments that have been assessed by the USPSTF are heterogeneous. Some screening instruments are designed to assess for a specific anxiety disorder, while others are designed to assess several anxiety disorders.

Broader screening instruments used to identify children with several different anxiety disorders include the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders and the Patient Health Questionnaire–Adolescent. Many instruments that screen for anxiety were initially developed for epidemiologic studies for surveillance or to evaluate response to treatment. Not all of the screening instruments are feasible for use in primary care settings because of length. 1, 3 Currently, only 2 screening instruments are widely used in clinical practice for detecting anxiety: SCARED and Social Phobia Inventory. Treatment for anxiety disorders can include psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, a combination of both, or collaborative care. 15 Several psychotherapy approaches have been used to treat anxiety; however, cognitive behavioral therapy is the most commonly used approach.

16–18 Duloxetine, a serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is the only medication approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of GAD in children 7 years or older. Other medications have also been reported as being prescribed off-label for treatment of anxiety in youth. 1, 3. Studies used 12 screening instruments to screen for 6 anxiety conditions. Some screening instruments with subscales screened for more than 1 anxiety disorder. Only 1 or 2 studies used each screening instrument for a given disorder. Although a variety of different screening instruments were assessed, 2 are widely used in practice for detecting anxiety: SCARED and the Social Phobia Inventory. The reference standard was a structured clinical interview for anxiety diagnosis. 1, 3.

### The fear of positive evaluation scale: assessing a proposed cognitive component of social anxiety [^112p8ebP]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Cognitive-behavioral models propose that fear of negative evaluation is the core feature of social anxiety disorder. However, it may be that fear of evaluation in general is important in social anxiety, including fears of positive as well as negative evaluation. To test this hypothesis, we developed the Fear of Positive Evaluation Scale (FPES) and conducted analyses to examine the psychometric properties of the FPES, as well as test hypotheses regarding the construct of fear of positive evaluation (FPE). Responses from a large (n = 1711) undergraduate sample were utilized. The reliability, construct validity, and factorial validity of the FPES were examined; the distinction of FPE from fear of negative evaluation was evaluated utilizing confirmatory factor analysis; and the ability of FPE to predict social interaction anxiety above and beyond fear of negative evaluation was assessed. Results provide preliminary support for the psychometric properties of the FPES and the validity of the construct of FPE. The implications of FPE with respect to the study and treatment of social anxiety disorder are discussed.

### The effect of singular nonverbal behaviours of experimenters on pain reports [^114Gn5W1]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Fear of minor pain was negatively associated with the UPR in females, so higher fear of minor pain was associated with a smaller reduction in pain from the pre-test to the conditioning phase. Previous studies have shown that higher levels of fear of pain are associated with lower placebo effects, and this study shows that fear of minor pain in females weakened the UPR amplitude that in turn was associated with a weaker conditioned pain response. In females, fear of minor pain was also negatively associated with the reinforced expectations, suggesting that being more afraid of minor pain inhibited the generation of larger expectations about the effectiveness of the cream, suggesting that negative emotions may inhibit the generation of positive expectations about treatment. It has been previously suggested that negative emotions like anxiety modulate placebo effects. More specifically for females, Colloca et alshowed that compared to males, intranasal inhalation of vasopressin enhanced the placebo analgesic response only in females, and the larger placebo analgesic effects in females were modulated by lower dispositional anxiety levels. Consistently, what our findings add is that the negative emotions may also weaken the UPR and generation of positive expectations in females. Lastly, the negative association between fear of pain and lower reduction in pain can have potential implications in clinical settings with pain patients with tendencies to exhibit maladaptive patterns of pain-related fear and pain catastrophizing, that may eventually reduce the treatment outcome.

### Functional involvement of septal miR-132 in extinction and oxytocin-mediated reversal of social fear [^116BnkzH]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Whether appetitive or aversive, social interactions are an indispensable component of our lives. Thus, dysregulation of social behavior often has tremendous consequences during an individual's life and is a symptom of various psychopathologies. Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by intense fear and avoidance of social situations. With a lifetime prevalence of 8 to 15% it is deemed a major health concern. The lack of appropriate animal models contributes to limited effective, efficient, and targeted treatment options for SAD. The social fear conditioning (SFC) paradigm generates robust fear and avoidance of same-sex conspecifics in mice. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) was found to be essential for reversing SFC-induced social fear in male and female mice, with the observed effect being localized within the lateral septum (LS).

Although OXT attracts enormous scientific interest due to its capacity to modulate various socio-emotional behaviors, its mechanisms of action at the neuronal and molecular levels remain largely unknown. More specifically, the involvement of OXT in the stringent orchestration of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, which is required to shape behavioral adaptations, is still to be elucidated. Epigenetic mechanisms that intricately regulate gene expression are known to influence socio-emotional behaviors, including social fear. The discovery of small non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), has extensively expanded our understanding of the cellular mechanisms used to regulate gene expression, which majorly contribute to socio-behavioral adaptations on the epigenetic level. miRNAs are small (~22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs that bind to a member of the Argonaute protein family (Ago proteins) and post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression by binding to target mRNAs, thereby initiating mRNA decay or reducing translational efficiency.

### Guideline summary review: an evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of low back pain [^117X6cto]. The Spine Journal (2020). High credibility.

Medical & psychological treatment — subacute LBP: In a randomized trial, patients were assigned to treatment-based classification (TBC) physical therapy alone (n = 36), TBC plus graded activity/exercise (GA) (n = 37), or TBC with graded exposure (GX) (n = 35); questionnaires at baseline, 4 weeks, and 6 months showed improvement in Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODQ) scores across groups without significant between-group differences, and all groups improved in Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ) scores with significant decreases in pain-related fear for TBC and GX (p < 0.01). Completer and intention-to-treat analyses were similar, with 26, 22, and 24 completing 6-month follow-up in TBC, GA, and GX, respectively, and the authors concluded that adding GA or GX to TBC was not effective; this provides Level I evidence that supplementing TBC with GA or GX was not effective for improving outcomes related to development of chronic LBP.

### Transcriptome and chromatin alterations in social fear indicate association of MEG3 with successful extinction of fear [^111zjFJA]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

Social anxiety disorder is characterized by a persistent fear and avoidance of social situations, but available treatment options are rather unspecific. Using an established mouse social fear conditioning (SFC) paradigm, we profiled gene expression and chromatin alterations after the acquisition and extinction of social fear within the septum, a brain region important for social fear and social behaviors. Here, we particularly focused on the successful versus unsuccessful outcome of social fear extinction training, which corresponds to treatment responsive versus resistant patients in the clinics. Validation of coding and non-coding RNAs revealed specific isoforms of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) Meg3 regulated, depending on the success of social fear extinction. Moreover, PI3K/AKT was differentially activated with extinction success in SFC-mice. In vivo knockdown of specific Meg3 isoforms increased baseline activity of PI3K/AKT signaling, and mildly delayed social fear extinction. Using ATAC-Seq and CUT&RUN, we found alterations in the chromatin structure of specific genes, which might be direct targets of lncRNA Meg3.

### Social buffering of human fear is shaped by gender, social concern, and the presence of real vs virtual agents [^111GyjjB]. Translational Psychiatry (2021). Medium credibility.

We assessed individual differences in social concern (worries regarding social censure or rejection because of publicly observable reactions) using the Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI-3; 22). The ASI-3 is a well-established questionnaire that allows for assessing social concern in parallel with other anxiety dimensions, i.e. physical and cognitive concern (see below for details). The parallel assessment of different anxiety dimensions is important, because it allows us to evaluate the effect of social concern, compared to physical and cognitive concern.

In more detail, the social concern scale assesses concern regarding observable reactions in the presence of others. Individuals indicate whether they are concerned to appear nervous ("It is important for me not to appear nervous".), tremble ("When I tremble in the presence of others, I fear what people might think of me".), blush ("It scares me when I blush in front of people".), sweat ("When I begin to sweat in a social situation, I fear people will think negatively of me".) or faint ("I think it would be horrible for me to faint in public".) in the presence of another person. Accordingly, social concern can be elicited by the mere presence of another individual.

Guided by previous studies, we assumed that the real or virtual presence of another person might reduce the subjective and autonomic fear responses, indicating a social buffering effect. In this case, the SCRs and subjective ratings to aversive sounds should be significantly smaller in the social compared to the alone treatment groups. Given that individuals scoring high on social concern tend to fear observable reactions in the presence of others (e.g. blushing, trembling etc), high social concern scores should counteract social buffering. The higher the social concern, the smaller the reduction in SCRs and subjective ratings to aversive sounds in the social compared to the alone treatment groups. Inspired by findings showing more generalized social anxiety effects in females, we hypothesized that this effect might be stronger in females than in males, reflected by a significant interaction between gender (female/male), treatment (alone/social) and social concern. Motivated by studies showing a reduction of social stress during virtual compared to real-life social interactions, we expected that the effect of social concern on social buffering should be significantly stronger in the presence of a real person compared to the presence of a virtual representation (agent) of this same person.

### Venlafaxine (venlafaxine hydrochloride) [^115jtptf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Venlafaxine extended-release tablets are a selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) indicated for:

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) (1.1)
Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) (1.2)

1.1 Major Depressive Disorder

Venlafaxine extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).

Efficacy of venlafaxine in MDD was shown in both short-term trials and a longer-term trial in MDD [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities, representing a change from previous functioning, and includes the presence of at least five of the following nine symptoms during the same two-week period: depressed mood, markedly diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation.

1.2 Social Anxiety Disorder

Venlafaxine extended-release tablets are indicated for the treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), also known as Social Phobia, as defined in DSM-IV.

Social Anxiety Disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of 1 or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. Exposure to the feared situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which may approach the intensity of a panic attack. The feared situations are avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with the person's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is a marked distress about having the phobias. Lesser degrees of performance anxiety or shyness generally do not require psychopharmacological treatment.

Efficacy of venlafaxine extended-release tablets in the treatment of SAD was established in short-term SAD trials[see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

### How Do patients' fear prediction and fear experience impact exposure-based therapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia? A comprehensive analysis of fear prediction [^116YtJLh]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5.6. Safety Behaviour During Exposure

Safety behaviour was assessed using two different questions in the protocol sheet. All exposures were documented: 'Did anything in the situation help you to cope with the fear or anxiety?' and 'During the exercise, did you try to control the fear or any symptoms?'. The patients could state 'yes', 'partly', or 'no'. In free text, they could indicate what kind of safety behaviour they had used. In the next step, two independent raters compared the data of the protocol sheets. These two independent raters assigned the information as either 1 (safety behaviour present) or 0 (no safety behaviour present). The raters' agreement was high and significant (Cohens Kappa = 0.92). If the person completely avoided exposure, the protocol was not completed. These patients continued outpatient treatment but were excluded from the study.

2.6. Data Analyses

2.6.1. Outcome Evaluation

The treatment outcome was defined a priori as differences in scores between the baseline and post/follow-up assessment scores for the primary outcomes MI scales (accompanied and unaccompanied) and PAS. The secondary outcomes were ACQ and BSQ. A higher change score indicated a more substantial improvement in symptoms and, consequently, a better treatment outcome.

2.6.2. Process Measures

The information of the exposure protocol was used to create indicators of emotional processing. Expected fear and experienced fear were both directly assessed. The difference between the two scores was calculated (expected fear–experienced fear).

2.7. Analytic Strategy

Given that no differences were observed with regard to the outcome measures (ACQ, BSQ and MI) between the therapist guided and patients led group (for more details see), for the present analyses, treatment groups were combined.

2.7.1. Hypothesis 1

Based on the calculations of Rachman and Lopatka, the overprediction bias of fearful subjects in a threatening situation during the first exposure (first hypothesis) was evaluated using a chi-square test. A deviation of up to 1 was allowed to be classified as a match. If the expected anxiety was higher than the experienced anxiety by more than 1, it was considered an overprediction. If the expected anxiety was lower than the experienced anxiety by more than 1, it was considered an underprediction. The calculation was conducted following Telch et al. or van Hout and Emmelkamp.

### Understanding social anxiety as a risk for alcohol use disorders: fear of scrutiny, not social interaction fears, prospectively predicts alcohol use disorders [^112Deo2i]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2009). Low credibility.

Increasing evidence indicates that social anxiety may be a premorbid risk factor for alcohol use disorders (AUD). The aim of this study was to replicate and extend previous work examining whether social anxiety is a risk factor for AUD by evaluating both the temporal antecedence and non-spuriousness of this relationship. We also examined whether social anxiety first-order factors (social interaction anxiety, observation anxieties) served as specific predictors of AUD. A non-referred sample of 404 psychologically healthy young adults (i.e. free from current or past Axis I psychopathology) was prospectively followed over approximately two years. Social anxiety (but not depression or trait anxiety) at baseline significantly predicted subsequent AUD onset. The relationship between social anxiety and AUD remained even after controlling for relevant variables (gender, depression, trait anxiety). Further, social anxiety first-order factors differentially predicted AUD onset, such that observation anxieties (but not social interaction anxiety) were prospectively linked to AUD onset. This study provides further support that social anxiety (and fear of scrutiny specifically) appears to serve as an important and potentially specific AUD-related variable that deserves serious attention as a potential vulnerability factor.

### Evidence for distinct genetic and environmental influences on fear acquisition and extinction [^113e5XV1]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Genetic and environmental influences on fear extinction

The modest but significant heritability of fear extinction (15%) suggests that a relatively small degree of variation in fear extinction in healthy individuals is influenced by genetic factors. The only prior twin study of fear conditioning to date (Hettema et al.) estimated the heritability of fear extinction of the CS+ specifically to be 36% (95% CI 18–52), and the CS− 34% (95% CI 16–50). The CIs for the current study include estimates up to 25% (95% CI 4–25). It is possible that the range of overlap between CIs from the prior and current study (16–25) may represent the 'true' range of heritability. There have been no twin studies of treatment response for anxiety, and two genome-wide meta analyses of CBT treatment response have failed to derive significant heritability estimates despite having statistical power to detect heritability of 30% or greater (Coleman et al; Rayner et al.). This study thus adds to our limited knowledge about the relative role for genes and the environment in fear extinction, a mechanism underpinning exposure-based treatment, a core component of CBT for anxiety disorders.

The high estimate of the non-shared environment (e² = 85%) influencing fear extinction in this study partially reflects high measurement error given our task (Purves et al.). Furthermore, the use of difference scores as an outcome, which, while reducing the total number of variables examined, aggregates the error variance of each individual stimuli, and thus inflates the overall non-shared environmental estimate.

There are several plausible contributors to variable treatment response over and above direct genetic influences. These include specific life experiences, and individual characteristics such as unemployment, low educational attainment and poor interpersonal relationships that are also known to reduce treatment efficacy (DeRubeis et al; Mojtabai; Newman, Llera, Erickson, Przeworski, & Castonguay; Renaud, Russell, & Myhr). Specific disorder profiles, including greater symptom severity, comorbidity with other mental health disorders and poor treatment adherence are associated with poor treatment response in anxious adults and children (Hudson et al; Rayner et al; Wergeland et al.). Understanding modifiable personal risk factors may help identify areas for intervention that could serve as a precursor or adjunct to therapy to further enhance the effect of exposure within a personalised medicine framework.

### Singular and combined effects of transcranial infrared laser stimulation and exposure therapy on pathological fear: a randomized clinical trial [^115Z3gYw]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Preclinical findings suggest that transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS) improves fear extinction learning and cognitive function by enhancing prefrontal cortex (PFC) oxygen metabolism. These findings prompted our investigation of treating pathological fear using this non-invasive stimulation approach either alone to the dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC), or to the ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) in combination with exposure therapy.

Methods

Volunteers with pathological fear of either enclosed spaces, contamination, public speaking, or anxiety-related bodily sensations were recruited for this randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled trial with four arms: (a) Exposure + TILS_vmPFC (n = 29), (b) Exposure + sham TILS_vmPFC (n = 29), (c) TILS_dlPFC alone (n = 26), or (d) Sham TILS _dlPFC alone (n = 28). Post-treatment assessments occurred immediately following treatment. Follow-up assessments occurred 2 weeks after treatment.

Results

A total of 112 participants were randomized [age range: 18–63 years; 96 females (85.71%)]. Significant interactions of Group × Time and Group × Context indicated differential treatment effects on retention (i.e. between time-points, averaged across contexts) and on generalization (i.e. between contexts, averaged across time-points), respectively. Among the monotherapies, TILS_dlPFC outperformed SHAM_dlPFC in the initial context, b = -13.44, 95% CI (-25.73 to -1.15), p = 0.03. Among the combined treatments, differences between EX + TILS_vmPFC and EX + SHAM_vmPFC were non-significant across all contrasts.

Conclusions

TILS to the dlPFC, one of the PFC regions implicated in emotion regulation, resulted in a context-specific benefit as a monotherapy for reducing fear. Contrary to prediction, TILS to the vmPFC, a region implicated in fear extinction memory consolidation, did not enhance exposure therapy outcome.

### Assessing the validity of social anxiety disorder subtypes using a nationally representative sample [^111P3q5H]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to examine and validate social anxiety disorder subtypes using the nationally representative National Comorbidity Survey Replication (N = 9282). Generalized and non-generalized subtypes were defined as fearing at least 8 (i.e., most) and fewer than 7 of 14 possible social situations, respectively, following the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). Results indicated that in those with social anxiety disorder, the odds of having comorbid major depression, a comorbid anxiety disorder, and suicidal ideation were significantly greater in the generalized subtype. However, differences were no longer significant when adjusting for the number of feared social situations. Results further indicated that the number of feared social situations was significantly associated with comorbid major depression, a comorbid anxiety disorder, and suicidal ideation. These findings call into question the validity of DSM-IV-defined subtypes and provide additional support for the notion that clinicians and researchers should consider viewing this disorder on a single continuum with greater number of feared situations associated with greater clinical severity.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^114XwiyD]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders — prevalence and onset data indicate that anxiety disorders are among the most common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents; at any given time, nearly 7% of youths worldwide have an anxiety disorder, with estimated lifetime prevalence in the United States approximating 20% to 30%. Among youths 13 to 18 years old, lifetime prevalence rates approximate 20% for specific phobia, 9% for social anxiety, 8% for separation anxiety, and 2% each for agoraphobia, panic, and generalized anxiety. The median age of onset approximates 11 years, and onsets often occur during specific developmental phases: separation anxiety during the preschool/early school-age years, specific phobia in the school-age years, social anxiety in the later school-age and early adolescent years, and generalized anxiety, panic, and agoraphobia in the later adolescent/young adult years. Anxiety disorders (especially generalized anxiety) are highly comorbid with each other and with other psychiatric disorders, and for comorbid occurrences, multifaceted treatment plans likely are necessary.

### Reducing fear and avoidance of memory loss improves mood and social engagement in community-based older adults: a randomized trial [^113Th9pb]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Primary outcome. ADRD-related fear and avoidance was assessed using the FAM scale, which focuses on the symptom of memory loss. The FAM is an 18-item self-report scale assessing fears and avoidance behaviors associated with memory loss, which has been validated for use in older populations. Items address two components: fear (e.g. " I am afraid that I might embarrass myself by forgetting something ") and avoidance (e.g. " I try not to exert my brain too much as it might make my memory worse "). Higher scores indicate greater fear and avoidance of memory loss (range = 18–90).

Secondary outcomes. Fear of ADRD more generally was assessed using the Fear of Alzheimer's Disease Scale (FADS), which focuses on fear of AD. The FADS is a 30-item self-report scale validated for use in older adults. Higher scores indicate greater fear of developing AD. Everyday memory failures were assessed using the Memory Failures Scale (MFS). The MFS is a validated 12-item self-report scale. Higher scores indicate greater frequency of memory failures experienced in everyday life. Anxiety, depression, and ability to perform social roles and activities, were assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 29-item profile (PROMIS-29) scales. The PROMIS-29 is a validated self-report scale assessing multiple health domains, including anxiety, depression, and ability to perform social roles and activities. Each domain is assessed using a 4-item subscale. Higher scores indicate higher anxiety, depression, and ability to perform social roles, respectively. The PROMIS-29 also includes subscales for fatigue, sleep disturbance, physical function, pain intensity, and pain interference; these were not examined here. Well-being was assessed using the World Health Organization-Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5). The WHO-5 is a validated 5-item self-report scale assessing well-being over the last two weeks. Higher scores indicate greater well-being.

Participant feedback. Following the intervention, participants answered debriefing questions. Questions focused on aspects they found most helpful, challenges related to completing the intervention, and recommendations for improvement.

### Kids FACE FEARS comparative effectiveness research… [^11216cJZ]. ClinicalTrials (2018). Low credibility.

Kids FACE FEARS Comparative Effectiveness ResearchClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Clinical anxiety is among the most common and impairing psychiatric conditions affecting children and adolescents. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is an effective psychological treatment for youth anxiety, with roughly 60% of youth showing considerable clinical response and global improvements in functioning. Regrettably, despite the existence of well-supported treatments, most youth with anxiety disorders do not receive any form of treatment, especially in resource poor settings. Telehealth has been increasingly studied with success as a means to overcome several logistical challenges to traditional brick-and-mortar CBT for youth anxiety and stigma about attending a mental health facility.

After years of initial research, m telehealth and hybrid formats became a dominant mode of outpatient mental health care, and in post-pandemic times these formats still play a prominent role role in youth mental health care. Whereas telehealth and hybrid formats offer opportunities to extend the reach of therapist-led CBT, guided online CBT offers a computerized treatment delivery format that reduces therapist demands and person-power needs relative to therapist-led care. For some, guided online CBT may be a more accessible, acceptable, and even effective format, although attrition can be high in self-paced care.

Despite great promise in the use of technology-based strategies for expanding the reach of CBT for pediatric anxiety, much remains to be learned about how such alternative CBT formats perform in typical care settings, what factors may facilitate versus challenge successful implementation and engagement in usual care settings, and whether specific subpopulations of anxious youth may differentially benefit from these options. As with the majority of controlled evidence supporting therapist-led CBT for youth anxiety, most support for telehealth and hybrid CBT has come from trials conducted in tightly controlled contexts and anxiety specialty clinics with highly selected samples and research therapists. Such work cannot speak to the effectiveness of telehealth effectiveness under typical care circumstances. Many of these studies have also been relatively small and underpowered to examine predictors of differential telehealth response.

The Kids FACE FEARS study design entails a large-scale, streamlined, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial, in which eligible youth with elevated anxiety identified in pediatric health care settings will be randomly assigned to therapist-led CBT versus guided online CBT intervention for youth anxiety and monitored for up to one year out.

### The fear of positive evaluation scale: psychometric properties in a clinical sample [^113LXWmE]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Cognitive models of social anxiety suggest that fear of negative evaluation (FNE) is the central cognitive dimension underlying the disorder. The Fear of Positive Evaluation Scale (FPES; Weeks, Heimberg, & Rodebaugh, 2008) was recently developed to assess an additional cognitive dimension purported to underlie social anxiety disorder (SAD), but its psychometric properties have yet to be examined in clinical populations. The present study, with 133 treatment-seeking patients, examined the applicability of the FPES with a clinical sample. Results indicated that the FPES was factorially distinct from a measure assessing FNE, and patients with SAD (n = 51) had higher mean scores on the FPES than patients with other anxiety disorders (n = 82). The FPES also showed adequate reliability (internal consistency), good convergent and discriminant validity, acceptable criterion-related validity in predicting social interaction anxiety symptoms, and appropriate sensitivity to treatment. The FPES appears to have good psychometric properties and is a promising new assessment tool for better understanding SAD.

### How Do patients' fear prediction and fear experience impact exposure-based therapy for panic disorder with agoraphobia? A comprehensive analysis of fear prediction [^112JvbNo]. Depression and Anxiety (2025). Medium credibility.

Overprediction bias may also lead some patients to avoid or drop out of exposure therapy. Approaches like desensitisation or graduated exposure (e.g.) can help by only gradually increasing challenging levels and following a fear hierarchy. Using retrieval cues in new contexts may also help. Care should be taken to ensure that these cues do not inadvertently function as safety behaviours. Despite this risk, such methods may encourage patients to engage in exposure therapy. Context changes during exposure are also recommended.

Although safety behaviour was not related to fear and overprediction in our study, we suggest encouraging patients to abstain from safety behaviours (compare). Arguably, there is at least a chance that fear activation might be more successful if safety behaviours are restricted (e.g.).

Several limitations of this study should be acknowledged. The level of anxiety was assessed solely via self-report. Incorporating physiological or behavioural measures (e.g.) could provide a more comprehensive assessment. In addition, the time spent in each exposure situation was limited due to time constraints within the treatment study. It, thus, remains unknown if more exposures in each one of the situations would have given different results. As seen in Table A1, the individuals in this sample completed different numbers of exposures across the different situations. Thus, some individuals are included that confronted only one situation. Perhaps the results would be different if all participants had exposure assignments over the same number of repetitions. Furthermore, the levels of anxiety differ substantially in the diverse situations across individuals. Most importantly, due to the first three exposure situations being prescribed, some situations may have elicited only little or no anxiety in some participants. This may have influenced our measures in terms of accuracy. If the fearful situation triggers higher levels of fear, it may also lead to a more substantial violation of expectations. Thus, the design of the present treatment study may have negatively impacted our results.

### Sertraline [^112gqZxz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.5 Social Anxiety Disorder

The effectiveness of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of SAD (also known as social phobia) was established in two multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled studies (Study SAD-1 and SAD-2) of adult outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for SAD.

Study SAD-1 was a 12-week, flexible dose study comparing sertraline hydrochloride (50 to 200 mg/day), n = 211, to placebo, n = 204, in which sertraline hydrochloride was initiated at 25 mg/day for the first week, then titrated to the maximum tolerated dose in 50 mg increments biweekly. Study outcomes were assessed by the:

(1) Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS), a 24-item clinician administered instrument that measures fear, anxiety, and avoidance of social and performance situations, and
(2) Proportion of responders as defined by the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) criterion of CGI-I < 2 (very much or much improved).

Sertraline hydrochloride was statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by the LSAS and the percentage of responders.

Study SAD-2 was a 20-week, flexible dose study that compared sertraline hydrochloride (50 to 200 mg/day), n = 135, to placebo, n = 69. Sertraline hydrochloride was titrated to the maximum tolerated dose in 50 mg increments every 3 weeks. Study outcome was assessed by the:

### Impaired identification of fearful faces in generalised social phobia [^113JhRsG]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Cognitive models and interventions for anxiety assume that socially anxious individuals interpret ambiguous social information in a threatening manner. However, experimental evidence for this hypothesised cognitive bias is mixed. The present study is novel in using a signal detection approach to clarify whether Generalised Social Phobia (GSP) is associated with biased identification of emotionally ambiguous facial expressions.

Methods

16 patients with GSP and 17 non-anxious volunteers classified ambiguous emotional facial expressions, with each face reflecting a blend of two emotions: angry-happy, fearful-happy and fearful-angry. Discrimination accuracy and response criterion were assessed.

Results

Patients with GSP showed significantly poorer discrimination of ambiguous emotional facial expressions that contained an element of fear (i.e., fearful-happy and fearful-angry expressions), compared to non-anxious controls. The groups did not significantly differ in discrimination of faces which lacked fear content (i.e., angry-happy blend), or on measures of response criterion.

Limitations

Small sample size, coexisting depressive symptoms.

Conclusions

Findings indicate a selective impairment in fear identification in GSP. Results are discussed with reference to neurocognitive models of anxiety, and research on serotonergic modulation of emotional face processing.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^116v7jjD]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AHRQ/Mayo review — scope and methods for treatments of child and adolescent anxiety disorders — The objective of the AHRQ/Mayo review was to evaluate the effectiveness of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy for the treatment of specific child and adolescent anxiety disorders and to evaluate safety concerns, and it was made available in August 2017 with errata published in July 2018. To be eligible, studies included children and adolescents between 3 and 18 years old with confirmed diagnoses of panic, social anxiety, specific phobia (including school phobia), generalized anxiety, or separation anxiety disorder, who received any psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy (alone or combined), and reported specified outcomes. Specified outcomes included primary anxiety symptoms from patient, parent, or clinician measures; secondary anxiety outcomes such as coping, avoidance, or anxious thoughts; global function; social function; satisfaction with treatment; response to treatment; and remission of the disorder. Both randomized controlled trials and comparative observational studies were included for effectiveness outcomes, and case reports or case series were used to identify adverse events. The key questions were twofold, addressing the comparative effectiveness of treatments for these disorders and the general and potential harms of available treatments. The strength of evidence for each outcome and comparison (e.g., fluoxetine vs. CBT) was rated via a consensus process, with randomized controlled trials starting with high strength of evidence and observational studies starting with low strength, and initial ratings were then raised or lowered based on five additional domains: risk of bias, precision, directness, consistency, and publication bias.

### Transcriptome and chromatin alterations in social fear indicate association of MEG3 with successful extinction of fear [^115wAVTE]. Molecular Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

The mouse model of SFC enables us to investigate underlying neurobiochemical mechanisms of social fear and social avoidance - the major symptoms of SAD. The difficult diagnosis of SAD usually occurs after social phobia has already been manifested. Therefore, from a translational research perspective, we were particularly interested in transcriptional changes accompanying social fear extinction training, which mimics exposure therapy applied in humans with SAD. Importantly, not only resilience and susceptibility for SAD, but also rates of therapeutic responsiveness and relapse show substantial inter-individual differences. However, in previous SFC studies, the naturally occurring variance in the outcome of extinction training performed on day 2 of the SFC paradigm has largely been ignored. Here we show that, indeed, the success of social fear extinction strongly determined the septal expression of the Meg-ex10 isoforms (Fig. 1), and the maintenance of social fear was accompanied by the maintenance of reduced Meg3-ex10 levels. (Fig. 2A, Fig. 1D). This suggests that septal Meg3-ex10 levels are an indicator for successful or unsuccessful fear extinction and, consequently, are inversely correlated to social fear, i.e. higher Meg3-ex10 expression correlates with reduced social fear expression during extinction. In this line, it is well established that fear acquisition and extinction involve distinct processes of learning and memory. Therefore, the opposing regulation of Meg3-ex10 within the septum after social fear acquisition and after successful fear extinction might be based on these different types of learning as also shown for other molecules. Interestingly, septal Meg3-ex10 expression was found to be strictly dependent on social fear extinction learning (Fig. 2B), but independent of social interactions per se (Fig. 2C). However, with our experimental setup we cannot decipher, whether the social component of extinction learning, or the learning process in general including non-social learning, are mandatory for Meg3-ex10 regulation. Considering the fact that the SFC model is based on operant fear conditioning principles, we could not include contextual or cued fear conditioning as an appropriate control. However, a recently published paradigm based on non-social instrumental fear conditioning might be applied as control for future studies to examine social-specificity vs. broader relevance in instrumental fear conditioning of the targets identified in our study.

### Anxious children and adolescents non-responding to CBT: clinical predictors and families' experiences of therapy [^116pLDLm]. Clinical Psychology & Psychotherapy (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to examine clinical predictors of non-response to manualized cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) among youths (children and adolescents) with anxiety disorders, and to explore families' perspective on therapy, using a mixed methods approach. Non-response to manualized group CBT was determined among 106 youths of Danish ethnicity (7-17years old) with a primary anxiety disorder, identified with the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale at the 3-month follow-up. Twenty-four youths (22.6%) had not responded to treatment, and a logistic regression analysis revealed that youths with a primary diagnosis of social phobia were seven times more likely not to respond, whereas youths with a comorbid mood disorder were almost four times more likely. Families of non-responding youths with primary social phobia and/or a comorbid mood disorder (n = 15) were interviewed, and data were analysed through interpretative phenomenological analysis. Two superordinate themes emerged: youths were not involved in therapy work, and manualized group format posed challenges to families. The mixed methods approach provided new perspectives on the difficulties that may be encountered by families of non-responding youths with a primary social phobia diagnosis and youths with a comorbid mood disorder during manualized group CBT. Clinical implications related to youths' clinical characteristics, and families' experience and suggestions are drawn. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Key Practitioner Messages

Youths with an anxiety disorder, who had a primary social phobia diagnosis and those, who had a comorbid mood disorder, were more likely not to respond to manualized group CBT. Parents of those non-responding youths often considered them as motivated to overcome their difficulties, but due to their symptomatology, they were unreceptive, reluctant and ambivalent and therefore not actively involved in therapy. The non-responding youths with social phobia felt evaluated and nervous of what others thought of them in the group. The parents of the non-responding youths with a comorbid mood disorder felt the group format placed restraints on therapists' ability to focus on their individual needs.

### Epidemiology of fears and specific phobia in adolescence: results from the Mexican adolescent mental health survey [^112Ux4kB]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Specific phobia is among the most common disorders in the general adolescent population, but also among the least studied. The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of specific fears among adolescents, the proportion of those with fears who meet criteria for specific phobia, and the proportion who recognize their fears as excessive and to identify comorbidity with other disorders and factors associated with severity and treatment.

Method

3,005 youth aged 12 to 17 years participated in the Mexican Adolescent Mental Health Survey, a stratified multistage probability sample representative of adolescents living in Mexico City in 2005. Fears, specific phobia, and 20 other DSM-IV psychiatric disorders were evaluated with the adolescent computerized version of the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview, administered by trained lay interviewers in the participants' homes. Descriptive, logistic regression, and discrete-time survival analyses were employed.

Results

Most adolescents reported at least 1 fear (76.5%); 36.5% of those met lifetime criteria for specific phobia, and 27.3% met criteria in the prior 12 months. Blood-injection-injury and animal fears were the most common types. Females were more likely to report any fear, to have more fear types, and to meet diagnostic criteria. Increased numbers of fears were associated with increased odds of meeting specific phobia criteria and with increased impairment. Among teens with specific phobia, 71.3% recognized their fear as excessive, 9.7% to 12.3% reported severe impairment, and only 6.5% had received treatment. Severity of impairment and comorbid disorders were associated with treatment seeking.

Conclusions

The large percentage of adolescents meeting diagnostic criteria coupled with the low proportion with serious impairment suggests that current diagnostic thresholds may be too low or not developmentally sensitive. Future research should address the nature of impairment for adolescents with specific phobia. Early detection and timely treatment are important given that specific phobia is persistent and highly comorbid and that few individuals seek treatment.

### An empirical analysis of moscovitch's reconceptualised model of social anxiety: how is it different from fear of negative evaluation? [^111crpNN]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Cognitive-behavioural models propose that excessive fear of negative evaluation is central to social anxiety. Moscovitch (2009) instead proposes that perceived deficiencies in three self attributes: fears of showing signs of anxiety, deficits in physical appearance, or deficits in social competence are at the core of social anxiety. However, these attributes are likely to overlap with fear of negative evaluation. Responses to an online survey of 286 participants with a range of social anxiety severity were analysed using hierarchical multiple regression to identify the overall unique predictive value of Moscovitch's model. Altogether, Moscovitch's model provided improvements in the prediction of safety behaviours, types of fears and cognitions; however only the fear of showing anxiety subscale provided unique information. This research supports further investigations into the utility of this revised model, particularly related to utility of explicitly assessing and addressing fears of showing anxiety.
