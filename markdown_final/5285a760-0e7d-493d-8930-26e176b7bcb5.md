## Question

What are the indications for surgery in radicular neck pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for surgery in patients with radicular neck pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining radicular neck pain and confirming the clinical diagnosis. Then, I should verify the role and duration of conservative management. Next, I will identify absolute and relative surgical indications, including neurologic thresholds and timing. After that, I should review the evidence comparing surgical techniques and their outcomes. Finally, I will integrate special scenarios, imaging strategy, and a practical decision framework, while double-checking areas where evidence is weak or conflicting.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and diagnostic anchors. Radicular neck pain reflects nerve root compression or irritation, typically presenting with dermatomal arm pain, paresthesias, and objective neurologic deficits such as weakness, reflex changes, or sensory loss. Distinguishing it from somatic axial pain is essential because management diverges substantially [^115dAD7v] [^114xx5ef]. Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic tests that meaningfully support radiculopathy: provocative maneuvers like Spurling's, traction response, and Valsalva have high specificity but low sensitivity, while paresthesia mapping to a specific dermatome and objective motor findings increase diagnostic confidence; MRI is appropriate when symptoms persist or surgery is being considered, but I need to ensure imaging correlates with the clinical picture to avoid treating incidental findings [^115dAD7v] [^114ZfMbX] [^111HBUxT].

> Next, I should review the foundation of conservative care and its expected trajectory. Most patients with cervical radiculopathy improve without surgery, so a structured nonoperative program is mandatory before operative referral. This includes supervised physical therapy emphasizing mobility and stabilization, NSAIDs, and selective use of traction, with expectations set that improvement often occurs over 4–6 weeks and may continue up to 12 weeks [^116rnQcm] [^113wmeL6] [^115DZLNq]. Wait, let me verify the role of injections: cervical interlaminar epidural steroid injections can provide short-term relief for radicular symptoms and may bridge care or defer surgery in some cases, but benefits are modest and transient, so they should not replace a comprehensive conservative trial [^115RPb2V] [^111Y6tDc].

> I will now examine absolute indications for surgery. Progressive neurologic deficit — most critically motor weakness — is a clear indication for urgent surgical decompression because delay risks irreversible denervation and functional loss. Similarly, disabling motor deficits such as deltoid palsy or wrist drop warrant earlier intervention even before completing a full 6-week conservative course [^116bM5Xi] [^112FDevW]. Hold on, I should verify the timing nuance: while some guidelines allow a closely monitored 4–6 week window in moderate deficits that are improving, any progression or failure to recover should prompt expedited surgical evaluation rather than prolonged conservative care [^111maSbW].

> Let me consider relative indications after a failed conservative trial. Persistent, function-limiting radicular pain beyond roughly 6–12 weeks despite appropriate nonoperative therapy is a common relative indication, recognizing that surgery offers faster pain relief but may not change long-term outcomes compared with continued conservative care. Shared decision-making is crucial here given trade-offs in speed of relief versus operative risks [^116bM5Xi] [^111Y6tDc] [^117QPG74]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought there was strong evidence that surgery is definitively superior long term, but I should double-check that; Cochrane and other systematic reviews suggest short-term superiority of surgery with convergence by 6–12 months, so expectations must be calibrated accordingly [^117QPG74] [^113s3dMz].

> Next, I should review the evidence on surgical technique selection. Historically, anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) has been the reference standard, but I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. Randomized data show that posterior cervical foraminotomy is noninferior to ACDF for single-level foraminal radiculopathy at 1–2 years with similar success rates and arm pain reduction, and posterior surgery may entail lower costs and avoid fusion-related complications, supporting a patient-centered, anatomy-driven choice [^1151vGpt] [^117GkRAw] [^1166Lh3E] [^115niXht]. Let me verify comparative effectiveness across anterior options: ACDF, anterior cervical discectomy without fusion (ACD), and cervical disc arthroplasty (CDA) all yield clinically meaningful improvements in radicular pain and function, with no consistent long-term superiority among techniques. CDA preserves motion and may reduce adjacent segment disease risk, but evidence quality varies and selection should be individualized [^113hSHu8] [^113BNdEk] [^113opVPB].

> I should confirm how pain predominance influences outcomes and counseling. Traditional teaching favors surgery when arm pain predominates over neck pain, but contemporary registry data show that patients with varying mixes of neck and arm pain can achieve clinically meaningful improvements and similar satisfaction after ACDF, so predominant pain location should not be an absolute barrier if other indications are present [^1141zJ2f]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; while outcomes can be comparable, expectations about the magnitude and speed of neck pain improvement should be tempered when axial pain predominates, and this should be discussed during shared decision-making [^1141zJ2f].

> Now, I need to ensure I address special scenarios. Myelopathy changes the calculus: even mild myelopathy may justify earlier surgical consultation because natural history can deteriorate unpredictably, and evidence comparing immediate versus delayed surgery in mild cases is limited and mixed, so a lower threshold for decompression is reasonable when red flags or progression are present [^1144zgVv] [^113Q2nDB]. But wait, what if the presentation is primarily axial neck pain without radiculopathy? Surgery lacks robust support in that scenario and should generally be avoided outside of rare, carefully selected cases with a concordant pain generator and exhaustive failed conservative care, ideally with psychological screening and diagnostic confirmation such as discography when appropriate [^111Y6tDc] [^1113KDRo].

> Next, I should review the imaging and diagnostic workup strategy. MRI without contrast is usually appropriate for new or worsening radiculopathy to define compressive lesions, but I need to ensure clinical-radiographic concordance to prevent overtreatment of incidental findings. In patients over 50, plain radiographs can help screen for systemic disease, though they are low yield for nonspecific neck pain, and advanced imaging should be reserved for persistent symptoms or surgical planning [^114ZfMbX] [^111HBUxT]. Hold on, I should verify the role of selective nerve root blocks. They can aid diagnostic localization and may provide therapeutic benefit in some patients, but they are adjuncts rather than substitutes for a careful neurologic examination and MRI correlation [^111AVtwn].

> I will now synthesize a practical decision framework. First, confirm true radiculopathy with dermatomal pain, paresthesias, and objective findings. Second, initiate a structured conservative program for 4–12 weeks with close reassessment. Third, escalate to surgical referral if there is progressive motor deficit, disabling weakness, intractable pain beyond 6–12 weeks despite care, or patient preference after counseling about trade-offs. Fourth, select technique based on anatomy, surgeon expertise, and patient priorities, recognizing that posterior foraminotomy and ACDF/ACD/CDA are all reasonable and largely equivalent in appropriately selected patients [^112NsLfB] [^1151vGpt] [^113hSHu8]. I should double-check that this aligns with guideline-based care; NASS emphasizes individualized treatment and acknowledges that some patients will require more or less than the average, reinforcing the need for shared decision-making and flexibility within evidence-informed boundaries [^112NsLfB].

> Finally, I need to ensure the patient counseling points are explicit. Surgery typically accelerates pain relief and functional recovery compared with conservative care, but long-term outcomes often converge by 6–12 months. Complication profiles differ by approach, with posterior foraminotomy avoiding anterior neck dissection and graft-related issues, while ACDF carries risks of dysphagia, hoarseness, and adjacent segment disease. Reoperation rates are generally low and comparable across common techniques in RCTs, which should be contextualized during informed consent [^117QPG74] [^1151vGpt] [^113hSHu8]. Hold on, I should verify one more nuance: while some meta-analyses suggest no single surgical technique is clearly superior for pure radiculopathy, surgeon experience and patient-specific anatomy often drive outcomes, so center-specific expertise should be part of the discussion [^113hSHu8].

---

Surgery for radicular neck pain is indicated when there is **progressive neurological deficit** (motor weakness, reflex loss, or sensory changes) [^116bM5Xi] or **persistent radicular pain** despite 6–12 weeks of conservative therapy [^116bM5Xi] [^113rsCA3]. Early surgery is appropriate for **severe or progressive deficits** to prevent permanent nerve injury [^112FDevW] [^113Q2nDB]. Surgery is not indicated for isolated axial neck pain without radiculopathy or myelopathy [^111Y6tDc] [^1144zgVv]. Common procedures include ACDF, posterior foraminotomy, and cervical disc arthroplasty, with similar long-term outcomes [^113hSHu8] [^113BNdEk] [^117GkRAw].

## Indications for surgical intervention

### Absolute indications

Absolute indications include **progressive neurological deficit**, characterized by motor weakness, reflex loss, or sensory changes attributable to nerve root compression [^116bM5Xi] [^112FDevW], and **severe neurological deficit**, marked by significant motor weakness or functional impairment that warrants immediate surgical intervention to prevent permanent nerve damage [^112FDevW].

---

### Relative indications

Relative indications include **persistent radicular pain**, in which radicular pain persists beyond 6–12 weeks despite conservative management (physical therapy, medications, epidural injections) [^116bM5Xi], and **recurrent radicular pain**, defined by repeated episodes of radicular pain significantly impairing quality of life despite conservative measures [^notfound].

---

## Contraindications to surgical intervention

Contraindications include **isolated axial neck pain**, in which surgery is not recommended for neck pain without radiculopathy or myelopathy [^111Y6tDc] [^1144zgVv], and **mild or non-progressive neurological deficits**, wherein conservative management remains the preferred approach [^1144zgVv].

---

## Timing of surgical intervention

Early surgery is indicated for patients with **progressive neurological deficits** or severe neurological impairment to prevent permanent nerve damage [^112FDevW] [^113Q2nDB], whereas **delayed surgery** is appropriate after a trial of conservative management (6–12 weeks) for persistent radicular pain without neurological progression [^111maSbW] [^114qiDRb].

## Surgical procedures commonly used

| **Procedure** | **Indications** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) | - Single-level disc herniation <br/> - Degenerative disc disease with radiculopathy | - Good long-term outcomes <br/> - Effective in relieving radicular symptoms | - Loss of motion at fused segment <br/> - Potential for adjacent segment disease |
| Posterior cervical foraminotomy | - Lateral disc herniation <br/> - Foraminal stenosis | - Motion-preserving <br/> - Lower risk of adjacent segment disease | - Limited access to central lesions <br/> - Potential for recurrent symptoms |
| Cervical disc arthroplasty | - Single-level disc disease <br/> - Younger patients | - Motion-preserving <br/> - Potential reduction in adjacent segment disease | - Long-term durability uncertain <br/> - Limited indications |

---

## Outcomes and effectiveness of surgical intervention

- **Short-term outcomes**: Surgery provides faster relief of radicular pain and neurological improvement compared to conservative management [^111Ab8Mt] [^117QPG74].
- **Long-term outcomes**: No significant difference in long-term outcomes between surgical and conservative management, although surgery offers faster relief [^117QPG74] [^111Y6tDc].
- **Patient satisfaction**: High patient satisfaction rates reported following surgical intervention, particularly in cases of persistent radicular pain [^115n4P6e].

---

## Risks and complications associated with surgical intervention

- **Common complications**: Infection, bleeding, nerve injury, and recurrence of symptoms.
- **Serious complications**: Permanent neurological impairment, paralysis, and death (rare) [^notfound].
- **Complication rates**: Vary by procedure and patient factors, with overall complication rates ranging from 4% to 10% [^notfound].

---

## Conservative management options

Conservative management includes **physical therapy** with exercises to improve neck strength, flexibility, and posture [^113wmeL6] [^115DZLNq], along with **medications** such as NSAIDs, analgesics, and muscle relaxants. Epidural steroid injections provide short-term relief of radicular pain [^115RPb2V] [^111Y6tDc].

---

## Factors influencing surgical decision-making

- **Patient factors**: Age, occupation, lifestyle, and patient preferences.
- **Clinical factors**: Severity of neurological deficits, duration of symptoms, and response to conservative management.
- **Imaging findings**: Degree of nerve root compression and specific anatomical considerations [^114ZfMbX].

---

Surgery for radicular neck pain is indicated for **progressive or severe neurological deficits** and for **persistent radicular pain** despite conservative therapy. Early surgery prevents permanent nerve damage, while delayed surgery is appropriate for persistent pain without neurological progression. ACDF, posterior foraminotomy, and cervical disc arthroplasty are effective options with similar long-term outcomes [^115n4P6e] [^113BNdEk].

### Cervical radiculopathy: is a prosthesis preferred over fusion surgery? A systematic review [^113BNdEk]. European Spine Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Meta-analyses on the comparison between fusion and prosthesis in the treatment of cervical radiculopathy mainly analyse studies including mixed patient populations: patients with radiculopathy with and without myelopathy. The outcome for patients with myelopathy is different compared to those without. Furthermore, apart from decompression of the spinal cord, restriction of motion is one of the cornerstones of the surgical treatment of spondylotic myelopathy. From this point of view, the results for arthroplasty might be suboptimal for this category of patients. Comparing clinical outcome in patients exclusively suffering from radiculopathy is therefore a more valid method to compare the true clinical effect of the prosthesis to that of fusion surgery.

Aim

The objective of this study was to compare clinical outcome of cervical arthroplasty (ACDA) to the clinical outcome of fusion (ACDF) after anterior cervical discectomy in patients exclusively suffering from radiculopathy, and to evaluate differences with mixed patient populations.

Methods

A literature search was completed in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, COCHRANE, CENTRAL and CINAHL using a sensitive search strategy. Studies were selected by predefined selection criteria (i.a.) patients exclusively suffering from cervical radiculopathy), and risk of bias was assessed using a validated Cochrane Checklist adjusted for this purpose. An additional overview of results was added from articles considering a mix of patients suffering from myelopathy with or without radiculopathy.

Results

Eight studies were included that exclusively compared intervertebral devices in radiculopathy patients. Additionally, 29 articles concerning patients with myelopathy with or without radiculopathy were studied in a separate results table. All articles showed intermediate to high risk of bias. There was neither a difference in decrease in mean NDI score between the prosthesis (20.6 points) and the fusion (20.3 points) group, nor was there a clinically important difference in neck pain (VAS). Comparing these data to the mixed population data demonstrated comparable mean values, except for the 2-year follow-up NDI values in the prosthesis group: mixed group patients that received a prosthesis reported a mean NDI score of 15.6, indicating better clinical outcome than the radiculopathy patients that received a prosthesis though not reaching clinical importance.

Conclusions

ACDF and ACDA are comparably effective in treating cervical radiculopathy due to a herniated disc in radiculopathy patients. Comparing the 8 radiculopathy with the 29 mixed population studies demonstrated that no clinically relevant differences were present in clinical outcome between the two types of patients.

### An update of comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for interventional techniques in chronic spinal pain. part II: guidance and recommendations [^114xx5ef]. Pain Physician (2013). Medium credibility.

Cervical radicular pain versus somatic referred pain — distinguishing features are organized by causes, symptom quality, modification with movement, radiation, and signs. Somatic pain causes include facet joint pain, myofascial syndrome, and discogenic pain, whereas radicular pain is associated with disc herniation, annular tear, and spinal stenosis. Somatic symptom quality is described as deep, aching, poorly localized, neck worse than arm, no paresthesia, covers a wide area, and no radicular or shooting pain; in contrast, radicular symptom quality is sharp, shooting, well localized, arm worse than neck, paresthesia are very reliable, well defined area, and radicular distribution. Somatic pain is worse with extension, better with flexion, and has no radicular pattern, while radicular pain is worse with flexion, better with extension, with a radicular pattern. Radiation for somatic pain includes neck to head, shoulder blades, upper back, with radiation below elbow — unusual, no radicular; radicular pain follows nerve root distribution with radiation below elbow common and radicular and shooting pain. For signs, somatic pain shows sensory alterations uncommon, motor changes of only subjective weakness with atrophy is rare, and reflex changes none, whereas radicular pain shows sensory alterations probable, motor changes with objective weakness and atrophy may be present, and reflex changes commonly expressed but seen occasionally.

It is now well recognized that the natural course of cervical radiculopathy is generally favorable. Comprehensive, aggressive, nonsurgical management often is successful with respect to functional outcomes, pain reduction, and patient satisfaction. Surgery is avoidable for most patients. The focus of this article is a review of the most recent and classic literature related to the nonsurgical management of cervical radiculopathies.

### National clinical guidelines for non-surgical treatment of patients with recent onset neck pain or cervical radiculopathy [^113wmeL6]. European Spine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

To summarise recommendations about 21 selected non-surgical interventions for recent onset (< 12 weeks) non-specific neck pain (NP) and cervical radiculopathy (CR) based on two guidelines from the Danish Health Authority.

Methods

Two multidisciplinary working groups formulated recommendations based on the GRADE approach.

Results

Twelve recommendations were based on evidence and nine on consensus. Management should include information about prognosis, warning signs, and advise to remain active. For treatment, guidelines suggest different types of supervised exercise and manual therapy; combinations of exercise and manual therapy before medicine for NP; acupuncture for NP but not CR; traction for CR; and oral NSAID (oral or topical) and Tramadol after careful consideration for NP and CR.

Conclusion

Recommendations are based on low-quality evidence or on consensus, but are well aligned with recommendations from guidelines from North America. The working groups recommend intensifying research relating to all aspects of management of NP and CR.

### Surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115VGdQj]. Spine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Design

Meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Objective

To determine whether anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), cervical disc replacement (CDR), or minimally invasive posterior cervical foraminotomy (MI-PCF) provides the best outcomes for patients with symptomatic single-level, single-side, and cervical radiculopathy.

Summary Of Background Data

The surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy is still controversial. ACDF has been widely used as a "gold standard". CDR has evolved and become a motion-preserving alternative with a potentially lower incidence of adjacent segment disease. However, both techniques require anterior neck dissection that carries a potential for serious morbidity. MI-PCF is a motion-preserving technique that can be performed with minimal invasiveness but has not gained universal acceptance.

Methods

Electronic database search for RCTs comparing the efficacy and effectiveness of ACDF, CDR, and MI-PCF was performed. Meta-analysis was done for secondary surgical procedures and adverse events.

Results

A total of 358 studies were retrieved, of which four RCT reports met the inclusion criteria for this study. Three studies present clinical data comparing ACDF and CDR, and one study presents data comparing ACDF and MI-PCF. Available data from the RCTs analyzed concluded that ACDF, CDR, and MI-PCF result in significant improvements in relevant symptoms, clinical, and functional outcomes in patients with single-level, single side cervical radiculopathy refractory to nonoperative treatment. CDR had the lowest percentage of secondary surgical procedures (P = 0.0178) whereas MICPF had the lowest percentage of adverse events (P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

All three techniques are effective in treating cervical radicular symptoms. MI-PCF has the lowest rate of adverse events whereas CDR has the lowest rate of secondary procedures. There is insufficient evidence to show which technique is the most effective and provides the longest-lasting symptom relief.

### Surgery for failed cervical spine reconstruction [^115yySLV]. Spine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Design

Review article.

Objective

To review the indications, operative strategy, and complications of revision cervical spine reconstruction.

Summary Of Background Data

With many surgeons expanding their indications for cervical spine surgery, the number of patients being treated operatively has increased. Unfortunately, the number of patients requiring revision procedures is also increasing, but very little literature exists reviewing changes in the indications or operative planning for revision reconstruction.

Methods

Narrative and review of the literature.

Results

In addition to the well-accepted indications for primary cervical spine surgery (radiculopathy, myelopathy, instability, and tumor), we have used the following indications for revision surgery: pseudarthrosis, adjacent segment degeneration, inadequate decompression, iatrogenic instability, and deformity. Our surgical goal for pseudarthrosis is obviously to obtain a fusion, which can usually be performed with an approach not done previously. Our surgical goals for instability and deformity are more complex, with a focus on decompression of any neurologic compression, correction of deformity, and stability.

Conclusion

Revision cervical spine reconstruction is safe and effective if performed for the appropriate indications and with proper planning.

### Posterior cervical foraminotomy compared with anterior cervical discectomy with fusion for cervical radiculopathy: two-year results of the FACET randomized noninferiority study [^1166Lh3E]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Posterior cervical foraminotomy (posterior surgery) is a valid alternative to anterior discectomy with fusion (anterior surgery) as a surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy, but the quality of evidence has been limited. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcome of these treatments after 2 years of follow-up. We hypothesized that posterior surgery would be noninferior to anterior surgery.

Methods

This multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial assessed patients with single-level cervical radiculopathy in 9 Dutch hospitals with a follow-up duration of 2 years. The primary outcomes measured reduction of cervical radicular pain and were the success ratio based on the Odom criteria, and arm pain and decrease in arm pain, evaluated with the visual analog scale, with a 10% noninferiority margin, which represents the maximum acceptable difference between the new treatment (posterior surgery) and the standard treatment (anterior surgery), beyond which the new treatment would be considered clinically unacceptable. The secondary outcomes were neck pain, Neck Disability Index, Work Ability Index, quality of life, complications (including reoperations), and treatment satisfaction. Generalized linear mixed effects modeling was used for analyses. The study was registered at the Overview of Medical Research in the Netherlands (OMON), formerly the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR5536).

Results

From January 2016 to May 2020, 265 patients were randomized (132 to the posterior surgery group and 133 to the anterior surgery group). Among these, 25 did not have the allocated intervention; 11 of these 25 patients had symptom improvement, and the rest of the patients did not have the intervention due to various reasons. At the 2-year follow-up, of 243 patients, primary outcome data were available for 236 patients (97%). Predicted proportions of a successful outcome were 0.81 after posterior surgery and 0.74 after anterior surgery (difference in rate, -0.06 [1-sided 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.02]), indicating the noninferiority of posterior surgery. The between-group difference in arm pain was -2.7 (1-sided 95% CI, 7.4) and the between-group difference in the decrease in arm pain was 1.5 (1-sided 95% CI, 8.2), both confirming the noninferiority of posterior surgery. The secondary outcomes demonstrated small between-group differences. Serious surgery-related adverse events occurred in 9 patients (8%) who underwent posterior surgery, including 9 reoperations, and 11 patients (9%) who underwent anterior surgery, including 7 reoperations (difference in reoperation rate, -0.02 [2-sided 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.05]).

Conclusions

This trial demonstrated that, after a 2-year follow-up, posterior surgery was noninferior to anterior surgery with regard to the success rate and arm pain reduction in patients with cervical radiculopathy.

### Noninferiority of posterior cervical foraminotomy vs anterior cervical discectomy with fusion for procedural success and reduction in arm pain among patients with cervical radiculopathy at 1 year: the FACET randomized clinical trial [^1151vGpt]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Importance

The choice between posterior cervical foraminotomy (posterior surgery) and anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (anterior surgery) for cervical foraminal radiculopathy remains controversial.

Objective

To investigate the noninferiority of posterior vs anterior surgery in patients with cervical foraminal radiculopathy with regard to clinical outcomes after 1 year.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multicenter investigator-blinded noninferiority randomized clinical trial was conducted from January 2016 to May 2020 with a total follow-up of 2 years. Patients were included from 9 hospitals in the Netherlands. Of 389 adult patients with 1-sided single-level cervical foraminal radiculopathy screened for eligibility, 124 declined to participate or did not meet eligibility criteria. Patients with pure axial neck pain without radicular pain were not eligible. Of 265 patients randomized (132 to posterior and 133 to anterior), 15 were lost to follow-up and 228 were included in the 1-year analysis (110 in posterior and 118 in anterior).

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to posterior foraminotomy or anterior cervical discectomy with fusion.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcomes were proportion of success using Odom criteria and decrease in arm pain using a visual analogue scale from 0 to 100 with a noninferiority margin of 10% (assuming advantages with posterior surgery over anterior surgery that would justify a tolerable loss of efficacy of 10%). Secondary outcomes were neck pain, disability, quality of life, work status, treatment satisfaction, reoperations, and complications. Analyses were performed with 2-proportion z tests at 1-sided .05 significance levels with Bonferroni corrections.

Results

Among 265 included patients, the mean (SD) age was 51.2 (8.3) years; 133 patients (50%) were female and 132 (50%) were male. Patients were randomly assigned to posterior (132) or anterior (133) surgery. The proportion of success was 0.88 (86 of 98) in the posterior surgery group and 0.76 (81 of 106) in the anterior surgery group (difference, -0.11 percentage points; 1-sided 95% CI, -0.01) and the between-group difference in arm pain was -2.8 (1-sided 95% CI, -9.4) at 1-year follow-up, indicating noninferiority of posterior surgery. Decrease in arm pain had a between-group difference of 3.4 (1-sided 95% CI, 11.8), crossing the noninferiority margin with 1.8 points. All secondary outcomes had 2-sided 95% CIs clustered around 0 with small between-group differences.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this randomized clinical trial, posterior surgery was noninferior to anterior surgery for patients with cervical radiculopathy regarding success rate and arm pain at 1 year. Decrease in arm pain and secondary outcomes had small between-group differences. These results may be used to enhance shared decision-making.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaCervical neck pain or cervical radiculopathy [^114ZfMbX]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Nontraumatic neck pain is a leading cause of disability, with nearly 50% of individuals experiencing ongoing or recurrent symptoms. Radiographs are appropriate as initial imaging for cervical or neck pain in the absence of "red flag" symptoms or if there are unchanging chronic symptoms; however, spondylotic changes are commonly identified and may result in both false-positive and false-negative findings. Noncontrast CT can be complementary to radiographs for evaluation of new or changing symptoms in the setting of prior cervical spine surgery or in the assessment of extent of ossification in the posterior longitudinal ligament. Noncontrast MRI is usually appropriate for assessment of new or increasing radiculopathy due to improved nerve root definition. MRI without and with contrast is usually appropriate in patients with new or increasing cervical or neck pain or radiculopathy in the setting of suspected infection or known malignancy. Imaging may be appropriate; however, it is not always indicated for evaluation of cervicogenic headache without neurologic deficit. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Cervical interlaminar epidural injections — while cervical epidural injections may be administered either by interlaminar or transforaminal approach, only the interlaminar approach has been studied with appropriate indications and effectiveness, and cervical transforaminal epidural injections are associated with high risk; common indications for cervical interlaminar epidurals include chronic neck and/or upper extremity pain of at least 3 months duration which has failed to respond or poorly responded to noninterventional and nonsurgical conservative management resulting from disc herniation/cervical radiculitis (evidence – good), cervical spinal stenosis (evidence – fair), post cervical surgery syndrome (evidence – fair), and axial or discogenic pain without facet joint pathology or disc herniation (evidence – fair), as well as intermittent or continuous pain causing functional disability.

### Surgical management of cervical and lumbosacral radiculopathies: indications and outcomes [^117MRDea]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

The most common indication for the surgical management of compressive cervical and lumbar radiculopathies is a herniated disc in a patient who has not improved with conservative management. Even though a herniated disk is a common condition, it is paramount that the examining physician considers an extensive differential diagnosis when evaluating radiculopathies, especially in patients with a history of cancer, multiple medical illnesses, secondary gain, or advanced age. This consideration has become even more important as imaging studies have improved, because previously undetected degenerative changes are now clearly visualized on MRI and CT scans. These improved studies, however, do not replace a thorough history and physical examination, because a patient's signs and symptoms may not correlate with the radiographic findings. The authors have presented a series of surgical techniques used to manage cervical and lumbar discectomies to the most recent "minimally invasive" percutaneous techniques. Much debate and controversy surround these more recent techniques. There is no controversy, however, in stating that achieving good outcomes, regardless of technique, is predicated on proper patient selection. Because patient selection is the most important predictor of outcome and because serious complications have been reported with "minimally invasive" percutaneous procedures, the authors continue to advocate the proven traditional surgical approaches until prospective, randomized studies demonstrate a clear benefit to using alternative techniques.

### Indications for surgical fusion of the cervical and lumbar motion segment [^1127p9tw]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

A literature review and the authors' clinical experience for the indication of fusion in the degenerative lumbar and cervical spine is provided.

Objective

To establish absolute and relative criteria for the indication for fusion in the degenerative cervical and lumbar spine.

Summary Of Background Data

Fusion in the cervical and lumbar degenerative spine is indicated under certain strict criteria. However, fusion in circumstances not meeting these criteria is controversial.

Method

A review of the literature and the authors' experience concerning indication and criteria of fusion in degenerative, lumbar, and cervical spine is provided.

Results

Fusion for the unstable spine related to trauma, infection, and tumors is relatively accepted. However, indications for fusion for degenerative, cervical, and lumbar spine are more controversial.

Conclusion

Lumbar and cervical fusion in the degenerative spine is frequently performed. Certain criteria have been established when a fusion should be considered. However, even these are not universally accepted. Strict prospective studies are needed to determine when a fusion of the degenerative, cervical, and lumbar spine is indicated. Patients with severe radicular pain may be considered for surgery after a comprehensive trial of conservative management. Fusion is usually necessary after a cervical discectomy, especially when spondylosis or osteophytic compression is present. Lumbar fusion is rarely indicated for routine discectomy. In patients with mechanical back or neck pain, surgery should only be considered after conservative measures have been exhausted and a radiographic abnormality is present at the symptomatic level, perhaps with pain concordant with discographic findings. Careful patient selection is the key to obtaining favorable surgical outcomes. In many cases, the goal may be a return to functionality rather than achieving a completely asymptomatic state.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^116cup2X]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — research recommendations for cervical radiculopathy: Recommendation #1 states that continued long term follow-up of patients in previously reported randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is necessary to validate purported advantages of TDA compared with ACDF, with focus on validated clinical outcomes, revision surgery, and adjacent segment disease, and subgroup analysis should include soft versus hard disc and foraminal versus paracentral pathology. Recommendation #2 states that additional independent, masked, prospective RCTs comparing ACDF to TDA would add substantial unbiased validation to the investigational device exemption (IDE) studies.

### Treatment of neck pain: injections and surgical interventions: results of the bone and joint decade 2000–2010 task force on neck pain and its associated disorders [^111Y6tDc]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Best evidence synthesis.

Objective

To identify, critically appraise, and synthesize literature from 1980 through 2006 on surgical interventions for neck pain alone or with radicular pain in the absence of serious pathologic disease.

Summary Of Background Data

There have been no comprehensive systematic literature or evidence-based reviews published on this topic.

Methods

We systematically searched Medline for literature published from 1980 to 2006 on percutaneous and open surgical interventions for neck pain. Publications on the topic were also solicited from experts in the field. Consensus decisions were made about the scientific merit of each article; those judged to have adequate internal validity were included in our Best Evidence Synthesis.

Results

Of the 31,878 articles screened, 1203 studies were relevant to the Neck Pain Task Force mandate and of these, 31 regarding treatment by surgery or injections were accepted as scientifically admissible. Radiofrequency neurotomy, cervical facet injections, cervical fusion and cervical arthroplasty for neck pain without radiculopathy are not supported by current evidence. We found there is support for short-term symptomatic improvement of radicular symptoms with epidural corticosteroids. It is not clear from the evidence that long-term outcomes are improved with the surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy compared to nonoperative measures. However, relatively rapid and substantial symptomatic relief after surgical treatment seems to be reliably achieved. It is not evident that one open surgical technique is clearly superior to others for radiculopathy. Cervical foramenal or epidural injections are associated with relatively frequent minor adverse events (5%-20%); however, serious adverse events are very uncommon (< 1%). After open surgical procedures on the cervical spine, potentially serious acute complications are seen in approximately 4% of patients.

Conclusion

Surgical treatment and limited injection procedures for cervical radicular symptoms may be reasonably considered in patients with severe impairments. Percutaneous and open surgical treatment for neck pain alone, without radicular symptoms or clear serious pathology, seems to lack scientific support.

### Do we really apply evidence-based-recommendations to spine surgery? Results of an international survey [^114jTUZS]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Various clinical scenarios

Table 3 summarizes the responses to the applicability of various medical approaches when making decisions about spinal pathologies. The rate of those who always or frequently refer to guidelines or scoring systems in their decisions was (94.3%). When no guideline or scoring system is used, the most commonly referred methods are "Literature search" and "Personal experience".

In patients with severe back pain, the most preferred initial approach chosen by participants was "Obtain MRI". In addition, there is a common belief that the spinal surgical approach and the addition of arthrodesis can improve clinical outcomes. There are some different opinions about whether to treat patients with low bone mineral density (BMD T < -2.5) before spine surgery, but there seems to be a trend to treat sometimes or always. There are also various opinions on prescribing high-dose methylprednisolone to patients with acute spinal cord injury. However, the rate of those who always or sometimes apply this treatment is relatively high. Most respondents stated that ACDF alone is sufficient in correcting sagittal alignment and that anterior discectomy has better outcomes than posterior when treating cervical radiculopathy. A majority of participants (68.3%) recommended physical and medical therapy to a patient with disc herniation in the absence of leg pain, whereas only 16% opted for no treatment.

Group comparisons

Gender

Since only a few women (12%) completed the survey, our authors avoided making conclusions about gender-wise comparisons from this data. The rate of those who know and understand EBM and use it in practice is relatively high in both men (67.0%) and women (72.2%). In the question about what is the best definition of EBM, the majority of both men (71.6%) and women (66.7%) participants gave the answer "combining personal clinical experience with the best evidence derived from medical, scientific research". In the case of decision-making in patients where no guideline or scoring system is used, the highest percentage relies on literature searches, with 54.5% for men and 58.3% for women. However, we observed a striking statistical difference concerning the opinions on the surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy is the higher agreement of women with the statement "The Neck Disability Index, SF-36, SF-12, and VAS are recommended outcome measures" compared to men (41.7% versus 20.8%, p = 0.013).

### Surgical interventions for cervical radiculopathy without myelopathy: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113hSHu8]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The effectiveness of surgical interventions for cervical degenerative disorders has been investigated in multiple systematic reviews. Differences in study population (e.g., patients with myelopathy and/or radiculopathy) were often neglected. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of surgical interventions for patients with symptoms of cervical radiculopathy without myelopathy by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) to identify RCTs that investigated the effectiveness of surgical interventions using an anterior or posterior approach compared with other interventions for patients with pure cervical radiculopathy. Outcomes were success rates (Odom criteria, similar rating scales, or percentage of patients who improved), complication and reoperation rates, work status, disability (Neck Disability Index), and pain (arm and neck). The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the likelihood of the risk of bias. A random-effects model was used. Heterogeneity among study results (I2 ≥ 50% or p < 0.05) was explored by conducting subgroup analyses. Funnel plots were used to assess the likelihood of publication bias.

Results

A total of 21 RCTs were included, comprising 1,567 patients. For all outcomes, among all surgical techniques, only 1 pooled estimate showed a significant effect on success rate, which was in favor of anterior cervical discectomy with fusion compared with anterior cervical discectomy without an intervertebral spacer (p = 0.02; risk ratio [RR] = 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77 to 0.98). Complication rates were higher when autologous bone graft from the iliac crest was used as an intervertebral spacer (p < 0.01; RR = 3.40; 95% CI = 1.56 to 7.43), related to donor-site morbidity.

Conclusions

This meta-analysis demonstrated consistent results regarding clinical outcome for pure cervical radiculopathy among all studied interventions. Complication and reoperation rates were also similar, with the exception of higher complication rates in patients in whom autologous bone grafts were used. On the basis of clinical outcome and safety, there is no superior surgical intervention for pure cervical radiculopathy.

Initially, there was no statistically significant difference in pain intensity between the surgically and conservatively treated groups, and Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) scheduled for surgery had higher sickness impact in the overall index; author conclusions state that operated patients demonstrated an improvement in pain (VAS) and in SIP, as well as at the clinical examination, although it was only partially maintained.

### Clinical outcomes after surgery for cervical radiculopathy performed in public and private hospitals: a nationwide relative effectiveness study [^116xpj8n]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Degenerative disorders of the spine are among the most common causes of lost disability-adjusted life years throughout the world, and the health-related costs associated with these conditions have been increasing over the past few decades. Degenerative changes in the cervical spine (spondylosis) increase with age and may be associated with disc herniation, hypertrophy of ligaments and facet joints, and may give rise to symptoms of nerve root compression, termed degenerative cervical radiculopathy. Patients with this condition often present with radicular neck and arm pain, numbness, or muscle weakness. Surgery may be indicated in selected patients.

Norway has a government-funded healthcare system with universal cover. Most specialized health services are provided in the public sector. Many public hospitals, however, have limited capacity and long waiting times, and this has paved the way for supplementary private providers of cervical spinal surgery. Most patients operated in private hospitals have health insurance paid for either by employers or by themselves.

How to balance the provision of healthcare in this area between the public and the private sectors has been debated, due to the rising costs and increased use of spinal surgery. An argument for an increase in private providers is that this would allow a general increase in the capacity and efficiency of treatment in the health services. There are, however, concerns that inequalities in access to health services and overuse could occur as a consequence of privatization. Information about the efficiency and clinical effectiveness of the treatment in these two settings can help policy-makers make judgements about performance and allow appropriate prioritization and allocation of resources. Such information is limited in the field of cervical spinal surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate whether clinical outcomes were equivalent among patients who underwent surgery for degenerative cervical radiculopathy in public and private hospitals in Norway.

### Cochrane review on the role of surgery in cervical spondylotic radiculomyelopathy [^1169LWyR]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

This study involved a search of MEDLINE (1966 to 2000), EMBASE (1980 to 2000), and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. The authors of the identified randomized controlled trials were contacted to detect any additional published or unpublished data. The trials selected for this study included all the truly unconfounded or quasi-randomized controlled investigations allocating patients with cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy to 1) "best medical management" or "decompressive surgery (with or without some form of fusion) plus best medical management", or 2) "early decompressive surgery" or "delayed decompressive surgery". Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality, and extracted the data.

Objectives

To determine whether surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy is associated with improved outcome, as compared with conservative management, and whether the timing of surgery (immediate or delayed because of persistence or progression of relevant symptoms and signs) has an impact on outcome.

Summary Of Background Data

Cervical spondylosis causes pain and disability by compressing the spinal cord or roots. Surgery to relieve the compression may reduce the pain and disability. However, it is associated with a small but definite risk. This study sought to assess the balance of risk and benefit from surgery.

Methods

Two trials involving a total of 130 patients were included. One trial with 81 patients compared surgical decompression with either physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in patients with cervical radiculopathy.

Results

The short-term effects of surgery, in terms of pain, weakness, or sensory loss were superior. However, at 1 year no significant differences between the groups were observed. Another trial with 49 patients compared the effects of surgery with those of conservative treatment in patients who had a mild functional deficit associated with cervical myelopathy. No significant differences were observed between the groups up to 2 years after treatment.

Conclusions

The data from the reviewed trials were inadequate to provide reliable conclusions on the balance of risk and benefit from cervical spine surgery for spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy.

### Using the modified Delphi method to establish a new Chinese clinical consensus of the treatments for cervical radiculopathy [^113wtmxN]. European Spine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Although cervical radiculopathy is very common, there is no standard treatment for this condition, with little high-level evidence available to guide the treatment choice. Thus, this study aimed to review the current data on the management of cervical radiculopathy; and, further, to establish a new Chinese clinical consensus of the treatments for cervical radiculopathy using the Delphi method.

Methods

First, a systematic review of the previously established treatment guidelines and of articles related to cervical radiculopathy was conducted to establish a protocol for the clinical consensus of the treatment for cervical radiculopathy. Second, from February 2012 to June 2014, we performed a modified Delphi survey in which the current professional opinions from 30 experienced experts, representing almost all of the Chinese provinces, were gathered. Three rounds were performed, and consensus was defined as ≥ 70% agreement.

Results

Consensus of the treatments for cervical radiculopathy was reached on seven aspects, including the proportion of patients requiring only non-surgical therapies; the effectiveness of neck immobilization, physiotherapy, pharmacologic treatment; surgical indications; contraindications; surgery.

Conclusions

The modified Delphi study conducted herein reached a consensus concerning several treatment issues for cervical radiculopathy. In the absence of high-level evidence, at present, these expert opinion findings will help guide health care providers to define the appropriate treatment in their regions. Items with no consensus provide excellent areas for future research.

### Posterior cervical foraminotomy compared with anterior cervical discectomy with fusion for cervical radiculopathy: two-year results of the FACET randomized noninferiority study [^117GkRAw]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2024). Medium credibility.

Background:

Posterior cervical foraminotomy (posterior surgery) is a valid alternative to anterior discectomy with fusion (anterior surgery) as a surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy, but the quality of evidence has been limited. The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical outcome of these treatments after 2 years of follow-up. We hypothesized that posterior surgery would be noninferior to anterior surgery.

Methods:

This multicenter, randomized, noninferiority trial assessed patients with single-level cervical radiculopathy in 9 Dutch hospitals with a follow-up duration of 2 years. The primary outcomes measured reduction of cervical radicular pain and were the success ratio based on the Odom criteria, and arm pain and decrease in arm pain, evaluated with the visual analog scale, with a 10% noninferiority margin, which represents the maximum acceptable difference between the new treatment (posterior surgery) and the standard treatment (anterior surgery), beyond which the new treatment would be considered clinically unacceptable. The secondary outcomes were neck pain, Neck Disability Index, Work Ability Index, quality of life, complications (including reoperations), and treatment satisfaction. Generalized linear mixed effects modeling was used for analyses. The study was registered at the Overview of Medical Research in the Netherlands (OMON), formerly the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR5536).

Results:

From January 2016 to May 2020, 265 patients were randomized (132 to the posterior surgery group and 133 to the anterior surgery group). Among these, 25 did not have the allocated intervention; 11 of these 25 patients had symptom improvement, and the rest of the patients did not have the intervention due to various reasons. At the 2-year follow-up, of 243 patients, primary outcome data were available for 236 patients (97%). Predicted proportions of a successful outcome were 0.81 after posterior surgery and 0.74 after anterior surgery (difference in rate, −0.06 [1-sided 95% confidence interval (CI), −0.02]), indicating the noninferiority of posterior surgery. The between-group difference in arm pain was −2.7 (1-sided 95% CI, 7.4) and the between-group difference in the decrease in arm pain was 1.5 (1-sided 95% CI, 8.2), both confirming the noninferiority of posterior surgery. The secondary outcomes demonstrated small between-group differences. Serious surgery-related adverse events occurred in 9 patients (8%) who underwent posterior surgery, including 9 reoperations, and 11 patients (9%) who underwent anterior surgery, including 7 reoperations (difference in reoperation rate, −0.02 [2-sided 95% CI, −0.09 to 0.05]).

Conclusions:

This trial demonstrated that, after a 2-year follow-up, posterior surgery was noninferior to anterior surgery with regard to the success rate and arm pain reduction in patients with cervical radiculopathy.

Cervical radiculopathy — single-level versus multi-level surgical decompression long term results lack comparative evidence, as a systematic review of the literature yielded no studies to adequately address this comparison. After this review, most patients with true radiculopathy suffer from one level and occasionally two level disease, and the incidence of multilevel disease without the additional presence of myelopathy is rare, leading to the conclusion that there is likely little to gain and a low probability of generating meaningful data to answer this question. For research prioritization, the work group would not recommend further pursuit of this question.

Cervical epidural injections — use, approaches, safety, and evidence: Cervical epidural injections have been used to treat radicular pain from herniated discs, spinal stenosis, chemical discs, chronic neck pain with or without radiculitis secondary to post cervical surgery syndrome, and chronic neck pain of discogenic origin, and are performed either by interlaminar or transforaminal approaches. Cervical epidural steroid injections, specifically utilizing the transforaminal approach, have been associated with devastating complications, though significant complications also have been reported with interlaminar epidurals with spinal cord damage and quadriparesis; complications of fluoroscopically guided interlaminar cervical epidural injections have been reported to be much less frequent and major complications are rare. The evidence for cervical interlaminar epidural injections has been a subject of debate and at best has had only moderate success in managing cervical radiculopathy, while there was no evidence available in the management of axial or discogenic neck pain, spinal stenosis, or post surgery syndrome at the time of these evaluations. A systematic review by Diwan et al included 7 randomized trials showing good evidence for cervical disc herniation and fair evidence for axial or discogenic pain, spinal stenosis, and post cervical surgery syndrome, and the authors identified 9 new studies published since that review.

Anterior cervical approaches for radiculopathy and spondylosis — comparative evidence: Anterior surgery "improves radicular symptoms more rapidly than conservative modalities of treatment with possible improvements in clinical function", yet "there is still no Class I or II evidence supporting the conclusion that surgery is superior in the long-term compared with nonoperative management". Evidence shows "there is no definite superiority of ACD, ACD with fusion or instrumentation, or corpectomy with plating". In "Level 1 disease", there is "Class II evidence that ACD and ACDF are equally effective in terms of long-term outcome", and "ACDF achieves a more rapid reduction in neck pain and radiculopathy, and reduces the risk of kyphosis". For "multiple level anterior decompressions, there is compelling evidence that ACDF is superior to ACD", and "the addition of plating improves pain compared with ACD alone and reduces the risk of pseudarthrosis, but no convincing evidence is available to suggest that the addition of instrumentation results in improvements in long-term outcome". Regarding fusion materials, there "appears to be equivalency regarding the use of harvested iliac crest bone, allograft, polyetheretherketone, and titanium in anterior fusion".

### Surgery versus conservative care for neck pain: a systematic review [^111fcHEr]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

General practitioners refer patients with continued neck pain that do not respond well to conservative care frequently to secondary care for further assessment. Are surgical interventions to the cervical spine effective when compared to conservative care for patients with neck pain?

Design

Systematic review.

Method

The search strategy outlined by the Cochrane Back Review Group (CBRG) was followed. The primary search was conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and PEDro up to June 2011. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of adults with neck pain, which evaluated at least one clinically relevant primary outcome measure (e.g. pain, functional status, recovery), were included. In addition, treatments had to include surgery and conservative care. Two authors independently assessed risk of bias using the criteria recommended by the CBRG and extracted the data. The quality of the evidence was rated using the GRADE method.

Results

Patients included had neck pain with or without radiculopathy or myelopathy. In total, three RCTs and six CCTs were identified comparing different surgical interventions with conservative care, of which one had a low risk of bias. Overall there is very low quality of evidence available on the effectiveness of surgery compared to conservative care in neck pain patients showing overall no differences.

Conclusion

Most studies on surgical techniques comparing these to conservative care showed a high risk of bias. The benefit of surgery over conservative care is not clearly demonstrated.

### Non-surgical interventional treatment of cervical and thoracic radiculopathies [^116a2evr]. Pain Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Cervical and thoracic radiculopathies are among the most common causes of neck pain. Outcome studies of conservative treatments have shown varying results and have not been well controlled or systematic. Although there has not yet been a non-surgical interventional procedure developed with the therapeutic efficacy of open surgery, conservative procedures can offer substantial benefits, are less invasive, and avoid surgical complications. While more invasive procedures may be appropriate when conservative treatment fails, prospective studies evaluating cervical and thoracic radiculopathy treatment options would help guide practitioners toward optimally cost-effective patient evaluation and care.

### Posterior cervical spine surgery for radiculopathy [^112FDevW]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

It is now common knowledge that cervical radiculopathy, frequently caused by disc herniation and/or degeneration, will often improve without surgical intervention. Only a small percentage of patients with the severity of symptoms necessitate surgical treatment. Surgery for radiculopathy is indicated for motor weakness, progressive neurological deficits, and progressive symptoms that do not improve with nonoperative treatment. Advantages and disadvantages exist for both ventral and dorsal approaches in the surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy. Indications and results for dorsal nerve root decompression are discussed, and a review of our preferred techniques, including use of minimally invasive technology, is presented.

### Surgical management of cervical degenerative disease: the evidence related to indications, impact, and outcome [^113wVG7Q]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Medium credibility.

AANS/CNS therapeutic effectiveness classification and recommendation levels define Class I as evidence provided by one or more well-designed randomized controlled clinical trials, including overview (meta-analyses) of such trials; Class II as evidence provided by well-designed observational studies with concurrent controls (e.g. case control and cohort studies); and Class III as evidence provided by expert opinion, case series, case reports and studies with historical controls. Level I comprises generally accepted principles for patient management, which reflect a high degree of clinical certainty (usually this requires class I evidence which directly addresses the clinical questions or overwhelming class II evidence when circumstances preclude randomized clinical trials); Level II comprises recommendations for patient management which reflect clinical certainty (usually this requires class II evidence or a strong consensus of class III evidence); and Level III comprises other strategies for patient management for which the clinical utility is uncertain (inconclusive or conflicting evidence or opinion).

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^112NsLfB]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

North American Spine Society (NASS) cervical radiculopathy guideline — scope and use — provides evidence-based recommendations to address key clinical questions for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders and outlines a reasonable evaluation and treatment options for adult patients. THIS GUIDELINE DOES NOT REPRESENT A "STANDARD OF CARE", nor is it intended as a fixed treatment protocol, and it states that there will be patients who will require less or more treatment than the average and that in atypical cases, treatment falling outside this guideline will sometimes be necessary. The guideline also notes it should not be seen as prescribing the type, frequency or duration of intervention, that treatment should be based on the individual patient's need and physician's professional judgment, that it should not be used as the sole reason for denial of treatment and services, and that it is not intended to expand or restrict a health care provider's scope of practice or to supersede applicable ethical standards or provisions of law.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® cervical pain or cervical radiculopathy: 2024 update [^111HBUxT]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cervical spine pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care as it ranks in the top 5 causes of global years lost to disability. The economic burden of cervical pain is also significant. Imaging is at the center of diagnosis of cervical pain and its causes. However, different symptoms and potential causes of cervical pain require different initial imaging to maximize the benefit of diagnostic usefulness of imaging. In this document we address different cervical pain variants with detailed assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of different modalities for addressing each specific variant. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Indications for anterior cervical decompression for the treatment of cervical degenerative radiculopathy [^111Ab8Mt]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Object

The objective of this systematic review was to use evidence-based medicine to identify the indications and utility of anterior cervical nerve root decompression.

Methods

The National Library of Medicine and Cochrane Database were queried using MeSH headings and key words relevant to surgical management of cervical radiculopathy. Abstracts were reviewed after which studies meeting inclusion criteria were selected. The guidelines group assembled an evidentiary table summarizing the quality of evidence (Classes I-III). Disagreements regarding the level of evidence were resolved through an expert consensus conference. The group formulated recommendations that contained the degree of strength based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines network. Validation was done through peer review by the Joint Guidelines Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

Results

Anterior nerve root decompression via anterior cervical discectomy (ACD) with or without fusion for radiculopathy is associated with rapid relief (3–4 months) of arm/neck pain, weakness, and/or sensory loss compared with physical therapy (PT) or cervical collar immobilization. Anterior cervical discectomy and ACD with fusion (ACDF) are associated with longer term (12 months) improvement in certain motor functions compared to PT. Other rapid gains observed after anterior decompression (diminished pain, improved sensation, and improved strength in certain muscle groups) are also maintained over the course of 12 months. However, comparable clinical improvements with PT or cervical immobilization therapy are also present in these clinical modalities (Class I). Conflicting evidence exists as to the efficacy of anterior cervical foraminotomy with reported success rates of 52–99% but recurrent symptoms as high as 30% (Class III).

Conclusions

Anterior cervical discectomy, ACDF, and anterior cervical foraminotomy may improve cervical radicular symptoms. With regard to ACD and ACDF compared to PT or cervical immobilization, more rapid relief (within 3–4 months) may be seen with ACD or ACDF with maintenance of gains over the course of 12 months (Class I). Anterior cervical foraminotomy is associated with improvement in clinical function but the quality of data are weaker (Class III), and there is a wide range of efficacy (52–99%).

### Long-term clinical results of percutaneous cervical nucleoplasty for cervical radicular pain: a retrospective cohort study [^113YQjzL]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Aside from pain and our self-perceived success with interventions, the COMI-neck also measured symptom-specific well-being, quality of life, social disability and work disability. When we compare the results of these outcome domains of the current study, with the outcomes reported in observational studies among patients undergoing anterior cervical spine surgery, we can see comparable decreases in pain scores and the COMI-summary score, showing an overall increase in the different COMI-domains.

Kim et al also looked at predictors for the success of PCN. In their retrospective study of 201 patients, factors such as unilateral radiculopathy and the use of a specific technique of PCN (curved-tip technique) were identified as predictors of success, while longer pain duration and concurrent spinal canal stenosis were identified as negative predictors. To be noted, the success rate of PCN was 66.7% in the study of Kim et al, though they used a more broader applied indication for PCN, their results appear to be in line with our study.

### Surgery for cervical radiculomyelopathy [^113s3dMz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Cervical spondylosis causes pain and disability by compressing the spinal cord or roots. Surgery to relieve the compression may reduce the pain and disability, but is associated with a small but definite risk. We sought to assess the balance of risk and benefit from surgery.

Objectives

To determine whether: 1) surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy is associated with improved outcome, compared with conservative management and 2) timing of surgery (immediate or delayed upon persistence/progression of relevant symptoms and signs) has an impact on outcome.

Search Strategy

We searched Medline (between 1966 and 1998), Embase (between 1980 and 1998) and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register. Authors of the identified randomised controlled trials were contacted to detect any additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

All unconfounded truly or quasi-randomised controlled trials allocating patients with cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy to 1) "best medical management" or "decompressive surgery (with or without some form of fusion) plus best medical management" 2) "early decompressive surgery" or "delayed decompressive surgery".

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data.

Main Results

Two trials involving a total of 130 patients were included. One trial with 81 patients compared surgical decompression with either physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in patients with cervical radiculopathy. The short-term effects of surgery, in terms of pain, weakness or sensory loss were superior, however, at one year no significant differences between groups were present. One trial with 49 patients compared the effects of surgery with those of conservative treatment in patients with mild functional deficit associated with cervical myelopathy. No significant differences were observed between groups, up to two years following treatment.

### Back pain in patients with degenerative spine disease and intradural spinal tumor: what to treat? when to treat? [^1144FWAf]. European Spine Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Back pain is common in industrialized countries and one of the most frequent causes of work incapacity. Successful treatment is, therefore, not only important for improving the symptoms and the quality of life of these patients but also for socioeconomic reasons. Back pain is frequently caused by degenerative spine disease. Intradural spinal tumors are rare with an annual incidence of 2–4/1,00,000 and are mostly associated with neurological deficits and radicular and nocturnal pain. Back pain is not commonly described as a concomitant symptom, such that in patients with both a tumor and degenerative spine disease, any back pain is typically attributed to the degeneration rather than the tumor.

Objective

The aim of the present retrospective investigation was to study and analyze the impact of microsurgery on back/neck pain in patients with intradural spinal tumor in the presence of degenerative spinal disease in adjacent spinal segments.

Methods

Fifty-eight consecutive patients underwent microsurgical, intradural tumor surgery using a standardized protocol assisted by multimodal intraoperative neuromonitoring. Clinical symptoms, complications and surgery characteristics were documented. Standardized questionnaires were used to measure outcome from the surgeon's and the patient's perspectives (Spine Tango Registry and Core Outcome Measures Index). Follow-up included clinical and neuroradiological examinations 6 weeks, 3 months and 1 year postoperatively.

Results

Back/neck pain as a leading symptom and coexisting degenerative spine disease was present in 27/58 (47%) of the tumor patients, and these comprised to group under study. Patients underwent tumor surgery only, without addressing the degenerative spinal disease. Remission rate after tumor removal was 85%. There were no major surgical complications. Back/neck pain as the leading symptom was eradicated in 67% of patients. There were 7% of patients who required further invasive therapy for their degenerative spinal disease.

Conclusions

Intradural spinal tumor surgery improves back/neck pain in patients with coexisting severe degenerative spinal disease. Intradural spinal tumors seem to be the only cause of back/neck pain more often than appreciated. In these patients suffering from both pathologies, there is a higher risk of surgical overtreatment than undertreatment. Therefore, elaborate clinical and radiological examinations should be performed preoperatively and the indication for stabilization/fusion should be discussed carefully in patients foreseen for first time intradural tumor surgery.

Authors' Conclusions

The available small randomised trials do not provide reliable evidence on the effects of surgery for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy. It is not clear whether the short-term risks of surgery are offset by any long-term benefits.

### Operative treatment of the patient with neck pain [^1144zgVv]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Most patients with axial neck pain and cervical radiculopathy can be managed conservatively. Surgical intervention for radiculopathy is considered only when conservative management has failed unless the neurologic deficits are very significant. In cases of myelopathy, surgery may be considered earlier, but if the myelopathy is mild, conservative treatment and close observation are still appropriate. For patients with axial neck pain, surgery is generally not considered except for rare cases caused by single- or two-level degenerative disk disease with severe and unrelenting pain. There are many surgical options for the patients with the degenerative cervical spine, but the indications are different. Surgical intervention involves a complete understanding of the disease process both from physical examination and from radiographic studies. If surgery is undertaken without appropriate clinical correlation, poor results often occur. Although the operative planning is the responsibility of the surgeon. the referring physician should also have some awareness of the basic principles behind the different surgeries.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^116RwjSp]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders — transforaminal epidural steroid injections have limited supporting evidence and a cautious use statement: A systematic review revealed limited high quality studies, and all evaluated studies were retrospective case series (Level IV). Level IV data indicate these injections may provide relief for 60% of patients, and about 25% with clear surgical indications may obtain at least short-term pain relief negating the need for surgery. Limited Level II evidence suggests that the addition of steroid to local anesthetic does not improve pain relief at three weeks post-injection. Studies qualifying as at least Level IV used fluoroscopic or CT guidance, and publications note risks including spinal cord injury and death that need to be considered. The work group was unable to make recommendations regarding the safety or efficacy of interlaminar epidural steroid injections. Recommendation: transforaminal epidural steroid injections using fluoroscopic or CT guidance may be considered when developing a medical/interventional treatment plan for patients with cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders, and due consideration should be given to the potential complications; grade of recommendation: C.

The stated objective was to report the results of surgical intervention in a series of patients with neck pain from C4 radiculopathy, with number of patients 12 (11 with cervical radiculopathy without myelopathy). Neck pain was exacerbated by flexion and extension in all patients and decreased sensation in the C4 dermatome was uniformly present; MRI was performed in all patients and CT scan in three patients prior to surgery. Excluding the myelopathic patient, four patients were treated with ACDF and seven patients were treated with PLF including 3/7 PSF, and follow-up data was obtain at 12–48 months. Work group conclusions list Potential level: IV and Downgraded level: IV, and state that neck pain with or without upper extremity clinical findings should include evaluation for a C4 radiculopathy and the examination should include C4 sensory testing.

### An algorithmic approach for clinical management of chronic spinal pain [^116VS9Pz]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Interventional pain management, and the interventional techniques which are an integral part of that specialty, are subject to widely varying definitions and practices. How interventional techniques are applied by various specialties is highly variable, even for the most common procedures and conditions. At the same time, many payors, publications, and guidelines are showing increasing interest in the performance and costs of interventional techniques. There is a lack of consensus among interventional pain management specialists with regards to how to diagnose and manage spinal pain and the type and frequency of spinal interventional techniques which should be utilized to treat spinal pain. Therefore, an algorithmic approach is proposed, providing a step-by-step procedure for managing chronic spinal pain patients based upon evidence-based guidelines. The algorithmic approach is developed based on the best available evidence regarding the epidemiology of various identifiable sources of chronic spinal pain. Such an approach to spinal pain includes an appropriate history, examination, and medical decision making in the management of low back pain, neck pain and thoracic pain. This algorithm also provides diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to clinical management utilizing case examples of cervical, lumbar, and thoracic spinal pain. An algorithm for investigating chronic low back pain without disc herniation commences with a clinical question, examination and imaging findings. If there is evidence of radiculitis, spinal stenosis, or other demonstrable causes resulting in radiculitis, one may proceed with diagnostic or therapeutic epidural injections. In the algorithmic approach, facet joints are entertained first in the algorithm because of their commonality as a source of chronic low back pain followed by sacroiliac joint blocks if indicated and provocation discography as the last step. Based on the literature, in the United States, in patients without disc herniation, lumbar facet joints account for 30% of the cases of chronic low back pain, sacroiliac joints account for less than 10% of these cases, and discogenic pain accounts for 25% of the patients. The management algorithm for lumbar spinal pain includes interventions for somatic pain and radicular pain with either facet joint interventions, sacroiliac joint interventions, or intradiscal therapy. For radicular pain, epidural injections, percutaneous adhesiolysis, percutaneous disc decompression, or spinal endoscopic adhesiolysis may be performed. For non-responsive, recalcitrant, neuropathic pain, implantable therapy may be entertained. In managing pain of cervical origin, if there is evidence of radiculitis, spinal stenosis, post-surgery syndrome, or other demonstrable causes resulting in radiculitis, an interventionalist may proceed with therapeutic epidural injections. An algorithmic approach for chronic neck pain without disc herniation or radiculitis commences with clinical question, physical and imaging findings, followed by diagnostic facet joint injections. Cervical provocation discography is rarely performed. Based on the literature available in the United States, cervical facet joints account for 40% to 50% of cases of chronic neck pain without disc herniation, while discogenic pain accounts for approximately 20% of the patients. The management algorithm includes either facet joint interventions or epidural injections with surgical referral for disc-related pain and rarely implantable therapy. In managing thoracic pain, a diagnostic and therapeutic algorithmic approach includes either facet joint interventions or epidural injections.

Cervical radiculopathy — ACD, ACDF, and posterior cervical foraminotomy randomized trial outcomes: A prospective randomized controlled trial in single level HNP with radiculopathy included 72 patients (22 foraminotomy, 25 ACD, 25 ACDF) with long-term follow-up by phone at 53 months, 56 months, and 69 months for the respective groups and about 40% loss to follow-up; return to work was 79% for foraminotomy, 92% for ACD and 81% for ACDF, and 100% of available patients were satisfied and would have the surgery again. This potential Level II study provides Level III evidence that for single level HNP causing cervical radiculopathy, outcomes for ACD are equivalent to ACDF, and the authors concluded that for single level HNP, all procedures are efficacious.

### Techniques for anterior cervical decompression for radiculopathy [^115YKpHP]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Spine (2009). Low credibility.

Object

The objective of this systematic review was to use evidence-based medicine to identify the best techniques for anterior cervical nerve root decompression.

Methods

The National Library of Medicine and Cochrane Database were queried using MeSH headings and keywords relevant to techniques for the surgical management of cervical radiculopathy. The guidelines group assembled an evidentiary table summarizing the quality of evidence (Classes I-III). The group formulated recommendations that contained the degree of strength based on the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines network. Validation was done through peer-review by the Joint Guidelines Committee of the American Association of Neurological Surgeons/Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

Results

Both anterior cervical discectomy (ACD) and anterior cervical discectomy with fusion (ACDF) are equivalent treatment strategies for 1-level disease with regard to functional outcome (Class II). Anterior cervical discectomy with fusion may achieve a more rapid reduction of neck and arm pain compared to ACD with a reduced risk of kyphosis, although functional outcomes may be similar. Anterior cervical discectomy with fusion is not a lasting means of increasing foraminal or disc height compared to ACD. Anterior cervical plating (ACDF with instrumentation) improves arm pain (but not other clinical parameters) better than ACDF in the treatment of 2-level disease (Class II). With respect to 1-level disease, plating may reduce the risk of pseudarthrosis and graft problems (Class III) but does not necessarily improve clinical outcome alone (Class II). Cervical arthroplasty is recommended as an alternative to ACDF in selected patients for control of neck and arm pain (Class II).

Conclusions

Anterior cervical discectomy, ACDF, and arthroplasty are effective techniques for addressing surgical cervical radiculopathy.

### Cost-effectiveness of posterior versus anterior surgery for cervical radiculopathy: results from a multicentre randomised non-inferiority trial (FACET) [^115niXht]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Cost-analyses in spine surgery are gaining popularity, although a great variety in design, reporting and outcomes exist. Also, the geographical distribution of studies varies substantially. As there are different financial healthcare systems and clinical practices between countries, results of studies may not be fully generalisable. Nevertheless, it is important to perform more economic evaluations in spine surgery in different geographical areas, to address the influence of regional practices and healthcare systems on the outcomes of cost evaluations. A guideline with recommendations for economic evaluations in spine surgery would aid generalisability.

In summary, posterior surgery was associated with lower costs compared to anterior surgery, and was likely to be cost-effective. As clinical outcomes were similar between groups, both approaches can be considered valid treatments for patients with cervical nerve root compression. We would like to advocate that all patients should be counselled for both approaches and a shared decision should be made with each individual patient.

With the criterion standard with controlled blocks, the evidence is good based on multiple high quality studies of diagnostic accuracy incorporating prevalence with or without false-positive rates. The evidence is limited or not available in all other categories.

### Altering physician referral practices is challenging, but not impossible: spine assessment clinic quality improvement study [^1173HpR1]. BMJ Open Quality (2025). High credibility.

When assessing GP's reason for referral and ability to recognise different surgical diagnoses, certain conditions were much more commonly referred and accurately identified. The conditions outlined in the referral guidelines as appropriate for referral to the spine clinic included radiculopathy, neurogenic claudication, myelopathy, osteomyelitis, fractures, cancer, spinal instability and non-urgent tumour.GPs have demonstrated proficiency in recognising spinal red flags such as progressive neurological deficit (ie, cauda equina) and fracture. This is supported by the relative absence (n = 2) of such conditions directed to the non-emergent spine assessment clinic. Rather, this study further demonstrates the challenge experienced by GPs in distinguishing patients who may be amenable to surgical intervention for non-urgent spinal conditions.

GP diagnoses were compared with clinic NPs under the assumption that the NPs, who are trained to evaluate spine patients on a daily basis, are better equipped to generate an accurate diagnosis. It was demonstrated that the greatest agreement in this study was observed for radiculopathy at 51%. It is not unexpected that radiculopathy was best identified since limb pain and nerve root compression, characteristic features of radiculopathy, are well described in literature outlining surgical spine conditions. In contrast, non-radicular surgical diagnoses were poorly identified by GPs, which can likely be attributed to literature focusing on dermatomal leg pain and paresthesia as the primary indication for surgical diagnosis. Finally, the NPs indicated that 21% of referrals appeared to be for isolated neck or back pain, a non-surgical condition that should typically be conservatively managed. Overall, these findings demonstrate a continued need to educate referring providers on how to recognise specific pathologies, such as neurogenic claudication, myelopathy and spinal instability.

### Surgery for cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy [^117QPG74]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cervical spondylosis causes pain and disability by compressing the spinal cord or roots. Surgery to relieve the compression may reduce the pain and disability, but is associated with a small but definite risk.

Objectives

To determine whether: 1) surgical treatment of cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy is associated with improved outcome, compared with conservative management and 2) timing of surgery (immediate or delayed pending persistence/progression of relevant symptoms and signs) has an impact on outcome.

Search Strategy

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE to 1998 for the original review. A revised search was run in CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 2), MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL (January 1998 to June 2008) to update the review. Authors of the identified randomised controlled trials were contacted for additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials allocating patients with cervical radiculopathy or myelopathy to 1) "medical management" or "decompressive surgery (with or without fusion) plus medical management" 2) "early decompressive surgery" or "delayed decompressive surgery".

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data.

Main Results

Two trials (N = 149) were included. In both trials, allocation concealment was inadequate and arrangements for blinding of outcome assessment were unclear. One trial (81 patients with cervical radiculopathy) found that surgical decompression was superior to physiotherapy or cervical collar immobilization in the short-term for pain, weakness or sensory loss; at one year, there were no significant differences between groups. One trial (68 patients with mild functional deficit associated with cervical myelopathy) found no significant differences between surgery and conservative treatment in three years following treatment. A substantial proportion of cases were lost to follow-up.

Authors' Conclusions

Both small trials had significant risks of bias and do not provide reliable evidence on the effects of surgery for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy. It is unclear whether the short-term risks of surgery are offset by long-term benefits. Further research is very likely to have an impact on the estimate of effect and our confidence in it. There is low quality evidence that surgery may provide pain relief faster than physiotherapy or hard collar immobilization in patients with cervical radiculopathy; but there is little or no difference in the long-term. There is very low quality evidence that patients with mild myelopathy feel subjectively better shortly after surgery, but there is little or no difference in the long-term.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^111maSbW]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Invasive clinical treatment recommendations overview — quality evidence indicates that patient outcomes are not adversely affected by delaying non-emergent surgery for weeks or a few months; in the absence of red flags, patients with radicular pain and other potential surgical conditions are treated with non-invasive treatments for typically at least 4 to 6 weeks. Patients with moderate to severe neurological deficits that are not improving or not trending to improvement at 4 to 6 weeks may benefit from earlier surgical intervention; those with progressive neurological deficit(s) are believed to have indications for immediate surgery, and those with severe deficits that do not rapidly improve are also candidates for earlier testing and surgery.

### Lack of uniform diagnostic criteria for cervical radiculopathy in conservative intervention studies: a systematic review [^117T9GvW]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Diagnostic imaging is used to confirm the presence of a clinically suspected CR. The diagnostic accuracy of imaging is thought to be limited, because asymptomatic radiological abnormalities are commonly seen with advanced imaging studies. This also holds true for plain X-ray studies that exhibit degenerative changes increasing with age unrelated to clinical signs and symptoms. Most often MRI was used, although data concerning the sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of CR for MRI are sparse and questionable. A more recent study on the interobserver reliability of MRI evaluation in patients with CR has shown it to be substantial for nerve root compression, with or without previous clinical information. In our study, only RCTs in a conservative treatment group were included, implying that we selected a group of patients often seen in primary health-care settings. We suppose that diagnostic imaging is much less often used in this setting, as the access to it is limited. This is supported by the North American spine surgeons' clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CR from degenerative disorders. They recommended that MRI was suggested only for the confirmation of correlative compressive lesions in cervical spine patients who failed a course of conservative therapy and who may be candidates for interventional or surgical treatment.

### Is neck pain treatable with surgery? [^117Jb2Co]. European Spine Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neck pain is one of the most common complaints in clinical practice and can be caused by a wide variety of conditions. While cervical spine surgery is a well-accepted option for radicular pain and myelopathy, surgery for isolated neck pain is controversial. The identification of the source of pain is challenging and subtle, and misdiagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a thorough literature review to discuss and compare different causes of neck pain. We then supplemented the literature with our senior author's expert analysis of treating cervical spine pathology.

Conclusions

This study provides an in-depth discussion of neck pain and its various presentations, as well as providing insight into treatment strategies and diagnostic pearls that may prevent mistreatment of cervical spine pathology.

### The global spine care initiative: a summary of guidelines on invasive interventions for the management of persistent and disabling spinal pain in low-and middle-income communities [^115oHuZg]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to synthesize recommendations on the use of common elective surgical and interventional procedures for individuals with persistent and disabling non-radicular/axial with or without myelopathy, radicular back pain, cervical myelopathy, symptomatic spinal stenosis, and fractures due to osteoporosis. This review was to inform a clinical care pathway on the patient presentations where surgical interventions could reasonably be considered.

Methods

We synthesized recommendations from six evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and one appropriate use criteria guidance for the surgical and interventional management of persistent and disabling spine pain.

Results

Lower priority surgery/conditions include fusion for lumbar/non-radicular neck pain and higher priority surgery/conditions include discectomy/decompressive surgery for cervical or lumbar radiculopathy, cervical myelopathy, and lumbar spinal stenosis. Epidural steroid injections are less expensive than most surgeries with fewer harms; however, benefits are small and short lived. Vertebroplasty should be considered over kyphoplasty as an option for patients with severe pain and disability due to osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture.

Conclusion

Elective surgery and interventional procedures could be limited in medically underserved areas and low- and middle-income countries due to a lack of resources and surgeons and thus surgical and interventional procedures should be prioritized within these settings. There are non-invasive alternatives that produce similar outcomes and are a recommended option where surgical procedures are not available.

AANS/CNS classification of evidence on prognosis and levels of recommendation defines Class I evidence and Level I recommendation when "All 5 technical criteria above are satisfied", Class II evidence and Level II recommendation when "Four of five technical criteria are satisfied", and Class III evidence and Level III recommendation as "Everything else". To evaluate prognosis studies, "five technical criteria are applied", assessing whether "a well-defined representative sample of patients" at a common point was assembled, whether "patient follow-up sufficiently long and complete", whether "objective outcome criteria" were applied in a "blinded" fashion, whether subgroup findings were adjusted for "important prognostic factors", and whether factors had "validation in an independent 'test set' group of patients". The guideline further notes that "the level of a recommendation made could be decreased, based on consensus input by the writing group, if there were methodological concerns", and states, "Additional information about the methods utilized in this systematic review can be found at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/guideline-development-methodology".

### Pain, coping, emotional state and physical function in patients with chronic radicular neck pain. A comparison between patients treated with surgery, physiotherapy or neck collar – a blinded, prospective randomized study [^113j989c]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe and explore the relationships between pain, emotional state and coping strategies in patients with chronic radicular neck pain before and after surgery or conservative treatments.

Methods

We randomize 81 conseutive patients with cervical radicular pain and nerve root compression, verified by MRI, to either surgical decompression with fusion or physiotherapy or neck collar. Emotional state was both measured with Mood Adjective Check List. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and with a Coping Strategies Questionnaire. Pain was measured with VAS and function with Disability Index Rating. Measurements were made before treatment, and follow ups after 3 and 12 months post treatment.

Results

We found generally a low emotional state with anxiety, depression and sleep-disturbances not only connected to pain. Pain improved faster in the surgery group but after one year no differences were seen. Surgery and physiotherapy improved function with heavy work compared to collar after 3 months. Many patients used active coping before treatment, but after treatment more passive coping strategies were found.

Conclusion

We recommend a multidisciplinary rehabilitation with cognitive behavioural therapy and psychological interventions.

Cervical radiculopathy — history and examination findings emphasize paresthesia distribution and specific provocative tests. Paresthesia is considered to be more valid than the distribution of pain, and the distribution of paresthesia in the hand is also considered more valid than the distribution of paresthesia in the forearm. Paresthesia, with or without pain, occurs in 90% of patients with surgically proven radiculopathy due to disc prolapse, yet approximately 45% of patients are unable to vocalize the paresthesia to a distinct region. Dermatomal mapping notes that paresthesia of the thumb or index finger is attributed to the C6 dermatome, the middle finger (with or without index) to the C7 dermatome, and the little finger to the C8 dermatome. In a best evidence review, a positive Spurling's, traction/neck distraction, and Valsalva can be used to establish a diagnosis of cervical radiculopathy, and the existing literature appears to indicate high specificity, low sensitivity, and good to fair interexaminer reliability. For detection of radiculopathy, the presence of numbness has varied significantly from 24% to 48%, and 60% to as high as 86%; numbness is most often seen in the C6 and C7 dermatomes, and the predictive validity of numbness was calculated to be 0.7. Regarding imaging, in patients 50 years of age or older, plain spinal radiography together with standard laboratory tests are highly accurate in identifying the underlying systemic disease; however, plain radiography was not a valuable tool for nonspecific neck pain, and no systematic reviews were identified which examined the diagnostic accuracy of diagnostic imaging in those with neck pain.

Nucleoplasty and Coblation for disc herniation — prior reviews and letters characterize the evidence as follows: As of January 2007 there were no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for Coblation, and another review found no published RCTs assessing Coblation or nucleoplasty; a later systematic review reported "fair evidence for nucleoplasty in managing radicular pain due to contained disc herniation" based on one randomized trial and 14 observational studies, while a subsequent letter stated there were "no RCTs comparing nucleoplasty with open surgical procedures", concluded that nucleoplasty "significantly reduces pain… and also increases their functional capacity", and opined it "is an effective, safe, and minimally invasive treatment option in cervical, thoracic, and lumbar contained disc herniations", though this work was conducted by "the manufacturer of the nucleoplasty probe".

Exclusion criteria

All but three studies explicitly stated exclusion criteria. Eight studies excluded patients with specific pathology or medical 'red flags', although the examples mentioned differed. Planned imminent treatments (surgery or injection), previous injuries or surgery of the spine, use of medication, clinical signs of cord compression, abnormal neurological signs, or the inability to tolerate the planned intervention were also mentioned as exclusion criteria across the different studies.

Overall, many studies mentioned exclusion criteria, but we found no uniformity in the criteria used to exclude patients with symptoms of CR. No criteria were considered to be contradictory.

### Surgical management of cervical radiculopathy [^116bM5Xi]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2001). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy presents as pain in a dermatomal distribution. Despite conservative nonoperative therapy, a large subset of patients will require surgical intervention. Indications for surgery include recalcitrant radiculopathy despite nonoperative treatment for more than 6 weeks and progressive motor deficit or disabling motor deficit (deltoid palsy, wrist drop) prior to 6 weeks. Anterior and posterior approaches have both yielded successful results in appropriately selected patients. Anterior cervical diskectomy and fusion is the generally preferred treatment for radiculopathy when there is a significant component of axial neck pain, when the disease is centrally located, or when there is any degree of segmental kyphosis. Posterior laminoforaminotomy is an acceptable choice for lateral soft disk herniations with predominant arm pain and for caudal lesions in large, short-necked individuals.

### Surgery for neck pain [^1113KDRo]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Axial neck pain is a common finding that typically represents a spectrum of clinical Arlington Orthopedic Associates, disorders affecting the cervical spine. Controversy exists concerning the ultimate treatment of the patient who presents with cervical spondylosis and primarily axial neck pain without radicular symptoms or myelopathy and who has failed to respond to extensive nonoperative treatment methods. Cervical discography has been used to assist in determining the specific level or levels causing the neck pain and, potentially, which levels to fuse; however, controversy regarding the specificity of cervical discograms has also been debated in the literature. Los Angeles, California We recommend exhausting all conservative means of treatment of axial neck pain. Surgery is offered only after conservative treatment fails and appropriate psychological testing is performed, as well as diagnostic imaging and discography that confirm a specific level or levels as the pain source. Cervical fusion may demonstrate good results in appropriately chosen patients with cervical spondylosis and axial neck pain.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders [^113opVPB]. The Spine Journal (2011). Medium credibility.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders: In a potential Level I study comparing total disc arthroplasty (TDA) with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF), motion was significantly less in ACDF for all time points except three weeks, and preoperatively there was no statistical difference in symptoms between groups (P > 0.1) by visual analog scale. Both groups showed the same pattern of arm pain relief without a statistically significant difference (P = 0.13), and ACDF showed a higher postsurgical resolving ratio in neck pain relief at three weeks without statistical significance (P = 0.09). The authors concluded disc motion was maintained by TDA at one year and was greater than ACDF with similar clinical results, but critique noted that neither patients nor reviewers were masked, no validated outcome measures were used, follow-up was only one year, and range of motion was decreased though significantly greater than ACDF; due to these limitations, this potential Level I study provides Level II evidence that compared with ACDF, patients treated with TDA have statistically significantly greater range of motion, with clinical outcomes similar for both groups.

### Does the predominant pain location influence functional outcomes, satisfaction and return to work after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for cervical radiculopathy? [^1141zJ2f]. Spine (2021). Medium credibility.

Study Design

Retrospective review of prospectively-collected registry data.

Objectives

The aim of this study was to determine how different combinations of preoperative neck pain (NP) and arm pain (AP) influence functional outcomes, patient satisfaction, and return-to-work in patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) for degenerative cervical radiculopathy (DCR).

Summary Of Background Data

Surgeons often base decisions on the traditional belief that the predominance of radicular upper extremity symptoms is a stronger indication for cervical spine surgery than axial pain. However, there is a paucity of literature supporting this notion.

Methods

A prospectively maintained registry was reviewed for all patients who underwent primary ACDF for DCR. Patients were categorized into three groups depending on predominant pain location: AP predominant ([APP]; AP > NP), NP predominant ([NPP]; NP > AP), and equal pain predominance ([EPP]; NP = AP). Patients were prospectively followed for at least 2 years.

Results

In total, 303 patients were included: 27.4% APP, 38.9% NPP, and 33.7% EPP cases. The APP group was significantly older (P = 0.030), although there were no other preoperative differences among the three groups. After adjusting for baseline differences, the SF-36 Physical Component Summary was significantly better in the APP group at 6 months (P = 0.048) and 2 years (P = 0.039). In addition, they showed a trend towards better 6-month Neck Disability Index (P = 0.077) and 2-year SF-36 Mental Component Summary (P = 0.059). However, an equal proportion of patients in each group achieved the Minimal Clinically Important Difference for each outcome, were satisfied, and returned to work 2 years after surgery.

Conclusion

Although patients with NPP had slightly poorer function and quality of life, all patients experienced a clinically meaningful improvement in patient-reported outcomes, regardless of the predominant pain location. High rates of satisfaction and return-to-work were also achieved. In the context of proper indications, these findings suggest that ACDF can be equally effective for DCR patients with varying combinations of NP or AP. Level of Evidence: 3.

Cervical radiculopathy from degenerative disorders, surgical treatment — this evidentiary table addresses whether anterior cervical decompression with fusion yields better outcomes than anterior cervical decompression alone and summarizes a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing anterior cervical decompression (ACD) with anterior cervical decompression and fusion (ACDF) using iliac crest bone graft (ICBG), polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), and titanium cages. The trial had a Study design: RCT with a Total number of patients: 125, allocated as 33 ACD, 30 ICBG, 26 PMMA, and 36 cages, with Duration of follow-up: 12 months, and Nonvalidated outcome measures used: Odom Criteria, VAS pain scale. Work group conclusions list Potential level: II and Downgraded level: III. Conclusions relative to the question indicate variable outcomes when comparing ACD to ACDF, reporting that in one cohort comparing ACD to fusion with ICBG, outcomes were equivalent, while another cohort showed superiority of interbody fusion with a titanium cage and allograft versus ACD, with validity limited because conclusions are weakened by small sample size and short follow-up.
