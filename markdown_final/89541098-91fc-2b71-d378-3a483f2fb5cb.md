\begin{aligned} & \text { Pythagorean Theorem (direct and inverse). } \\ & \text { [Properties of medians. Center of gravity of a triangle. }]\end{aligned}

In triangle $ABC$, the medians drawn to sides $AC$ and $BC$ intersect at a right angle. It is known that $AC = b$ and $BC = a$. Find $AB$.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to find the length of side AB in triangle ABC, given that the medians to sides AC and BC intersect at a right angle, and that AC = b and BC = a. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the centroid and the vector representation of medians. Then, I should verify the condition that the medians are perpendicular. Next, I will translate that perpendicularity into a dot product equation and expand it algebraically. After that, I need to solve for the unknown side AB in terms of a and b. Finally, I will sanity-check the result and consider special cases to ensure consistency with the Pythagorean theorem and median properties.

> Let me first confirm the geometric setup and notation. In triangle ABC, let M be the midpoint of AC and N be the midpoint of BC, so the median from B is BM and the median from A is AN. The medians intersect at the centroid G, and we are told that BM is perpendicular to AN, which means the vectors BM and AN have a dot product of zero [^notfound].

> I need to express the medians as vectors. Let me place the triangle in a coordinate-free vector framework with origin at A, so that vector AB = c, vector AC = b, and vector BC = a. Wait, let me verify the vector definitions to avoid confusion: typically, we denote side lengths as lowercase and vectors as bold or with arrows; here, I will keep vectors explicit and use lowercase for lengths, so |AB| = c, |AC| = b, |BC| = a. Then, BM = AM − AB = (1/2)b − c, and AN = AB + BN = c + (1/2)(a), but hold on, I should double-check BN; since N is the midpoint of BC, BN = (1/2)BC = (1/2)(c − b), so AN = c + (1/2)(c − b) = (3/2)c − (1/2)b. Hmm, wait a minute, that expression for AN looks off; let me reconsider. If A is the origin, then N = B + (1/2)(C − B) = (1/2)(B + C), so AN = N − A = (1/2)(B + C) = (1/2)(c + b), which is cleaner and correct. I should correct myself and use AN = (1/2)(b + c) and BM = (1/2)b − c to keep the algebra consistent [^notfound].

> Now, I will impose the perpendicularity condition. The dot product of BM and AN must be zero: BM · AN = 0. Substituting the vectors, that gives [(1/2)b − c] · [(1/2)(b + c)] = 0. Let me expand this carefully: (1/4)(b · b) + (1/4)(b · c) − (1/2)(c · b) − (1/2)(c · c) = 0. Simplifying, I get (1/4)|b|^2 − (1/4)(b · c) − (1/2)|c|^2 = 0. Multiply through by 4 to clear denominators: |b|^2 − (b · c) − 2|c|^2 = 0, which rearranges to b · c = |b|^2 − 2|c|^2. Hold on, I should verify the sign; yes, that matches the expansion [^notfound].

> Next, I should relate the dot product to side lengths using the law of cosines. Recall that b · c = |b||c|cosθ, but I don't actually need the angle; instead, I can use the identity |a|^2 = |c − b|^2 = |c|^2 + |b|^2 − 2(b · c). Substituting the expression for b · c from above, I get |a|^2 = |c|^2 + |b|^2 − 2(|b|^2 − 2|c|^2) = |c|^2 + |b|^2 − 2|b|^2 + 4|c|^2 = 5|c|^2 − |b|^2. Let me double-check the algebra; yes, that simplifies correctly to |a|^2 = 5|c|^2 − |b|^2 [^notfound].

> I will now solve for the unknown side AB, which is |c|. Rearranging the equation gives 5|c|^2 = |a|^2 + |b|^2, so |c|^2 = (|a|^2 + |b|^2)/5, and therefore |c| = √[(a^2 + b^2)/5]. Wait, let me verify the final expression; I initially thought I might have misplaced a factor, but this matches the derivation. So, AB = √[(a^2 + b^2)/5] [^notfound].

> Let me consider a sanity check and a special case. If the triangle were right-angled at C with legs a and b, then the medians would not generally be perpendicular, so this formula should not reduce to the Pythagorean theorem; that expectation is correct. However, if I imagine a degenerate case where a = b and the medians are perpendicular, the formula gives AB = √[(2a^2)/5] = a√(2/5), which is a positive real number and geometrically plausible, supporting the algebraic result [^notfound].

> Final answer: AB = √[(a^2 + b^2)/5].

The medians to sides AC and BC intersect at the centroid and form a right angle. Using the property that the centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio and applying the Pythagorean theorem to the right triangle formed by the medians, we find that the length of AB is (\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\dfrac{a^2 + b^2}{5}}}).

---

## Geometric setup and properties

Let triangle ABC have medians from vertices A and B intersecting at centroid G, with AC = b and BC = a. The medians intersect at a right angle, so ∠AGB = 90°. The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, so AG = 2/3 m_a and BG = 2/3 m_b, where m_a and m_b are the lengths of the medians from A and B, respectively.

---

## Median length formulas

The lengths of the medians can be expressed using Apollonius's theorem:

- **Median from A to BC**: (m_a = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2})
- **Median from B to AC**: (m_b = \\dfrac{1}{2} \\sqrt{2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2})

where c is the length of side AB.

---

## Applying the Pythagorean theorem

Since the medians intersect at a right angle, triangle AGB is a right triangle with hypotenuse AB. By the Pythagorean theorem:

[
AG^2 + BG^2 = AB^2
]

Substitute the centroid ratios:

[
\\left(\\dfrac{2}{3} m_a\\right)^2 + \\left(\\dfrac{2}{3} m_b\\right)^2 = c^2
]

Simplify:

[
\\dfrac{4}{9} (m_a^2 + m_b^2) = c^2
]

Now substitute the median formulas:

[
m_a^2 = \\dfrac{1}{4} (2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2), \\quad m_b^2 = \\dfrac{1}{4} (2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2)
]

Add them:

[
m_a^2 + m_b^2 = \\dfrac{1}{4} [(2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2) + (2a^2 + 2c^2 - b^2)] = \\dfrac{1}{4} (a^2 + b^2 + 4c^2)
]

Plug into the Pythagorean equation:

[
\\dfrac{4}{9} \\cdot \\dfrac{1}{4} (a^2 + b^2 + 4c^2) = c^2
]

Simplify:

[
\\dfrac{1}{9} (a^2 + b^2 + 4c^2) = c^2
]

Multiply by 9:

[
a^2 + b^2 + 4c^2 = 9c^2
]

Rearrange:

[
a^2 + b^2 = 5c^2
]

Solve for c:

[
c^2 = \\dfrac{a^2 + b^2}{5}
]

Take the square root:

[
c = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{a^2 + b^2}{5}}
]

---

## Final answer

The length of side AB is (\\boxed{\\sqrt{\\dfrac{a^2 + b^2}{5}}}).

### Finding the right angle: a geometric approach to measuring intersectional HIV stigma [^b29c9770]. AIDS and Behavior (2022). Medium credibility.

Intersectionality has emerged as theoretically and practically important to advancing HIV stigma research. However, few psychometric measures capture the intricacies of intersectional stigma. Grounded in the HIV stigma framework and contemporary theories of intersectionality, this paper describes a novel approach to conceptualizing the measurement of intersectional stigma. Taking the notion of an intersection literally, that is the point at which two or more lines meet and form a union, we offer a geometric conceptualization for developing a psychometric instrument to measure intersectional stigma. Ratings of stigmatized attributes, such as stigma ascribed to gender, race, sexual orientation, and HIV status are assessed on independent scales to calculate their intersection using the Pythagorean Theorem, c = [Formula: see text] (a 2 +b 2) and its extension to multiple stigmatized attributes d = [Formula: see text] (a 2 +b 2 +c 2). Data from a sample of Black /African American women living with HIV were used to test the concept of a geometric approach to measuring intersectional enacted stigma and intersectional anticipated stigma. Findings from the test of concept were encouraging and warrant further scale development research.

### Quantification of surgical route parameters for exposure of the jugular foramen via a trans-mastoidal approach exposing jugular foramen in three-dimensional visualization model [^7f42670d]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Surgical operation within the region of the jugular foramen presents a great challenge. The authors characterized the quantitative impact of surgical window parameters on the exposure of the jugular foramen via a trans-mastoidal approach.

Methods

Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging data were used to establish a 3-dimensional model of the jugular foramen region. The mastoidale, posterior edge of the mastoid, and the superior edge of the bony external acoustic meatus were selected as points a, b, and c. The anterior edge of the tuberculum jugulare was selected as point d. The midpoints of line segments ab, ac, and bc were selected as points e, f, and g. Triangle abc was divided into triangles aef, beg, cfg, and efg. Surgical corridors of the triangular pyramid were outlined by connecting the above triangles to point d. Anatomic exposure was evaluated by measuring the area and volume of various structures within each route. Statistical comparisons were performed via analysis of variance.

Results

The model allowed for adequate visualization of all structures. The areas of triangles beg and efg were greater than those of triangles aef and cfg (P < 0.05). The volumes of triangular pyramids d-beg and d-cfg were greater than those of triangular pyramids d-aef and d-efg (P = 0.000). Statistically significant differences were also observed for volumes of osseous, venous, and cranial nerve structures in all divided routes (P = 0.000).

Conclusion

Our results indicate that 3-dimensional modeling may aid in the quantification of surgical exposure and that division of the craniotomy window may allow for more precise operation.

Experimental design and behavioral analysis. a At the beginning of the trial, the monkey fixated a center point on the monitor. After 1.5 s, two offers appeared to the left and right of the fixation point. The offers were represented by sets of color symbols, with the color indicating the juice type, the number of squares indicating juice amount and the shape of the symbols indicating the action cost associated with the offer (crosses, low cost; diamonds high cost). The offers remained on the monitor for 1 s, then disappeared. The monkey continued fixating the center point for another 1 s. At the end of this delay, two saccade targets (two color dots) appeared. The two saccade targets were located on two (invisible) concentric rings centered on the fixation point. The monkey maintained fixation for a randomly variable delay (0.6–1.2 s) before the center fixation point was extinguished (go signal), at which point the monkey indicated its choice with a saccade. Importantly, the association between the symbols (cross, diamond) and the saccade amplitudes (short, long) was known to the monkey. b Choice patterns, one session. The percentage of B choices is plotted against the ratio #B:#A, where #A and #B are quantities of juice A and B, respectively. Trials were separated in two groups depending on the action cost for juice A. The choice pattern obtained when juice A had a high cost (black) was displaced to the left (lower indifference point) compared with the choice pattern obtained when juice A had a low cost (gray). The regression lines were obtained with a simplified version of Eq. (1) in which terms a 3 to a 6 were removed. The action cost can be measured as ξ = a 2 / a 0 (Eq. 1). c Distribution of action costs measured across sessions for monkey B (79 sessions, median(ξ) = 0.174, p < 10 −10, Wilcoxon signed-rank test) and for monkey L (107 sessions, median(ξ) = 0.327, p < 10 −10, Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

Step 1: preoperative design

The patient is positioned in a supine posture, and the design line marked with methylene blue. Initially, identify the optimal location for the new epicanthus (designated as point A) and mark it as the projection point of point A 'exposed when the skin is slightly stretched towards the nose (point A' is the original position of the medial canthus angle). Point B is situated on the free edge of the epicanthus on the upper eyelid (the starting point of the epicanthus), while Point C is the extension point of the B-A 'line connecting two points. The length of the AB arm is approximately equivalent to the length of the BC arm (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Preoperative design: Point A is the ideal position for the new medial canthus angle. Point B is the intersection point between the free edge of the medial canthus skin and the upper eyelid skin. Point C is the extension point of the B-A 'line connecting the two points

Step 2: adequate subcutaneous separation

Utilize a No.11 blade to incise the skin along the AB and BC lines; employ sharp scissors to carefully dissect and elevate the flap ABC, creating a separation zone measuring approximately 10mm in length and 8mm in width, forming a 270° circular configuration. Trim the attachment of the anterior orbicularis oculi muscle to the medial canthus skin, thereby fully releasing the dense connective tissue between the skin and the orbicularis oculi muscle (Fig. 2).

### Rapid active zone remodeling consolidates presynaptic potentiation [^13e85582]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

To investigate the AZ structure in an approach independent of the cluster-distance minimization procedure described above, we repeated the averaging in a different way as follows. We developed a MATLAB code for AZ centering and alignment by rotation of the highest intensity pixel to identical angles and therefore similar positions, which yielded qualitatively similar results (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Again, high-intensity clusters were detected in AZ images cleaned from clusters belonging to bordering AZs, and all translations and rotations were then performed on unretouched images. The center of mass of the found cluster coordinates was calculated and the image shifted so that the center of mass of the coordinates was in the center of the 51 by 51 pixel space (x = y = 26; see Eqs. (1) to (6)). Only the position of the brightest pixel was then considered for rotation. To determine the angle by which to rotate each image to place this highest intensity pixel to the same fixed position (on the vertical midline between the two top image quadrants — the "twelve o'clock" position), the x and y distances to the center of rotation (equal to the center pixel of the image x = y = 26) were calculated to find the length (l) of the hypotenuse and the opposite side of the right triangle using pdist. The angle α in degrees was then calculated by taking the inverse sine in degrees of this value (MATLAB function asind), as shown in Eq. (9). In cases where the brightest peak was located above the horizontal midline, the adjacent side of the triangle was the vertical midline. In cases where the brightest peak was located below the horizontal midline, the angle was calculated with the horizontal midline being the adjacent side, and 90° were added to the final angle value. Additionally, in cases where the brightest peak was located to the right of the vertical midline, the angle was multiplied with −1. To generate the results shown in Supplementary Fig. 3b, which shows the averaging of AZ images within randomly assigned categories, we generated a number of random category values and then proceeded with the averaging procedure described above. For this, we reproduced the distribution of category values from the AZ dataset according to the histogram values of the category vector as follows. A histogram of the category vector was generated (MATLAB function histogram) with a bin width of 1, yielding the absolute amount of AZs per category. A cumulative sum vector was calculated from these histogram values (MATLAB function cumsum). For each position in the category vector, we then chose a random number between 0 and 1 and multiplied it by the number of images. We then found the first position in the cumulative sum vector that was larger than this random value. The position found was equal to the assigned category. This resulted in a randomly assigned category vector with a similar distribution of categories as the original vector.

### Impulse dispersion of aerosols during singing and speaking: a potential COVID-19 transmission pathway [^c6d80047]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

The impulse dispersion in x -direction was found to be greater than in y - or z -direction. The median distance to the front was 0.86 m for MT+, 0.78 m for MT−, 0.82 m for T+, and 0.74 m for T− at the end of the tasks. The M tasks revealed distinctly lower values with 0.62 m (M+) and 0.49 m (M−), respectively (Friedmann/Wilcoxon/Bonferroni-correction P values: MT ± vs. M ± = 0.003, T ± vs. M ± = 0.015, and MT ± vs. T ± = nonsignificant). The intersubject variability was large, ranging from 0.61 m to 1.36 m for the MT tasks (Figure 1). Once a task was completed, the motion of the aerosol cloud decreased with an additional median movement to the front (x -direction) between 0.04 m and 0.11 m for all tasks 3 seconds after the end of task.

Figure 1.
Exemplary images demonstrating the dispersion of a female subject at the end of all tasks (melody and text, text, and melody). Below each image, the diagrams show the temporal dispersion to the front (x -direction). The upper row refers to the soft (−) versions of the tasks, and the lower row refers to the loud (+) versions of the tasks. The red curves represent the individual subjects, and the green curve represents the median. The 0 point on the x -axis in the time scale refers to the end of the task. M = melody; MT = melody and text; T = text.

The dispersion to the side was much less (Figure 2). However, the distances in y -direction show a lateralization imbalance for some subjects, presumably because of a small convectional flow generated by the singer's motion immediately before the beginning of the task. The y -diameter between left and right exhibited median values between 0.57 m and 0.88 m at the end of the task.

### A modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy using the lateral approach for the treatment of posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity in children [^aa5eb75a]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 2
A, Preoperative x-ray of 9-year-old boy of left-sided cubitus varus; (B and C) the same patient treated by a modified inverse right-angled triangle osteotomy and fixation by K -wires.

All the patients underwent follow-up by clinical–radiologic means at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years postoperative period, respectively. The clinical and radiologic parameters were recorded in the postoperative period. The patient's clinical evaluation included measurement of varus angulation, carrying angle, and range of motion (ROM) of the elbow before surgery and at the final follow-up. Functional outcome was graded as per criteria described by Oppenheim et alas excellent, good, and poor. An excellent result included correction of the varus deformity to within 5 degrees of the contralateral elbow, motion to within 5 degrees of the preoperative flexion and rotation arcs, and no perioperative complications. A good result demonstrated a valgus position and motion to within at least 10 degrees of the preoperative arcs. A poor result was assigned to any case with a complication, residual varus, or loss of more than 10 degrees in any plane of motion compared with the preoperative examination. Radiologic evaluation included an anteroposterior view and a lateral view of the elbow on both sides with the contralateral side as a control. The carrying angle can be determined radiologically by the humerus-elbow-wrist (HEW) angle, which was measured on the anteroposterior view of the elbow. A line passed through the middle longitudinal axis of the lower 1/3 of the humerus, and then drew a second line between the radius and the ulna along the middle longitudinal axis of the upper 1/3 of the forearm. The extension lines of these 2 lines intersect at the supracondylar part and the intersection angle is the HEW angle (Fig. 3 A). The HEW angle was radiographically assessed before surgery and at the final follow-up. The lateral condylar prominence index (LCPI) was measured by drawing the longitudinal humeral axis to the transepicondylar line, which divided the transepicondylar line into lateral and medial parts (Fig. 3 B). Then the ratio of the difference between lateral and medial distance and total transepicondylar distance was calculated and called as LCPI.

### Novel surgical safety zones on bony-en-face view of humeral greater tuberosity: a fresh cadaveric dissection study [^0238b312]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The neurovascular alignment in the humeral greater tuberosity (HGT) region has not been thoroughly investigated. However, many studies have documented the vascular-nerve architecture of the proximal humerus. The purpose of this study was to identify novel safety zones on the bony-en-face view of the HGT for surgical procedures.

Methods

Eighteen complete adult fresh frozen cadavers (36 paired shoulders) were dissected in this study (12 males and 6 females; mean age of 69.39 years). Five landmarks-A, B, C, D, and E-were established to define the boundary of the HGT. Point A was the intersection of the superior facet of HGT and the intertubercular groove of the long head of the biceps tendon. Point B was the junction of the attachment point between the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus muscle. Point C was the intersection of the infraspinatus and the teres minor muscle and point D was the lowest foot point of the teres minor muscle. Point E was on a vertical intersection line from point D to point A. Next, we segmented the individualized pentagon ABCDE into 15 zones. First, we drew line BF to ensure it was perpendicular to DE. Then, we designated points H, J, and M as the midpoints of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor, respectively, with H and J perpendicular to DE and M perpendicular to EA. Finally, we drew perpendicular lines from points J, C, and M to EA, which intersected at points K, G, and L, respectively. The neurovascular structures in each zone were identified to enable the calculation of percentages, allowing for the definition of safe and dangerous zones.

Results

We have identified the specific ranking of the safe zones for branches of the circumflex humeral artery as follows: 1a (19.44%, meaning blood vessels were observed in 7 of 36 shoulders, accounting for 19.44% of the total); 3a (25%); 2a (47.22%); 7 (66.66%); 2b (75%); 1b (77.77%); 3b (80.55%); 4, 10, and 11 (all 88.88%); 6 and 8 (both 91.67%); and 5, 9, and 12 (all 100%). The specific zone ranking of vascular-branch numbers is as follows: 1a < 3a < 2a < 7 < 2b < 1b < 10 < 3b < 4 < 6 < 11 < 8 < 9 < 12 < 5. The specific ranking of the dangerous zones for the anterior branches of the axillary nerve is 8 (5.55%), 11 (8.33%), 10 (38.88%), and 9 (66.66%).

Conclusion

We demonstrate the neurovascular distribution in the 15 zones on the bony-en-face view of the HGT, clearly highlighting both safe and dangerous zones. We recommend following clinical suggestions based on our anatomical findings: (1) selection of safe insert points from zones 1a, 3a, 2a, or 7 for screw fixation (Liu-Gang type I & II) and (2) avoidance of neurovascular dangerous zones 8, 11, 10, and 9 for plate fixation. However, we should keep in mind that this technique cannot prevent vascular disruption in these areas.

### A modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy using the lateral approach for the treatment of posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity in children [^bbbb2306]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

During the time between October 2017 and May 2020, 22 elbows with posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity were treated by means of a modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy at the Department of Pediatric Orthopaedics of our hospital. All procedures were carried out by a single senior surgeon. The surgical indication was that the difference between the affected side and the healthy contralateral side was at least 20 degrees and the parents requested surgical treatment. The 22 patients involved included 6 female and 16 male patients with an average age of 10.3 years (range, 8 to 13 years) at the time of the osteotomy. The average time from injury to the osteotomy was 2.2 years (range, 1.1 to 3.2 years). Thirteen patients had a right-sided deformity and 9 had a left-sided deformity. All patients presented with an extension type of supracondylar fracture at the time of injury. The procedures were performed after the approval of the Institutional Ethics Committee and informed consent was obtained from the patients and their families.

Preoperative Planning and Operative Technique

Design drawing of paper simulated osteotomy was performed before surgery. The initial osteotomy was performed 0.5 to 1 cm superior to the olecranon fossa and perpendicular to the lateral rim of the distal humerus (line AB) (Fig. 1 A). The proximal end of the humerus osteotomy was resected with a reverse right-angled triangle so that the DAE angle was equal to the intended angle of correction (Fig. 1 B). The intended angle of correction was equal to the sum of the carrying angle of the normal side plus the varus angle of the affected side and the expectation of 5 degrees of correction loss after surgery. According to the relevant knowledge of the right triangle, the angle DBA was equal to the angle DAE, which was the expected correction angle. After the inverted right triangle, ADB was cut off at the proximal end of the humerus osteotomy, and the apex A of the distal humeral osteotomy segment was rotated inward and overlapped with the apex D to complete the distal humeral valgus osteotomy (Fig. 1 C).

### Long term positional stability of the argus II retinal prosthesis epiretinal implant [^78fa4cd5]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Determination of linear and angular movement

Fundus images from all patients taken during M1, M3, M6, M12, and M24 were imported into NIH ImageJ v1.53a to measure lengths AB, AC, BC, and angles 𝜶, 𝜷, 𝛾, and 𝜟 (Fig. 1) (Schneider et al. 2012). As reported by the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System Surgeon Manual, the diameter of each electrode is 200 μm in diameter. The diameter of one electrode from each image analyzed was measured in pixels on ImageJ, and a scale was set based on the 200-μm measurement provided by the surgeon manual. Following the calibration, each length was measured in micrometers, and angle measured in degrees.

Fig. 1
Fundoscopy of patient A-03 at month 24 post implantation with markings to show distances and angles that were recorded using NIH ImageJ: A A represents the point in the center of the optic disc, B is the point at the top corner of the surgical handle on the implant, C is the point in the center of the tack. Alpha (α) represents the ∠CAB, gamma (Ɣ) represents the ∠ACB, beta (β) represents ∠ABC. B delta (𝜟) measures the angle made by the line along the edge of the implant to the horizontal of the image frame

Length AB represents the distance from the optic disc to the surgical handle on the electrode array. This distance reflects the implant moving towards or away from the optic disc in a linear fashion. Angle 𝛾 (optic disc-tack-surgical handle), angle 𝜶 (tack-optic disc-surgical handle), and angle 𝜷 (optic disc-surgical handle-tack) are reflective of rotation around the axis of the tack. Another measure for showing the rotation around the axis is the angle to the horizontal of the image frame (angle 𝜟). Variations in such markers between postoperative visits M1, M3, M6, M12, and M24 would be reflective of the linear movement and rotation of the implant over time (Fig. 1).

Other markers recorded in this study were length AC which is the distance from the optic disc to the tack and length BC which is the distance from the surgical handle to the tack. Both are representative of steady measures over time and are used as retinal references.

### Trigonometry in daily ultrasound practice [^c806ac21]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

We have read with interest the editorial by Piton et al. regarding application of Pythagoras' theorem in central venous cannulation. Geometry is at the base of our daily life and we should apply his theorems and axioms to obtain the best result in our daily practice.

We believe that trigonometry is another important branch of geometry in addition to Pythagoras' theorem that has to be taken into consideration while performing invasive procedures under ultrasound guidance. Sine, cosine and tangent are the basis of trigonometry, they represent the ratio between the sides of a right-angled triangle. Sin(α) is the ratio between side B and the hypotenuse (H) (Fig. 1), Cos(α) is the ratio between side A and the hypotenuse (H), and Tan(α) is the ratio between side B and side A. It is important to note that, for a given angle α, the ratio between the sides is unconnected from the triangle size.

Fig. 1
Internal jugular vein ultrasound anatomy. H hypotenuse; A and B are catheti of the triangle

As already stated by Piton, in our ultrasound daily practice, we constantly build right-angled triangles: the hypotenuse is the needle route, side A is the distance measured on the skin between needle insertion point and target projection on the skin, and side B is the depth of the target.

Side B is determined by the patient's anatomy and the operator cannot modify it. As reported by Schulman et al. needle/skin angulation between 30° and 45° is considered to be ideal while performing ultrasound procedure.

Trigonometry is helpful in determining which targets can be reached with such needle angulation. At 45° angulation tan(α) is equal to 1, meaning that side A and side B have to be equal. For example, if our target jugular internal vein is 2 cm deep, the needle has to be inserted 2 cm from the target. Generalizing, we have a good needle visualization whenever Tan(α) ≤ 1 with side B equal to or shorter than side A.

In conclusion, physicians have to take into account target depth while choosing the ultrasound linear probe of appropriate size to be able to visualize all needle routes and the needle skin entrance site.

### Re-interpreting mesenteric vascular anatomy on 3D virtual and / or physical models, part II: anatomy of relevance to surgeons operating splenic flexure cancer [^1235c168]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Morphological and morphometric analyses

All distances were measured on 3D virtual models in Osirix using a length tool.

The difference in level between the MCA origin and the IMA origin was named a mesenteric inter-arterial stair. The values measured and the relationship between the values are clarified in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1
Distance A: From the MCA origin to the IMA origin. Distance B: Parallel to the aorta axis from the IMA origin to the transverse plane through the MCA origin. Distance C: In the transverse plane from the MCA origin to the intersection with Distance B. The angle between the Distance A and Distance B intersection was named Angle AB Vessels MCA middle colic artery, SMA superior mesenteric artery, IMA inferior mesenteric artery

Distance A (oblique distance) was measured from the MCA origin to the IMA origin. Distance B (longitudinal distance) was measured parallel to the aorta axis from the IMA origin to the intersection with the transverse plane through the MCA origin. Distance C (lateral distance) and the angle AB were calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. These lines form a right-angled triangle with the MCA origin in one and the IMA origin in the other vertex.

The angle AB represents the direction, distance A (oblique distance) represents the length, and distance C (lateral distance) represents the height of the mesenteric inter-arterial stair.

The distance from the IMA origin to the LCA origin was measured on the IMA in a stepwise manner along the vessel. Calibres of the vessels were measured at their base, using a length tool, and measuring the largest diameter.

### A simple clinical application for locating the anterior ethmoidal artery using the anterior ethmoidal foramen and the anterior nasal spine [^ee403e1b]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Sagittal CT images showing the 3 types of AEA (red arrows). (A) Grade Ⅰ: within the roof; (B) Grade Ⅱ: under the roof, considered as prominent; (C) Grade Grade Ⅰ: distant from the ethmoidal roof. AEA indicates anterior ethmoidal artery; CT, computed tomography.

We followed the steps below for making the measurements:
Determining the reference landmarks for measurement.

Point A (ie, the AEF) was identified as a bell-like structure formed medially between the superior oblique and the medial rectus muscles in the coronal plane. Point B was the intersection of the perpendicular line from point A and the sagittal plane. Point C was the point of intersection of the 3 planes. Point D (ie, the ANS) was the bony protuberance at the anterior and upper part of the maxilla in the sagittal view. Point E was the intersection of the perpendicular line from point A and the axial plane. The diagrammatic drawing with the specific measurement method is shown in Figure 2.

(2) Measuring the distance between the AEF and ANS and the angle between AEF-ANS and the axial plane.

FIGURE 2
The 3-dimensional space between the ANS and the AEF was constructed. Point A, AEF; point D, ANS. AEF indicates anterior ethmoidal foramen; ANS, anterior nasal spine.

The AEF-ANS distance was defined as the distance from AEF (point A) to ANS (point D).

The AEF-ANS angle (ie, ∠ADE) was defined as the angle between the ANS-AEF line and the axial plane.

AB and BC were measured in the coronal position, whereas CD and AC were measured in the sagittal position. The angle between AB and BC and that between AC and CD were both right angles; hence, the distance from point A to D and the angle between AEF-ANS and the axial plane could be calculated using trigonometry.

The trigonometric formula can be written as follows:

### From the betweenness centrality in street networks to structural invariants in random planar graphs [^f2be3b03]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Plotting the rescaled average betweenness of nodes as a function of the distance r from the barycenter (Methods), demonstrates a monotonic decrease with distance in the high density regime (Fig. 4d). For low values of ρ e there appears no distance dependence of the nodes, whereas for ρ e > 0.4, a clear dependence emerges with the curves converging to the form seen for maximally dense random geometric graphs as calculated in. (Note that while both planar and geometric graphs are embedded in space, the latter allows for edge-crossings and therefore broader degree distributions and larger number of edges for the same N. In light of this difference, the similarity between the two ostensibly different classes of graphs is notable.) In combination, the structural metrics suggest that while the spatial position of a node is decoupled from its BC value in sparse networks, a strong correlation emerges for increasingly dense networks.

### Nonossifying fibroma of the lower femur with genu valgum: a case report [^0d674303]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Fig. 1
Ⓐ - Ⓑ Genu valgum deformity of the right lower limb. Ⓒ - Ⓔ X-ray showed partial osteolytic destruction of the metaphyseal segment of the femur, destruction of the medial cortex, and valgum deformity of the knee. X-ray of the whole length of the lower limb showed valgum deformity of the right knee. Ⓕ CT showed partial osteolytic destruction and cortical destruction of the femur, with clear boundaries and sclerotic edges. Ⓖ T1 imaging showed a low signal in the medullary cavity at the metaphyseal segment of femoral with clear boundaries. Ⓗ Spindle cell lesions and more multinucleated giant cells were observed in the preoperative puncture pathology images

We completed the relevant preoperative situation of the patient and planned to carry out expanded tumor curettage and osteotomy. The patient's valgum deformity was located in the distal femur, and there was no deformity of the tibia. The amount and direction of osteotomy were designed according to the Miniaci method. The ankle joint center (B) and knee joint center (C) were connected on the full-length film of both lower limbs, and the line was extended to the proximal end. The position of the osteotomy hinge point (A) was 5 mm above the lateral condyle of the femur and approximately 5–10 mm inward from the lateral cortex. This point was the center of the circle (A). The line was rotated between this point (A) and the center of the femoral head (O) and intersected the extension of line BC at D. The rotation angle (∠ OAD = 19.5°) was the osteotomy degree (Fig. 2 A). The hinge point was taken as the apex, and an isosceles triangle was made toward the medial cortex of the distal femur. The top angle of the triangle was the osteotomy degree mentioned above, and the length of the bottom edge was 1.26 cm, which was the length of the medial cortex of the femur to be corrected (Fig. 2 B).

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

PCSK9 inhibitor evidence and ezetimibe sequencing in clinical ASCVD are summarized with inclusion thresholds and outcomes. Ezetimibe "was allowed at entry along with statin therapy in both PCSK9 inhibitor trials (FOURIER, ODYSSEY OUTCOMES)". Yet "only very small numbers (3% and 5% respectively) were on ezetimibe during these trials". "This approach is supported by 2 simulation studies… these reports showed that addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy will lower LDL-C to < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) in the majority of patients, leaving a minority eligible for a PCSK9 inhibitor", and "These 2 well-designed simulation studies favor the strategy of addition of ezetimibe before PCSK9 inhibitor and warrants an LOE of B-NR". In FOURIER, "Recruitment was limited to patients who had LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or non–HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (≥ 2.6 mmol/L) on maximal statin ± ezetimibe", and "At a median follow-up of 2.2 years, evolocumab significantly reduced composite ASCVD (15% RRR; 1.5% AAR) without neurocognitive side effects". In ODYSSEY OUTCOMES, investigators "tested alirocumab in patients on maximal statin ± ezetimibe with ACS over a median of 2.8 years, observed a 15% RRR".

### Minimum electric-field gradient coil design: theoretical limits and practical guidelines [^075005b9]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Regions A and B are geometrically symmetric about the z = 0 plane, with minimum energy solutions (assuming no E‐field constraint) yielding z‐symmetric field solutions and zero B 0 concomitant fields. Hence, the open diamond starting point (representing the minimum energy solution with no E‐field constraints) for the solid and dashed curves (in both black and green cases) coincide. The symmetry is broken by the addition of a patient model with an E‐field constraint.

The knee in the curves marks the point where magnetic energy, current density, and winding complexity increase rapidly as E max is driven to lower values. These complexities render unrealizable or impractical any gradient designs on the vertical portions of the curves to the left of the knee. Examination of winding patterns indicates that solutions that exhibit energy increases > 25% (or even less depending on coil type) above the global minimum energy become unrealizable (eg, demonstrating two or more "eyes" per half coil [four or more total eyes for an x or y coil] in the fingerprint wire patterns).

The red and purple dotted curves in Figure 2 represent two practical cases in which the primary coil currents are restricted to a single inner surface near the patient and the shield coil currents to an outer cylinder, while at the same time adding torque and eddy current constraints. Line segments acd of Figure 1 represent a primary winding surface consisting of a cone and a cylinder, whereas line segment ab represents its cylindrical shield winding; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 8, 22 and results in the red dotted curves in Figure 2. A second case is defined by restricting primary currents to the cylinder represented by line segment cd and shield currents to the cylinder ab; this yields designs similar to those proposed by previous literature 28 and produces the purple dotted curves in Figure 2. For both configurations, the eddy current surface is a 1‐m‐long, 620‐mm‐diameter cylinder, centered about the gradient isocenter and placed outside the shield winding of the gradient coil. The time = 0 eddy current error is constrained to a peak deviation less than 0.1% of the ideal gradient field on the surface of a 20‐cm‐diameter volume, corresponding to 100 µT for a 1 T/m step change in gradient strength. The torque constraint is set to zero for a uniform z‐directed B 0 main magnetic field. There is no net force for a perfectly uniform main B 0 field in all calculations.

### A modified reverse right-angled triangle osteotomy using the lateral approach for the treatment of posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity in children [^c98160a8]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
Design drawing of paper simulated osteotomy before surgery (A–C). The initial osteotomy was performed 0.5 to 1 cm superior to the olecranon fossa and perpendicular to the lateral rim of the distal end of the humerus (line AB). The proximal end of the humerus osteotomy was resected with a reverse right-angled triangle so that the DAE angle was equal to the intended angle of correction. The lateral edge of the distal fragment was moved to the apex of the proximal osteotomy site. D, The distal lateral humeral marking line (solid line). DAE refers to the included angle formed by the intersection of line DA and line AE.

The patient was supine, and the affected side was abducted and placed on the abduction operation platform. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia using a tourniquet. A 4 to 6 cm longitudinal incision was made over the lateral distal humerus and the interval between the brachioradialis and triceps muscles was developed. The distal humerus was exposed circumferentially by subperiosteal dissection. First, a longitudinal marking line was marked on the lateral edge of the distal humerus with an electric motor saw for alignment of the lateral edge after osteotomy and correction of distal humeral hyperextension on the sagittal plane (Fig. 1 D). A 2.0 mm Kirschner wire (K -wire) was inserted from the lateral edge of the humerus under fluoroscopy, 0.5 to 1 cm above the olecranon fossa, and perpendicular to the lateral edge of the distal end of the humeral osteotomy (Fig. 1 A) to locate the initial osteotomy line (line AB), and then osteotomy was performed with an electric motor saw along the direction of the K -wire. Using a goniometer and scale, all lines as preoperative planned were drawn on the proximal end of the humeral osteotomy, and osteotomy cuts were made accordingly. The right-angled triangle-shaped bone was removed (Fig. 1 B) and the lateral edge of the distal fragment was moved to the apex of the proximal osteotomy site to correct the varus on the coronal plane (Fig. 1 C). According to the longitudinal marking line of the lateral edge of the distal humerus, the distal end of the humeral osteotomy was tilted forward to correct the elbow hyperextension on the sagittal plane (Fig. 1 D). The osteotomy site was cross-pinned with 1.5 to 2.0 mm K -wires (Fig. 2). Stability of the construct was confirmed by taking fluoroscopic views under valgus and varus stress. Additional K -wires or screws could be used if required according to stability. After wound closure, a long-arm cast was applied with the elbow flexed at 90 degrees and the forearm was in a neutral position.

### The geometric nature of weights in real complex networks [^16d6fe49]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Hidden metric spaces underlying real weighted networks

At the beginning of this section, we showed that the normalized weights of links participating in triangles are higher, thus suggesting a coupling between the weighted organization of real weighted complex networks and an underlying metric space. We then presented a model that has the critical ability to fix the joint degree–strength distribution, while independently varying the level of coupling between the weights and the metric space (parameter α). This opens the way to a definite proof of the geometric nature of weights in real complex networks, which inevitably must involve the triangle inequality: the most fundamental property of any metric space.

For unweighted networks, a direct verification of the triangle inequality based on the topology without an embedding in a metric space is not possible, due to the probabilistic nature of the relationship between the binary structure and the distance between nodes. In contrast, weights do contain information about their distances in the metric space (via equation (2)) such that a direct verification of the triangle inequality is possible. To ensure that the metric properties of triples in the network are in correspondence to the metric properties of the corresponding triangles in the underlying space, only triples of nodes forming triangles in the network are taken into account to evaluate the triangle inequality. There are however two main challenges when one tries to apply this methodology. The first one is related to the fact that connections in the weightedmodel depend not only on angular distances but also on hidden degrees, such that we need a purely geometrical formulation of the weighted hidden metric space network model, in which angular distances and degrees are combined into a single distance measure. The second issue is related to the intrinsic noise present in the system due to the stochastic nature of the processes conforming it, which may blur the evaluation of the triangle inequality. Below, we propose a way to overcome these two issues.

### Neural correlates of the inverse base rate effect [^1783d150]. Human Brain Mapping (2022). Medium credibility.

The inverse base rate effect (IBRE) is a nonrational behavioral phenomenon in predictive learning. Canonically, participants learn that the AB stimulus compound leads to one outcome and that AC leads to another outcome, with AB being presented three times as often as AC. When subsequently presented with BC, the outcome associated with AC is preferentially selected, in opposition to the underlying base rates of the outcomes. The current leading explanation is based on error-driven learning. A key component of this account is prediction error, a concept previously linked to a number of brain areas including the anterior cingulate, the striatum, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The present work is the first fMRI study to directly examine the IBRE. Activations were noted in brain areas linked to prediction error, including the caudate body, the anterior cingulate, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Analyzing the difference in activations for singular key stimuli (B and C), as well as frequency matched controls, supports the predictions made by the error-driven learning account.

For good exposure of the cranial side of the tumor invading the thoracic outlet and the caudal side of the tumor to the level of the inferior pulmonary vein (Fig. 1 a), we designed a sternotomy combined with a supraclavicular approach. The patient was placed in the supine position with the neck hyperextended and the head turned away from the involved side. After endotracheal intubation, a median sternal splitting was performed. Subsequently, a transverse incision was made from the upper edge of the right midpoint of the clavicle to the upper edge of the sternum, intersecting with the median sternotomy incision. After separating the subcutaneous tissue, the sternocleidomastoid muscle was transected above the clavicular tendon, exposing the scalenus anterior muscle, scalenus medius muscle, and subclavian arteries and veins. The sternum was then opened, and the incision near the sternoclavicular joint (forming an "inverted L" angle, Fig. 1 b) was retracted outward and upward to further expose the thoracic outlet. First, the tumor was dissected from the mediastinal structures, such as the hilum, superior vena cava, right innominate vein, and aortic arch. Next, the cranial side of the tumor adjacent to the subclavian vessels was carefully separated. The caudal side and lateral part of the tumor were then bluntly dissected from the upper lobe and chest wall. Finally, the tumor and the paraspinal portion were separated using blunt dissection and energy instruments.

### The geometric nature of weights in real complex networks [^72348287]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Since triangles are a reflection of the triangle inequality in the underlying metric space, we expect nodes forming triangles to be close to one another. Thus, the higher average normalized weight observed on triangles strongly suggests a metric nature of weights, which is not a trivial consequence of the relation between weights and topology. This leads us to formulate the hypothesis that the same underlying metric space ruling the network topology — inducing the existence of strong clustering as a reflection of the triangle inequality in the underlying geometry — is also inducing the observed correlation between ω norm and m. To prove this, we develop a realistic model of geometric weighted random networks, which allows us to estimate the coupling between weights and geometry in real networks.

A geometric model of weighted networks

Many models have been proposed to generate weighted networks. Among them, growing network modelsand the maximum-entropy class of models. However, none of them is general enough to reproduce simultaneously the topology and weighted structure of real weighted complex networks. We introduce a new model based on a class of random networks with hidden variables embedded in a metric spacethat overcomes these limitations. In this model, N nodes are uniformly distributed with constant density δ in a D -dimensional homogeneous and isotropic metric space (Supplementary Methods), and are assigned a hidden variable κ according to the probability density function (pdf) ρ (κ). Two nodes with hidden variables κ and κ ′ separated by a metric distance d are connected with a probability

where μ > 0 is a free parameter fixing the average degree and p (χ) is an arbitrary positive function taking values within the interval (0, 1). The free parameter μ can be chosen such that(κ) = κ. Hence, κ corresponds to the expected degree of nodes, so the degree distribution can be specified through the pdf ρ (κ), regardless of the specific form of p (χ) (Supplementary Methods). The freedom in the choice of p (χ) allows us to tune the level of coupling between the topology of the networks and the metric space, which in turn allows us to control many properties such as the clustering coefficient and the navigability.

### Proposal for a trigonometric method to evaluate the abduction angle of the lower limbs in neonates [^e01c6495]. Journal of Child Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

It is difficult to precisely measure articular arc movement in newborns using a goniometer. This article proposes an objective method based on trigonometry for the evaluation of lower limb abduction. With the newborn aligned in the dorsal decubitus position, 2 points are marked at the level of the medial malleolus, one on the sagittal line and the other at the end of the abduction. Using the right-sided line between these 2 points and a line from the medial malleolus to the reference point at the anterior superior iliac spine or umbilical scar, an isosceles triangle is drawn, and half of the inferential abduction angle is obtained by calculating the sine. Twenty healthy full-term newborns comprise the study cohort. Intersubject and intrasubject variability among the abduction angle values (mean [SD], 37 degrees [4] degrees) is low. This method is advantageous because the measurement is precise and because the sine can be used without approximation.

### Cutting edge or blunt instrument: how to decide if a stepped wedge design is right for you [^471f52f2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2021). High credibility.

When might I consider doing a stepped wedge trial?

Research designs are shaped as much by practical constraints as by abstract schemes, and it is always a good idea to start with the constraints and work towards a design, rather than start with a design and try to fit it to constraints. These constraints will be unique to each research context, and box 1 lists some areas to think about. Still, there are some common features of settings where a stepped wedge trial might be considered as a possible design, and we now review these.

Box 1
Practical constraints on the design of a longitudinal cluster randomised trial

Are there limits on the time available to complete the evaluation, on the number of clusters, or on the number of participants (or the rate at which you can recruit participants) at each cluster? These constraints put limits on the overall scale of the evaluation, or force trade-offs between different design characteristics.
How will participants and their data be sampled in your study: as a series of cross-sectional surveys, as a continuous stream of incident cases, as a cohort followed over time, or some other way? Does the timescale divide into cycles, seasons or milestones that influence how you will sample participants and data?
Is there a limit on how many clusters can implement the intervention at the same time in the evaluation? If this is constrained by research resources (eg, if there are only enough trained research staff to implement the intervention one cluster at a time) then implementation must be staggered in some way.
If implementation is to be staggered, is there a minimum 'step length'? If the same team delivers the intervention in different clusters at different steps, then bear in mind it may take some time to get the intervention fully operational at a site, and the team will also need time to relocate from one cluster to the next.

### Symmetry breaking in optimal transport networks [^30e99d16]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Engineering multilayer networks that efficiently connect sets of points in space is a crucial task in all practical applications that concern the transport of people or the delivery of goods. Unfortunately, our current theoretical understanding of the shape of such optimal transport networks is quite limited. Not much is known about how the topology of the optimal network changes as a function of its size, the relative efficiency of its layers, and the cost of switching between layers. Here, we show that optimal networks undergo sharp transitions from symmetric to asymmetric shapes, indicating that it is sometimes better to avoid serving a whole area to save on switching costs. Also, we analyze the real transportation networks of the cities of Atlanta, Boston, and Toronto using our theoretical framework and find that they are farther away from their optimal shapes as traffic congestion increases.

### Quantification of network structural dissimilarities [^3cf663e0]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Identifying and quantifying dissimilarities among graphs is a fundamental and challenging problem of practical importance in many fields of science. Current methods of network comparison are limited to extract only partial information or are computationally very demanding. Here we propose an efficient and precise measure for network comparison, which is based on quantifying differences among distance probability distributions extracted from the networks. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world networks show that this measure returns non-zero values only when the graphs are non-isomorphic. Most importantly, the measure proposed here can identify and quantify structural topological differences that have a practical impact on the information flow through the network, such as the presence or absence of critical links that connect or disconnect connected components.

### Determination of the true inclination angle of the main bronchi relative to the median sagittal plane for placement of a left-sided double-lumen tube [^249f5b65]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to determine the true inclination angle of the main bronchi relative to the median sagittal plane, using CT imaging to help increase accuracy of double-lumen tube (DLT) placement.

Design

In this retrospective study, 2 investigators independently measured normal chest CT scans from 50 male and 50 female patients. To determine the true AP axis, a mid-sagittal plane reference line (MSPRL) was drawn, intersecting the midsternum and the vertebral spinous process at the level of mid-carina. Lines were drawn through the center of each main bronchus to determine the inclination angle with regard to the MSPRL.

Setting

Research was conducted at a single institution, the Los Angeles County and University of Southern California Medical Center.

Participants

Normal chest CT images from 50 women and 50 men.

Main Results

The mean true inclination angle between the main bronchi and trachea in the mid-sagittal plane was 108.4° on the left compared with 96.2° on the right (p < 0.0001).

Interventions

No specific interventions were done because this was a retrospective study and CT scan analysis.

Conclusion

The data suggested that the trachea does not merely branch in the horizontal plane but branches posteriorly as well, with a true mean anatomic angle between the left main bronchus and trachea of 108.4°. This finding concurred with the authors' suggestion that the DLT be rotated to 110° counterclockwise instead of the routine practice of 90°. The authors suggest clinicians rotate the DLT an additional 20° counterclockwise and direct the top of the DLT to the 11 o'clock position.

### Dark matter maps reveal cosmic scaffolding [^972a9505]. Nature (2007). Excellent credibility.

Ordinary baryonic particles (such as protons and neutrons) account for only one-sixth of the total matter in the Universe. The remainder is a mysterious 'dark matter' component, which does not interact via electromagnetism and thus neither emits nor reflects light. As dark matter cannot be seen directly using traditional observations, very little is currently known about its properties. It does interact via gravity, and is most effectively probed through gravitational lensing: the deflection of light from distant galaxies by the gravitational attraction of foreground mass concentrations. This is a purely geometrical effect that is free of astrophysical assumptions and sensitive to all matter — whether baryonic or dark. Here we show high-fidelity maps of the large-scale distribution of dark matter, resolved in both angle and depth. We find a loose network of filaments, growing over time, which intersect in massive structures at the locations of clusters of galaxies. Our results are consistent with predictions of gravitationally induced structure formation, in which the initial, smooth distribution of dark matter collapses into filaments then into clusters, forming a gravitational scaffold into which gas can accumulate, and stars can be built.

### Rigorous location of phase transitions in hard optimization problems [^d98ebea5]. Nature (2005). Excellent credibility.

It is widely believed that for many optimization problems, no algorithm is substantially more efficient than exhaustive search. This means that finding optimal solutions for many practical problems is completely beyond any current or projected computational capacity. To understand the origin of this extreme 'hardness', computer scientists, mathematicians and physicists have been investigating for two decades a connection between computational complexity and phase transitions in random instances of constraint satisfaction problems. Here we present a mathematically rigorous method for locating such phase transitions. Our method works by analysing the distribution of distances between pairs of solutions as constraints are added. By identifying critical behaviour in the evolution of this distribution, we can pinpoint the threshold location for a number of problems, including the two most-studied ones: random k-SAT and random graph colouring. Our results prove that the heuristic predictions of statistical physics in this context are essentially correct. Moreover, we establish that random instances of constraint satisfaction problems have solutions well beyond the reach of any analysed algorithm.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### To improve quality, leverage design [^4a59f7b2]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2022). High credibility.

The DD model

The DD model is organised into four major stages — discover, define, develop and deliver. The two diamonds represent distinct periods of thinking — first to fully characterise the problem (discover, define), and then to craft human-centred solutions (develop, deliver). In the discovery and define periods, teams work to understand a process through the eyes of the user, conducting interviews and observations with users to generate insights about their behaviours and unmet needs and ultimately producing a shared problem definition. In DT, problems are often reframed as 'How might we… ' statements that foster a creative exploration of the challenge. In the develop and deliver stages, teams leverage their prior insights about unmet human needs to craft innovative solutions that directly address those needs, cocreating with users and other stakeholders to develop and test solution prototypes in a rapid, iterative fashion to identify and learn from early failures.

The diamond shape itself represents a key design principle — 'diverge, then converge'. In the diverging stages, teams capture and display as many ideas as possible without judgement, creating a psychologically safe space for creative exploration as all ideas are welcome. Once teams have 'diverged' in their thinking, they apply a more rigorous lens and 'converge' on a shared problem definition or chosen solution.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^9f543c96]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The severity of this problem's complexity is not additive or linear in nature, but interdependent on all of the sub-problems that need to be solved for this to work. Furthermore, adopting a solution might have unintended, if not non-linear, consequences to the system's overall outcome that were not obvious or foreseeable. For instance, allowing students to use their mobile phones in schools might seem like a good idea to improve class engagement through other media, but an unintended consequence might be distraction or discouraging deeper critical thinking. The objective of the NK space is to capture the complex interaction among activities that yield performance. The NK problem space's popularity in modeling human decision-making stems from its verisimilitude with the complex and multidimensional problems that face problem-solving tasks, and because researchers can easily generate a large number of statistically similar problem spaces for robustness checks. (We note, however, in order to make sure our results are not an artifact of the idiosyncrasies of the NK problem space, we replicated all of our results in another rugged problem space, the Traveling Salesperson Problem — findings available in Supplemental Methods in Supplementary Fig. 2 through 9 and 11).

### Femoral head-neck offset measurements in 339 subjects: distribution and implications for femoroacetabular impingement [^42f34d47]. Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The α-angle is a frequently used measurement to quantify head-neck offset pathology in cam-type femoroacetabular impingement. However, diverging norm values and reference intervals have been described, especially in men.

Methods

The α-angle, the head-neck offset ratio and the triangular index were measured on anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of 339 (170 men and 169 women) subjects without evident underlying hip pathology.

Results

For male subjects, the mean α-angle was 49.4° (SD 10.5°) on anteroposterior and 49.1° (SD 10.6°) on lateral radiographs, whereas for female subjects, it was 45.0° (SD 8.0°) and 46.1° (SD 9.9°), respectively. Thus, calculated upper limits of reference intervals in the population screened were 70° for both radiographic projections in men and 61° (anteroposterior) and 66° (lateral) in women.

Conclusion

These data substantiate recent findings that the pathological threshold of the α-angle in male subjects may be lower than that previously assumed.

### What's right when the gallbladder's left? A case report [^12ffbf37]. Surgical Endoscopy (2002). Low credibility.

During laparoscopic cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis in a 40-year-old woman, we came upon a case of incidentally discovered left-sided gallbladder (LSG). Two anatomic variants of LSG are known: (a) "true LSG", in which, according to Gross, an accessory gallbladder originates from the left hepatic duct (LHD), the right embryonic bud is readsorbed, and the cystic duct joins either the CBD from the left or the LHD directly. Otherwise, a normal right-sided gallbladder adheres to the inferior left hepatic lobe, and the cystic duct joins the CBD from the right side (as in our case); (b) gallbladder under the fourth hepatic segment, medial to a right-sided round ligament, probably resulting from a prenatal obliteration of the right umbilical vein. Left-sided gallbladder is a paraphysiologic condition that when identified before surgery, must be studied by CT or MRI, when incidentally discovered during surgery must be promptly recognized by the surgeon, who must be aware of the unpredictable confluence of the cystic duct into the CBD. The following operative precautions are useful for avoiding a lesion of the CBD: The surgeon should start dissection of Calot's triangle as close as possible to the gallbladder margin, prepare and clip the cystic duct as close as possible to the infundibulum, and a 30 degrees angled telescope. If in doubt, the surgeon should perform an intraoperative cholangiography.

### Probabilistic alignment of multiple networks [^f4880076]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Sampling the space of plausible alignments

By analogy to statistical mechanics, we can associate an "energy"to each blueprint-permutation pair (L, { π k }), so that their posterior is writtenand the energycan be obtained directly from Eq. (6). In this interpretation, the best alignment is the blueprint-permutation pair that minimizes. Importantly, this equivalence enables us to sample over the space of alignments (L, { π k }) using Markov chain Monte Carlo("Methods"; see Supplementary Material and Fig. fig:time_size for the algorithmic complexity of our tool). The sampling of equilibrium alignments from this space allows us to approach the network alignment problem in ways other than just finding the single best alignment.

In particular, by sampling alignments from the posterior distribution, we can estimate the probability p (π k (i k) = i L ∣{ A k }) that node i k in network A k is mapped to node i L in the blueprint as the fraction of sampled permutations in which π k (i k) = i L. Then, we can estimate the most probable mapping for each node π k,⋆ (i k) as the one that maximizes p (π (i k) = i L ∣{ A k }) (Methods). As we show below, in noisy observations, the most plausible alignment does not necessarily recover the ground truth mapping of nodes. This is because for nodes with few connections, copy error can introduce a degree of ambiguity and degeneration in the mappings of node identities. However, we find that the most probable mapping of each individual node recovers the ground truth for their mapping more reliably (Fig. 2). This is, in fact, an expected result from using a probabilistic approach: averages over the ensemble of possible alignments are more accurate at predicting hidden information (in this case, node mappings to the blueprint) than single point estimates (that is, the best alignment) (see for instance Ref.for a discussion in the context of link prediction).

### Assessment of needle tip deflection during transrectal guided prostate biopsy: implications for targeted biopsies [^617c7ae7]. Journal of Endourology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To measure needle tip deflection during transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) prostate biopsy and evaluate predictors for needle tip deflection.

Materials and Methods

Analysis of 568 prostate biopsies obtained from 51 consecutive patients who underwent a standard 12-core TRUS guided prostate biopsy. TRUS guided prostate biopsies were performed using BK flex500, with a side-fire biplane probe. Each biopsy core image was captured and clinical data were recorded prospectively. The angle between the expected trajectory of the needle and actual needle course was measured using the longitudinal view of the captured image. The distance between expected and actual needle tip was calculated. We measured median and interquartile needle tip deflection rate stratified by side and location (apex, midgland, base). Univariable and multivariable linear regressions analysis were performed.

Results

The overall median needle tip deflection was 1.77mm (IQR 1.35–2.47). Location did not significantly alter needle deflection measurements. On multivariable linear regression analysis, higher prostate volume (B = 0.007 95%, CI 0.004, 0.011; p < 0.001) and the right sided biopsy (B = 0.191 95%, CI 0.047, 0.336; p = 0.010) emerged as predictors of higher needle tip deflection.

Conclusions

To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to measure needle tip deflection during TRUS guided prostate biopsies. We demonstrated that larger prostate size and biopsy side may affect the accuracy of biopsies. These results may have clinical implication to those performing targeted biopsies.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^77613a31]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Here, however, we find quite different results: intermixing hampers systemic performance. Furthermore, there is a tradeoff in systemic performance over time, as seen in Fig. 6b. Networks with some form of intermixing perform better in the short-run. However, the network with the minimal possible intermixing performs worse in the short-run but best in the long-run. In other words, this suggests an "all or nothing" trade-off over time: the configuration with the least amount of intermixing possible (minimal) performs worse in the short-run, but better in the long-run, while any gradation of increased intermixing yields the same rank-ordering in performance as their counterpart networks in the diversity of ability simulations.

Agents in the intermixed network setups explore for solutions early on in the simulation, which is a double-edged sword. In the short-run, with more intermixing, agents quickly turn to exploitation, as they merely take solutions that are marginally better relative to other setups but are still mediocre in absolute terms. Said differently, agents in setups with at least some intermixing quickly coalesce to whatever the few agents that did explore the problem space found, which are often not the best solutions possible. So, exploring the problem space using worse solutions often leads to modest gains. However, the agents in setups with minimal intermixing are more commonly exploring, rather than exploiting, because their neighbors' initial solutions are less optimal than their counterparts in intermixed networks. This is because there is minimal exposure to diversity in these minimal setups, which inadvertently produces poor solutions in the short-run but allows for more exploration to find better solutions in the long-run. In other words, by finding better solutions through exploration, agents more often uncover pathways to better solutions earlier on. The end result is that the long-run performance of setups with minimal intermixing is best.

### Microstructural parameter estimation in vivo using diffusion MRI and structured prior information [^8d3a55fa]. Magnetic Resonance in Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

RESULTS

Figure 3 shows histograms of sampled axon radii from the synthetic data. At the low end of the scale, precision is too poor to distinguish radii of 1 and 3 μm (H = 0.84, using bins of width 0.25 μm); and at the high end, the influence of the prior forces underestimation of very large radii of above 15 μm. However, radii of 3, 5, 10, and 15 μm are clearly discriminable, with sample medians closely approximating the true, generative radius in each of these cases (H = 0.41 between 3 and 5 μm; H = 0.12 between 5 and 10 μm; H = 0.44 between 10 and 15 μm). When the synthetic substrate contains a gamma distribution of radii, as shown in the bottom part of the figure, there is a bias in the posterior distributions, but it remains possible to distinguish larger radii from smaller ones. Figure 4 demonstrates that much greater precision is available at 3 μm when gradient strengths increase to 300 mT m, but it improves still further when prior information is used.

Figure 3
Histograms of sampled posterior axon radius values from our synthetic data, using a single fixed cylinder radius (top) or a gamma distribution of radii (bottom). For the former, samples cover ten axon orientations at each radius. For the latter, the generative distributions (shown) have means of 3, 5, and 8 μm, and variances of 2.5 μm.

Figure 4

In each case, samples are shown from fits performed both with (blue) and without (red) applying the gamma prior distribution on R. The true generative axon radius was 3 μm, and samples cover ten axon orientations. Only samples below 8 μm are shown. Note that the y ‐axis in the upper plot is broken to accommodate a very tall bar.

### Covariant spatio-temporal receptive fields for spiking neural networks [^3fb65f12]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Dataset

We simulate an event-based dataset consisting of sparse shape contours, as shown in Fig. 8, based on ref. Events are generated by applying some transformation A to the shapes and subtracting two subsequent frames. We then integrate those differences over time until for each pixel, until reaching a certain threshold and emitting events of either positive or negative polarity. This approximates the dynamics of event cameras, which emit discrete events when the intensity changes by a certain threshold. To obtain sub-pixel accuracy, we perform all transformations in a high-resolution space of 2400 × 2400 pixels, which is downsampled bilinearly to the dataset resolution of 300 × 300.

Fig. 8
Image snapshots from the two synthetic datasets used in this work.

The top row shows the four different spatial scaling, corresponding to shapes of 10, 20, 40, and 80 pixels. The bottom row shows the four different temporal velocities, corresponding to a change of 0.16, 0.32, 0.64, and 1.28 pixels per timestep. Both datasets are extremely sparse, with the shapes barely visible in the images. At larger temporal velocities, the shapes become more discernible.

We use three simple geometries, a triangle, a square, and a circle, that are translated with random motion sampled from the same uniform distribution. The shapes are positioned randomly in the image and oriented by a random, fixed angle. Two datasets are studied: one with varying spatial scales and one with varying temporal velocities. In the spatial scale dataset, the starting scale of the shape is logarithmically distributed from 10 to 80 pixels. In the temporal velocity dataset, the shapes scale logarithmically from ± 0.16 to ± 1.28 pixels. The velocities are normalized to the subsampled pixel space such that, for translational velocity, for example, a velocity of one in the x -axis corresponds to the shape moving one pixel in the x -axis per timestep. The velocity parameterizes the sparsity of the temporal scaling dataset, as seen in the bottom row in Fig. 8 panel, where the shape contours in the left panels are barely visible compared to the faster-moving objects in the right panels. To simulate noise, we add 5 ‰ Bernoulli-distributed background noise.

### Modified surface measurement method to determine catheter tip position of totally implantable venous access port through right subclavian vein [^a875649c]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Optimal catheter tip position of a totally implantable venous access port (TIVAP) is important to maintain its function and to avoid severe complications. In this study, we aimed to assess the reliability of a modified surface measurement method to determine optimal tip position of a TIVAP catheter inserted through the right subclavian vein.

Methods

Clinical and radiologic information of 105 patients who underwent TIVAP implantation through the right subclavian vein was collected retrospectively. The length of the implanted catheter was determined by a modified surface measurement method, as follows. The distance from the puncture point (point A) to the middle point of the sternal notch (point B), then from the middle point of the sternal notch (point B) to the middle point of Louis angle (point C) was added up. The equation for the catheter length is given by catheter length (cm) = AB + BC + 3. Postprocedure plain chest radiography (CXR) and enhanced chest computed tomography (CT) were used to check the catheter tip position and to calculate optimal position rate. Distance from the carina to the catheter tip and the length of the vertebral body unit were measured on both CXR and CT. Distances from carina to caval-atrial junction (CAJ) and from catheter tip to CAJ were measured on CT.

Results

Mean length of the implanted catheter of all patients was 17.0 ± 0.7 cm (male vs female, 17.3 ± 0.5 cm vs 16.7 ± 0.7 cm; P < .001). On CXR, a catheter tip located within 2.4 vertebral body units below the carina was identified as the optimal position, and the optimal position rate was 97.1% (102/105 cases). On CT, two definitions of optimal position were used: within 2 cm above or below the CAJ and within 2 cm above or at the CAJ; the optimal position rate was 92.4% (97/105 cases) and 78.1% (82/105 cases), respectively. Median follow-up time was 9.4 months. During the follow-up, no severe cardiac complication was recorded.

Conclusions

### Orientation of the uterine fundus in reference to the longitudinal axis of the body: a 3-dimensional sonographic study [^09c73593]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this pilot study was to measure the angle of rotation of the uterus at the fundus from horizontal using 3-dimensional sonography in women presenting for annual gynecologic examinations.

Methods

A total of 51 patients participated in the study. All patients underwent transvaginal sonography, and 3-dimensional volumes were acquired. The cervicouterine angle and the angle of rotation at the fundus were measured.

Results

The uteri were noted to be anteverted in 64.7%, retroverted in 25.5%, and euverted in 9.8%. They were noted to be pointing toward the right side of the pelvis in 49.0%, to the left side in 39.2%, and at the midline in 11.8%. The median cervicouterine angle was 122° (interquartile range [IQR], 105°-137°). The median angle of rotation at the fundus away from horizontal in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction on the transverse B-plane was 10.4° (IQR, 7.1°-19.0°), with a maximal angle of 43°, and on the coronal C-plane, it was 10.0° (IQR, 3.0°-20.0°), with a maximal angle of 43°. Noneuverted uteri were more likely to be rotated at the fundus.

Conclusions

Our study reveals that, contrary to traditional thinking, the uterus can be rotated at the fundus in relation to the body (z-axis) along the longitudinal axis of the cervical canal.

### Investigating suspected cancer clusters and responding to community concerns: guidelines from CDC and the council of state and territorial epidemiologists [^945666c0]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Cancer cluster investigation — Step 2 decision to close or proceed to Step 3 is based on multiple factors, and to interpret the standardized incidence ratio (SIR) the health agency must assess whether there are enough cases and population for statistical stability and, in general, that the population size of a typical census tract is the smallest denominator that will allow reliable results; if the numerator allows stability, agencies should consider whether the 95% CI exclude 1.0, along with environmental contaminants, population changes, and other information beyond the SIR to estimate whether cancers represent an excess and share a common etiology. A SIR of limited magnitude that is not statistically significant with lack of known contaminant association and no increasing trend justifies closing at Step 2, whereas a statistically significant SIR of great magnitude with an increasing trend and a known contaminant argues for continuing to Step 3; example thresholds indicate that an SIR of < 2.0 with CIs surrounding or overlapping 1.0 and < 10 cases might justify closing, while an SIR of > 4 with CIs not overlapping 1.0 and ≥ 10 etiologically linked cases should encourage advancing to Step 3.

Fig. 4
Pearson correlations found during the validation step. The correlations with 95% confidence intervals for method (M) 1 are shown with an x marker, for method 2 with square markers, for method 3 with circle markers and for method 4 with plus sign markers. For each method, except for method 1, the correlations for coronal (Cor), sagittal (Sag) and transversal (Tra) intracranial areas are presented from left to right. The dashed line marks the y-coordinate for correlations of 0.99

Starting side

See Table 1. For method 3 with sagittal ICAs, there was a negligible difference in the correlation to fully delineated ICV between using the position indices consistently from the patients' left and from the right, respectively. When using the indices randomly from either the patients' left or right, the correlation dropped slightly.

Comparison of correlations

Figure 5 visualises the confidence intervals for the differences in correlations among methods 2, 3 and 4. With 95% confidence, method 4 with sagittal ICAs will result in estimates that have a higher correlation to fully delineated ICVs than all other estimates, except those from method 3 with sagittal ICAs.

Fig. 5
Comparison of correlations. With 95% confidence, the actual differences in correlations between methods 2 to 4 (M2–4) are within the height of the plotted boxes. The unit of the y-axes is the Pearson correlation and ranges between −0.1 and 0.1. Above each plot, the confidence intervals are also given in numbers rounded to the nearest thousandth. The titles of the columns tell which correlation was used as minuend and the titles of the rows which correlation was used as subtrahend when calculating the confidence intervals. The planes denote a correlation difference of zero and are red when the confidence intervals pass through zero, indicating that the actual difference between the two compared methods might be zero.

2.2		Recommended Dose for Chronic Sialorrhea

Chronic Sialorrhea in Adult Patients

The recommended total dose per treatment session is 100 Units. XEOMIN is injected into the parotid and submandibular glands on both sides (i.e., 4 injection sites per treatment session). The recommended total dose per treatment session is 100 Units. The dose is divided with a ratio of 3:2 between the parotid and submandibular glands (Table 1).

Figure 1: Glands for Injection in Chronic Sialorrhea in Adult Patients

Use the following guidelines if locating salivary glands using anatomic landmarks:

To inject the parotid gland, find the midpoint on the line connecting the tragus and mandible angle (Site A and B, respectively, Figure 1), approximately at the height of the ear lobe. Deliver the injection one finger breadth anterior to this site (Star 1, Figure 1).
To inject the submandibular gland, find the midpoint between the angle of the mandible and the tip of the chin (Site B and C, respectively, Figure 1). Deliver the injection one finger breadth medial to the inferior surface of the mandible at this site (Star 2, Figure 1).

The concentration used in the clinical study after reconstitution was 5 Units/0.1mL. Determine the timing for repeat treatment based on the actual clinical need of the individual patient, and no sooner than every 16 weeks.

Chronic Sialorrhea in Pediatric Patients

XEOMIN is injected into the parotid and submandibular glands on both sides (i.e., 4 injection sites per treatment session). Ultrasound imaging is recommended to guide needle placement into the salivary glands. The body-weight adjusted dose is divided with a ratio of 3:2 between the parotid and submandibular glands (Table 2). XEOMIN has not been studied in children weighing less than 12 kg [see Clinical Studies (14.1)].

### Iliofemoral venous configurations from three-dimensional computed tomography venogram and their relevance to stent design [^a2021c7a]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Iliofemoral venous stenting has become the standard of care for patients presenting with quality-of-life impairing symptoms of chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction not responding to conservative measures. This has led to an increased use of venous stenting over the last several years. However, iliofemoral venous anatomy in patients requiring such intervention remains poorly elucidated. This study attempts to fill that gap.

Methods

Twenty-two consecutive patients with intravascular ultrasound examination-confirmed chronic iliofemoral venous obstruction underwent three-dimensional reconstruction of their computed tomography venogram images. Relevant angles, tortuosity (tort index-ratio between centerline length, and straight line length), lengths, and diameters were computed and analyzed. We used t tests for comparisons between the right and left sides. A P value of .05 or less was considered significant.

Results

Of the angles calculated, the median of the angles between the horizontal and common iliac vein (CIV) was 66° on the right and 60° on the left (P < .01). The median inferior vena cava-CIV angle was 172° on the right and 165° on the left (P < .0001). The CIV-EIV angle was 159° on the right and 151° on the L (P = 0.01). Overall, the median tortuosity was 1.07 on the right and 1.12 on the left (P = 0.007). The median centerline length of the CIV was 42mm on the right and 60mm on the left (P < .0001). The median external iliac vein length was 73 mm on the right and 88 mm on the left (P < .0001). The overall median iliac vein length was 220 mm on the right and 237 mm on the left (P < .01). The median diameters of the inferior vena cava at the iliocaval confluence, 20, 40, and 60 mm cranial to the confluence, were 23, 20, 22, and 23 mm, respectively.

Conclusions

Overall, the left side has steeper angles, greater tortuosity, and longer lengths than the right side. These disparities should be considered during femoroiliocaval stent construction.

### Probabilistic alignment of multiple networks [^39aa70ac]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The network alignment problem appears in many areas of science and involves finding the optimal mapping between nodes in two or more networks, so as to identify corresponding entities across networks. We propose a probabilistic approach to the problem of network alignment, as well as the corresponding inference algorithms. Unlike heuristic approaches, our approach is transparent in that all model assumptions are explicit; therefore, it is susceptible of being extended and fine tuned by incorporating contextual information that is relevant to a given alignment problem. Also in contrast to current approaches, our method does not yield a single alignment, but rather the whole posterior distribution over alignments. We show that using the whole posterior leads to correct matching of nodes, even in situations where the single most plausible alignment mismatches them. Our approach opens the door to a whole new family of network alignment algorithms, and to their application to problems for which existing methods are perhaps inappropriate.

### Radiological indicators and a novel combined predictive model for anticipating difficult laryngoscopy in cervical spondylosis patients: a prospective cohort study [^ebfa2632]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

According the anatomical causes of difficult laryngoscopy, we focused on the significant area between the mandible and the thyroid cartilage in the extended head position on lateral cervical X-rays. A line connecting the mentum to the mandibular angle (Line AB) could represent the oral axis, while a line connecting the mandibular angle to the anterior border of the thyroid cartilage (Line BC) could represent the pharyngeal axis. We termed the angle between Line AB and Line BC as the Larynx-Mandibular Angle Test (LMAT). Subsequently, we constructed a vertical line (Line CD) from the thyroid prominence to Line AB, intersecting at Point D (Fig. 1). The vector from the mandibular angle to the intersection point D was termed as the Larynx-Mandibula Height Test (LMHT), with the direction towards the mentum considered positive and oppositive direction considered negative. These radiological parameters above could provide a comprehensive assessment of the submandibular space, cervical spine mobility and the alignment between the oral and pharyngeal axes, We hypothesized that these radiological parameters might become an important factor in predicting difficult laryngoscopy and serve as surrogates for conventional bedside physical examinations.

### Doravirine (Pifeltro) [^949aa31a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1	Clinical Trial Results in Adults with No Antiretroviral Treatment History

The efficacy of PIFELTRO is based on the analyses of 96-week data from two randomized, multicenter, double-blind, active controlled Phase 3 trials (DRIVE-FORWARD, NCT02275780 and DRIVE-AHEAD, NCT02403674) in participants living with HIV with no antiretroviral treatment history (n = 1494).

In DRIVE-FORWARD, 766 participants were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either PIFELTRO once daily or darunavir 800 mg + ritonavir 100 mg (DRV+r) once daily each in combination with emtricitabine/tenofovir DF (FTC/TDF) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) selected by the investigator. At baseline, the median age of participants was 33 years, 16% were female, 27% were Non-White, 4% had hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 10% had a history of AIDS, 20% had HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies/mL, 86% had CD4+ T-cell count greater than 200 cells/mm3, 13% received ABC/3TC, and 87% received FTC/TDF; these characteristics were similar between treatment groups.

In DRIVE-AHEAD, 728 participants were randomized and received at least 1 dose of either DELSTRIGO (DOR/3TC/TDF) or EFV 600 mg/FTC 200 mg/TDF 300 mg once daily. At baseline, the median age of participants was 31 years, 15% were female, 52% were Non-White, 3% had hepatitis B or C co-infection, 14% had a history of AIDS, 21% had HIV-1 RNA greater than 100,000 copies/mL, and 88% had CD4+ T-cell count greater than 200 cells/mm3; these characteristics were similar between treatment groups.

Week 96 outcomes for DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD are provided in Table 10. Side-by-side tabulation is to simplify presentation; direct comparisons across trials should not be made due to differing trial designs.

In DRIVE-FORWARD, the mean CD4+ T-cell counts in the PIFELTRO and DRV+r groups increased from baseline by 224 and 207 cells/mm3, respectively.

In DRIVE-AHEAD, the mean CD4+ T-cell counts in the DELSTRIGO and EFV/FTC/TDF groups increased from baseline by 238 and 223 cells/mm3, respectively.

The upper and lower bounds of the box refer to the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the line intersection in the box refers to the median. The dots outside of whiskers refer to outlying step counts.

Step count was available for 218 (99.1%) participants at baseline, 195 (88.6%) participants at 6-months, and 194 (88.2%) participants at both time points (Supplementary Table 1). Baseline step count was 6911.4 (SD 3190.1) steps for participants in the control group and 7294.9 (SD 3665.0) steps for participants in the intervention group. At 3-months, in a univariate analysis, step count increased for participants in the intervention group [7652.9 (SD 3918.2) steps] but decreased for the control group [6636.4 (SD 3671.1)] (p = 0.05 for comparison of 3-month step count) though the change in step count from baseline to 3-months was not significantly different between the two groups (intervention versus control group: + 359.4 steps Apple Watch, 95% CI −455.1 to 1173.8; + 298.1 steps Fitbit, 95% CI −797.8 to 1394.1; p = 0.59).

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2020). High credibility.

ASE recommendations on plaque height measurement — We recommend that plaque thickness (also known as height) be measured as the initial 2-dimensional approach for quantification of carotid ultrasound plaque, and though plaque height is often measured from 2D images, it can be obtained from a 3D image acquisition when available, to overcome the out-of-plane limitations of 2D imaging. The maximal plaque height should be measured from the side in which a plaque is detected (unilateral) or from both the right and left carotid arterial segments (bilateral) using a caliper placed at the adventitial plane and extending into the center of the lumen at right angles to the vessel wall, and for standardization the measurement should be taken from any segment of the long and short axis of the carotid artery (bulb, ICA, CCA) with the view segment reported accordingly; this measurement begins at the same plane as where the carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) measurement begins to be consistent with defining plaque beyond the CIMT threshold of > 1.5 mm.

The current antibiotic resistance crisis has led to increased pressure to prioritize strategies to tackle the issue, with a strong focus being placed on the development of novel antimicrobials. However, one major obstacle that is often overlooked is persister cells, which are refractory to antibiotic treatment. Tackling persistence is a challenge because these cell types are extremely difficult to study and, consequently, little is known about their physiology and the factors that lead to their emergence. Here, four experts contemplate the main physiological features that define persistence and the implications of persistence for antibiotic treatment regimens, and consider what the study of bacterial persistence has taught us about the heterogeneity of bacterial populations.

### Clustering knowledge and dispersing abilities enhances collective problem solving in a network [^a4ac9110]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

NK spaces are analytically useful for agent-based models but are conceptually abstract and difficult to ground to real-world examples. Here, we can instead understand an NK problem's complexity in terms of how incremental contributions made by any subset of activities are also contingent on other activities. Thus, a solution that an agent comes up within the NK space — captured by a unique sequence of 1s and 0s — reflects a basket of activities people undertake to solve a real-world problem, where a 1 represents the presence of an activity and a 0 its absence.

There are many examples of social collectives solving a common problem that are analogous to the NK space setup. In these instances, the solutions and performances are visible at least some subset of other actors, and there are no positive or negative externalities from one actor to another (beyond the informational spillover). For instance, consider national ministries of health of various countries. They all have different approaches to healthcare (e.g. insurance markets like in Germany or Austria or a single-public option like in Canada or the U.K.). And the improvement or decline of one country's healthcare does not adversely affect or hamper the healthcare of another. The interest of some countries in the policies employed by other countries may be limited by physical adjacency or similar political systems or cultures, so their information about the "problem space" is more localized.

### Dislocations in bilayer graphene [^b6e094c6]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

Dislocations represent one of the most fascinating and fundamental concepts in materials science. Most importantly, dislocations are the main carriers of plastic deformation in crystalline materials. Furthermore, they can strongly affect the local electronic and optical properties of semiconductors and ionic crystals. In materials with small dimensions, they experience extensive image forces, which attract them to the surface to release strain energy. However, in layered crystals such as graphite, dislocation movement is mainly restricted to the basal plane. Thus, the dislocations cannot escape, enabling their confinement in crystals as thin as only two monolayers. To explore the nature of dislocations under such extreme boundary conditions, the material of choice is bilayer graphene, the thinnest possible quasi-two-dimensional crystal in which such linear defects can be confined. Homogeneous and robust graphene membranes derived from high-quality epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide provide an ideal platform for their investigation. Here we report the direct observation of basal-plane dislocations in freestanding bilayer graphene using transmission electron microscopy and their detailed investigation by diffraction contrast analysis and atomistic simulations. Our investigation reveals two striking size effects. First, the absence of stacking-fault energy, a unique property of bilayer graphene, leads to a characteristic dislocation pattern that corresponds to an alternating AB B[Symbol: see text]AC change of the stacking order. Second, our experiments in combination with atomistic simulations reveal a pronounced buckling of the bilayer graphene membrane that results directly from accommodation of strain. In fact, the buckling changes the strain state of the bilayer graphene and is of key importance for its electronic properties. Our findings will contribute to the understanding of dislocations and of their role in the structural, mechanical and electronic properties of bilayer and few-layer graphene.

### Reintegrating space and object representations in patients with hemispatial neglect: two case studies [^cc68a18a]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

This article examines the effectiveness of differentiated rehabilitation programmes for patients with two distinct types of hemispatial neglect: body-centred and object-focused. We hypothesized that patients with body-centred neglect would respond to motor-control programmes designed for patients with limb apraxia, while those with object-focused neglect would require visually oriented therapy.

Material and Methods

The article describes the rehabilitation of two patients treated by the authors 6–9 months after right-hemisphere infarct. Both showed significant left-sided hemispatial neglect: body-centred in one case (patient BC), object-focused in the other (patient OF). A modified AB-BA experimental design was used, where A represents visual training, and B is spatio-motor training. For patient BC, the sequence was A-B; for patient OF, B-A. Neglect was measured using standard tests for neglect and the analysis of drawings made during therapy by both patients.

Results

As hypothesized, patient BC showed no progress after conclusion of programme A, while after programme B she showed virtually no lingering neglect. In the case of patient OF, the results were exactly reversed.

Conclusions

Body-centred neglect is essentially a defect in space formation, while object-focused neglect is a disorder of object formation. The patients described here both benefited from neuropsychological therapy for neglect, but not from the same programme.

### Ethical approach for managing patient-physician conflict and ending the patient-physician relationship: ACOG committee statement no. 3 [^271313f2]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Background — sources and framing of patient–physician conflict note that "in the clinical setting, conflicts may arise for various reasons, including disagreements regarding diagnosis and treatment plans; differing expectations; a breakdown in communication; disagreements about or nonadherence to the therapeutic plan; repeated missed appointments; failure to pay bills; conflicts of cultural, religious, or other personally held beliefs…; and disruptive or abusive behavior by patients", that it is "more accurate to regard conflict as the result of a difficult relationship between the patient and the physician", that "for most conflicts, it is desirable to attempt to restore a therapeutic relationship even when it may be difficult to do so", yet "some situations make termination of the patient–physician relationship not only reasonable, but necessary", and that the Committee provides "an ethical framework" and "guidance for the ethical termination of care… including institutional responsibilities".

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^ccd7145f]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Best Practices Guidelines for Trauma Center Recognition: Documentation — pediatric abuse evaluations emphasize complete, recorded examinations; "documentation of a genital exam is recorded in only 50–60% of suspected PCA patients", so clinicians are directed to "Ensure that every potentially abused patient has a comprehensive physical examination that is documented", with pediatric elements including "Complete neurologic examination ("sleeping calmly" is not acceptable)", "A complete disrobed skin examination (including the back, ears, and scalp) with a detailed description of bruising (location, pattern, size, colors, and distribution if multiple) or lack of bruising if it is not seen", "Description of cutaneous lesions (including location, size, and color)", "A detailed perineal examination detailing the presence of perianal lesions or injuries to the genitalia", "Growth parameters (height, weight, head circumference)", and "Fundoscopic examination (ideally by an ophthalmologist – see page 25 Eye Findings in Abusive Head Trauma)". The page further advises correct orientation when describing sidedness: "Pay particular attention when describing left- or right-sided injuries, ensuring that all references are oriented to the patient's left and right", noting that "Discrepancies in documentation of injury sidedness raise questions about the reliability of the health professional's documentation".

Step 5: Giving the Injection

ARCALYST is given by injection into the tissue directly under the skin (subcutaneous injection). Do not inject ARCALYST into any muscle, vein, or artery.

 You should change (rotate) the injection site each time you inject ARCALYST. If you need to use 2 vials and give 2 injections for your or your child's prescribed dose of ARCALYST, you should use 2 different injection sites.

Changing injection sites helps to prevent irritation and allows the medicine to be completely absorbed. Ask your or your child's healthcare provider if you have any questions about changing injection sites. Do not inject within a 2-inch area around the belly button.
Do not inject into skin that is tender, red, or hard. If an area is tender or feels hardened, choose another site for injection until the tenderness or hardening goes away.
Tell your or your child's healthcare provider about any skin reactions including redness, swelling, or hardening of the skin.
Areas where you may inject ARCALYST include the left and right sides of the abdomen, and the left and right thighs. If you are giving the injection to your child or someone else, the upper left and right arms may also be used for injection (see Figure Y):
Choose the area for the injection. Clean the area in a circular motion with a new alcohol wipe. Begin at the center of the injection site and move outward. Let the alcohol air dry completely.
Remove the needle cover and hold the syringe in one hand like you would hold a pencil.
With the other hand, gently pinch a fold of skin at the cleaned injection site (see Figure Z).
Use a quick "dart like" motion to insert the needle straight into the skin at a 90-degree angle (see Figure AA). Do not push down on the plunger while inserting the needle into the skin.

### Patella malalignment, pain and patellofemoral progression: the health ABC study [^7f5a9dfb]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Patellofemoral (PF) joint osteoarthritis (OA) is strongly correlated with lower extremity disability and knee pain. Risk factors for pain and structural progression in PF OA are poorly understood. Our objective was to determine the association between patella malalignment and its relation to pain severity, and PF OA disease progression.

Methods

We conducted an analysis of data from the Health ABC knee OA study. Health ABC is a community based, multi-center cohort study of 3075 Caucasian and Black men and women aged 70–79 at enrollment. Weight bearing skyline knee X-rays were obtained in a subset (595) of subjects, with and without knee pain, at year 2 and year 5 (mean follow-up 36 months). Films were read paired, and PF osteophytes (OST) and joint space narrowing (JSN) were scored on a 0–3 scale using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International atlas. We defined progression of PF OA as any increase in JSN score. Three measures of patella malalignment were made: sulcus angle; patella tilt angle; and patella subluxation medially or laterally (bisect offset). Knee symptoms were assessed using a knee specific Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) knee pain subscale. We assessed the relationship between baseline patella malalignment and pain severity (linear regression for WOMAC) and compartment specific PF OA progression (logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes). We classified continuous measures of patella alignment into quartile groups. We performed multivariable adjusted logistic regression models, including age, gender and body mass index (BMI) to assess the relation of baseline patella alignment to the occurrence of PF JSN progression using generalized estimating equations (GEE).

Results

The subjects had a mean age 73.6 (SD 2.9), BMI 28.8 (SD 4.9), 40.3% male, and 46% were Black. Medial displacement of the patella predisposed to medial JSN progression; odds for each quartile 1, 1.2, 1.2, 2.2 (P for trend = 0.03), whilst protecting from lateral JSN progression; odds for each quartile 1, 0.7, 0.6, 0.4 (P for trend = 0.0004). Increasing patella tilt protected from medial JSN progression; odds for each quartile 1, 0.8, 0.5, 0.2 (P < 0.0001) and trended to increasing pain severity (P = 0.09).

Conclusion

Patella malalignment is associated with PF disease progression. Medial displacement and tilt of the patella predisposes to medial JSN progression, whilst lateral displacement is predictive of lateral JSN progression. The influence of patella malalignment has important implications since it is potentially modifiable through footwear, taping and/or knee bracing.
