## Question

Aubrey has a deck of cards with 52 cards in it. She then adds two additional cards to the deck. If she splits the deck evenly among herself and two other players, how many cards does each player have?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how many cards each player gets when Aubrey starts with a 52-card deck, adds 2 more cards, and then splits the total evenly among herself and two other players. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the total number of cards after adding the two extra cards. Then, I should verify the number of players among whom the cards are being divided. Next, I will perform the division and check whether it results in a whole number. Finally, I will state the answer clearly and confirm it makes sense in context.

> Let me first confirm the total number of cards. Starting with 52 cards and adding 2 more gives 52 + 2 = 54 cards total, so the deck now has 54 cards.

> Wait, let me verify the number of players. The problem says the deck is split evenly among herself and two other players, which means 1 + 2 = 3 players total.

> I will now examine the division. Splitting 54 cards evenly among 3 players means 54 ÷ 3 = 18 cards per player. Hold on, I should verify that this is indeed a whole number and that there is no remainder; 3 × 18 = 54, so the division is exact and each player receives the same number of cards.

> Therefore, each player gets 18 cards.

---

Each player receives **18 cards**. The total number of cards is 52 + 2 = 54, and dividing 54 cards evenly among 3 players gives 54 ÷ 3 = 18 cards per player.

---

## Step-by-step solution

- **Initial number of cards**: 52
- **Additional cards added**: 2
- **Total number of cards**: 52 + 2 = 54
- **Number of players**: 3 (Aubrey and two other players)
- **Cards per player**: 54 ÷ 3 = 18

---

## Conclusion

Each player, including Aubrey, will have **18 cards**.

### Mapping computational cognitive profiles of aging to dissociable brain and sociodemographic factors [^58c0dcf2]. Npj Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

The model calculates the probabilities associated with choosing each deck as a function of attention weights (a), which represents the weight/value given to each category per trial. The matrix elements of the attention signal always sum to one. It was assumed that for each participant's first trial, the attention weights are divided evenly between categories:

Attention weights are updated using a feedback signal (s), which represents whether the categories were rewarded or not. For example, in the case where a chosen deck matches the test card based on only colour and nothing else, and the trial is rewarded, the feedback signal would look like this, with each element of s representing colour, number, and shape respectively. The current attention weights are updated based on the feedback signal according to the following equations:where t refers to the current trial. Parameters r and p determine how rapidly attention weights alter based on rewarding and punishing feedback signals, respectively.

In the example above, the feedback is unambiguous as the chosen deck matches the test card on only one category. However, in some cases where more than one category is matched (for example, both colour and shape), the feedback signal relies on the free parameter f to modulate how focused or wide the attention is for each category's feedback. When f approaches 0, attention is split evenly between the matching categories:

As f increases, the feedback signal is split proportionally between current attention weights. For example, if the attention weight for colour is higher than shape, the feedback signal would follow suit and perhaps be represented by:

The following equations represent how the feedback signal is modulated by the attention weights and the matching matrix.

When outcome on the current trial is correct, the feedback signal is computed only with the matching attention weights, and when the outcome is incorrect, only the non-matching attention weights contribute to the feedback signal.

Design

Figure 1 illustrates the game structure and procedures. Exactly 12 participants take part in each session and they are randomly divided into four groups consisting of three participants each. In the baseline condition, participants are informed that they will make (at most) one decision and that there are a total of four sequential groups. Moreover, they are informed about the position of their group in the succession of groups and learn that the allocation of participants to the groups is random. After reading a printout of the instructions (reproduced in Supplementary Note 3) and being given an opportunity to ask clarifying questions, the experiment starts. In the baseline condition, each member of Group 1 is endowed with €10. The three members of this group simultaneously face the same decision: they are required to divide their endowment between a private account and a group account. More precisely, they are required to decide how much money to allocate to the group account while the rest of the endowment automatically remains in their private account. If individual contributions to the group account sum to less than €15, the experiment ends instantly and all participants of later groups are informed that the experiment has ended and that their earning from the experimental task are zero. However, if the sum of contributions to the group account amounts to €15 or more (i.e. at least 50% of the total group endowment), the game continues and moves to the next group (Group 2). Independent from the sum of total contributions in the group account, members of Group 1 earn the respective amounts in their private accounts (i.e. the initial endowment of €10 minus their individual contribution to the group account). If the game is sustained, the same procedure applies for members of Groups 2 and 3. The experiment ends with the decision of the members of Group 3. If the contributions of Group 3's members to the group account sum to €15 or more, then the members of Group 4 each earn €5. Otherwise, members of Group 4 earn nothing. Reaching the threshold exactly costs €15 to the current generation but provides an endowment of €30 to the subsequent generation(s). There is hence a gain in total earnings (across multiple generations) from reaching the threshold. These potential gains from contributing are largest for members of the first generation, but smaller for participants in subsequent generations (with no such gains from Group 3). Choosing €15 as a threshold value has the advantage of facilitating coordination between group members by allowing for individual contributions of €5 (i.e. 50% of the endowment) to be sufficient for reaching the threshold. Hence, it is a symmetric focal point for coordination. At the same time, individual endowments are smaller than the threshold. Hence, no single group member can unilaterally provide the public good and successful provision requires the cooperation of at least two group members.

### Observational learning computations in neurons of the human anterior cingulate cortex [^f50d9075]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Guided by cross-species evidence of AMY, rostromedial prefrontal cortex (rmPFC) and ACC involvement in both social and reward-based processes, we collected a unique dataset of single-neuron recordings in these three structures in humans to investigate whether they encode key computations predicted by formal learning theory but for learning through the observation of others. This approach also enabled us to compare the relative contributions of single neurons within these areas to learning in the same paradigm for the first time.

Subjects performed a novel card game task consisting of five rounds per game. In each round the subjects first played out one trial themselves (self-experienced) and then observed two other players play out the next two trials (observed; Fig. 1a). In each trial a player had to pick a card from either the left card deck of one suit (for example, clubs) or the right card deck of another suit (for example, spades Fig. 1b). The subjects were informed that one of the decks provided a 30%, and the other a 70% chance of drawing a winning card, and that, within the winning and losing cards, respectively, the amounts ($10 or $100) were distributed randomly and equally. The subjects were also advised that they could therefore learn which was the better deck by keeping track of their own, self-experienced win/lose outcomes as well as those of the other two observed players, who also picked their cards from the same decks. In each experimental session, after the card game task (12 games), the subjects also played a one-armed random slot machine task with a 50% chance of winning or losing (Fig. 1c).

The findings presented here show that neurons in the AMY and the rmPFC encode the outcome (winning or losing) for self-experienced trials and to a limited extent for observed trials, or alternatively for slot machine trials. Neurons in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC), however, encode all three trial types. In the card game neurons in all three brain areas also encode the amount won or lost, but only in the rACC are these parameters encoded differently for self-experience and observed trials. Finally, we show that a population of rACC neurons encode observational PEs. Taken together these findings emphasize the rACC's role in observational learning and provide the first single-cell evidence of the nature of the computation at work during these processes in humans.

Behavioral Analysis

The 2 behavioral measures of interest were win-switch and lose-stay rates. The win-switch rate indicates how frequently a participant selected a winning card (+100 points) from 1 deck and subsequently chose a different deck on the next trial. Win-switch rates were calculated as the number of win-switch decisions divided by the total number of trials in which the participant selected a winning card. Lose-stay rate indicates how frequently a participant selected a losing card (−50 points) from 1 deck and subsequently chose the same deck on the next trial. Lose-stay rates were calculated as the number of lose-stay decisions divided by the number of trials in which the participant selected a losing card.

### Observational learning computations in neurons of the human anterior cingulate cortex [^28060c9f]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Experimental paradigm

Subjects executed the card game task followed by the slot machine task on a laptop computer, while sitting up in their hospital bed. The other two, observed players were introduced to the subjects by asking them to read individual short biographies and imagining them to be physically present and actually playing cards with them. Due to clinical restrictions they were not real people present in the room, but instead their choices were played out by the computer. The subjects were made aware of these restrictions. They were additionally (wrongfully) informed that the other players' choices were pre-recorded and asked to imagine playing against these real people. After conclusion of all experiments, the subjects were debriefed that the observed players were in fact made up virtual agents and that their behaviour was deliberately designed by the experimenters as to maximize amount and PE variance over trials.

In an individual trial the current player (the subject or one of the two observed players, Fig. 1a) had to draw a card by choosing one of two decks (the subjects made their choice with the left or right arrow key). On a player's choice, the chosen card was highlighted for 1 s before the outcome was revealed for 3 s (Fig. 1b). We recorded 180 trials per session (60 self-experienced trials and 120 observed trials). The subjects were aware that no real money would be paid out (their total winnings were always visible onscreen while the other players' total winnings remained unknown). Additional motivation was provided by designing the experimental paradigm as an appealing computer game including a dedicated hall of fame across all anonymized patients. Patients reported a strong motivational effect resulting from competing in this hall of fame. They started playing the slot machine with the higher amount won during two sets of six card games played immediately prior. In the slot machine game winning doubled their total earnings and losing halved them, however, they could never go below $ 0. Subjects played the slot machine until they had played for at least 5 min and decided to stop (on average 79.6 +/− 8.2 trials were played out). All subjects easily followed these instructions with the exception of one individual, who was therefore not included in this study.

### Payoff information hampers the evolution of cooperation [^3d5b4bfa]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Running this many periods of interaction in a single laboratory session is made feasible using a graphical software interface (see Fig. 1) where choices are implemented through a slider. Actions are determined by the slider's position at the end of the timed period and the slider remains in the same position when the next period starts. Subjects are shown a progress bar filling up every 8 s and a counter of remaining periods. In the first period sliders are set at a random position that determines play in that period. After a period has ended subjects receive feedback on both players' actions and payoffs in the previous period: two dots in the interface indicate (through their horizontal position) actions and (through their vertical position) payoffs. Furthermore, in treatment Info subjects are shown a curve of potential payoffs that they could have earned given their partner's choice. Notice that subjects are, of course, free to leave the slider in the same position for multiple rounds, in which case actions from previous periods are simply repeated. Indeed, many subjects often choose to wait a little between adjustments, which renders the game much less volatile and stressful than the sheer number of periods might suggest.

### Bah humbug! association between sending christmas cards to trial participants and trial retention: randomised study within a trial conducted simultaneously across eight host trials [^d99ab86c]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Results

A total of 3223 participants were randomised to be included in this SWAT — 1617 to receive the Christmas card and 1606 to not receive a card (table 2). We excluded three participants who had no contact address recorded and so were not eligible to be included in the SWAT. Additionally, one participant was randomised three times in error; we included the first allocation in the analysis and excluded the other two allocations (one in each arm). At least one card was returned as the participant no longer lived at the stated address; however, they are included in the analysis under the intention to treat principle.

Table 2
Baseline characteristics of participants included in primary analysis (due for follow-up on/before 31 March 2020), by arm, for each host trial and overall. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise

Only 1469 (749 randomised to receive the card; 720 not) participants were due a follow-up on or before 31 March 2020 and thus are included in the analysis (45.6% of 3223 randomised) (table 2). The percentage of randomised participants included in the analysis varied from 26% (282/1093, REFLECT) to 83% (43/52, SWHSI-2), as shown in table 2; this was due to both the frequency of the follow-ups and the stage the trial was at. For instance, the participants in SWHSI-2 were due their three month and six month follow-ups, whereas those in REFLECT were due their one year follow-up. Figure 2 shows the flow of participants through the SWAT. Table 2 shows the baseline characteristics of the participants included in the analysis. Most participants were female (1033/1469; 70%) and of white ethnicity (813/847; 96%). Additionally, as shown table 1, most of the trials implemented postal follow-up, which may not be typical of all trials.

### Increased decision thresholds trigger extended information gathering across the compulsivity spectrum [^3702d848]. Translational Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Task

The subjects performed a paradigm based on the 'information sampling task', (Fig. 1). In each game, subjects saw 25 covered cards (depicted by gray squares). Each of these cards could be uncovered using the computer mouse, to reveal one of two colours. In every game subjects were instructed to indicate whether they considered the majority of cards to be blue or yellow (the colours actually varied between games, the nomenclature here is used for simplicity). They were allowed to uncover as many cards as needed (a short delay of 250 ms was introduced between opening the tiles), without restriction on the time spent on the task. Once they felt 'certain enough' (detailed instructions are provided in Supplementary Information) they indicated their final decision by selecting the respective colour. After their decision, a short feedback screen (1000 ms) provided information about how many points were won (current and total points), and the next game followed immediately. Subjects had to open at least one card prior to deciding, but there was no maximum, so that subjects were allowed to sample all 25 cards possible before deciding.

Figure 1
Information gathering task. Subjects were asked to indicate whether the majority of the 25 covered cards (left panel) were of yellow or blue colour. In each game, they were allowed to uncover as many cards as they wished (middle panels) by clicking on a covered card. When they had decided they indicated their decision by selecting the respective colour (right panel)

We implemented two different reward schemes (the order of presentation of the schemes was kept constant across subjects). In the first set of 10 games ('fixed' condition), subjects won or lost 100 points by declaring the correct or incorrect colour, irrespective of the number of cards they uncovered. Then, in the second set of 10 games ('decreasing' condition), the potential win decreased as a function of sampling. The potential win started at 250 points and decreased by 10 points for every card that was uncovered (e.g. a correct decision after 4 opened cards would provide 250 − 4 × 10 = 210 points). Subjects lost 100 points for a wrong decision, irrespective of the number of uncovered cards. Before the start of the fixed condition, subjects performed one practice game to familiarise themselves with the task. Details about the sequences shown are provided in the Supplementary Information.

### Selection / interview criteria for drafting players [^fb98a854]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

One important element for forming and cultivating a high performing team in any sport is player selection. For most professional sports, this is an intense period whereby coaching, performance, and administrative staff must work together and use collective wisdom to identify players who have the best probability of consistent high performance. The stakes of a draft are high: the wrong choice can be incredibly costly and impact a team's performance and culture for many years. This article identifies and details common features of the drafting procedure, followed by a discussion of best practices for structuring and executing a draft protocol.

### Resource heterogeneity can facilitate cooperation [^8d37ec47]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Methods

Payoff matrix

The payoff matrix (Table 1) is obtained in four steps. First, players on a poor site can invest R₁, whereas players on a rich site can invest R₂; cooperators invest, whereas defectors do not. The pooled investments are multiplied by r and then evenly distributed among the two players. Second, payoffs are normalized by adjusting the payoff baseline so that a cooperator on a poor site playing against a defector on a poor site receives a payoff of 0. Third, payoffs are normalized by adjusting the payoff unit, so that two cooperators on poor sites playing against each other will each receive a payoff of 1. These two normalizations have no bearing on game dynamics. Fourth, the definitions b = [2/r] and c = [(R₂ − R₁)/R₁] are applied to arrive at the payoff matrix shown below. Note that switching cooperation to defection in this matrix always increases a player's payoff by b −1 on a poor site and by (c+ 1)(b −1) on a rich site, irrespective of the partner's strategy or site quality. Note also that the site quality of partners affects a player's payoff only when their partners cooperate, but not when they defect.

Game dynamics

Our spatial game dynamics are analogous to those analysed, for example, by Nowak et al. Individual players reside on sites of a 100 × 100 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions. Updating is asynchronous, by randomly choosing a focal site to be updated in each step. The player on this focal site then plays the game described in the main text with all four nearest neighbours, and these neighbours in turn play it with their four nearest neighbours. The focal site is held by the focal player, or is taken over by its neighbours, with probabilities proportional to their payoffs raised to the power of m (resulting in what is known as proportional or imitation updating), which thus characterizes the degree of stochasticity in the contest for a site. When a site's occupancy changes, the payoffs of the focal player and its neighbours are updated.

### Basis functions for complex social decisions in dorsomedial frontal cortex [^0a72cc55]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Decision phase

In each trial, after the observation phase came the decision phase. During the decision phase, participants compared performance scores between players, which were displayed in the previous observation phase. The decision was between whether the relevant member(s) of one's own team had performed better in the observation or whether the relevant member(s) of the opponent team had performed better. It was unknown which players would have to be compared until the start of the decision. Participants therefore had to memorize the performance score of all players, that is, the number of successful performances. Each player's performance score ranged between 0 and 6 (in case no performances were successful or all of them were successful, respectively), and this had to be extracted from the series of six performance cues that were shown while that player's RDK was active (by accumulating the yellow success cues and discarding the red error cues). Importantly, each decision phase actually comprised two decisions, and both referred to the same set of performances that had just been seen in the observation phase of the trial. Both decisions followed precisely the same logic, which is why only the first of them is shown in Fig. 1 for illustration. Note that the fact that two decisions were given, and that both referred to the same information, meant that people had to remember the performances of all four players throughout the trial, beyond the first decision and until the second decision was made.

Sudoku

A computerized version of the popular number puzzle game. A 9 × 9 grid of squares is divided into nine boxes. At the start of each game some squares already have numbers (1–9) in them. The player must determine which numbers go in the remaining squares based on the rule that the numbers 1–9 can only appear in each row, column, and box once.

Tetris

Tetris is a classic video game in which players must arrange falling blocks of different shapes (zoids) to form lines at the bottom of the screen. When a complete line is formed the line disappears and points are awarded. If complete lines are not formed, zoids stack up and the game ends when the zoid stack reaches the top of the screen. As the game progresses the speed with which zoids fall increases, increasing difficulty.

Poker

A computerized version of the card game. This version of poker implemented 5 card draw rules. After placing a bet, cards are dealt, and the player decides which cards to hold, and new cards are dealt if requested. Points are awarded based on the final hand and initial bet.

Word search

The player is presented with a matrix of jumbled letters and a word definition below. The player must find the word corresponding to the definition in the matrix and highlight it. Score is based on the number of words found within a limited amount of time.

### Comprehensive warm-up programme to prevent injuries in young female footballers: cluster randomised controlled trial [^d76dabc7]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Compliance

In our previous intervention study we tested the effect of a training programme, in a similar cohort of young female footballers. We were encouraged that compliance in the current trial was higher than with the previous programme (77% v 52%). One key objective for the revision was to improve the compliance among coaches and players, and, with this in mind, the revised programme was expanded with more exercises to provide variation and progression. It also included a new set of structured running exercises to make it better suited as a stand alone warm-up programme for training and matches. In addition, the first part of the programme included exercises with a partner, which seemed to appeal to the players.

The resources used to promote the programme among the intervention teams were moderate so it should be possible to replicate implementation in large scale nationwide programmes. The coaches and team captains were introduced to the programme during one three hour training session. To boost compliance we also developed new information material for coaches and players: a DVD showing all the exercises, a poster, a loose leaf exercise book, and small exercise cards attached to a handy neck strap that the coaches could bring to the training field. It was up to the coaches and team captains, however, to teach the programme to the players on the roster. Furthermore, the clubs received no follow-up visits throughout the season to refresh coaching skills or give players feedback on their performance. Despite the moderate efforts to promote the programme, compliance was good and we saw effects on the risk of injury. It should be possible to implement the programme at the community level by including injury prevention as part of basic coaching education and making educational material such as that developed for the current study available to teams, coaches, players, and parents.

The technical nature of many of the exercises in the programme required players to focus during training to gain the intended benefit. Site visits indicated that not all of the players seemed to concentrate fully on the performance of the exercises, which might be expected for this age group. Furthermore, the compliance logs documented that not all clubs completed the requested minimum of two training sessions a week. We included all clubs and players in the intention to treat analysis, which means that the preventive effect of the programme might be higher than reported. This is supported by subgroup analyses within the intervention group, indicating a trend towards a lower risk of injury among the most compliant players.

### Avoiding a red card: recommendations for a consistent standard of concussion management in professional football (soccer) [^56c5ab6e]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Avoiding a red card

The aforementioned measures should not be considered in isolation but in combination as a holistic approach to complete concussion care. The professional football stakeholders (eg, leagues, players unions) remain responsible for the implementation of these measures. Additional standards introduced in other sports (eg, baseline assessments, neurocognitive evaluations, the assistance of an independent physician, a compliance and sanction committee) should also be considered and evaluated for effectiveness in reducing concussions and their consequences within professional football. For a high profile, well-resourced sport, with an opportunity and responsibility to educate globally, a consistent approach to concussion recognition and management is needed throughout professional football to avoid a red card.

### The impact of social hierarchies on neural response to feedback evaluations after advice giving [^4cd3f510]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

During EEG data collection, participants (playing the role of advisor) were comfortably seated in an electromagnetically shielded room, approximately 75 cm in front of a computer monitor (19‐in LED screen, refresh rate: 60 Hz; resolution: 1440 × 900 pixels). As illustrated in Figure 1d, in each trial, a sentence showing "Pairing… " was presented on the black background screen for 1500–2000 ms, followed by the statement "Pairing with Player A" or "Pairing with Player B" which appeared for 2000 ms. This statement indicated that the advisee was Player A or Player B in this given trial. A white fixation cross was then presented on a black background for 500 ms, followed by a random dot picture separated by a white line on the left and right sides of the screen (generated randomly, lasting 1000 ms. Note that the number of dots on each side ranged from 18 to 23. The number of dots and position of the dot distribution differed on both sides in each trial). Afterward, the participants were presented with two gray squares (1.9° × 1.9° of visual angle) appearing on the left and right sides of the fixation point against a black background, with an integer number in the range of 18–23 presented above this fixation point (Note that participants were told that putative advisees could only see this number in this interface). Notably, in this interface, participants were asked to select which side (the left or right side of the random dots picture that was previously presented) contained this given integer number of dots by pressing the "F" or "J" key with their corresponding left or right index finger, respectively. After pressing the key, the participant saw their selected option (i.e. advice) highlighted by a thick red/white border, and the unselected option highlighted by a thick white/red border for 500 ms. After an interval of 800–1000 ms, the feedback showing advisees' decisions was then displayed for 1000 ms. Phase 1: if the advisee accepted the participants' advice, participants would see a " √ " appear in the red/white‐bordered square (advice). Alternatively, if the advisee rejected the participant's advice, participants would see a " √ " appear in the white/red‐bordered square. Finally, after an interval of 800–1000 ms, feedback showing the advisees' outcomes was presented for 1000 ms. Phase 2: if the advisee accepted the participants' advice and gained (i.e. the advice provided was correct), participants would see " √ " and "+10" (vertical arrangement) in the red/white‐bordered square. If the advisee accepted the advice but lost (i.e. the advice provided was incorrect), participants would see " √ " and "−10" in the red/white‐bordered square. Conversely, if the advisee rejected the advice but gained (i.e. the advice was incorrect), participants would see " √ " and "+10" in the white/red‐bordered square; if the advisee rejected the advice and lost (i.e. advice was correct), participants would see " √ " and "−10" in the white/red‐bordered square. The border color (red/white) for highlighting the selected option (i.e. advice) and that for the unselected option were counterbalanced across participants. Afterward, a blank screen was shown for 1000 ms as an inter‐trial interval.

### The foundations of the human cultural niche [^ae285b1f]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Rate of innovation. To determine whether humans were able to generalize the function of specific items within the game, we investigated the number of unsuccessful combinations that isolated players had to generate before producing a successful one. This log-transformed value was the response variable. The rank of the innovation (within the player's own innovation record) was evaluated as an explanatory variable. Theoretically, the response variable should be strongly affected by the number of possible combinations that one player was able to generate from his/her pool of items. For this reason, we introduced the corresponding log-transformed number of possible combinations that the player could produce as a control variable. The player's identity was introduced as random variable. Our results indicate that the number of unsuccessful combinations that players had to generate before producing a successful one was negatively affected by the rank of the innovation (LRT: χ² = 5.32, d.f. = 1, P = 0.02, N = 431), indicating that players got better at generating successful combinations across time. As expected, the number of possible combinations negatively affected the individuals' ability to find successful combinations, although this effect was only marginally significant (LRT: χ² = 3.02, d.f. = 1, P = 0.08, N = 431).

All statistical analyses were conducted using R version 3.0.1. The significance of explanatory variables was assessed by comparing full and restricted models using LRTs and parametric bootstrapping with 1,000 simulations. Both tests yielded qualitatively similar results. Mixed models, LRTs and parametric bootstrapping were performed using the lme4 (ref.) and pbkrtestpackages.

### Episodic foresight is impaired following acute alcohol intoxication [^1cd235e2]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

After completing the trial day, participants were asked to complete three virtual days. These three virtual days presented 30 situation cards, 20 of which comprised the episodic foresight task (i.e. 10 presented an episodic foresight problem; 10 presented the context for a resolution of that problem). The remaining 10 featured similar narrative content but did not present an episodic foresight problem (these cards simply feature virtual day narrative content to act as distractor situations). In addition, of the 20 daily activity cards, 10 featured an item (in a list of five items, with four being distracter items). Once acquired, these items could be used to resolve the episodic foresight problem. An additional 10 daily activities cards featured five distracter items (i.e. no items that were relevant to resolve the problems). Problem, resolution, and distracter situation cards were presented intermittently with daily activities cards. To introduce a temporal delay between the three task components (and thereby ensure the task measured episodic foresight, and not basic problem solving), there was an average delay of two intervening cards between a problem presentation and item acquisition, and two further intervening cards occurred between item acquisition and problem resolution context.

The key dependent measures in VW-Foresight are item acquisition and item use. Item acquisition is scored as the number of target items acquired on the daily activities cards (from 10 possible items). For item use, given that the ability to use an item is contingent on first acquiring that item, the number of items correctly used is first conditionalized on initial acquisition (i.e. the number of used items is divided by the number acquired, to produce a proportion of already acquired items; see).

Alcohol use

Participants' current alcohol use was indexed using the AUQ, a measure of drinking quantity and patterns within the past 6 months. Participants answer 12 questions that assess their typical alcohol drinking habits. This measure was also used to provide a binge drinking score, calculated usingAUQ binge score equation.

Retrospective memory

Retrospective memory was measured using the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. Participants were orally presented with a list of 12 words pertaining to three semantic categories for three trials and asked to recall as many words as they could remember in any order following each trial and once again after a 30-min delay. Immediate recall was calculated by tallying the total number of words correctly recalled following the initial three trials, and delayed recall by tallying the number of words recalled following the 30-min delay.

### UK healthcare staff experiences and perceptions of a mass casualty terrorist incident response: a mixed-methods study [^3e028b36]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

The importance of an MI plan

Responder comments indicated that the availability of an effective Trust MI Plan helped to enable and supported an effective response. Many participants valued recent opportunities to revise the plan, which made them better aware of MI response arrangements as well as refreshed their knowledge of roles and roles of their teams. Having a plan and action cards provided a structure for actions and helped to mitigate the inherent initial stress associated with an MI response. Mass casualty distribution plan was credited with allowing more efficient way of managing the distribution of a large number of casualties from the scene of the incident and across hospitals, to prevent overloading the nearest to the scene hospitals, as well as to allow trusts to be better prepared to receive casualties by knowing in advance the category and number of patients allocated by the plan. The distribution plan allowed critical care across a number of providers working as network.

Whole process seemed to run as per the plan which was reassuring and helpful. [survey]

Recent revision of our major incident plan meant the plan was fresh in my mind and that of the team. [survey] The feedback I got was the initial was a little bit of panic but they got their cards out, cards for each of the team members and they were very clear on those roles and they followed them pretty much to the [letter]… Once they got those there seemed to be a calmness and a process. [53]

There was no time wasted between… The ambulance control didn't have to phone the hospitals to say can you take ten patients? The hospitals just knew they were going to take ten patients and that was it. So that saved lots of time and bother. It worked great, really [22]

### Identity cards help patients identify their doctors [^cc8621ed]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Lessons and Limitations

Carrying out this project revealed many challenges and learning points.

i. Ensuring the support from a key stakeholder was a vital component in the study as engaging all doctors and nurses on the ward to carry and distribute the ID card was challenging. Once a senior consultant introduced them during their ward round and demonstrated their use, other members of the team were willing to participate as well. This held true for increasing the scope of the project from the medical ward to including the surgical ward, as another series of discussions were required in order to begin initial data collection and trial the first PDSA cycle.

ii. Momentum of the project largely depended on the motivation and enthusiasm of the junior doctors based on the ward and therefore posed the biggest challenge to successful implementation and future sustainability of the ID card. However, since the project findings were presented at a Trust wide consultant's meeting, the Trust policy has been amended to allow the named consultant to appear above the patient's bedside, thereby inviting other ward staff (e.g.: matron, nurse, health care assistant) to participate in this incentive.

iii. Issues with the logistical details of the study itself such as misplaced or damaged ID cards required an extra PDSA cycle to trial larger cards, permanently fixed to the beside tables. This required communication with the nursing staff and housekeeping to ensure that these documents were not removed during the patient's admission. Further discussions with the media office to help produce more durable forms of this card were proposed to consider the possibility of creating an electronic ID card which is displayed as a screen saver onto every patient's bedside television.

### The efficacy of a movement control exercise programme to reduce injuries in youth rugby: a cluster randomised controlled trial [^a3f8064b]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Standardisation procedures

Prior to start of the playing season and data collection, staff in schools allocated to each trial arm will be trained in the required exercise programme that they are to use. The research team will be responsible for training the school staff on their allocated exercise programme and for distributing the data collection and exercise programme materials. This will be undertaken through face-to-face practical demonstrations organised as part of centralised teacher training events, whereby the intervention or sham exercise programmes (phase 1) will be practically demonstrated to coaches. The format and layout of materials will be indistinct, with only the content of materials differing between the trial arms. Staff will also receive a filmed demonstration (available as a DVD), cue cards (snapshot images and key coaching points for each exercise) and booklets that detail the correct execution of specific exercises (with coaching points/instruction cues) for supplementary reference during the playing season. The instructions provided to the trainers in each experimental arm will be structurally indistinct.

Data collection materials will also be indistinct between the trial arms. Coaches of all individual teams will be provided with both paper and electronic copies (based on their preference) of an exposure and compliance report form to be completed on a weekly basis, detailing team-level training and individual match exposure, along with a compliance record in relation to the exercise programme. The member of staff responsible for logging and treating all reportable injuries will be provided with hard and electronic copies (depending on preference) of the injury report forms to be completed when a player visits for treatment.

In addition to completing a playing and injury history questionnaire, all consenting players will be subjected to baseline anthropometric testing (standing height, seated height, body mass and body composition) prior to start the study in order to characterise participants in the two study arms.

### Designing and implementing an electronic health record-embedded card study in primary care: methods and considerations [^0212b8cb]. Annals of Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Card studies-short surveys about the circumstances within which patients receive care-are traditionally completed on physical cards. We report on the development of an electronic health record (EHR)-embedded card study intended to decrease logistical challenges inherent to paper-based approaches, including distributing, tracking, and transferring the physical cards, as well as data entry and respondent prompts, while simultaneously decreasing the complexity for participants and facilitating rich analyses by linking to clinical and demographic data found in the EHR. Developing the EHR-based programming and data extraction was time consuming, required specialized expertise, and necessitated iteration to rectify issues encountered during implementation. Nonetheless, future EHR-embedded card studies will be able to replicate many of the same processes as informed by these results. Once built, the EHR-embedded card study simplified survey implementation for both the research team and clinic staff, resulting in research-quality data, the ability to link survey responses to relevant EHR data, and a 79% response rate. This detailed accounting of the development and implementation process, including issues encountered and addressed, might guide others in conducting EHR-embedded card studies.

### Bah humbug! association between sending christmas cards to trial participants and trial retention: randomised study within a trial conducted simultaneously across eight host trials [^1572d260]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Cost per card

The costs below are detailed for the overall SWAT, including all Christmas cards that were sent (n = 1617). A surplus of cards was ordered (n = 1787), and owing to the way in which printing was done, an additional surplus was received and subsequently prepared in some instances. Preparing and packaging 1836 Christmas cards took 918 minutes (15.3 hours) — approximately 30 seconds per card. The members of staff involved with the preparation ranged from a grade 3 to a grade 7, with pay ranging from approximately £11.01 to £22.46 per hour. Each card was posted by second class Royal Mail using Mailmark franking at a cost of £0.41 each. Thus, the total cost of sending the Christmas cards was £1306.40 or £0.76 (€0.91; $1.02) per card sent. As we found no evidence of additional participants being retained, we did not calculate a cost per additional retained participant. Table 4 summarises the costs of sending the cards.

Table 4
Details of cost associated with Christmas cards

CO 2 emissions

The estimate for the "carbon footprint" of a typical greetings card, such as a Christmas card, is 140 g CO 2 equivalent. Based on the 1617 cards sent to participants in the intervention arm, the average amount of CO 2 produced in this SWAT was 226 kg. This is equivalent to a return flight from Aberdeen to Leeds (York's closest airport — approximately 230 miles direct distance). Based on previous research that identified 40% of clinical trials units having used Christmas cards as a retention strategy previously, and assuming that each UK clinical trials unit (n = 53 UKCRC registered) would send cards in 10 host trials, each of moderate size (n = 250), this would equate to a total CO 2 emission of 4.5 tonnes per year. This does not account for additional trials that use Christmas cards but are conducted outside a registered clinical trials unit.

Sensitivity analyses

Our sensitivity analyses looking at sex and postal-only time to completion confirmed our original conclusions. More details are in the supplementary materials.

### Avoiding a red card: recommendations for a consistent standard of concussion management in professional football (soccer) [^3995efa9]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Compared with some collision/contact sports, concussions are relatively uncommon in professional football (soccer). Nevertheless, professional football has been under repeated scrutiny because of questionable recognition and management (on-field and off-field) of concussions during several high-profile international and national competitions. Given the Concussion in Sport Consensus process has been ongoing for two decades, it is important that professional football adopt consistent policies that represent the highest standard of concussion care. We believe the current approach to concussion in some professional football competitions may warrant a red card. Being the world's highest profile sport, we acknowledge that football's apparent concussion management oversights may appear to be disproportionately exposed in both the medical and public eye. We also recognise that the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) and many professional leagues have made many steps towards promoting high-quality concussion care. Equally, however, variable policies exist that may compromise athlete care, and the sports profile and popularity should be used to promote optimal concussion care and educate millions. As clinicians who have been working in professional football for over 100 cumulated years, we propose a series of measures to improve the recognition and management of concussion across professional football.

### Cooperation in alternating interactions with memory constraints [^ac67444b]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Results

Model description

In the following, we formulate a simple baseline scenario, which we use to derive our main analytical results (see also Supplementary Note 1). More general scenarios are discussed in a later section, and in full detail in Supplementary Note 3. We consider interactions between two players, player 1 and player 2. Both players repeatedly decide whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D). These repeated interactions can take place in two different ways. In the simultaneous game, there is a discrete number of rounds. In each round, both players make their decision at the same time, not knowing their co-player's decision (Fig. 1 a). In contrast, in the alternating game, the players move consecutively. We consider the strictly alternating game: Player 1 moves first, and then player 2 learns about player 1's decision and moves next (Fig. 1 b). We note that there are also variants of the alternating game in which the order of moves is random. In particular, one player may by chance make two or more consecutive moves before it is the other player's turn again. The effect of such irregular alternation patterns will be discussed later.

For the simultaneous game, the possible payoffs in each round can be represented by four parameters. Players receive the reward R in rounds in which they both cooperate; they receive the temptation payoff T and the sucker's payoff S, respectively, if only one player cooperates; and they receive the punishment payoff P in case they both defect. For T > R > P > S, we obtain the prisoner's dilemma. In the alternating game, however, it is useful to assume that payoffs can be assigned to each player's individual action. In that case, the value of one player's cooperation is independent of the co-player's previous or subsequent decision (or equivalently, payoffs are independent of how the two players' decisions are grouped into rounds). As a result, we obtain the donation game. Here, cooperation means to pay a cost c > 0 in order to provide a benefit b > c to the co-player. The donation game is a special case of a prisoner's dilemma for whichTo compare the alternating game with the simultaneous game, we assume payoffs satisfy (1) throughout.

### The preventing Australian football injuries with exercise (PAFIX) study: a group randomised controlled trial [^4a7f7692]. Injury Prevention (2009). Low credibility.

Analysis

At the start of the RCT, retrospective injury data are obtained to determine equivalence in injury risk at baseline. Injury, exposure and compliance data are being collected during each month of the Australian Football season, and the outcome measures of interest are the total numbers of injuries, total exposure and overall compliance rates over the entire study period. All data will be pre-coded and double-entered into a PC database.

All analyses will be undertaken with the Stata analysis package and performed on an intention-to-treat basis with the control arm (arm 1) as the reference group. The analysis of biomechanical outcomes will take clustering of individuals within teams into account through the use of generalised estimating equations. Poisson or negative binomial regression, as appropriate, will be used to analyse injury rates with estimation of a scale parameter allowing for cluster effects.

Behavioural, attitudinal and knowledge variables will be assessed by a number of different items on a questionnaire. Responses will be scored, and the scores from different items combined to give an overall attitude score on a quasi-continuous scale. Scores will be compared preseason to postseason, and changes compared across study arms. The attitudes and behaviours of players, particularly attitudes before and after, will be compared by categorical data analysis again using generalised estimating equations to allow for cluster effects. Information about injury outcomes (ie, time away from sport and amount of treatment received) will be collected from all injured players so that the cost per injury can be calculated.

Project time frame

The project is being conducted over the 4-year period of 2006–2009 (including two playing seasons) as shown below. Given the timing of the Australian Football season, and the need to produce the training instruction kits, data collection forms, and to set-up the biomechanical testing procedures, the trial phase itself did not start until year 2.

Sideline and office screening after suspected concussion includes timed rapid naming tests with baseline comparison. In organized sports, a sideline evaluation may include the King-Devick test, a rapid number-naming test in which the total time needed to read 3 test cards and the number of errors committed while reading the cards are recorded; preinjury testing to obtain an individual's baseline test time and error rate is recommended for comparison with postinjury testing; another promising tool, the Mobile Universal Lexicon Evaluation System (MULES), is a rapid picture-naming test that comprises a series of 54 color photographs.

### A message for you: a novel communication tool developed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic [^969b3dcd]. BMJ Open Quality (2021). High credibility.

Results

In total, we received 184 cards addressed to 75 patients. Nighty-eight per cent of cards were delivered successfully. Of the four cards that we were unable to deliver, three cards were addressed to patients that were discharged by the time of delivery. The final, non-delivered card was submitted to a patient who had unfortunately passed away by the time of delivery.

Figure 2 illustrates the weekly total number of recipients and cards delivered during each of the three cycles. The number of weekly recipients rose from 8 in week 1 to a peak of 15 in week 4, coinciding with the implementation of cycle 2. During the same period, the number of cards delivered rose from 9 to 45. On average, each patient received 3.5 cards from two separate senders. The percentage of the inpatient population that received cards varied from 2% (week 1) and 4% (week 4).

Table 1
An overview of the experimental designs for all experiments

In the 'country' column, DE = Germany and 'UK' = United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

For the iterated experiments, we tested groups of six participants (who did not know each other) in the same room with six computers side-by-side, separated by partitions that prevented participants from seeing each other's screens. Participants played a series of iterated Prisoner's Dilemma games, in which we systematically varied whether the outcomes were positive or negative (see "Payoff matrices" below). In each group, each of the six participants played iterated Prisoner's Dilemmas with each of the other five participants, without knowing with whom they were playing. Each player made 300 decisions: five (interactions) × 12 (payoff matrices) * five (repetitions). In Experiments 2 and 3, participants played three repetitions of 20 payoff matrices against each other player. The order of the payoff matrices within each interaction was randomised (but each repetition of a payoff matrix was played successively in each interaction). At the beginning of each interaction, both players were randomly assigned to be either the column-player (indicate decision with left-right arrow buttons) or the row-player (indicate decision with top-down arrow buttons) for the entire interaction. Participants were paid a base payment of 9€/h. We incentivized participants' decisions such that, depending on their decisions, up to 2€ (Experiment 1) or 5€ (Experiments 2 and 3) could be subtracted from or added to their base payment.

### Getting tough on concussion: how welfare-driven law change may improve player safety-a rugby union experience [^f60d0cbf]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Increasing the focus on current sanctions

At the end of 2017, the first year of this increased sanction focus, World Rugby confirmed that all monitored competitions (six major professional elite adult competitions and international matches) had issued more on-field high-tackle penalties per game (average 58% increase). Issuing of more severe sanctions (yellow and red cards) was noted in all but one of these monitored competitions.

Yellow cards, issued for mid-danger tackle offences with an example being a high tackle, arm-to-head with low level of danger, increased by 41%, and red cards, issued for high-danger tackles such as a shoulder charge direct to head at high speed, increased over eightfold.

For the first time since 2012, concussion rates in 2017 did not rise in those competitions where referees had issued a higher rate of yellow and red card sanctions, despite robust medical and public scrutiny. In the single competition where the rate of cards issued had in fact decreased, concussion rates continued to climb.

In 2018, the second season of our increased sanction focus, we noted intracompetition and intercompetition inconsistencies for the awarding of high-tackle sanctions, particularly in the issue of yellow and red cards. This led to general media criticism, which we recognised could potentially undermine this increased sanction intervention.

### Basis functions for complex social decisions in dorsomedial frontal cortex [^4d039842]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Observation phase

In the observation phase, participants observed performance cues for each player in a random but counter-balanced sequence (each player appeared first in the sequence for the same number of trials, for example). Participants' veridical performances from the pre-experiment were paired with veridical performances from three other previous participants and displayed during this phase. The insight into pre-recorded performance was unrelated to beating the other team in the main experiment (Extended Data Fig. 2). Player identities were cued by RDK images and displayed in the same spatial positions as in the pre-experiment to reinforce continuity between the pre-experiment and the main fMRI experiment and to illustrate that the displayed performances referred to the pre-experimental performance assessment.

In the observation phase, for each player, participants observed six brief performance cues. The performance cues were always displayed centrally on the screen at the same location for each player, and successful performances were indicated by yellow coin cues and erroneous performances were indicated by a red X. Participants already knew the meaning of these cues from the pre-experiment (see the 'Behavioural pre-experiment' section). Because the performance cues always appeared in the same location for all players, we cued the player to which of these performances related in the following way: 400 ms before the performance cue sequence started, the RDK image of the respective player appeared in its predefined location and its dots moved in a slow and coherent fashion in a direction (randomly left or right) for 2.1 s overall. Importantly, the active RDK was simply a means to indicate the relevant player.

### Let us stop throwing out the baby with the bathwater: towards better analysis of longitudinal injury data [^d7e256da]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The problem

Longitudinal sports injury data are often analysed in one of the three ways:
A risk,
A rate,
Time to first injury (hazard).

All three approaches have profound limitations.

Some studies report injury incidence in terms of the number of injured players divided by the number of players on the team at pre-season (far right hand side, figure 2). This is the average probability of injury, which is a risk. A risk answers a question often voiced by players and/or their families at pre-season: What is the probability that I will be hurt this season? To compute a one-season risk, the data for each player is reduced to a binary outcome: yes — sustained ≥ 1 injury, and no — remained injury free. Such analyses ignore how many injuries people sustain, as well as ignore the timing between subsequent injuries. In our figure, players 1 and 3 contribute the same information to a risk, despite of the fact that player 3 has three injuries and player 1 has one injury.

Figure 2
Common approach to reporting injury incidence in terms of injured athletes.

An alternative approach is the injury rate. The rate (or 'incidence density') is the number of injuries divided by the total person-time at risk (far right hand side, figure 3). Scientists use rates because, unlike risks, they use more of the injury information and account for variation in follow-up between respondents. However, rate does not have an obvious interpretation for non-scientists. A problem with rates is that the measure still ignores the length of time between injuries and inherently assumes that multiple injuries to the same person were unrelated. Thus, three non-TL injuries to three different players followed for 3 weeks each yields the same rate as three non-TL injuries to the same player followed for 9 weeks. However, these are two different situations from clinical and resource allocation standpoints.

Figure 3
Common approach to reporting injury incidence in terms of injury counts.

The third approach is to use simple survival analysis to compute time to first injury (bold lines, figure 4). This quantity is known as initial hazard and it is equivalent to a rates analysis in which all respondents are censored after their first injury. But by limiting analysis to time to first injury only, this approach also excludes information about subsequent injuries. Thus data on only one injury is included for player 2 and data on two subsequent injuries is excluded from the player 3's injury profile.

### Reinforcement learning in professional basketball players [^303f98c8]. Nature Communications (2011). Medium credibility.

In order to further explore this possibility, we made use of the heterogeneity between players. We characterized each player according to the extent to which the outcome of a single 3pt attempt affects his/her 3pt probability. Formally, we define the susceptibility of a player, χ, to be the difference between the probability of a 3pt attempt following a made 3pt, Pr[3pt|made 3pt], and the probability of a 3pt attempt following a missed 3pt, Pr[3pt|missed 3pt] divided by the sum of these two probabilities:

and characterize each player by his/her susceptibility. A positive susceptibility indicates that after a made 3pt, a player is more likely to attempt another 3pt, compared with after a missed 3pt. The larger the value of χ is, the stronger the effect of the outcome of a 3pt on a player's policy. We sorted the players into nine equal sized groups according to their susceptibility and computed the average 3pt percentage and average 3pt return for each group. The 3pt percentage (Fig. 3c) as well as the 3pt return (Fig. 3d) are negatively correlated with susceptibility, supporting the hypothesis that large positive susceptibility is detrimental to a player's performance.

### Basis functions for complex social decisions in dorsomedial frontal cortex [^0831abc8]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Participants this time did not have to discern the movement direction of the dots (which would have been easy because the coherence of the RDK was very high). They simply needed to understand that the performance cues displayed centrally represented the performance recorded for this specific player. Using the moving RDK to indicate the relevant player was, like many other small manipulations in this study, a way to enable participants to make a link between the pre-experiment and the main fMRI experiment, and to make it plausible that the displayed performance cues related to the RDK performance of the respective player. While the player's RDK was moving, the sequence of six performance cues was shown centrally on screen. After the above-mentioned 400 ms, the first performance cue was presented for 200 ms. The remaining performance cues were shown subsequently with a delay of 100 ms between them, also for 200 ms each. During this time, the player's RDK was still active to indicate the relevant player, and the RDK movement ended precisely at the time the sequence of six performance cues ended as well.

For each of the four players, the performance cues were presented in exactly this fashion. A sequence of six centrally presented performance cues was shown while the player-specific RDK was active. After a player's performance was presented, their RDK stopped moving and remained static until the decision phase started. This meant that at the end of the performance phase, all four RDKs were shown statically on screen in the location associated with the respective player. Importantly, the order of the players was fully balanced (Fig. 2). At the end, after the last player's performance was shown and the observation phase had ended, after a Poisson-distributed jitter (1–5 s, with a mean of 2 s), the decision phase started.

### Commitment to honesty oaths decreases dishonesty, but commitment to another individual does not affect dishonesty [^6d7024b6]. Communications Psychology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Confirmatory analyses

All models represented in the following confirmatory part were preregistered before conducting the study and deviations are clearly noted as such.

We measured how much commitment participants felt to their matched partners (or a hypothetical other participant from the same experiment in the baseline and oath treatments). Note that due to a technical error, we did not measure commitment in the baseline and oath treatments in Study 2. We observed that prior to the game, participants in the partner and partner+oath treatments reported higher commitment to their matched partners than participants in the baseline and oath treatments toward another study participant across all studies (Table 4). This effect was statistically significant in all studies in which we assessed it except for Study 1 (see Table 4). In Studies 2–7, we also assessed whether commitment increased in the partner and partner + oath treatments after engaging in the economic game task. We observed a statistically significant increase in ratings in all except Study 5 and 7, with participants reporting higher commitment after compared to before the game task (see Table 4). An overview of commitment scores to the partner for each treatment and study is provided in Fig. 2. In Study 7, participants reported significantly lower commitment after as compared to before the game task (Table 4). We explored this finding in a non-registered analysis and observed a statistically significant moderation by the number of doubles reported across the task. Reporting more doubles in the sequential die roll was positively associated with increased commitment to the partner after the task, especially for Player A (see Supplementary Figs. 3–4).

### Neural encoding of perceived patch value during competitive and hazardous virtual foraging [^faedc8e1]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Safe trials consisted of making decisions based on the configuration of competition in each patch and the learned repeating cycles that enable recognition of the location within a cycle and hence, the upcoming configuration. Threat trials included the appearance of a virtual predator, adding a relevant parameter to participants' decisions. Selecting a patch with few players increases the risk of capture by a predator, but also increases the chance of acquiring rewards. Occupying a patch with several other players dilutes the risk of capture by a predator, but decreases the chance of acquiring rewards.

Each block was divided into eight (8) sub-blocks consisting of 18 trials of which half were safe trials and half were threat trials. Based on this structure, participants completed a total of 576 trials, balanced between the three trial types detailed above (SI, SL, LI). Threat trials ended when a virtual predator appeared and captured a player. The task duration over the course of 2 days was approximately 3.5 h, including a short training period. During the training period the participant observed changing patch configurations as a fixed 3-change cycle was repeated. For example, the left patch might cycle through the following number of competitors: 6, 4, 3 such that if the player observes four players in the patch, the next cycle will display three players with 100% certainty. Participants completed a post-task questionnaire, were debriefed on the experimental purpose, and paid $120 for participation.

Behavioral data acquisition and analysis

Participants' x–y coordinates were recorded at a sampling rate of 30 Hz. Other variables collected included reward spawn location and collection; patch selection decisions; safe/threat value of each environment, number of competitors in each environment, captures and shocks received.

Decisions tallies were generated for two focal variables including whether (1) the player selected the patch with fewer competitors; (2) the player selected a patch currently observed or a prospective patch. These decisions were analyzed based on several factors including (1) the trial type, e.g. safe or threat; (2) the trial length, e.g. short or long; (3) the block, e.g. low competitor numbers or high competitor numbers; and (4) the actual number of competitors in each patch. Data cleaning and organization was performed using Python 3.7. Statistical testing was performed using R version 3.5.0 (see below for details regarding behavioral modeling).

### How to hospital: barriers to developing a patient' hospital survival guide' to support information transfer during ward-rounds on the patient journey from admission to hospital to discharge [^687542eb]. BMJ Open Quality (2022). High credibility.

Table 2
Sample quotes from interviews with patients based on questions from online supplemental appendix 2

Patients gave feedback on the format of the diary cards: They stated that they found the diary-cards helpful and stated that they would use the cards. Patients commented that 'undoubtedly the cards would help a lay person', for those 'whose second language is English', for confused patients and if repeat testing were to be done. One patient requested more diary cards for further tests.

A patient who had been readmitted to hospital after a previous stay had a CT. The patient had used Google to find out what a CT scan was. This patient stated their intention to use the patient diary and thought that it was up to patients to ask questions to understand their illness and jargon. The patient did not complete the cards the next day due to concerns about hand writing, but thought the simpler format was appropriate. Two participants raised concerns whether patients would be expected to record their own test results.

Patients commented on the colour scheme as 'eye catching' and 'engaging' yet some called them 'too childish' or 'simplistic'. Concerns of blind or colour-blind patients were raised. Test descriptions were thought to be at an appropriate level of information and patients didn't feel they needed more. Most patients said they would use the cards, yet some didn't find them necessary. The interviewed felt that patients should fill the diary out, to avoid medical jargon.

Ideas for improvement to be made included making the cards bigger to accommodate more information or tests results, especially for longer stays. One patient hoped the cards would be in an easier format for carrying and several patients felt a booklet type resource would be beneficial.

Fourth PDSA-cycle

The doctor completed the cards during ward rounds. Ten ward patients were selected at random (three patients per bay). Eight patients were female, and their ages ranged from 59 to 88 years (median 79). Five patients did not recall their diagnosis prior to receiving the diary cards and three did not recall the diagnosis even after receiving the cards. Seven patients knew what tests had been requested prior to the card and eight after, three patients knew their discharge date before and nine after, four understood discharge arrangements before and eight after receiving the card. The family members of patients with cognitive impairment indicated that they found the cards useful.

### Evolving cooperation in multichannel games [^5d3521c5]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Because players may condition their behavior on the entire previous history of play, strategies for multichannel games can be arbitrarily complex. To make a computational analysis of the evolutionary dynamics feasible, we assume that players choose from a predetermined set of given complexity. Here, we first consider reactive strategies. A player's behavior in any given round may thus depend on the co-player's action in the last round, but it is independent of all previous rounds. In the unlinked case, reactive strategies can be represented by 4-tuplesHere, is a player's probability to cooperate in game k, dependent on the co-player's previous action a ϵ { C, D } in that game. In the linked case, reactive strategies take the formNow, is the probability to cooperate in game k depending on the co-player's previous actions in game one and two, respectively. In the linked case, players themselves may decide to treat each game as independent, by choosing a strategy for whichIt follows that the set of linked strategies (2) contains the unlinked strategies (1) as a (strict) subset. In the following, we explore the effect of linkage in two ways. (i) We compare the evolving cooperation rates between the linked and unlinked case; and (ii) we analyze to which extent players in the linked case use strategies that are infeasible in the unlinked case.

To describe how players adapt their strategies over time, we consider a pairwise comparison process. Evolution occurs in a population of fixed size N. Players receive payoffs by interacting with all other population members. Occasionally, they are given a chance to update their strategies. With probability μ (reflecting a mutation probability), players do so by random strategy exploration. In that case, they choose a new strategy uniformly at random from the set of all available strategies. Otherwise, with probability 1 − μ, players consider imitating the strategy of someone else. To this end, they randomly sample a role model from the population. Then they adopt the role model's strategy with a probability that increases in the role model's payoff (for details, see "Methods"). Over time, the two elements of imitation and random strategy exploration yield a stochastic process on the space of all possible population compositions. We explore this process through computer simulations in the limit of rare mutations – (the respective code is provided in Supplementary Note 5).

### The association of environmental heat stress with performance: analysis of the 2014 FIFA world cup Brazil [^6c616c92]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Data analysis

Each match (n = 64) was coded as one data point representing the match characteristics (average of both teams; ie, actual playing time, number of passes per minute, rate of successful passes, and total number of goals and cards) or the average player response (per minute, average of both teams; ie, total distance and distance covered at low, moderate and high intensities). This approach was adopted to account for factors that affect performance such as the opponent's level, the scoring advantage of one team, the tactics, etc. The relationship of these variables with the environmental conditions (WBGT) was investigated via linear correlation (Pearson).

The match variables were compared between the environmental stress categories via one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). All variables were tested using Mauchly's procedure for sphericity before applying ANOVA. A χ² was used to analyze categorical data (ie, total number of cards and goals). When expected frequencies were less than five in at least one cell (ie, number of red cards and goals scored), the Fischer's exact test was used. Data were coded and analysed in PASW software V.21.0 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA) and the level of significance was set as p < 0.05. Data are reported as mean ± SD. The study was approved from Zurich University review board.

### X as a proxy for tackle safety culture? Sentiment analysis of social media posts on red-carded and yellow-carded tackles during the 2019 rugby world cup [^6417736b]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Objectives

This study analysed the overall sentiment of attitudes, opinions, views and emotions expressed in posts on X related to red-carded and yellow-carded tackles during the 2019 Rugby World Cup (RWC).

Methods

Sentiment analysis was conducted on posts on X about red or yellow cards issued at the 2019 RWC. Posts were classified as 'agree', 'disagree' and 'neutral' The frequency of posts, red cards, yellow cards, all injuries, tackle injuries and total number of tackles per match were also synced to the 45-match playing schedule.

Results

Five tackle-related red cards were issued during the 2019 RWC, and 15 tackle-related yellow cards, with 337 and 302 posts identified for each card decision, respectively. For red cards, 42% of posts (n = 158/377) agreed with the referee's decision, 19% (n = 71/377) disagreed and 40% were neutral. For yellow cards, 24% (n = 73/302) agreed with the referee's decision, 33% (n = 99/302) disagreed and 43% were neutral.

Conclusions

For red cards, posts were 2.2 times more likely to agree with the referee's decision than disagree. Posts that agreed with a red card decision were also more likely to be shared (reposted) than posts that disagreed with a red card decision. In contrast, sentiments expressed for yellow card decisions were mixed. This may be related to interpreting the degree of danger and whether mitigation is applied. Within the ecosystem of rugby, sharing sentiments on social media plays a powerful role in creating a positive player welfare narrative.

### Working memory deficits affect risky decision-making in methamphetamine users with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^9796171a]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2012). Low credibility.

Methamphetamine (MA) use and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) commonly co-occur and are independently associated with dysregulation of frontostriatal loops and risky decision-making; however, whether their comorbidity exacerbates risky decision-making is not known. This study evaluated 23 participants with histories of MA dependence and ADHD (MA+ADHD+), 25 subjects with MA dependence alone (MA+ADHD-), and 22 healthy adults (MA-ADHD-), who completed the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) as part of a larger neuropsychiatric research evaluation. Results showed a significant interaction between ADHD, MA, and working memory, such that individuals with working memory deficits in the MA+ADHD+ cohort demonstrated the strongest propensity to select cards from "disadvantageous" versus "advantageous" decks on the IGT. This effect was not better explained by other psychiatric, substance use, neuromedical, or cognitive factors. Findings suggest that working memory deficits may moderate the expression of risky decision-making in MA users with ADHD.

### Exploring the steps of learning: computational modeling of initiatory-actions among individuals with attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder [^8a6aba6f]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Choice accuracy and difficulty

For the purposes of analysis, we wanted to code choice accuracy and choice difficulty for each trial and stage. In each stage, participants were asked to make a choice between two actions. A choice was coded as "correct" if the participant selected the action that took part in the sequence with the highest true expected value at a certain stage. Choice difficulty was defined in a similar way, according to the true expected values of the sequence associated with each offered option. (For more information, see SI).

Using ex-Gaussian distribution to estimate RT variability

An ex-Gaussian distribution is a non-theoretical statistical model that was extensively used in cognitive and ADHD research to describe the distribution of reaction times. It combines two different distributions: the Gaussian (normal) distribution, which represents the more frequent and typically quicker reaction time, and an exponential distribution, which represents the tail of slower reaction times. Specifically, τ is the parameter that describes the exponential portion of the distribution. By using the ex-Gaussian distribution, researchers can more accurately model the full range of reaction times, including the long tail of slower responses. (For more information, see SI).

Data treatment

The first trial in each block, trials with implausibly quick reaction times (< 200 ms) or exceptionally slow reaction times (> 4000 ms) were omitted (5.15% of all trials). Participants with more than 25% excluded trials (one participant, HC group) or higher than 5% no response rate (none), were further excluded from the analysis. Due to technical issues, we found after data collection that some participants did not receive choice feedback on a minority of trials. Those trials were omitted (69 trials overall), and participants with more than 5% of omitted trials were excluded (4 participants, 3 participants from the HC group, and 1 participant from the ADHD group).

### Dynamics of cooperation in concurrent games [^8ce84629]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Methods

In the following, we briefly summarize our theoretical and experimental methods. All details can be found in the Supporting Information.

Calculation of payoffs

For each treatment, we compute the players' payoffs by representing the game as a Markov chain. The possible states of this Markov chain are the possible outcomes of a given (repeated or concurrent) game. For example, in the control treatment, consider players 1 and 2, who interact in a repeated donation game with high benefits. The possible outcomes of a given round are the four possible realizations a = (a₁, a₂) ∈ {C, D}². Given the players' strategies and given the action profile a of the previous round, we can compute the probabilitythat players choose actions according to the profilein the next round for each. By computing all the possible transition probabilities, we derive a 4 × 4 transition matrixthat captures the dynamics of the repeated game. The respective invariant distribution v = (v CC, v CD, v DC, v DD) describes how often we are to observe each possible outcome (a 1, a 2) ∈ {C, D} 2 on average. Given this invariant distribution, payoffs are given by

In the other treatments, payoffs can be calculated similarly, even though they require more computation. In the same-partner treatment, the possible outcomes of an interaction between players 1 and 2 are now given by a 4-tuple. Here, an entry a i k ∈ {C, D} represents player i 's action in game k. Because each entry can take one of two values, there are now 16 possible outcomes. Hence the corresponding transition matrix is of size 16 × 16.

In the different-partner treatment, all four players need to be considered simultaneously. Therefore, the current state is now represented by an 8-tuple. It follows that the state space has 2⁸ = 256 elements. Hence, calculating the players' payoffs requires the invariant distribution of a 256 × 256 transition matrix. While these particular computations are easily manageable when individuals interact across two games, the computational complexity increases exponentially with the number of games concurrently played.

### Industry-supported healthcare programme for concussion management in junior community Australian football [^4b66b81a]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Results

A total of 283 head-related injury cards for individual players were received during the 2023 season (figure 2). Overall, 223 (78.8%) players and parents/carers participated in a screening phone call for the study. Of those screened, 154 (69.1%) players were deemed eligible (ie, diagnosed or suspected SRC) and invited to participate in the industry-supported healthcare programme, of which 108 verbally expressed interest and were emailed the study consent form, with 58 (53.7%) included in the study (figure 2, table 2). The 58 included participants consisted of 39 boys and 19 girls, with under 16s having the highest number of participants (n = 16), followed by under 15s (n = 9) and under 18s (n = 8) (table 2). At the time of consenting to the study, all 58 players were presenting with an index head-related injury for the 2023 season, with 52 (89.7%) characterised as having a suspected SRC and 6 (10.3%) diagnosed with SRC (from a hospital emergency department (ED) presentation on the day of the game) (figure 2).

Table 2
Overview of players who participated in the study

All 58 participants attended their initial appointment with the physician, with 43 of the 52 suspected SRC (82.7%) being diagnosed with SRC at this appointment. The remaining nine players were cleared of SRC at the initial appointment and provided with clearance for RTP. For outcome reporting, these nine players are included in the calculations of demand and implementation but were not included in acceptability and adherence, as these outcomes were specific to those attending with diagnosed SRC.

Of the 49 diagnosed SRCs (six diagnosed in ED (and confirmed by the physician) and 43 diagnosed by the physician), 41 (83.7%) participated in the study follow-up after RTP (figure 2).

### MediDial cards: a quick win for service improvement [^a28d196a]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Lessons and limitations

Although it was a relatively simple concept, this project has been highly successful and brought about a change in the daily life of junior doctors. The MediDial cards were initially intended for foundation trainees but due to the response following their implementation are now being used by trainees of all grades. One unforeseen outcome was their use for locum doctors working at our Trust. Locum doctors were able to have a MediDial card when starting at their morning or evening handover to assist them when working in a possibly unfamiliar trust, an aspect of the project which has been very well received.

Due to the positive feedback and effectiveness of the MediDial cards since being introduced, the project has been up scaled for cards to be available to all clinicians throughout the Trust. There has also been an agreement with the service improvement team and clinical leads that the MediDial cards will be reviewed every six to twelve months to ensure numbers are up to date and new cards printed again for medical staff use. While the project is scalable and could be developed in to an app or smartphone tool, the success of the MediDial cards has been in its simplicity. While the switchboard can always be contacted if needed for the most common numbers, the simple and cheap MediDial card means they are always to hand when needed.

As the project has been free to implement and shown to be beneficial to trainees, this project can be sustainable into the future. As a template has been created for the MediDial cards, it must simply be reviewed at given intervals, updated and then reprinted, requiring minimal maintenance. This template also has the potential to be taken to other Trusts, have the relevant numbers inserted and the MediDial cards introduced there for trainees. This is a future goal that we aim to achieve with this initiative.

The blister card comes to you set up for Sunday Start. If your healthcare professional has instructed you to start pill-taking on the SUNDAY after your menstrual period has begun or if your period begins on Sunday you will take your first pill that very same day. Start with the Sunday pill in row #1. Take one active pill daily for 21 days followed by one white placebo pill daily for 7 days.
If you start pill-taking on a day other than SUNDAY, peel the attached sticker by selecting the day of the week you plan to start. Place the sticker over the pre-printed days of the week and make sure it lines up with the pills. This sticker will help to remind you to take your pill every day. Take the yellow pill which corresponds to the day in row #1 for both the 1/35 day regimen and the 0.5/35 day regimen of the first pack during the first 24 hours of your period. After taking all of the pills at the end of row #3, go back to row #1 and complete the "active" pills. Once all of the active pills have been taken, proceed to row #4 and take the 7 "reminder" pills to complete the pack.
When you start taking the pill for the first time, use an additional method of protection until you have taken your first 7 pills.
Your tablet dispenser consists of three parts, the foil pouch, wallet, and a blister pack containing 28 individually sealed pills. Note that the pills are arranged in four numbered rows of 7 pills each with the days of the week printed above them. The 21 colored pills are "active" birth control pills. The 7 white pills are inactive; their purpose is to help make your pill-taking schedule simple and easy to remember.
You must take your pills in order, one pill each day at intervals of 24 hours. Always start with the colored pills in row #1. To remove a pill, push down on the pill with your thumb and forefinger so that the pill releases through the back of the dispenser. See diagram below:

### How much is too much? (part 1) international olympic committee consensus statement on load in sport and risk of injury [^ea79c886]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Athletes participating in elite sports are exposed to high training loads and increasingly saturated competition calendars. Emerging evidence indicates that poor load management is a major risk factor for injury. The International Olympic Committee convened an expert group to review the scientific evidence for the relationship of load (defined broadly to include rapid changes in training and competition load, competition calendar congestion, psychological load and travel) and health outcomes in sport. We summarise the results linking load to risk of injury in athletes, and provide athletes, coaches and support staff with practical guidelines to manage load in sport. This consensus statement includes guidelines for (1) prescription of training and competition load, as well as for (2) monitoring of training, competition and psychological load, athlete well-being and injury. In the process, we identified research priorities.

### Identity cards help patients identify their doctors [^8a51ddb7]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Post-Measurement

Following the distribution of ID cards during cycle 1, a marked improvement in the ability of patients to recall the names of their doctors was noted on both respiratory and vascular wards. Results are demonstrated in Figures 1–3 (see Figures attached).

On the respiratory ward, the ability of patients to recall at least one member of their treating medical team improved from an initial 37% to 67% (Figure 1). In particular, an improvement in the ability to recall the named consultant improved from 38% to 50% following the first PDSA cycle, and a further improvement was noted up to 83% following cycle 2 (Figure 2). This retention of this information was also demonstrated over the course of 5 days on the ward (Figures 1 & 2, Mondays). On the vascular ward, following a single PDSA cycle, 100% of patients surveyed could recall meeting their consultant and 87% were able to recall their name (Figure 3), up from an initial 54%. A similar trend was noted for registrar and junior doctor identification (Figures 2 & 3).

### Identity cards help patients identify their doctors [^12d8b319]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Strategy

Our aim was to improve identification of the named consultant and/or single member of the treating team to 80%, within one week of admission. Our main outcome measure was patient recall of the named consultant and/or any member of the treating team. Patients were given ID cards during the consultant- or senior-led ward round which clearly indicated the names and grades of all doctors involved in their care. The card can be kept by each patient for future reference. Patients then surveyed to ascertain if the desired outcome measure was achieved and based on results, further cycles were refined as appropriate, and where possible the scale and scope of the implementation was increased.

PDSA Cycle 1

ID cards were distributed to patients during their first encounter on the respiratory ward with a named consultant. Improved short term recall and awareness of doctor's names was clearly evident (Figures 1 & 2, cycle 1). Patients however could still not retain this information after a few days spent on the ward as ID cards were found to be too small and often went missing. ID cards were then re-fashioned to have a larger font and to be permanently fixed to the bedside. A parallel cycle was carried out on the vascular ward with a dramatic improvement in patient recall observed (Figure 3).

PDSA Cycle 2

Larger ID cards were distributed to patients during their first encounter on the respiratory ward with a named consultant. Cards were placed in protective plastic sheets and fastened to bedside tables. Improved short term recall and awareness of doctor's names was then demonstrated (Figures 1 & 2, cycle 2).

A REMINDER

If you forget any of the 7 white "reminder" pills in WEEK 4: THROW AWAY the pills you missed. Keep taking 1 pill each day until the pack is empty. You do not need a back-up method.

FINALLY, IF YOU ARE STILL NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PILLS YOU HAVE MISSED:

Use a BACK-UP METHOD anytime you have sex.

KEEP TAKING ONE "ACTIVE" PILL EACH DAY until you can reach your healthcare professional.

How to Use the Blister Cards

The blister card comes to you set up for Sunday Start. If your physician has instructed you to start pill-taking on the SUNDAY after your menstrual period has begun or if your period begins on Sunday you will take your first pill that very same day. Start with the Sunday pill in row #1. Take one active pill daily for 21 days followed by one white placebo pill daily for 7 days.
If you start pill-taking on a day other than SUNDAY, peel the attached sticker by selecting the day of the week you plan to start. Place the sticker over the pre-printed days of the week and make sure it lines up with the pills. This sticker will help to remind you to take your pill every day. Take the light yellow pill which corresponds to the day in row #1 of the first pack during the first 24 hours of your period. After taking all of the pills at the end of row #3, go back to row #1 and complete the "active" pills. Once all of the active pills have been taken, proceed to row #4 and take the 7 "reminder" pills to complete the pack.
When you start taking the pill for the first time, use an additional method of protection until you have taken your first 7 pills.
Your tablet dispenser consists of three parts, the foil pouch, wallet, and a blister pack containing 28 individually sealed pills. Note that the pills are arranged in four numbered rows of 7 pills each with the days of the week printed above them. The 21 colored pills are "active" birth control pills. The 7 white pills are inactive; their purpose is to help make your pill-taking schedule simple and easy to remember.
You must take your pills in order, one pill each day at intervals of 24 hours. Always start with the colored pills in row #1. To remove a pill, push down on the pill with your thumb and forefinger so that the pill releases through the back of the dispenser. See diagram below:

### Role of tattoos in football: behavioral patterns and success-analysis of the FIFA world cup 2018 [^2575c870]. Clinics in Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Epidemiologic studies suggest that individuals with tattoos are more extroverted, aggressive, and more likely to take risks than individuals with no tattoos. Whether these personality traits affect athletic performance is uncertain. We compared behavioral patterns and rates of success of football players at the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA) World Cup 2018 by tattoo status. In this cross-sectional study, 32.7% of football players had visible tattoos (241 of 736), mostly on their arms (97.1%). Footballers with tattoos played longer on average (208 versus 160 minutes; P < .001), received more cards (.38 versus .27; P < .001), and committed more fouls per player (2.64 versus 2.2; P < .001). Players with tattoos attempted more shots at goal (P = 0.016), but without higher goal success (P = 0.204). The higher number of disciplinary events (being whistled for fouls and given yellow or red cards) and longer playing time of football players with tattoos may reflect personality traits reported in nonathletic individuals with tattoos, such as dominance, extroversion, aggressiveness, and willingness to take risks.

TABLE TENNIS ACTIVITY CARD Parts of the Body Worked Upper & Lower Legs Heart & Lungs Arms Abs Table tennis is a fun indoor game. Gear Up You'll need the right equipment to get started. First, you'll want a table. The tables that are used look a lot like a tennis court – they are usually rectangular and green with white lines. A six-inch net is used to divide the table in half. Next, you'll need a ball and paddles. The balls used in tournaments and during professional competitions are made of plastic and are hollow inside. Paddles, sometimes called rackets, are mostly made of wood. Each side is covered with a sheet of rubber. Often times the rubber sheets are made with different textures. This allows players to hit the ball at different speeds and with different types of spin. Even if a player chose different textures for each side of the paddle, official regulations require one side to be red and one side to be black.

This way, players can always tell which side of the paddle their opponent is using. Stand far enough from the table so that your arm and paddle can be fully extended. Shift your weight to the balls of your feet, and keep your knees slightly bent. Lean forward a bit, using your non-paddle hand to keep balance. Toss the ball up for a serve, and let it bounce one time before hitting it. Each player serves five times, and then the serve goes to their opponent. Stand like you're about to serve the ball for a forehand shot. Only this time, face sideways so that your non-paddle shoulder points toward the other player. Swing your paddle back, shifting your hips in the same direction. Remember that the further you swing back, the more powerful the shot will be. Hold the paddle at the height of your waist, and keep your wrist tilted slightly toward the floor. This way you'll hit the ball in an upward direction and send it over the net. Swing your arms and hips forward, and take your shot.

Scoring There are a variety of ways to score a point. You'll score when a server makes a bad serve or when a player isn't able to hit the ball back to the other player. Points are also scored if the ball bounces two or more times on one player's side, or if the player touches the net or table.

### Cool and hot executive function in conduct-disordered adolescents with and without co-morbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: relationships with externalizing behaviours [^561b769d]. Psychological Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

An understanding of the exact nature of executive function (EF) deficits in conduct disorder (CD) remains elusive because of issues of co-morbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Method

Seventy-two adolescents with CD, 35 with CD + ADHD and 20 healthy controls (HCs) were assessed on a computerized battery of putative 'cool' and 'hot' EFs. Participants also completed the Child Behaviour Checklist (CBCL).

Results

In the cool EF tasks such as planning, the CD + ADHD group in particular showed most notable impairments compared to HCs. This pattern was less evident for set shifting and behavioural inhibition but there were significant correlations between errors scores on these tasks and indices of externalizing behaviours on the CBCL across the sample. For hot EF tasks, all clinical groups performed worse than HCs on delay of gratification and poor performance was correlated with externalizing scores. Although there were no notable group differences on the punishment-based card-playing task, there were significant correlations between ultimate payout and externalizing behaviour across groups.

Conclusions

Overall, our findings highlight the fact that there may be more common than distinguishing neuropsychological underpinnings to these co-morbid disorders and that a dimensional symptom-based approach may be the way forward.

Motor

The Beery Visual-Motor Integration, Sixth Edition (VMI-6) was completed by five participants, with standard scores ranging from 42 to 83 (50.8 ± 18.0); four of the five met the criteria for a visual motor integration disorder. The six individuals who could not complete the VMI-6 were not able to independently manipulate a pencil. On the DP-4 Physical domain, participants' scores ranged from 40 to 68 (47.0 ± 11.1) (Fig. 3).

On the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire (DCDQ), participants on average scored 7.8 (2.0) on the Control During Movement domain (maximum 30), 4.1 (0.3) on the Fine Motor/Handwriting domain (maximum 20) and 8.9 (3.8) on the General Coordination domain (maximum 25). Overall, participants scored 20.8 (4.5) on the Total Score; all participants met the threshold for a developmental coordination disorder. On the Vineland-3 Motor domain, participants had standard scores ranging from 52 to 65 (57.8 ± 5.6). Participants showed similar fine and gross motor skills (Table 1); Gross Motor subdomain V scale scores ranged from 4 to 8 (6.4 ± 1.5) and Fine Motor from 5 to 11 (7.2 ± 2.3).

Psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities

Six of 11 participants presented with inattention and hyperactivity and 5 of 11 with impulsivity. Consensus DSM-5 diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were given to 6 of 10 participants (Fig. 4, Supplementary Material, Table S4).

### Impact of movie and video game elements on tic manifestation in children [^00897951]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

To test our hypotheses, we used three types of media content: (i) an excerpt from the film Up (2009) with its dramatic climax, (ii) short clips featuring affective bodily cues of positive and negative valence, and (iii) an in‐house designed game called ZenithX (Figure 1a–c) involving three types of anticipatory events: dice roll, battle, and card regain. Given the evidence on striatal dopaminergic responsiveness to cued expectations, we specifically investigated whether tic frequency varied between two anticipation modes: (i) anticipation with a cue indicating the pending reward and invoking value expectations and (ii) anticipation without such a cue.

FIGURE 1
The ZenithX game and the experimental setup. We designed the ZenithX game as a combination of the card game War and the board game Ladders and Snakes. (a1) In each game round, participants compete in a race to the top with three opponents (out of four potential opponents including one allegedly human, played by the experimenter, and three bots). The first opponent arriving at the top is granted the highest score, whereas the rest lose points according to their distance from the top. The opponents differ in color, indicating their strength (their success rates in battles). A virtual dice roll determines the number of forward steps for each player in each round. (a2) When two players occupy the same slot, a combat is initiated. The combat includes the following phases as follows. (i) Card selection: the participant selects one of three cards from their hand; the cards are numbered from 1 to 9, where 9 is the strongest card. (ii) Battle: The selected card competes with the opponent's card. The winner advances, and the loser retreats a number of steps equal to the difference between the competing cards' numbers. (iii) Card retrieval (a3): an animation of three chests appears on the screen. The chests differ in color, indicating the strength of the cards they contain (i.e. the chests differ in card number probabilities). During the anticipation phase, three chests were presented, and one of them started shaking, indicating that the retrieved card would be drawn from it. The duration of the chest presentation and shaking animation was randomly set to 0.5, 4.5, 9, or 13.5 s, with a total duration of 14 s for the entire phase. Finally, the chest opened, and the participant retrieved and exposed a card. In Experiment 2, the motionless chest appeared on the screen for 3 s, followed by shaking for 3–4 s. Each participant attended a 3‐h session at the Immersive lab, which was conducted by a trained research assistant. The participants provided their consent for video and audio recording of the session using two Logitech Brio 4K webcams. One of the webcams was placed in front of the participant for video recording, whereas the other was placed on a small stool next to them for sound recording. (b1) The participants were seated on a student chair (represented schematically due to confidentiality issues), equipped with a computer mouse and a pair of on‐ear headphones (Audio‐Technica ATH‐M20X), facing a projector screen (b2). They were instructed to tic as much or as little as they needed throughout the entire session without suppressing tics.

### Sanctioned illegal high tackles significantly increase concussion risk to both tacklers and ball carriers in elite men's rugby union [^118c0d4f]. BMJ Open Sport & Exercise Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Tackler versus ball carrier HIA risk

Both tacklers and ball carriers were significantly more likely to suffer concussions following sanctioned high tackles (table 1). Tackler concussion propensity was 66.4 times (16.2 to 272.8) higher for red-carded tackles than legal tackles, though these were rare (n = 2 tackler concussions from red-carded tackles). Any sanctioned high tackle (n = 8, propensity 31.8, 15.9 to 63.5 tackler concussions per 1000 tackles) was 28.5 times more likely to result in a tackler concussion than a legal tackle (propensity ratio 28.5, 13.5 to 59.9).

Table 1
Tackle, concussion and HIA removal numbers, and calculated propensities for a range of sanction severities to tacklers and ball carriers

Ball carrier concussion risk was greatest in red-carded tackles (propensity 333.3 concussions per 1000 red-carded tackles, propensity ratio for RC vs legal tackles 863.7, 388.0 to 1922.5), with ball carrier concussion propensity decreasing as sanction severity decreased from red carded to penalty only sanctioned tackles (table 1).

For HIA1 removal risk, tackler propensity was 35.7 (18.6 to 68.8) HIAs per 1000 sanctioned high tackles (propensity ratio 19.2, 95% CI 9.9 to 37.2, for sanctioned vs legal tackles). Tacklers who received cards (n = 4 out of 96 tackler HIAs) were 24.7 times more likely to require HIA1 removal than tacklers who made legal tackles.

Figure 3 shows the odds of a concussion to either player as sanction severity increases in a sequential manner, with the OR of each sanction relative to the odds from a legal tackle shown on the graph. The odds of concussion increased with a dose–response relationship as sanction severity increased sequentially from legal tackle to RC (p < 0.001). The odds of a concussion were 457.4 (200.3 to 1044) times greater after a red-carded tackle than a legal tackle.

On the contrary, not only the incidence of time-loss injuries but also the proportion of moderate/severe injuries was highest in the World Cups and the Club World Cups. The high number of matches played by these top-level players has been previously discussed as a potential risk factor for injury.

### Tackling risky alcohol consumption in sport: a cluster randomised controlled trial of an alcohol management intervention with community football clubs [^d1f97d6b]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

Trial registration and protocol

Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12609000224224. Publication of research protocol.

Design

A repeat cross-sectional cluster randomised controlled trial was undertaken with community football clubs (clusters) randomised to either control or intervention groups.

Setting

The study was undertaken with community football clubs within the Hunter, New England and Sydney regions of New South Wales, Australia.

Participant eligibility and recruitment

Clubs

All community level, non-elite 'football' clubs (Rugby League, Rugby Union, soccer/association football and Australian Rules football) within the study area were eligible to participate if they had over 40 members, sold alcohol and were not participating in an alcohol management improvement programme. A nominated representative (eg, President) from each club was telephoned to assess club eligibility and invite clubs to participate in the study.

Club members

A quasi-random process was used to select club members for baseline and postintervention surveys, with a study invitation provided to the 30 members of each club with the most recent birthdays. Members of clubs (players, spectators/fans, coaches/trainers, committee members or administrators) were eligible to participate in the study if they were 18+ years of age and spoke English. Selected members were telephoned to confirm eligibility and to obtain formal consent. Each club was provided AU$500 to reimburse member recruit costs.

Random allocation and blinding

Following baseline data collection, clubs were randomly allocated (using a Microsoft Excel random-number generator) to intervention or control conditions using simple randomisation in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by football code and geographical area. Randomisation was performed by an independent statistician not involved in intervention delivery or data collection. Research staff involved in postintervention data collection were blind to the group allocation of clubs. To assess blinding, staff were asked to report which treatment group they believed the club members belonged.

Intervention

The intervention was based on an existing alcohol management intervention (Good Sports) in community sports clubs. To maximise effectiveness, the intervention addressed multiple determinants of risky alcohol consumption, including alcohol availability and pricing, free alcohol promotions, drinking gamesand alcohol-related sponsorship. The alcohol management practices were organised into a three-level accreditation framework, implemented over two and a half sporting seasons (2010–2012; table 1).

### Executive function and fluid intelligence after frontal lobe lesions [^cc29e55b]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Figure 3 also suggests little difference between left lateral, right lateral, inferior medial and superior medial subgroups. In confirmation, ANOVA showed no significant difference between these groups, for Culture Fair IQ, F (3, 32) = 1.76, P = 0.17, for Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, F (3, 30) = 0.16, P = 0.92, or for Verbal Fluency, F (3, 31) = 0.76, P = 0.53 (Table 2, rightmost column; ANOVAs on raw scores unadjusted for Culture Fair).

As frontal lesions are sometimes specifically linked with perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (Milner,), analyses were repeated using percentage perseverative errors (Nelson,) instead of the total error score. For this measure, the group difference between patients and controls was not significant, t (72) = 0.17, P = 0.43, accompanied by a weaker correlation with Culture Fair, r = −0.31, P < 0.005. Again, ANOVA showed no significant difference between frontal subgroups, F (3, 30) = 0.28, P = 0.84.

In a further subsidiary analysis, numbers of problems correctly solved were examined for each of the four separate subtests of the Culture Fair. The correlation with Wisconsin Card Sorting Test total errors was negative for all four subtests (median −0.52), and with Verbal Fluency score positive for all four subtests (median 0.43), suggesting behaviour similar to that of total IQ scores from the full test.

Results

Descriptive statistics

In the first division, the rank_diff variable's SD of 3.58 indicates variability in team performance, while the points_diff variable's SD of 8.18 reflects fluctuations in points. The second division shows even greater variability, with rank_diff at 4.86 and points_diff at 8.40, highlighting higher deviations from expected performance compared with the first division (table 1). Regarding injury measures, in the first division, teams lost an average of 753.67 days to injuries (SD: 367.39). In contrast, in the second division, the average number of days lost due to injuries was higher at 869.13 (SD: 394.39). The variable injury incidence indicates that teams in the first division averaged 21.36 injured players (SD: 3.98). In the second division, teams averaged 21.57 injured players (SD: 4.26). Finally, the results show that the first-division teams averaged 1.84 injured players on matchday (SD: 0.93), while the second-division teams had a higher average of 2.24 injured players on matchday (SD: 1.02).

### Working memory training restores aberrant brain activity in adult attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder [^80c1e79f]. Human Brain Mapping (2020). Medium credibility.

2.3.1 Dual n‐back task

Due to its wide use in brain imaging, cognitive training, and ADHD research (see Section 1), we selected the n‐back task as our training task, as well as an outcome measure before and after training (Jaeggi, Buschkuehl, Jonides, & Perrig, 2008). Despite that the behavioral training and transfer outcomes appear to be quite similar regardless of whether participants train on single or dual n‐back tasks (Au et al. 2015), we selected a dual task for two reasons. First, we wanted to test whether the behavioral training results were similar to our previous dual n‐back training study in a neurotypical population (Soveri et al. 2017a). Second, we assumed that the dual n‐back training would require more widespread cognitive and neural processes as compared to single n‐back training, thus resulting in more extensive changes in brain activity (see Thompson, Waskom, & Gabrieli, 2016). In the dual n‐back task, participants were presented with simultaneous phonological and visuospatial stimulus streams. The phonological stream included eight different spoken Finnish syllables (/dy/, /ki/, /le/, /nä/, /pö/, /ro/, /su/, or /ta/) while the visuospatial stimuli were white squares appearing in eight possible locations on the screen (at top middle, bottom middle, or any of the four left or right corners from the fixation that was at the center). Syllables and squares were presented at the same time (500 ms stimulus presentation, 2,500 ms inter‐stimulus interval). The task was to indicate whether the current stimulus matched the one presented n‐trials back. Participants were required to respond to both stimulus streams, that is, they had to press the right key if the syllable matched the one presented n trials back, and the left button if the spatial location of the square matched with the square location n trials back. On each trial, a target could appear in the phonological or visuospatial stream, or both. The task consisted of 10 blocks of sequences, each containing 20 squares and 20 syllables. Total duration of the dual n‐back task in the pretest session was about 12 min. The task was adaptive, that is, the difficulty was continuously adjusted according to individual's performance. When 90% accuracy was reached, n was increased by 1 in the next block. If the accuracy rate fell below 75% on either stimulus type, n was decreased by 1. The level of n could vary between 1 and 9. The session began with a 2‐back sequence but changed to 1‐back if the accuracy fell below 75%. At the end of the session, a result screen was displayed showing the highest level of n achieved during the session and the number of blocks completed for each level of n. Given that the task difficulty varied as a function of each participant's task performance (meaning that accuracy or RT metrics are not comparable across participants), we used the maximum n‐back level achieved per session as the main dependent variable (cf. Soveri et al. 2017b).

Exposure and injury registration

Data collection was undertaken in accordance with the 2006 consensus statement on how to conduct injury surveillance research in soccer and in line with the recent 2020 International Olympic Committee (IOC) consensus statement. The overall study methodology has previously been described in detail.

In brief, all first team players in the included teams were invited to participate in the study. At the beginning of every season, teams appointed a contact person within their medical team to be responsible for collecting data and communicating with the study group. Player baseline data were collected at inclusion on an annual basis. All individual player exposures during supervised training sessions and matches were recorded on standard attendance records. Time loss injuries were registered on standard injury cards containing information about the type, location and circumstances of the injury. The appointed contact person reported attendance records and injury cards monthly to the study group that checked the reports and sent feedback to the teams to clarify any missing or unclear data. No specific diagnostic criteria for AAIS and PAIS were used, and it was up to the medical staffs to classify the injuries and refer for imaging or any other consultations needed. All injuries were given a diagnostic code by the study group per the Orchard Sports Injury Classification System (OSICS) 10. Injury was defined as any physical complaint sustained by a player that resulted from a soccer match or soccer training and led to the player being unable to take a full part in future soccer training or match play. Other relevant injury definitions for this substudy are highlighted in Table 1.
