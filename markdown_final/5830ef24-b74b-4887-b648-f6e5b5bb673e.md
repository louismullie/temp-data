## Question

Treat her-2 positive breast cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating HER2-positive breast cancer across early and advanced disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about disease classification and prognostic implications. Then, I should verify the foundational role of HER2-targeted therapy and the standard first-line regimen. Next, I will examine early-stage management, including neoadjuvant strategies, adjuvant therapy, and escalation or de-escalation based on response. After that, I need to review advanced disease sequencing, including second-line and beyond, and special populations such as HR-positive disease and brain metastases. Finally, I should consider resistance mechanisms, emerging therapies, and practical implementation issues like cardiotoxicity monitoring and cost considerations [^1111cgTG] [^111heyCL].

> Let me first confirm the disease framework and prognostic context. HER2-positive breast cancer accounts for roughly 15–20% of invasive disease and confers an aggressive phenotype; however, the development of anti-HER2 therapies has fundamentally altered outcomes, converting a historically poor-prognosis subtype into one with substantial long-term survival in many patients, particularly when treated in the curative setting [^113XWHUt] [^116Q6vxh]. Hold on, I should verify heterogeneity within HER2-positive disease; ER status partitions HER2-positive tumors into biologically distinct subsets with differing patterns of relapse and treatment sensitivities, which has implications for sequencing and de-escalation strategies [^111yMHCi] [^1119eVBi].

> Next, I should review the foundational principle: HER2-targeted therapy is mandatory across settings unless contraindicated by cardiac disease. Trastuzumab reduces recurrence and mortality by about one-third in early-stage disease, with durable benefits persisting beyond a decade, and this magnitude of benefit is consistent across nodal status and ER subgroups, supporting universal adjuvant trastuzumab in appropriately selected patients [^112Yj27i] [^111Z6EVB]. Wait, let me verify the cardiac caveat; guidelines advise against HER2-targeted therapy in patients with clinical heart failure or significantly reduced LVEF, necessitating baseline and periodic cardiac function assessment during treatment [^1111cgTG] [^114aXAVx].

> I will now examine first-line therapy in metastatic disease. The standard of care is dual HER2 blockade with trastuzumab plus pertuzumab combined with a taxane, which yields superior survival compared with trastuzumab-based therapy without pertuzumab; this is a strong, evidence-based recommendation unless taxanes are contraindicated [^114aXAVx] [^115SQjN5]. Let me double-check the maintenance strategy; chemotherapy is typically continued for 4–6 months or until maximal response, after which anti-HER2 therapy is continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity, which aligns with both ASCO and NCCN guidance [^113JqR4r] [^111DCNZg].

> Now, for early-stage disease, I need to ensure I distinguish neoadjuvant from adjuvant pathways. For node-positive or high-risk node-negative HER2-positive tumors, neoadjuvant therapy with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, with the addition of pertuzumab in many cases, increases pathologic complete response and facilitates surgical management; dual blockade yields higher pCR than trastuzumab alone, supporting its routine use in the neoadjuvant setting [^113inUyr] [^112wH83s]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; for very small, node-negative tumors (T1a–T1b N0), routine neoadjuvant therapy is not advised outside trials, and adjuvant decisions should be individualized given uncertain absolute benefit in this subgroup [^113inUyr] [^1152NLxH].

> Next, I should review adjuvant therapy and escalation based on response. After surgery, patients who achieve pCR generally complete one year of trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab, whereas those with residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant therapy should receive trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), which reduces recurrence compared with continued trastuzumab; this is a strong, evidence-based recommendation [^1138cXYT] [^115BkK72]. Wait, I should verify duration; one year of adjuvant trastuzumab remains standard, though emerging data suggest that six months may be noninferior in selected low-risk settings, a consideration that requires careful patient selection and shared decision-making [^115mwNjE].

> I need to check de-escalation strategies and the evolving role of chemotherapy omission. In selected patients with favorable biology and low-risk features, chemotherapy-sparing regimens such as paclitaxel plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab are being explored to reduce toxicity while maintaining efficacy; however, these approaches remain investigational for many and should be restricted to clinical trials or highly selected scenarios [^1119eVBi] [^117QV3B4]. But wait, what if the tumor is HR-positive and HER2-positive; in that subtype, endocrine therapy plus anti-HER2 therapy may be reasonable for low-burden, indolent disease, though most patients still derive greater benefit from chemotherapy plus dual HER2 blockade in the curative setting [^117Qz3t1] [^113inUyr].

> Turning to advanced disease beyond first line, I should confirm the second-line standard. If progression occurs during or after first-line therapy and the patient has not previously received trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), T-DXd is the preferred second-line agent based on robust efficacy data; this is a strong, updated ASCO recommendation [^111MxXdF] [^113tLcNN]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives; T-DM1 remains an option if T-DXd has already been used or is unavailable, and subsequent lines should be individualized based on prior therapies, biomarkers, and patient preferences, with multiple active options including tucatinib-based regimens, neratinib, lapatinib, margetuximab, and chemotherapy combinations [^113GvPym] [^114ifWGg].

> Let me consider special populations, starting with HR-positive, HER2-positive metastatic disease. For low-burden, asymptomatic patients or those with comorbidities precluding chemotherapy, endocrine therapy plus trastuzumab or lapatinib can be considered, though most patients ultimately require chemotherapy plus HER2-targeted therapy for optimal disease control; endocrine therapy may be layered in after chemotherapy completion or at progression in selected cases [^117Qz3t1] [^115T6TUp]. I should confirm that this is framed as a weak recommendation with shared decision-making due to limited evidence and heterogeneity of benefit [^117Qz3t1].

> Brain metastases require a distinct approach, so I need to ensure I address CNS-directed strategies. Tucatinib combined with trastuzumab and capecitabine improves survival in patients with HER2-positive disease and brain metastases, and should be prioritized when CNS involvement is present; multidisciplinary care is essential to integrate surgery, radiotherapy, and systemic therapy sequencing [^112Fi5aD]. Wait, let me verify the evidentiary basis; this recommendation reflects high-quality randomized data demonstrating CNS activity and overall survival benefit in this population [^notfound].

> Next, I should review resistance mechanisms and how they inform sequencing. Intratumoral HER2 heterogeneity, activation of alternative signaling pathways such as PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and immune escape all contribute to resistance; these insights support rational sequencing of agents with distinct mechanisms and exploration of combinations that address compensatory pathways [^113XWHUt] [^117RT13x]. Hold on, I should verify that these concepts are guiding current trial design and real-world practice patterns, which they are, including efforts to pair ADCs with TKIs or immunotherapies in selected contexts [^113XWHUt].

> I will now examine emerging therapies and future directions. Antibody–drug conjugates beyond T-DM1 and T-DXd, novel bispecific antibodies, and immune-based combinations are under active investigation, and while checkpoint inhibitors have not yet transformed HER2-positive disease as they have in TNBC, selected combinations and biomarker-enriched strategies may yield benefit in the future [^113XWHUt]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should be cautious not to overstate immunotherapy's current role; outside trials, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is not standard for HER2-positive breast cancer, but ongoing studies may redefine its place [^notfound].

> I need to ensure practical implementation details are addressed. Baseline and periodic echocardiography or multigated acquisition scanning is required to monitor for trastuzumab-related cardiotoxicity, with particular vigilance when anthracyclines are part of the regimen; dose holds and cardiology co-management are standard when LVEF declines [^notfound]. Cost and access can be barriers, so clinicians should discuss affordability, insurance coverage, and available assistance programs, and consider resource-stratified options when high-cost agents are inaccessible, aligning with ASCO's emphasis on equitable, value-conscious care [^111heyCL] [^111o1ZnR].

> Let me reconsider the overall treatment algorithm to ensure internal consistency. In early-stage disease, use neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus dual HER2 blockade for node-positive or high-risk node-negative disease, escalate to T-DM1 for residual disease, and deliver one year of adjuvant anti-HER2 therapy; in advanced disease, start trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane, continue anti-HER2 maintenance, and sequence to T-DXd in second line if not previously used, with subsequent lines individualized to prior therapies, comorbidities, and patient preferences [^113inUyr] [^114aXAVx] [^111MxXdF]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with both ASCO and NCCN guidance, which it does, acknowledging that certain de-escalation strategies remain investigational and require careful selection and shared decision-making [^116afnNg] [^114aXAVx].

The standard of care for HER2-positive breast cancer is **trastuzumab plus pertuzumab with a taxane** for first-line metastatic disease [^114aXAVx], and **trastuzumab with chemotherapy** for early-stage disease, with one year of adjuvant trastuzumab [^112Yj27i]. For patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy, **T-DM1 is recommended** [^1138cXYT]. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is the preferred second-line therapy for metastatic disease [^111MxXdF], and tucatinib-based regimens are effective for CNS metastases [^113Q55nY]. Neratinib is used as extended adjuvant therapy in HR-positive, HER2-positive patients [^111ADw92]. Treatment is tailored by hormone receptor status, prior exposure, and comorbidities, with ongoing research into novel agents and combinations [^114ifWGg].

## Early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer

### Neoadjuvant therapy

- **Standard regimen**: Trastuzumab plus pertuzumab with chemotherapy (anthracycline and taxane or non-anthracycline) [^113inUyr] for node-positive or high-risk node-negative disease [^114QVVze].
- **Pathological complete response (pCR)**: Dual HER2 blockade increases pCR, a surrogate for improved long-term outcomes [^111ADw92].
- **Residual disease**: After neoadjuvant therapy, T-DM1 is recommended for residual invasive disease [^1138cXYT].

---

### Adjuvant therapy

- **Standard regimen**: Trastuzumab with chemotherapy, followed by one year of adjuvant trastuzumab [^115BkK72].
- **Dual blockade**: Pertuzumab may be added in high-risk patients, though benefits are modest [^1152NLxH].
- **Extended therapy**: Neratinib is used after trastuzumab in HR-positive, HER2-positive patients [^111ADw92].

---

## Metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer

### First-line therapy

The **standard regimen** is trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane (docetaxel or paclitaxel) [^114aXAVx] [^116afnNg]. For selected HR-positive patients with low burden, **endocrine therapy plus trastuzumab** may be considered [^117Qz3t1].

---

### Second-line therapy

The **preferred agent** is trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) [^111MxXdF] for patients not previously exposed [^113tLcNN]. Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) remains an **alternative** [^113GvPym].

---

### Subsequent lines of therapy

- **Tucatinib**: With trastuzumab and capecitabine, effective including in CNS metastases [^notfound].
- **Other options**: Neratinib, lapatinib, margetuximab, and chemotherapy combinations [^114ifWGg].

---

## Special considerations

### Hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive disease

In HR-positive, HER2-positive disease, **endocrine therapy** can be combined with HER2-targeted therapy in selected patients [^117Qz3t1]. CDK4/6 inhibitors are being explored in clinical trials [^113xbLyp].

---

### Brain metastases

For brain metastases, **tucatinib-based regimens** are effective [^115Av4jv], and **radiation therapy** is used in combination with systemic therapy.

---

### Cardiac toxicity

Cardiac toxicity warrants **monitoring** with regular echocardiograms during trastuzumab-based therapy, and **management** involves adjusting therapy if significant LV dysfunction occurs.

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Antibody-drug conjugates**: Ongoing development of new ADCs [^1119xAt6].
- **Immunotherapy**: Under investigation, particularly in HER2-positive subtypes [^1152GuqQ].
- **Biomarkers**: Efforts to identify predictors of response and resistance [^117RT13x].

### Is there a role for immunotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer? [^1152GuqQ]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Although the prognosis and prediction of therapeutic benefit for breast cancer patients overexpressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) have dramatically changed with the administration of anti-HER2-targeted therapies, HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer is still an incurable disease. Thus, new and better therapeutic options are urgently needed. Among them, are the agents stemming from the field of immunology that have been the focus of impressive scientific progress and new therapeutic opportunities seem to emerge "every day" in a variety of tumor types.

### Towards personalized treatment for early stage HER2-positive breast cancer [^1119eVBi]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2020). High credibility.

Advances in HER2-targeted therapies have improved the survival of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. The standard-of-care treatment for localized disease has been chemotherapy and 1 year of adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy, typically with the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab. Despite the effectiveness of this treatment, disease relapse occurs in a subset of patients; thus, focus has been placed on escalating treatment by either combining different HER2-targeted agents or extending the duration of HER2-targeted therapy. Indeed, dual HER2-targeted therapies and extended-duration anti-HER2 therapy, as well as adjuvant therapy with the anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate T-DM1, have all been approved for clinical use. Emerging evidence suggests, however, that some patients do not derive sufficient benefit from these additional therapies to offset the associated toxicities and/or costs. Similarly, the universal use of chemotherapy might not benefit all patients, and treatment de-escalation through omission of chemotherapy has shown promise in clinical trials and is currently being explored further. The future of precision medicine should therefore involve tailoring of therapy based on the genetics and biology of each tumour and the clinical characteristics of each patient. Predictive biomarkers that enable the identification of patients who will benefit from either escalated or de-escalated treatment will be crucial to this approach. In this Review, we summarize the available HER2-targeted agents and associated mechanisms of resistance, and describe the current therapeutic landscape of early stage HER2-positive breast cancer, focusing on strategies for treatment escalation or de-escalation.

### Management of patients with advanced-stage HER2-positive breast cancer: current evidence and future perspectives [^113XWHUt]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Amplification and/or overexpression of ERBB2, the gene encoding HER2, can be found in 15–20% of invasive breast cancers and is associated with an aggressive phenotype and poor clinical outcomes. Relentless research efforts in molecular biology and drug development have led to the implementation of several HER2-targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine-kinase inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates, constituting one of the best examples of bench-to-bedside translation in oncology. Each individual drug class has improved patient outcomes and, importantly, the combinatorial and sequential use of different HER2-targeted therapies has increased cure rates in the early stage disease setting and substantially prolonged survival for patients with advanced-stage disease. In this Review, we describe key steps in the development of the modern paradigm for the treatment of HER2-positive advanced-stage breast cancer, including selecting and sequencing new-generation HER2-targeted therapies, and summarize efficacy and safety outcomes from pivotal studies. We then outline the factors that are currently known to be related to resistance to HER2-targeted therapies, such as HER2 intratumoural heterogeneity, activation of alternative signalling pathways and immune escape mechanisms, as well as potential strategies that might be used in the future to overcome this resistance and further improve patient outcomes.

### HER2-positive breast cancer [^116Q6vxh]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Anti-HER2 treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer has changed the natural biology of this disease. This Series article reviews the main achievements so far in the treatment of both metastatic and early HER2-positive breast cancer. The success of neoadjuvant therapy in HER2-positive early breast cancer is especially acknowledged, as pertuzumab has been approved on the basis of a higher proportion of patients achieving a pathological complete response with pertuzumab and trastuzumab than with trastuzumab alone in a neoadjuvant study. Event-free survival after the confirmatory adjuvant trial completed recruitment was numerically better with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab than with trastuzumab alone. With survival rates of almost 5 years in women with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer and 75% of patients achieving a pathological complete response, new treatments in the past decade have clearly improved the prognosis of HER2-positive breast cancer. Despite these achievements, however, the persisting high toll of deaths resulting from HER2-positive breast cancer calls for continued, intensive clinical research of newer therapies and combinations.

Overall, there is a lack of head-to-head trials; therefore, there is insufficient evidence to recommend one regimen over another, and the patient and the clinician should discuss differences in treatment schedules, routes, and toxicities during the decision-making process, after which options are listed.

### Targeting HER2-positive breast cancer: advances and future directions [^1119xAt6]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2023). High credibility.

The long-sought discovery of HER2 as an actionable and highly sensitive therapeutic target was a major breakthrough for the treatment of highly aggressive HER2-positive breast cancer, leading to approval of the first HER2-targeted drug - the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab - almost 25 years ago. Since then, progress has been swift and the impressive clinical activity across multiple trials with monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates that target HER2 has spawned extensive efforts to develop newer platforms and more targeted therapies. This Review discusses the current standards of care for HER2-positive breast cancer, mechanisms of resistance to HER2-targeted therapy and new therapeutic approaches and agents, including strategies to harness the immune system.

### Treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer: current status and future perspectives [^115gvwaY]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2011). Medium credibility.

The advent of HER2-directed therapies has significantly improved the outlook for patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer. However, a significant proportion of these patients still relapse and die of breast cancer. Trials to define, refine and optimize the use of the two approved HER2-targeted agents (trastuzumab and lapatinib) in patients with HER2-positive early stage breast cancer are ongoing. In addition, promising new approaches are being developed including monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting HER2 or other HER family members, antibodies linked to cytotoxic moieties or modified to improve their immunological function, immunostimulatory peptides, and targeting the PI3K and IGF-1R pathways. Improved understanding of the HER2 signaling pathway, its relationship with other signaling pathways and mechanisms of resistance has also led to the development of rational combination therapies and to a greater insight into treatment response in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Based on promising results with new agents in HER2-positive advanced-stage disease, a series of large trials in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings are planned or ongoing. This Review focuses on current treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and aims to update practicing clinicians on likely future developments in the treatment for this disease according to ongoing clinical trials and translational research.

### Proposed treatment guidelines for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer in Europe [^116u7TD9]. Annals of Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) is overexpressed/amplified in 20%-30% of human breast tumors and is a marker for a poor prognosis. For these reasons, HER2 has been selected as a therapeutic target for breast cancer treatment. Oncologists can no longer ignore the importance of HER2 status for treatment algorithms in breast cancer. In light of the consequences of HER2 status on treatment selection, further research is warranted to refine and standardize HER2 testing in order to minimize false-negative results and optimize selection of treatment pathways. The anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (MAb) trastuzumab (Herceptin) has proven valuable in treating HER2-positive, advanced-disease patients. and the availability of this novel biologic agent has important implications for clinical practice. This review describes a set of guidelines based on the current options for treatment of breast cancer. Two important factors have been taken into account in compiling these recommendations: (1) the lack of level I evidence to convincingly demonstrate the value of HER2 as a predictive marker for resistance or sensitivity to chemo- and hormonal therapy, and (2) the recently published pivotal phase II and III trial data proving the efficacy of trastuzumab as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

### Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeted therapies in breast cancer [^115a91ip]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was acknowledged as an important therapeutic target in breast cancer more than 25 years ago. Subsequently, significant basic science and translational discoveries have resulted in the approval of four HER2-targeted therapies over the past 15 years. This editorial discusses future challenges regarding selection and development of treatments for HER2-positive breast cancer, which can only be met by continuing to support research efforts into the basic mechanisms by which cancer cells escape targeted therapies. Identifying specific molecular mechanisms underlying the sensitivity or resistance to each HER2-targeted agent will ultimately allow individualized therapy for each patient.

### Optimizing treatment of HER2-Positive breast cancer [^114AGDFS]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2015). Low credibility.

The treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer has benefited from a number of targeted agents. Although adjuvant trastuzumab has dramatically reduced progression — making metastatic disease far less common today — newer treatment advances are also impacting this disease. Dual targeting with pertuzumab and trastuzumab can extend the survival of metastatic disease by more 16 months, but despite such success, resistance to HER2 targeting remains a challenge. Drugs in the pipeline, such as neratinib, may help meet this therapeutic demand. In addition to anti-HER2 agents, chemotherapy is beneficial to patients with tumors 1 cm or larger, but the optimal treatment of smaller tumors is still a work in progress.

### Breast cancer [^114xHjDb]. Lancet (2017). Excellent credibility.

Breast cancer is one of the three most common cancers worldwide. Early breast cancer is considered potentially curable. Therapy has progressed substantially over the past years with a reduction in therapy intensity, both for locoregional and systemic therapy; avoiding overtreatment but also undertreatment has become a major focus. Therapy concepts follow a curative intent and need to be decided in a multidisciplinary setting, taking molecular subtype and locoregional tumour load into account. Primary conventional surgery is not the optimal choice for all patients any more. In triple-negative and HER2-positive early breast cancer, neoadjuvant therapy has become a commonly used option. Depending on clinical tumour subtype, therapeutic backbones include endocrine therapy, anti-HER2 targeting, and chemotherapy. In metastatic breast cancer, therapy goals are prolongation of survival and maintaining quality of life. Advances in endocrine therapies and combinations, as well as targeting of HER2, and the promise of newer targeted therapies make the prospect of long-term disease control in metastatic breast cancer an increasing reality.

### Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2-positive breast cancer: does estrogen receptor status define two distinct subtypes? [^111yMHCi]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) overexpression occurs in ∼20% of breast cancers and has historically been associated with decreased survival. Despite substantial improvements in clinical outcomes, particularly with the emergence of HER2-targeted therapy, a substantial minority of patients still relapses, and progression is inevitable in metastatic disease. Accumulating data indicate that HER2-positive disease is itself a heterogeneous entity.

Methods and Results

In this article, we qualitatively review the data supporting the classification of HER2-positive disease as at least two separate entities, distinguished by estrogen receptor (ER) status. We summarize differences in clinical outcomes, including response to neoadjuvant therapy, timing and patterns of dissemination, efficacy of therapy in the metastatic setting and survival outcomes.

Conclusions

The collective data are sufficiently strong at this point to propose that ER status defines two distinct subtypes within HER2-positive breast cancer, and we highlight the implications of this knowledge in future research, including understanding of the basic biology of HER2-positive breast cancer and the design of future clinical trials.

HER2-targeted therapy with chemotherapy — continuation and maintenance: If a patient is receiving HER2-targeted therapy and chemotherapy combinations, the chemotherapy should continue for approximately 4–6 months (or longer) and/or to the time of maximal response, depending on toxicity and in the absence of progression. When chemotherapy is stopped, clinicians should continue the HER2-targeted therapy; no further change in the regimen is needed until the time of progression or unacceptable toxicities. Type: Evidence based; Evidence quality: Intermediate; Strength of recommendation: Moderate.

### Trastuzumab for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer: a meta-analysis of 13 864 women in seven randomised trials [^112Yj27i]. The Lancet: Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Summary

Background

Trastuzumab targets the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein. Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces the risk of recurrence and death, but is associated with cardiac toxicity. We investigated the long-term benefits and risks of adjuvant trastuzumab on breast cancer recurrence and cause-specific mortality.

Methods

We did a collaborative meta-analysis of individual patient data from randomised trials assessing chemotherapy plus trastuzumab versus the same chemotherapy alone. Randomised trials that enrolled women with node-negative or node-positive, operable breast cancer were included. We collected individual patient-level data on baseline characteristics, dates and sites of first distant breast cancer recurrence and any previous local recurrence or second primary cancer, and the date and underlying cause of death. Primary outcomes were breast cancer recurrence, breast cancer mortality, death without recurrence, and all-cause mortality. Standard intention-to-treat log-rank analyses, stratified by age, nodal status, oestrogen receptor (ER) status, and trial yielded first-event rate ratios (RRs).

Findings

Seven randomised trials met the inclusion criteria, and included 13 864 patients enrolled between February, 2000, and December, 2005. Mean scheduled treatment duration was 14.4 months and median follow-up was 10.7 years (IQR 9.5 to 11.9). The risks of breast cancer recurrence (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.71; p < 0.0001) and death from breast cancer (0.67, 0.61 to 0.73; p < 0.0001) were lower with trastuzumab plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone. Absolute 10-year recurrence risk was reduced by 9.0% (95% CI 7.4 to 10.7; p < 0.0001) and 10-year breast cancer mortality was reduced by 6.4% (4.9 to 7.8; p < 0.0001), with a 6.5% reduction (5.0 to 8.0; p < 0.0001) in all-cause mortality, and no increase in death without recurrence (0.4%, –0.3 to 1.1; p = 0.35). The proportional reduction in recurrence was largest in years 0–1 after randomisation (0.53, 99% CI 0.46 to 0.61), with benefits persisting through years 2–4 (0.73, 0.62 to 0.85) and 5–9 (0.80, 0.64 to 1.01), and little follow-up beyond year 10. Proportional recurrence reductions were similar irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics, including ER status. The more high risk the tumour, the larger the absolute reductions in 5-year recurrence (eg, 5.7% [95% CI 3.1 to 8.3], 6.8% [4.7 to 9.0], and 10.7% [7.7 to 13.6] in N0, N1–3, and N4+ disease).

Interpretation

Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces recurrence of, and mortality from, breast cancer by a third, with worthwhile proportional reductions irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics.

### Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive and hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: new insights into molecular interactions and clinical implications [^114wjEyf]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Recent data show a significant benefit from combining an anti-HER-2 agent with endocrine therapy in HER2-positive and hormone receptor (HR)-positive metastatic breast cancer. However, as the clinical outcomes achieved by these combinations do not favourably match those with chemotherapy, clinicians still perceive HER2-positive breast cancer as an homogeneous group and consider chemotherapy with anti-HER2 agents as the preferred treatment option, regardless of the HR status. Indeed, in HR-positive HER2-positive tumours, chemotherapy with anti-HER2 agents is the backbone of treatment, while endocrine therapy is commonly used in sequence when HR and HER2 are co-expressed rather than as a real alternative. Emerging biological and clinical data challenge this paradigm, suggesting that HER2-positive tumours are rather heterogeneous that HRs co-expression may account for part of this heterogeneity and, finally, that chemotherapy may represent an overtreatment in selected cases. The present review aims to summarise the biological features of HER2-positive breast cancer according to HR status, the role of the bi-directional cross-talk between HER2 and HR pathways on resistance development to anti-HER2 and endocrine therapy, and finally, the novel therapeutic strategies, including but not limited to chemotherapy, targeting these two pathways.

### Dual HER2 inhibition: mechanisms of synergy, patient selection, and resistance [^117RT13x]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

HER2-targeted therapies for patients with HER2 + breast cancer are rapidly evolving, offering a range of more complex and personalized treatment options. Currently, an array of anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antibody-drug conjugates are administered, sometimes alongside chemotherapy or endocrine therapy, both in curative and palliative contexts. However, the heterogeneous nature of HER2 + breast cancer demands a deeper understanding of disease biology and its role in responsiveness to novel HER2-targeted agents, as well as non-HER2-targeted therapies, in order to optimize patient outcomes. In this Review, we revisit the mechanisms of action of HER2-targeted agents, examine the evidence supporting the use of dual HER2 blockade in patients with HER2-amplified tumours, and explore the role of biomarkers in guiding future treatment strategies. We also discuss potential implications for the future treatment of patients with HER2 + breast cancer.

### Advances in treating HER2-positive breast cancer: an interview with sunil verma [^113RVG6x]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

2. Thirty years after its discovery, HER2 is one of the most promising targets in breast cancer therapy. Could you take us through how HER2-directed treatments have developed and how they have impacted therapy, particularly with early breast cancer?

It is a journey 30 years in the making. The HER2 gene was identified around 1984, and this was followed with work by pivotal researchers, including Dennis Slamon, indicating that breast cancer patients who have HER2 overexpression and amplification had the worst prognosis. The advent of trastuzumab occurred in the early 1990s, and in the late 1990s it was shown that the incorporation of trastuzumab with standard chemotherapy improves overall survival. By the late 1990s, we had this information, and by 2000 we were using it for treatment of metastatic advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.

Over the past decade, I think our understanding of HER2-positive breast cancer has transformed significantly, going from a sense of using a targeted drug with chemotherapy – in effect, you lose the essence of targeted treatment when you're giving it along with chemotherapy – to a point where we're now using dual targeted therapy with trastuzumab and lapatinib, and dual targeted therapy with two antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab). Our own work has highlighted the role of antibody-drug conjugates, moving away from traditional chemotherapy. I say this is truly a 'targeted treatment', as it incorporates both targeted therapy and targeted chemotherapy, in order to specifically target the HER2-positive cancer cells.

### Trastuzumab for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer: a meta-analysis of 13 864 women in seven randomised trials [^111Z6EVB]. The Lancet: Oncology (2021). High credibility.

However, it is not clear how the level of HER2 amplification, tumour characteristics, in particular oestrogen receptor (ER) status, or other patient risk factors influence the magnitude and duration of treatment benefit. Trastuzumab is expensive and can be associated with cardiac toxicity, particularly when administered with anthracyclines. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate the long-term benefits and risks of trastuzumab on breast cancer recurrence and cause-specific mortality, and whether these effects vary by patient characteristics or types of tumour.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Amplification of the HER2 gene is present in 10–20% of tumours in patients with early-stage breast cancer and is associated with aggressive cancers and an increased risk of disease recurrence. The Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG)'s ongoing extensive searches of bibliographic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and meeting abstracts, up to March 31, 2020, identified seven trials comparing chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, a humanised IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets the extracellular domain of the HER2 protein, with the same chemotherapy alone for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer. Individual trials reported substantial benefits with trastuzumab; however, cardiac toxicity was increased and it was unclear how the level of HER2 amplification, tumour characteristics (eg, oestrogen receptor [ER] status), or other patient risk factors influence the magnitude and duration of benefit.

Added value of this study

This collaborative meta-analysis collated, checked, and analysed individual patient-level data from 13 864 women in seven randomised controlled trials. Trastuzumab reduced the rate of breast cancer recurrence by 34% and of breast cancer mortality by 33%, compared with chemotherapy alone. The average absolute reduction in the 10-year risk of breast cancer recurrence was 9.0%, with a 6.4% reduction in the 10-year risk of dying from breast cancer, and no increase in deaths unrelated to breast cancer. The proportional reductions in recurrence were similar for ER-positive and ER-negative tumours, and did not differ significantly by other patient or tumour characteristics, including the level of HER2 amplification, for patients considered to be HER2-positive.

Implications of all the available evidence

Adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy for patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer reduces recurrence of and mortality from breast cancer by a third, with worthwhile proportional benefits irrespective of recorded patient and tumour characteristics.

### Human epidermal growth factor receptor family-targeted therapies in the treatment of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer [^116ighaz]. The Oncologist (2014). Low credibility.

Breast cancer characterized by overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) has been associated with more aggressive disease progression and a poorer prognosis. Although an improved understanding of breast cancer pathogenesis and the role of HER2 signaling has resulted in significant survival improvements in the past 20 years, resistance to HER2-targeted therapy remains a concern. A number of strategies to prevent or overcome resistance to HER2-targeted therapy in breast cancer are being evaluated. This article provides a comprehensive review of (a) the role of HER2 signaling in breast cancer pathogenesis, (b) potential receptor and downstream therapeutic targets in breast cancer to overcome resistance to HER2-targeted therapy, and (c) clinical trials evaluating agents targeting one or more members of the HER family and/or downstream pathways for the treatment of breast cancer, with a focus on metastatic disease.

### Breast cancer [^1158MUc9]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2019). High credibility.

Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy in women worldwide and is curable in ~70–80% of patients with early-stage, non-metastatic disease. Advanced breast cancer with distant organ metastases is considered incurable with currently available therapies. On the molecular level, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease; molecular features include activation of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, encoded by ERBB2), activation of hormone receptors (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor) and/or BRCA mutations. Treatment strategies differ according to molecular subtype. Management of breast cancer is multidisciplinary; it includes locoregional (surgery and radiation therapy) and systemic therapy approaches. Systemic therapies include endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive disease, chemotherapy, anti-HER2 therapy for HER2-positive disease, bone stabilizing agents, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA mutation carriers and, quite recently, immunotherapy. Future therapeutic concepts in breast cancer aim at individualization of therapy as well as at treatment de-escalation and escalation based on tumour biology and early therapy response. Next to further treatment innovations, equal worldwide access to therapeutic advances remains the global challenge in breast cancer care for the future.

### Systemic treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^115ap7JW]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

SELECTED RECOMMENDATIONS

The recommendations were developed by a multinational, multidisciplinary group of experts using evidence from the existing guidelines and clinical experience as a guide. The ASCO Expert Panel underscores that health care practitioners who implement the recommendations presented in this guideline should first identify the available resources in their local and referral facilities and endeavor to provide the highest level of care possible with those resources. ASCO Resource–Stratified Guidelines acknowledge that clinicians and medical institutions in resource-constrained settings are striving to provide more effective medications, human and material infrastructure, as well as interact with policymakers. The authors would like to make some general points applying to recommendations throughout this guideline: outcomes should be balanced with quality of life including financial toxicity; recommendations are made regarding what is feasible in resource-constrained settings in this publication.

Due to the large breadth of recommendations, the Panel elected to discuss selected areas.

Overarching Clinical Questions on Patients With HR-Positive, HER2-Negative MBC

Recommendations 1.1.1–1.1.9 (first-line), 2.1.1–2.1.6 (second-line), 3.2.1 (patients with HR-positive, BRCA1 / 2 mutation–positive MBC included in a separate section).

Discussion

The first set of treatment recommendations (Table 5) state that clinicians should recommend treatment with systemic therapy according to pathological and biomarker features when the results of biomarker testing and pathology are available. Basic immunohistochemistry (estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PgR], and HER2) is an important step in characterizing the disease and should be sought when possible in every scenario, as this will critically inform treatment decisions.

### Systemic therapy for patients with advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^1111cgTG]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose To update evidence-based guideline recommendations for practicing oncologists and others on systemic therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced breast cancer to 2018. Methods An Expert Panel conducted a targeted systematic literature review (for both systemic treatment and CNS metastases) and identified 622 articles. Outcomes of interest included overall survival, progression-free survival, and adverse events. Results Of the 622 publications identified and reviewed, no additional evidence was identified that would warrant a change to the 2014 recommendations. Recommendations HER2-targeted therapy is recommended for patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, except for those with clinical congestive heart failure or significantly compromised left ventricular ejection fraction, who should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and taxane for first-line treatment and trastuzumab emtansine for second-line treatment are recommended. In the third-line setting, clinicians should offer other HER2-targeted therapy combinations or trastuzumab emtansine (if not previously administered) and may offer pertuzumab if the patient has not previously received it. Optimal duration of chemotherapy is at least 4 to 6 months or until maximum response, depending on toxicity and in the absence of progression. HER2-targeted therapy can continue until time of progression or unacceptable toxicities. For patients with HER2-positive and estrogen receptor-positive/progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer, clinicians may recommend either standard first-line therapy or, for selected patients, endocrine therapy plus HER2-targeted therapy or endocrine therapy alone.

### Emerging approaches for treating HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer beyond trastuzumab [^116MB9dR]. Annals of Oncology (2013). Low credibility.

Because metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is incurable in most cases, the goals of treatment are improvement in quality of life, management of symptoms, and prolonged survival. The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in up to 30% of breast tumors, and before the development of HER-targeted therapy, HER2 positivity was predictive of poorer clinical outcomes. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab (anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies), lapatinib (a small molecule inhibitor of HER2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR]) are approved for treating HER2-positive MBC in the United States. Although trastuzumab plus chemotherapy is currently regarded as the first-line standard of care for HER2-positive MBC, it is not without shortcomings; these include its association with certain adverse events (e.g. cardiotoxic effect) and development of resistance. A number of investigational agents that target HER2 and other members of that receptor family are in clinical development for patients with HER2-positive MBC whose disease has progressed on trastuzumab. In addition, in an effort to overcome treatment resistance, clinical trials are evaluating combination therapy (investigational HER-targeted agents with trastuzumab or lapatinib). This review discusses recently completed and ongoing phase II and III clinical trials of investigational HER-targeted agents in the setting of trastuzumab-progressive, HER2-positive MBC.

Many newer agents in combination are being studied in the front-line treatment of women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC), but the story in the endocrine arena is more about the wise use of new strategies to overcome endocrine resistance, because no new antihormonal agents have been approved in the past decade. During his presentation at the NCCN 19th Annual Conference, Dr. William Gradishar explored what's new in the treatment of MBC, focusing primarily on enhancing the effect of endocrine therapy to overcome resistance with newer targeted agents such as everolimus, reevaluating the role of rebiopsy on disease progression and measuring circulating tumor cells as a surrogate of response to treatment, and reviewing the effective treatment regimens for HER2-positive disease.

### Estrogen / HER2 receptor crosstalk in breast cancer: combination therapies to improve outcomes for patients with hormone receptor-positive / HER2-positive breast cancer [^116A3f1h]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

The human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in 13–22% of breast cancers (BC). Approximately 60–70% of HER2+ BC co-express hormone receptors (HRs). HR/HER2 co-expression modulates response to both anti-HER2–directed and endocrine therapy due to "crosstalk" between the estrogen receptor (ER) and HER2 pathways. Combined HER2/ER blockade may be an effective treatment strategy for patients with HR+/HER2+ BC in the appropriate clinical setting(s). In this review, we provide an overview of crosstalk between the ER and HER2 pathways, summarize data from recently published and ongoing clinical trials, and discuss clinical implications for targeted treatment of HR+/HER2+ BC.

### Systemic treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline Q and a… [^1176NFuy]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

QUESTION: WHAT IS THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH HER2-POSITIVE MBC?

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–targeted therapy is recommended for patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, except for those with cardiovascular contraindications. In special circumstances, such as low disease burden, and/or the presence of a long disease free-interval, clinicians may offer first-line endocrine therapy alone.

When treating patients with HER2-positive MBC, trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane, or endocrine therapy for first-line treatment are recommended according to ASCO guidelines. However, in resource-constrained settings, the resource-stratified guideline presents a tiered list of alternatives. For example, if pertuzumab isn't available, then clinicians may offer either chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, or chemotherapy. Trastuzumab emtansine, capecitabine plus lapatinib, chemotherapy or endocrine therapy plus trastuzumab, or either without trastuzumab if the latter is not available. Navelbine can be used with trastuzumab in the frontline setting, if taxanes are not available. Another possible companion is platinum therapy.

In the second-line setting, or relapse within 12 months of adjuvant therapy, HER2-targeted therapy should be given based on prior therapy, hormone receptor status, and availability. While trastuzumab deruxtecan is the Maximal setting–recommended second-line option, in resource-constrained settings where patients and clinicians cannot access the most resource-required targeted therapy, chemotherapy or endocrine therapy may be offered with or without alternate HER2-targeted therapy regimens. The alternatives are again listed in a tiered order.

### Systemic therapy for advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^115sSRWw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

HER2-positive advanced breast cancer — first-line context and evidence gaps are as follows: For patients whose cancers progressed after > 12 months after the end of trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy or who had de novo metastatic disease, the standard first-line therapy remains the combination of trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and a taxane (either paclitaxel or docetaxel). There is a lack of current published data on the benefit of endocrine therapy in this maintenance regimen of trastuzumab and pertuzumab in patients with hormone receptor–positive HER2-positive cancers, and the optimal duration of dual HER2 therapy in patients achieving complete remission remains unknown. The optimal regimen for patients relapsing after neoadjuvant dual HER2 blockade followed by postneoadjuvant T-DM1 is unknown; these patients may, theoretically, benefit from agents not previously received if relapse occurred within ≤ 12 months, although there is currently no evidence to make a formal recommendation. The Expert Panel encourages future studies and notes real-world data could be valuable in this scenario.

HER2 and Immunotherapy Need

HER2 therapies are recommended in 12% of patients in Enhanced and Maximal, and none in Basic and Core settings. Merging these data with GLOBOCAN cancer incidence, almost 9% of all patients with BC in 2018 have an indication for HER2 therapies, but only 8% in 2040 because of rising incidence in L and LM countries. The absolute number of patients recommended HER2 therapies increases from 183,943 to 224,131 between 2018 and 2040 because of population growth (Table 1).

### Trastuzumab for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer: a meta-analysis of 13 864 women in seven randomised trials [^114qaLP6]. The Lancet: Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

This meta-analysis substantiates that — for patients with operable HER2-positive breast cancer — the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy further reduces recurrence of, and mortality from, breast cancer during the first decade of follow-up by about a third. For the patient population in the trials in this analysis, this finding translates, on average, into a 10-year absolute reduction of 9.0% in recurrence and of 6.4% in breast cancer mortality, compared with chemotherapy alone. These reductions were achieved despite substantial crossover from control to trastuzumab in two trials; therefore, the benefits might have been larger with perfect compliance. The greatest effect was on distant recurrence, although local recurrence was also reduced; however, there was no apparent effect on the incidence of new contralateral breast cancers.

Subgroup analyses by conventional pathological features indicated similar proportional reductions in recurrence, irrespective of nodal status, tumour grade, tumour diameter, and histological subtype. Trastuzumab produced similar proportional reductions in recurrence of ER-positive and ER-negative disease, as did chemotherapy alone in previous meta-analyses. Similar to HER2-negative disease, the risk of early (years 0–4) recurrence was higher for HER2-positive, ER-negative tumours than for HER2-positive, ER-positive tumours. However, late (years 5–9) recurrences are more likely in ER-positive than in ER-negative disease, even though patients with ER-positive disease were scheduled to receive at least 5 years of endocrine therapy.

As the proportional reductions in different subgroups were similar, there were greater absolute reductions in risk among patients with node-positive disease than among those with node-negative disease because of their higher absolute risk of recurrence. Nevertheless, the absolute benefits were substantial, even in the patients with node-negative disease entered into these trials, suggesting appreciable benefits from the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy for all patients with HER2-positive disease fit enough to receive systemic treatment.

### Comparative effectiveness of neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer: a network meta-analysis [^112wH83s]. Journal of the National Cancer Institute (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The growing number of antihuman epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) agents suggests the need for defining the optimal choice of neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer.

Methods

Randomized trials that compared different anti-HER2 regimens in the neoadjuvant setting were included. The odds ratio (OR) for pathological complete response (pCR), treatment completion, and safety was utilized for pooling effect sizes. Network meta-analysis using a Bayesian statistical model was performed to combine the direct and indirect evidence of neoadjuvant therapy for HER2-positive breast cancer. All statistical tests were two-sided.

Results

A database search identified 1047 articles, with 10 studies meeting the eligibility criteria. A total of 2247 patients in seven different treatment arms were assessed. Anti-HER2 agents evaluated included trastuzumab (tzmb), lapatinib (lpnb), and pertuzumab (pzmb). Network meta-analysis showed no statistically significant difference between dual targeting treatment arms; however, lpnb reduced treatment completion due to adverse events. Patients in dual targeting arms had statistically significantly more pCR than those in other treatment arms (chemotherapy [CT] + tzmb + pzmb vs CT + tzmb, OR = 2.29, 95% credibility interval = 1.02 to 5.02, P = 0.02). The surface under the cumulative ranking probability curve indicated that CT + tzmb + pzmb had the highest probability of being the best treatment arm in terms of pCR.

Conclusions

This study indicates that combining two anti-HER2 agents with CT is the most effective treatment modality in the neoadjuvant setting for HER2-positive breast cancer.

### Evolving novel anti-HER2 strategies [^112Td4L7]. The Lancet: Oncology (2009). Medium credibility.

The approval of trastuzumab for use in metastatic breast cancer marked a breakthrough in the understanding of the biology of the disease. However, like most cancer therapies, the disease finds a way to advance despite the treatments developed to eradicate it. Although trastuzumab has had a large effect on the treatment of early and advanced-stage disease, a substantial proportion of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer still progress after receiving the drug. Potential mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab include bypass mechanisms, mutations of the HER2 target, masking of HER2 proteins, inhibition of insulin-like growth factor, and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) deficiency. Many therapies are being developed to target these mechanisms in patients with HER2-positive, trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer. Additionally, treatment strategies other than trastuzumab with unique mechanisms of action are being assessed in this specific group of patients. In this review, we discuss the emerging data assessing therapeutic approaches in the management of trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive disease.

In conclusion, sustained inhibition of either HER2 or ER can result in functioning of the other pathway as a key means of escape/survival in ER+/HER2+ breast cancer cells. Combined receptor (HER2 plus ET) blockade may help overcome the resistance to therapy in this disease population. potentially reduce the use of chemotherapy, and hopefully improve survival results, while maintaining clinical feasibility in terms of safety and tolerability. Further research in patient selection, predictive biomarkers, treatment sequencing, and combination therapies –, as well as novel targeted therapies, are needed in this population to improve patient outcomes.

### ESMO expert consensus statements (ECS) on the definition, diagnosis, and management of HER2-low breast cancer [^114vQkex]. Annals of Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low breast cancer has recently emerged as a targetable subset of breast tumors, based on the evidence from clinical trials of novel anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates. This evolution has raised several biological and clinical questions, warranting the establishment of consensus to optimally treat patients with HER2-low breast tumors. Between 2022 and 2023, the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) held a virtual consensus-building process focused on HER2-low breast cancer. The consensus included a multidisciplinary panel of 32 leading experts in the management of breast cancer from nine different countries. The aim of the consensus was to develop statements on topics that are not covered in detail in the current ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline. The main topics identified for discussion were (i) biology of HER2-low breast cancer; (ii) pathologic diagnosis of HER2-low breast cancer; (iii) clinical management of HER2-low metastatic breast cancer; and (iv) clinical trial design for HER2-low breast cancer. The expert panel was divided into four working groups to address questions relating to one of the four topics outlined above. A review of the relevant scientific literature was conducted in advance. Consensus statements were developed by the working groups and then presented to the entire panel for further discussion and amendment before voting. This article presents the developed statements, including findings from the expert panel discussions, expert opinion, and a summary of evidence supporting each statement.

### New HER2-positive targeting agents in clinical practice [^114JuoVQ]. Current Oncology Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Overexpression of human epidermal growth factor occurs in approximately 20–25% of invasive breast cancers. This subtype of breast cancer has been associated with poor clinical outcomes. The development of trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the extracellular domain of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), revolutionized outcomes of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer; however, many patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer eventually become resistant to it. Several newer anti-HER2 agents have been developed, including lapatinib, pertuzumab, and trastuzumab emtansine. These exciting advances in drug development for HER2-positive breast cancer have also led to many challenges, including how to optimally sequence and combine HER2-targeted agents.

### A network meta-analysis of efficacy and safety for first-line and second / further-line therapies in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer [^1134NgaB]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast cancer is a prevalent malignancy and the primary cause of cancer-related death among women globally. It constitutes 15.5% of all female cancer fatalities, with around 2.3 million new breast cancer cases recorded worldwide in 2020 and approximately 685,000 deaths. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of the National Cancer Institute in the United States, it is estimated that there will be about 297,790 new cases of breast cancer and 43,170 breast cancer-related deaths in 2023. These account for 15.2% of all new cancer cases and 7.1% of all cancer-related deaths, respectively. Most breast cancer cases occur in females (approximately 99%), but there are approximately 2500 new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in males annually in the United States. In clinical practice, breast cancer is commonly subtyped by hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). The subtype of HR-positive/HER2-negative represents the most prevalent among all racial groups, accounting for approximately 68% of cases across all ethnicities. Historically, the estrogen receptor signaling pathway primarily drives cancer cell growth and survival in these tumors, these tumors were treated with endocrine therapy (ET). However, due to limitations in single-agent endocrine therapy efficacy and the presence of primary or secondary drug resistance, endocrine monotherapy is increasingly insufficient for clinical treatment. The development of targeted therapies including Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i) and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI), particularly in combination with ET, has revolutionized the management of these tumors. Nonetheless, the comparative efficacy and safety of most first-line and second/further-line treatments remain uncertain. While some randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have verified the safety and efficacy of targeted therapies or combined targeted endocrine therapy for patients with HR + /HER2 − advanced breast cancer, the absence of head-to-head comparisons prevents us from determining which treatment offers the greatest survival advantage.

### Trastuzumab for early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer: a meta-analysis of 13 864 women in seven randomised trials [^115BkK72]. The Lancet: Oncology (2021). High credibility.

The efficacy of trastuzumab could be enhanced by adding other HER-directed therapies, such as lapatinib or pertuzumab, and by giving combination HER2-directed therapy before surgery. Adapting treatment according to initial tumour response is another approach, as in the KATHERINE trial, in which switching to trastuzumab–emtansine (an antibody–drug conjugate) was more effective than continuing trastuzumab in patients with residual disease following neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Further understanding of how cancer biology affects outcome, such as the relevance of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes or tumour genomics, might also help to individualise treatment approaches.

In summary, this meta-analysis confirms that breast cancer recurrence and mortality can be reduced by a third by adding 1 year of trastuzumab treatment to adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer. The proportional reduction was unaffected by any of the measured tumour or patient characteristics. Because optimal anthracycline and taxane-based chemotherapy schedules also reduce the risk of breast cancer mortality by about a third, regardless of HER2 status or other characteristics, the combination of chemotherapy plus trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer could reduce the risk of death from breast cancer by about 50%, compared with receiving neither chemotherapy nor trastuzumab.

### Current and future management of HER2-Positive metastatic breast cancer [^111wN86c]. JCO Oncology Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed and/or amplified in approximately 20% of breast cancers, conferring an aggressive tumor behavior but also an opportunity for targeted therapies. In the advanced setting, the prognosis of patients suffering from this disease has greatly improved after the introduction of new anti-HER2 drugs beyond trastuzumab. For most patients, a taxane combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the first-line setting, followed by trastuzumab-emtansine in second line, should be considered the standard of care today. However, chemo-free anti-HER2 strategies in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer could also be considered in selected patients. In the third-line setting and beyond, several emerging anti-HER2 therapies are becoming available, including tucatinib, fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (DS-8201a), neratinib, and margetuximab-cmkb. In addition, new compounds and combinations are showing promising results in the late-line setting. The treatment landscape of HER2-positive advanced disease is evolving constantly, active drugs such as pertuzumab and trastuzumab-emtansine are moving to early-stage, many biomarkers, including quantification of HER2 itself, are being explored to improve patient selection, and patient populations with specific needs are emerging, such as those with brain metastasis. Here, we provide an overview of the current and future management of HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.

### Advances in targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 signaling for cancer therapy [^1118CTwE]. Clinical Cancer Research (2006). Low credibility.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)-2 is a member of the HER tyrosine kinase family, which regulates cell growth and proliferation. HER-2 is overexpressed in 20% to 30% of breast cancers and has been associated with an aggressive phenotype and a poorer prognosis, making it an appealing therapeutic target. Since 1998, the anti-HER-2 antibody trastuzumab has been used for the treatment of women with HER-2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Results from large trials have established a role for trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting for the treatment of high-risk primary breast cancer as well. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target HER-2 are also very promising therapies and are likely to be incorporated into clinical practice in the near future. HER-2-targeted therapies represent a major step forward in achieving our goal of delivering individualized targeted therapy for breast cancer. However, there are many unanswered questions about the optimal use of these agents. Ongoing research will better elucidate the best combination therapies to overcome resistance to HER-2-targeted agents and will help identify patients at high enough risk to warrant their toxicity.

### Systemic treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer: ASCO resource-stratified guideline [^114M2PMy]. JCO Global Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Although this guideline refers to the sex of people at risk of BC as women, all people with breasts are at risk for BC and the guidelines apply uniformly to all such people. Therefore, despite limited data when it comes to BC in men, the Expert Panel recommends they have access to the same therapeutic options as patients born female as recommended in evidence-based guidelines. In instances in which the guideline draws on data on the basis of gendered research (eg, studies regarding women with BC), the guideline authors describe the characteristics and results of the research as reported.

In developing resource-stratified guidelines, ASCO has adopted its framework from the four-tier resource setting approach (Basic, Limited, Enhanced, Maximal; Table 1) developed by Breast Health Global Initiative and modifications to that framework on the basis of Disease Control Priorities 3. The framework emphasizes that variations occur not only between but also within countries with disparities, for example, between rural and urban areas.

### Trastuzumab-containing regimens for metastatic breast cancer [^111w1BBu]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with breast cancer are classified as having cells that over-express the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (known as HER2-positive) or not (HER2-negative). Typically, patients with HER2-positive disease have a worse prognosis. Trastuzumab is a selective treatment that targets the HER2 pathway. The available evidence supporting trastuzumab regimens mostly relies upon surrogate endpoints and, although the efficacy results seem to support its use, other uncertainties have been raised about its net benefit in relation to transient cardiac toxicity and a long-term increased risk of metastasis to the central nervous system.

Objectives

To assess the evidence on the efficacy and safety of therapy with trastuzumab (overall) and in relation to the type of co-administered regimen and the line of treatment, i.e. first-line or beyond progression, in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's (CBCG) Specialised Register and used the search strategy developed by the CBCG to search for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in CENTRAL (2013, Issue 1), MEDLINE, EMBASE, BIOSIS, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) search portal and ClinicalTrials.gov (up to 17 January 2013).

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab alone or in combination with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or targeted agents in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

We collected data from published trials. We used hazard ratios (HRs) for time-to-event outcomes and risk ratio (RRs) for binary outcomes. Subgroup analyses included type of regimen (taxane-containing, anthracycline-containing, aromatase inhibitor-containing or other) and treatment line (first-line, beyond progression).

Main Results

The review found seven trials, involving 1497 patients, which met the criteria to be included. The trials were generally of moderate methodological quality; two studies have not published their results on overall survival so the presence of selective outcome reporting bias cannot be ruled out. None of the studies used blinding to treatment allocation, though this is unlikely to have biased the results for overall survival. Studies varied in terms of co-administered regimen and in terms of treatment line. In four studies, trastuzumab was administered with a chemotherapy, such as a taxane-containing, anthracycline-containing or capecitabine-containing regimen. Two studies considered postmenopausal women and administered trastuzumab with hormone-blocking medications, such as an aromatase inhibitor. One study administered trastuzumab in addition to lapatinib. Five studies out of seven included women treated with trastuzumab administered until progression as first-line treatment and two studies considered trastuzumab beyond progression. The combined HRs for overall survival and progression-free survival favoured the trastuzumab-containing regimens (HR 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.71 to 0.94, P = 0.004; and HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.70, P < 0.00001, respectively; moderate-quality evidence). Trastuzumab increased the risk of congestive heart failure (RR 3.49, 90% CI 1.88 to 6.47, P = 0.0009; moderate-quality evidence) and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) decline (RR 2.65, 90% CI 1.48 to 4.74, P = 0.006). For haematological toxicities, such as neutropenic fever and anaemia, there was no clear evidence that risks differed between groups, while trastuzumab seemed to raise the risk of neutropenia. The overall survival improvement was maintained when considering patients treated as first-line or patients receiving taxane-based regimens. The progression-free survival improvement was maintained when considering patients receiving taxane-based regimens, and patients treated as first-line or subsequent lines. Few data were collected on central nervous system progression. Similarly, few studies reported on quality of life and treatment-related deaths.

Authors' Conclusions

Trastuzumab improved overall survival and progression-free survival in HER2-positive women with metastatic breast cancer, but it also increased the risk of cardiac toxicities, such as congestive heart failure and LVEF decline. The available subgroup analyses are limited by the small number of studies. Studies that administered trastuzumab as first-line treatment, or along with a taxane-based regimen, improved mortality outcomes. The evidence to support the use of trastuzumab beyond progression is limited. The recruitment in three out of seven studies was stopped early and in three trials more than 50% of patients in the control groups were permitted to switch to the trastuzumab arms at progression, making it more difficult to understand the real net benefit of trastuzumab. Trastuzumab is generally used for women with HER2-positive early breast cancer in clinical practice, while women enrolled in most of the trials in the metastatic setting were naive to trastuzumab. The effectiveness of trastuzumab for women relapsing after adjuvant trastuzumab is therefore still an open issue, although it is likely that the majority are being offered it again.

### HER-2-targeted therapy: lessons learned and future directions [^1144LcHr]. Clinical Cancer Research (2003). Low credibility.

HER-2 is overexpressed in 20–25% of invasive breast cancers and is associated with an aggressive tumor phenotype and reduced survival rates. The HER-2 status of a tumor is the critical determinant of response to the HER-2-targeted antibody trastuzumab. Thus, accurate assessment of HER-2 expression levels is essential for identifying breast cancer patients who will benefit from HER-2-targeted therapy. Trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy increases response rates, time to progression, and survival. However, the majority of cancers that initially respond to trastuzumab begin to progress again within 1 year. This minireview describes HER-2 targeting strategies currently in use or in stages of development for the treatment of breast cancer.

### Treatment patterns and associated outcomes among patients with HER2 + metastatic breast cancer in the United States: an observational cohort study [^112qKfuu]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Implications for practice

There are several drugs available to treat HER2+ mBC, including some that are more recently approved. This study sought to better understand how these drugs are used and how well they work in patients with HER2+ mBC receiving treatment in largely community-based clinics.

Treatment patterns varied, and more than half of the patients moved to a new therapy within approximately 1 year of their first treatment suggesting rapid progression of disease. The findings indicate that these patients need more effective first treatments that can prevent cancer from growing, spreading, or worsening and provide longer benefits.

### Interaction of host immunity with HER2-targeted treatment and tumor heterogeneity in HER2-positive breast cancer [^112XZhSF]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Growing evidence suggests a clear role of the host immune system in HER2+ breast cancer. In addition, HER2+ breast cancer is generally considered more immunogenic than hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/HER2-, and specific molecular HER2+ subgroups (e.g. HER2-enriched disease) are more immunogenic than others (e.g. Luminal A or B). From a clinical perspective, the immune system plays a relevant prognostic role in HER2+ breast cancer and contributes to the therapeutic effects of trastuzumab. However, as more HER2-targeted agents become available, a better understanding of the role played by the immune system in modulating therapy response to different agents will be needed. Furthermore, the recent introduction in oncology of immune checkpoint inhibitors capable of unleashing anti-tumor immune response opens new possibilities for therapeutic combinations in HER2+ breast cancer. Here, we review the current pre-clinical and clinical data on the interplay between the immune system and HER2+ breast cancer, focusing on different HER2-targeted treatments and the biological heterogeneity that exists within HER2+ disease. Finally, we discuss new therapeutic approaches exploiting the immune system to increase activity or revert resistance to HER2-targeted agents.

### HER2-positive breast cancer and tyrosine kinase inhibitors: the time is now [^113Q55nY]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer accounts for 20–25% of all breast cancers. Multiple HER2-targeted therapies have been developed over the last few years, including the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) lapatinib, neratinib, tucatinib, and pyrotinib. These drugs target HER2 and other receptors of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, therefore each has unique efficacy and adverse event profile. HER2-directed TKIs have been studied in the early stage and advanced settings and have shown promising responses. There is increasing interest in utilizing these drugs in combination with chemotherapy and /or other HER2-directed agents in patients with central nervous system involvement, TKIs have shown to be effective in this setting for which treatment options have been previously limited and the prognosis remains poor. The aim of this review is to summarize currently approved TKIs for HER2+breast, key clinical trials, and their use in current clinical practice.

Purpose

To update evidence-based guideline recommendations to practicing oncologists and others on systemic therapy for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive advanced breast cancer.

Methods

An Expert Panel conducted a targeted systematic literature review (for both systemic treatment and CNS metastases) and identified 545 articles. Outcomes of interest included efficacy and safety.

Results

Of the 545 publications identified and reviewed, 14 were identified to form the evidentiary basis for the guideline recommendations.

Recommendations

HER2-targeted therapy is recommended for patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, except for those with clinical congestive heart failure or significantly compromised left ventricular ejection fraction, who should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and taxane for first-line treatment and trastuzumab deruxtecan for second-line treatment are recommended. In the third-line setting, clinicians should offer other HER2-targeted therapy combinations. There is a lack of head-to-head trials; therefore, there is insufficient evidence to recommend one regimen over another. The patient and the clinician should discuss differences in treatment schedule, route, toxicities, etc during the decision-making process. Options include regimens with tucatinib, trastuzumab emtansine, trastuzumab deruxtecan (if either not previously administered), neratinib, lapatinib, chemotherapy, margetuximab, hormonal therapy, and abemaciclib plus trastuzumab plus fulvestrant, and may offer pertuzumab if the patient has not previously received it. Optimal duration of chemotherapy is at least 4–6 months or until maximum response, depending on toxicity and in the absence of progression. HER2-targeted therapy can continue until time of progression or unacceptable toxicities. For patients with HER2-positive and estrogen receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer, clinicians may recommend either standard first-line therapy or, for selected patients, endocrine therapy plus HER2-targeted therapy or endocrine therapy alone.

### Her-2 targeted therapy: beyond breast cancer and trastuzumab [^115k548f]. Current Oncology Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Her-2 is a validated therapeutic target in breast cancer. The two critical questions that remain regarding Her-2 targeting concern 1) the relevance of Her-2 inhibition in other malignancies and 2) the ability of novel agents to achieve greater Her-2 inhibition than trastuzumab. The contribution of cell signaling effects and immunologic mechanisms to the effect of trastuzumab in vivo remains poorly understood. Thus, the preclinical data that support the greater efficacy of novel Her-2 antibodies or small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors remain to be validated in clinical trials. In this review, we discuss the evidence from recent trastuzumab clinical trials as a point of departure for consideration of novel Her-2 targeted therapies. Preliminary results from early clinical trials suggest that Her-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitors may extend the population for which this strategy offers therapeutic effect.

### HER2-positive breast cancer and tyrosine kinase inhibitors: the time is now [^115Av4jv]. NPJ Breast Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive breast cancer accounts for 20–25% of all breast cancers. Multiple HER2-targeted therapies have been developed over the last few years, including the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) lapatinib, neratinib, tucatinib, and pyrotinib. These drugs target HER2 and other receptors of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, therefore each has unique efficacy and adverse event profile. HER2-directed TKIs have been studied in the early stage and advanced settings and have shown promising responses. There is increasing interest in utilizing these drugs in combination with chemotherapy and /or other HER2-directed agents in patients with central nervous system involvement, TKIs have shown to be effective in this setting for which treatment options have been previously limited and the prognosis remains poor. The aim of this review is to summarize currently approved TKIs for HER2+ breast, key clinical trials, and their use in current clinical practice.

### Systemic therapy for advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^117CFzTb]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Guideline implementation for HER2-positive breast cancer — practice integration and dissemination are described: ASCO guidelines are developed for implementation across health settings, and each guideline includes a member from ASCO's Practice Guideline Implementation Network (PGIN) on the panel whose additional role is to assess suitability for community implementation and identify barriers a reader should be aware of. Barriers to implementation include the need to increase awareness among front-line practitioners, survivors of cancer and caregivers, and to provide adequate services with limited resources; a retrospective cohort study indicates elderly women may not receive guideline-concordant care. The guideline Bottom Line Box was designed to facilitate implementation, the guideline will be distributed widely through the ASCO PGIN, and ASCO guidelines are posted on the ASCO website and most often published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

### Overcoming resistance and restoring sensitivity to HER2-targeted therapies in breast cancer [^112USroS]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 15%-23% of breast cancers overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which leads to the activation of signaling pathways that stimulate cell proliferation and survival. HER2-targeted therapy has substantially improved outcomes in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. However, both de novo and acquired resistance are observed.

Design

A literature search was performed to identify proposed mechanisms of resistance to HER2-targeted therapy and identified novel targets in clinical development for treating HER2-resistant disease.

Results

Proposed HER2-resistance mechanisms include impediments to HER2-inhibitor binding, signaling through alternative pathways, upregulation of signaling pathways downstream of HER2, and failure to elicit an appropriate immune response. Although continuing HER2 inhibition beyond progression may provide an additional clinical benefit, the availability of novel therapies targeting different mechanisms of action could improve outcomes. The developmental strategy with the most available data is targeting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. The oral mTOR inhibitor everolimus has shown promising activity in combination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab in trastuzumab-refractory, advanced breast cancer.

Conclusions

Non-HER2-targeted therapy is a promising means of overcoming resistance to HER2-targeted treatment. Ongoing clinical studies will provide additional information on the efficacy and safety of novel targeted therapies in HER2-resistant advanced breast cancer.

### HER story: the next chapter in HER-2-directed therapy for advanced breast cancer [^112pngXv]. The Oncologist (2013). Low credibility.

Untreated human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2)-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC) is an aggressive disease, associated with a poor prognosis and short overall survival. HER-2-directed therapy prolongs both time to disease progression and overall survival when combined with chemotherapy and has become the standard of care for those with HER-2-positive breast cancer in the early and advanced settings. Despite the remarkable therapeutic impact HER-2-directed therapy has had on disease outcomes, some patients with HER-2-positive disease will have primary resistant disease and others will respond initially but will eventually have progression, underscoring the need for other novel therapeutic options. This article reviews recent phase III trial data and discusses a practical approach to sequencing of HER-2-directed therapy in patients with HER-2-positive ABC. The significant cumulative survival gains seen in these trials are slowly reshaping the landscape of HER-2-positive ABC outcomes.

Systemic treatment — ER- and/or PR-positive; HER2-positive recurrent unresectable or stage IV (M1) disease: For Progression on first-line endocrine therapy ± HER2-targeted therapy, consider alternate endocrine therapy, if not endocrine refractory ± HER2-targeted therapy; if there is No clinical benefit after up to 3 sequential endocrine therapy regimens ± HER2-targeted therapy or Symptomatic visceral disease, use Systemic therapy ± HER2-targeted therapy until progression. For Progression on systemic therapy + HER2-targeted therapy, Alternate systemic therapy + HER2-targeted therapy and Continue HER2-targeted therapy until progression. Most patients will be candidates for multiple lines of systemic therapy to palliate advanced breast cancer, and at each reassessment clinicians should assess value of ongoing treatment, the risks and benefits of an additional line of systemic therapy, patient performance status, and patient preferences through a shared decision-making process. Consider no further HER2-targeted therapy and continue supportive care; see NCCN Guidelines for Palliative Care and NCCN Guidelines for Supportive Care. The potential side effects of additional lines of therapy may outweigh any clinical benefit in a patient who has a compromised performance status, and patient preferences must be taken into account. The optimal duration of trastuzumab in patients with long-term control of disease is unknown. False-negative ER and/or PR determinations occur, and there may be discordance between the ER and/or PR determination between the primary and metastatic tumor(s); endocrine therapy with its low attendant toxicity may be considered in patients with non-visceral or asymptomatic visceral tumors. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Systemic therapy for advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^111heyCL]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Cost implications for HER2-positive breast cancer systemic therapy — shared decision making, affordability, and cost-effectiveness considerations are highlighted: Discussion of cost can be an important part of shared decision making, and clinicians should discuss with patients the use of less expensive alternatives when it is practical and feasible for treatment of the patient's disease and there are two or more treatment options that are comparable in terms of benefits and harms. Tables 3 and 4 show estimated costs for the available treatment options, noting that medication prices may vary markedly depending on negotiated discounts and rebates. Patient out-of-pocket costs may vary depending on insurance coverage, and coverage may originate in the medical or pharmacy benefit with different cost-sharing arrangements; patients should be aware that different products may be preferred or covered by their particular insurance plan and that even with the same insurance plan the price may vary between pharmacies, and when discussing financial issues and concerns patients should be made aware of any financial counseling services available to address this complex landscape. As part of guideline development, ASCO may search the literature for published cost effectiveness analyses to inform relative value, but excludes analyses that lack contemporary cost data, agents not available in the United States or Canada, and/or agents that are industry-sponsored; higher patient out-of-pocket costs have been shown to be a barrier to initiating and adhering to recommended cancer treatments.

### Treatment with trastuzumab for 1 year after adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer: a 4-year follow-up of a randomised controlled trial [^116XmKH1]. The Lancet: Oncology (2011). Medium credibility.

Background

Treatment with adjuvant trastuzumab for 1 year improves disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive early breast cancer. We aimed to assess disease-free survival and overall survival after a median follow-up of 4 years for patients enrolled on the Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) trial.

Methods

The HERA trial is an international, multicentre, randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial comparing treatment with trastuzumab for 1 and 2 years with observation after standard neoadjuvant, adjuvant chemotherapy, or both in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. The primary endpoint was disease-free survival. After a positive first interim analysis at a median follow-up of 1 year for the comparison of treatment with trastuzumab for 1 year with observation, event-free patients in the observation group were allowed to cross over to receive trastuzumab. We report trial outcomes for the 1-year trastuzumab and observation groups at a median follow-up of 48.4 months (IQR 42.0–56.5) and assess the effect of the extensive crossover to trastuzumab. Our analysis was by intention-to-treat. The HERA trial is registered with the European Clinical Trials Database, number 2005–002385–11.

Findings

The HERA trial population comprised 1698 patients randomly assigned to the observation group and 1703 to the 1-year trastuzumab group. Intention-to-treat analysis of disease-free survival showed a significant benefit in favour of patients in the 1-year trastuzumab group (4-year disease-free survival 78.6%) compared with the observation group (4-year disease-free survival 72.2%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.76; 95% CI 0.66–0.87; p < 0.0001). Intention-to-treat analysis of overall survival showed no significant difference in the risk of death (4-year overall survival 89.3%vs 87.7%, respectively; HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.70–1.04; p = 0.11). Overall, 885 patients (52%) of the 1698 patients in the observation group crossed over to receive trastuzumab, and began treatment at median 22.8 months (range 4.5–52.7) from randomisation. In a non-randomised comparison, patients in the selective-crossover cohort had fewer disease-free survival events than patients remaining in the observation group (adjusted HR 0.68; 95% CI 0.51–0.90; p = 0.0077). Higher incidences of grade 3–4 and fatal adverse events were noted on 1-year trastuzumab than in the observation group. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, each in less than 1% of patients, were congestive cardiac failure, hypertension, arthralgia, back pain, central-line infection, hot flush, headache, and diarrhoea.

Interpretation

Treatment with adjuvant trastuzumab for 1 year after chemotherapy is associated with significant clinical benefit at 4-year median follow-up. The substantial selective crossover of patients in the observation group to trastuzumab was associated with improved outcomes for this cohort.

### Selection of optimal adjuvant chemotherapy and targeted therapy for early breast cancer: ASCO guideline update [^1118GtEe]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to management of early breast cancer, adjuvant systemic therapy, HER2+, ASCO 2021 guidelines recommend to offer trastuzumab plus chemotherapy in all patients with HER2+, node-positive breast cancer and in patients with HER2+, node-negative breast cancer (≥ 1 cm).

### Real-world treatment patterns and outcomes of patients with hormone receptor-positive / HER2-low metastatic breast cancer treated with chemotherapy [^1115Ra6B]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our real-world study brings into focus pivotal facets of the treatment landscape for individuals diagnosed with HR+/HER2-low mBC receiving CT. Though most patients received CT after completing at least 1 HT-based regimen, about one-fourth of patients managed in the community practice setting initiate CT as 1L therapy likely due to high disease burden and worse clinical pathological characteristics. The clinical outcomes associated with CT were suboptimal with median PFS of less than 10 months. Consequently, our study highlights a critical gap in available therapeutic alternatives to CT in early lines of therapy, underscoring the pressing need for innovative and more efficacious treatment options to meet the evolving needs of patients navigating HR+/HER2-low mBC. The advent of HER2-targeted treatment for this indication will likely help to address this gap, with T-DXd potentially representing an alternative for patients in need of more effective treatment in early lines of therapy.

### Translating neoadjuvant therapy into survival benefits: one size does not fit all [^114XATb7]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Neoadjuvant therapy has been established as an effective therapeutic approach for patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Similar outcomes between neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy have been demonstrated in several trials. Nevertheless, neoadjuvant therapy has some advantages over adjuvant therapy, including tumour downstaging, in vivo assessment of therapeutic efficacy, reduced treatment durations, and the need to enrol fewer patients for clinical trials to reach their preplanned objectives. The number of neoadjuvant trials in patients with breast cancer has increased substantially in the past 5 years, particularly in the context of HER2-positive disease. Substantial improvements in the pathological complete response rate to anti-HER2 therapy, a proposed surrogate end point for long-term clinical benefit, have been observed with neoadjuvant dual-agent HER2 blockade. Thus, it was hypothesized that this approach would provide additional survival benefits over standard-of-care therapy with the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab in the adjuvant setting. Emerging data, however, are calling this notion into question. We discuss potential reasons why results of neoadjuvant trials of targeted therapies have not been mirrored in the adjuvant setting, and other than inherent differences in clinical-trial designs and statistical power, we consider how the biology of the disease, patient characteristics, and drug administration and schedule might influence the results.

### Use of novel combination therapies in the treatment of advanced HR + / HER2-Breast cancer [^112rSy6K]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2018). Low credibility.

Endocrine therapy remains the backbone for treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in the metastatic setting. Despite the effectiveness of endocrine therapy, primary and acquired endocrine resistance continue to be important clinical challenges. The landscape of metastatic breast cancer treatment has changed considerably with the incorporation of novel agents, including cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. This article reviews current endocrine treatment strategies and recent and ongoing studies of combination therapies in metastatic hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer.

### Systemic therapy for HER2-Positive metastatic breast cancer: moving into a new era… [^114hUvJ6]. ASCO (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, first-line treatment should be pertuzumab–trastuzumab–docetaxel/paclitaxel regardless of hormone receptor status. A taxane should be given for at least six cycles, if tolerated, followed by maintenance pertuzumab–trastuzumab until progression. Continued anti–HER2-based therapy is the current clinical standard for patients with HER2-positive tumors. If other anti-HER2 therapies have been exhausted, are not considered suitable, or are not available, trastuzumab beyond progression should be considered. Although patients with HER2-positive MBC have traditionally been considered incurable, the new HER2-targeted biologic treatments developed in the past two decades are currently challenging this dogma.

First-line Therapy When HER2-positive MBC is diagnosed, HER2 blockade should be usually offered based on the great benefit obtained in different clinical trials conducted in the past two decades. In a pivotal study, Slamon and colleagues 1showed that adding trastuzumab to chemotherapy improved both progression-free survival and overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone. This study was a revolutionary change in the way of treating these patients. Since then, different approaches have tried to optimize trastuzumab-based therapy. The duration of chemotherapy is recommended for no fewer than six cycles of docetaxel. 2Paclitaxel is also an alternative for these patients, with evidence from the PERUSE clinical trial, a phase IIIb study of either docetaxel, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel administered in combination with trastuzumab and pertuzumab.

Second-Line Therapy Trastuzumab emtansine has been considered for the past 10 years to be the best treatment option for patients whose disease has progressed after trastuzumab- and taxane-based treatment, based on the results of the phase III EMILIA trial. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 3. 6 mg/kg of T-DM1 every 3 weeks or 1, 000 mg/m. Because of these results, T-DXd should now be considered the best second-line treatment option for patients with HER2-positive MBC treated previously with taxane plus trastuzumab. 9The Table lists outcomes of key first- and second-line trials and Fig. 1 lists first- and second-line treatments.

### Current and future management of HER2-Positive metastatic breast cancer | JCO oncology practice… [^115dufYY]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

For most patients, a taxane combined with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in the first-line setting, followed by trastuzumab-emtansine in second line, should be considered the standard of care today. However, chemo-free anti-HER2 strategies in hormone receptor-positive, HER2-positive breast cancer could also be considered in selected patients. First-line Treatment Options Pertuzumab, Trastuzumab, and Chemotherapy The combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab and a single-agent chemotherapeutic should be the standard first-line treatment for most patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer. Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody binding to the HER2 extracellular domain II, which prevents dimerization of HER2 with other HER receptors and together with trastuzumab allow a more comprehensive signaling blockade.

In our opinion, pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy should be considered in most patients relapsing > 12 months from the last dose of anti-HER2 therapy. Another important aspect is that CLEOPATRA did not allow maintenance endocrine therapy. Thus, the value of endocrine therapy in this setting is unknown. Second-line Treatment Options T-DM1 For most patients progressing to trastuzumab- or pertuzumab-based chemotherapy in the first line, T-DM1 monotherapy should be considered the standard second-line therapy. T-DM1 is an antibody drug conjugate that incorporates the HER2-targeted antitumor properties of trastuzumab with the cytotoxic activity of the microtubule-inhibitory agent DM1 and allows intracellular drug delivery specifically to HER2-overexpressing cells.

Patients must have progressed to trastuzumab and a taxane in the metastatic setting or had progressed < 6 months after completing treatment for early-stage disease. T-DM1 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in both PFS and OS end points. 56This study randomly assigned 237 patients with HER2-positive and HR-positive advanced breast cancer who had been previously treated with at least two prior HER2 targeted therapies to abemaciclib, trastuzumab and fulvestrant, abemaciclib with trastuzumab or chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. The triple combination was superior to chemotherapy and trastuzumab.

In the neoadjuvant setting, dual HER2 blockade with trastuzumab and pertuzumab plus chemotherapy has increased the rate of pathologic complete response, a surrogate marker of improved long-term outcome; yet, in the adjuvant setting, it has led to small benefits in invasive disease-free survival. Extended adjuvant therapy with the irreversible pan-HER2 inhibitor neratinib is an option for selected patients with HER2-positive and estrogen receptor–positive disease who have received neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. 4, 6, 7More recently, the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab emtansine has become the new standard of care among patients with HER2-positive breast cancer and residual disease following neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. 5Extended adjuvant therapy with neratinib, a potent, irreversible, pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, after the completion of chemotherapy and adjuvant trastuzumab has also been evaluated.
8.

Escalation Strategies Patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer and higher risk of recurrence are generally defined as having tumors ≥ 2 cm and/or node-positive disease. Those patients should be treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus anti-HER2 therapy. Additionally, the presence of residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant treatment, ie, patients who do not achieve a pathologic complete response, leads to increased risk of relapse. 11Therefore, several escalation strategies consisting of adding anti-HER2–targeted agents have been evaluated: dual HER2 blockade to increase rates of pCR, a surrogate marker of improved long-term outcomes, 12or as adjuvant treatment; extended anti-HER2 adjuvant therapy; and adjuvant therapy in patients with residual disease after neoadjuvant therapy.

36Patients were randomly assigned to receive either three cycles of 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide followed by six cycles of paclitaxel plus carboplatin or nine cycles of paclitaxel plus carboplatin. HER2-targeted therapy with trastuzumab-pertuzumab was administered concomitantly with chemotherapy, with patients completing 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab together with radiotherapy and adjuvant endocrine therapy as indicated.

### Tailoring therapy to be just right in HER2-Positive early-stage breast cancer: the goldilocks problem | JCO oncology practice… [^117QV3B4]. ASCO (2021). Medium credibility.

As illustrated in Figure 1 of the review, patients with suspected stage I disease are offered up-front surgery, followed by trastuzumab plus paclitaxel in the adjuvant setting if surgery confirms the clinical staging. Patients with clinical stage II or III breast cancers are offered neoadjuvant polychemotherapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Adjuvant T-DM1 is recommended if residual disease is discovered at the time of surgery, and trastuzumab with or without pertuzumab is offered if pathologic complete response is achieved. Of note, this approach is used irrespective of hormone receptor status, with the exception that additional adjuvant treatment with neratinib can be considered in patients with hormone receptor–positive node-positive disease, albeit with a lack of data to support the benefit of neratinib in patients who were previously treated with pertuzumab and/or T-DM1.

Importantly, the toxicity profile of each approach must be weighed carefully against its incremental benefit. Although this algorithm currently represents the gold standard approach, it is likely that we undertreat or overtreat a substantial number of patients when following these guidelines. As illustrated in Table 2 of the Review, 10%-40% of patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer exhibit a pCR after neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy-free regimens, indicating marked sensitivity to HER2-targeted therapies. On the other hand, disease relapse remains an issue in many patients despite receiving the most aggressive existing neoadjuvant and adjuvant regimens. On the other hand, the CompassHER2-pCR trial is investigating the neoadjuvant regimen of paclitaxel with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in patients with clinical stage II-IIIa disease, in efforts to define the long-term outcomes of this de-escalated chemotherapy regimen. The results of these trials are eagerly awaited. 5Building on this, the ELPIS trial plans to enroll patients with stage I breast cancers that are HER2-enriched according to the PAM50 score, piloting the complete omission of surgery in patients without evidence of residual disease after neoadjuvant paclitaxel, trastuzumab, and pertuzumab.
