## Question

treatment acute decompensated heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to treat acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in a step-by-step manner. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial triage and phenotyping approach that guides early therapy. Then, I should verify diagnostic elements that confirm ADHF and identify precipitants. Next, I will align acute stabilization to hemodynamic profiles and double-check thresholds for vasodilators, diuretics, and inotropes. After that, I should review monitoring, decongestion targets, and biomarker use. Then, I will examine inpatient optimization of guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) by EF phenotype, confirm safety prerequisites, and integrate trial data. Finally, I need to cover risk stratification, discharge planning, special populations, and post-discharge surveillance, ensuring each step is supported by up-to-date guideline and trial evidence.

> Let me first confirm the early assessment priorities, because the initial 15–30 minutes set the therapeutic trajectory and misclassification can harm patients. ADHF presentations are heterogeneous; patients rarely say "heart failure", so I need to triage by symptoms and signs, screen for precipitants, and phenotype by perfusion and blood pressure profile to guide immediate therapy, while initiating ECG, chest X-ray, point-of-care ultrasound, and labs including natriuretic peptides to support the diagnosis and risk stratification [^114q5Arz] [^113wxM4D]. Hold on, I should verify that phenotyping by systolic blood pressure (hypertensive, normotensive, hypotensive) is indeed emphasized for tailoring therapy; yes, both ED-focused reviews and ESC/AHA guidance support this pragmatic approach to rapidly select vasodilators, diuretics, or inotropes as appropriate [^111xDjpu].

> Now, for hypertensive AHF, I need to check the blood pressure threshold for IV vasodilators so I don't overgeneralize. Wait, I initially thought SBP > 140 mmHg was the trigger, but the ESC suggests IV vasodilators when SBP is > 110 mmHg, while ACC/AHA emphasize use in the absence of hypotension; reconciling this, I should consider nitroglycerin early in severe hypertension and pulmonary edema, titrating rapidly to relieve dyspnea while monitoring for hypotension, and reserve nitroprusside for severe afterload excess in monitored settings, always as an adjunct to decongestion rather than a replacement [^111xDjpu]. Let me also double-check a common pitfall: relying on high-dose loop diuretics alone in hypertensive flash pulmonary edema can be counterproductive early on; the pathophysiology is often vascular congestion, so front-loading afterload reduction makes physiologic sense here [^112Doch9] [^114q5Arz].

> For normotensive ADHF with clear volume overload, I should confirm the emphasis on prompt IV loop diuretics and structured escalation if response is inadequate. The ACC/AHA/HFSA guideline recommends early IV loop diuretics to relieve congestion and reduce morbidity; if diuresis is inadequate in a few hours, I should increase the dose, consider continuous infusion, and, if needed, add a thiazide-type agent like metolazone cautiously for synergy to avoid electrolyte derangements, documenting response with strict I/O and daily weights [^113SBt7a] [^112hogBK] [^1151Ln3a]. Wait, let me verify that the discharge diuretic plan should be anticipated early; yes, guidelines explicitly call for a post-discharge diuretic adjustment plan to reduce rehospitalizations, so starting that framework during admission is prudent [^114GmdQw].

> In hypotensive ADHF with hypoperfusion or cardiogenic shock, I need to ensure I prioritize perfusion and organ support while avoiding routine inotrope use when not indicated. I should use inotropes such as dobutamine or milrinone only for shock with evidence of hypoperfusion, select norepinephrine as the preferred vasopressor if hypotension persists, and avoid long-term inotropes outside palliative or bridge indications due to harm signals, while considering early mechanical circulatory support in refractory cases and correcting precipitants in parallel [^113eFAzu] [^1135ZdXt] [^117PGTsj] [^113KXF8g] [^117KByBa]. Hold on, I should verify that routine inotrope use is discouraged; the ESC explicitly warns against routine inotropes without hypoperfusion, consistent with ACC/AHA guidance on potential harm with non-bridge use [^1135ZdXt] [^117KByBa].

> Next, I should review monitoring and decongestion targets systematically, because inadequate surveillance leads to AKI and readmissions. Daily weights, strict I/O with a reasonable net-negative target, and serial exams of JVP, edema, and pulmonary findings remain foundational, while daily electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine are advised when using IV diuretics or actively titrating therapy, with particular attention to rising BUN and creatinine as early AKI or hypoperfusion markers that portend worse outcomes [^111aocJJ]. Let me double-check the prognostic burden of renal metrics; both historical ADHERE and post-hoc ACTIV data link elevated BUN, especially above 40–43 mg/dL, to higher in-hospital and early post-discharge risk, independent of creatinine, reinforcing careful renal-perfusion balancing during decongestion [^115vvR3w] [^115CRR9Q].

> I will now examine biomarker use to guide risk and therapy suitability, but I need to ensure not to overinterpret single values. Measuring BNP/NT-proBNP supports diagnosis in the ED and helps risk-stratify; at discharge, higher BNP portends increased short-term readmission and mortality risk, and trends during hospitalization can contextualize response, while troponin and other biomarkers may refine risk in selected patients, though discharge natriuretic peptide levels carry the most consistent short-horizon signal in small cohorts [^114q5Arz] [^114JFGVF] [^115VqaD5]. Let me verify ARNI evidence in hospitalized HFrEF, because that influences when to consider initiation; PIONEER-HF showed that starting sacubitril/valsartan after hemodynamic stabilization reduced NT-proBNP and HF rehospitalization versus enalapril without excess safety events, supporting in-hospital initiation when blood pressure and renal function allow [^112cif67].

> Turning to inpatient GDMT optimization, I should confirm which therapies can be initiated safely during or just after decongestion in HFrEF. After stabilization, I should start or continue the four foundational classes as tolerated: ARNI preferred over ACEI/ARB, evidence-based beta-blocker, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and SGLT2 inhibitor, recognizing that beta-blockers should be initiated once euvolemic and hemodynamically stable and should be continued unless shock is present, and that in-hospital initiation strongly predicts long-term use and dose achievement [^114AP1WF] [^113u92iX] [^116Q17e7] [^1147u2vm]. Wait, I should confirm that SGLT2 inhibitors are indeed supported in contemporary guidance for HFrEF and can be initiated during hospitalization; yes, the 2022 guidelines include SGLT2 inhibitors among the core pillars, and early initiation is reasonable once renal function and hemodynamics are acceptable, integrating with the other classes to reduce mortality and HF hospitalization [^116Q17e7] [^113u92iX].

> For HFmrEF and HFpEF, I need to ensure I neither overstate nor understate evidence. In HFmrEF, the ACC/AHA/HFSA guideline supports considering HFrEF therapies, especially near the lower EF boundary, to reduce HF hospitalization and possibly mortality, whereas in HFpEF, priority is optimal diuresis, strict blood pressure control, rhythm and comorbidity management, and now SGLT2 inhibitors per contemporary updates, acknowledging that evidence strength differs by phenotype and comorbidity load [^115RZVLw] [^116Q17e7]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should not imply equal benefit across all EF spectra; the registry landscape underscores that phenotype proportions and comorbidities vary, and therapeutic yield is greatest in HFrEF, with growing but still more modest evidence in HFpEF, reinforcing careful patient selection and target-setting [^114eTxwE].

> Before discharge, I should double-check that risk stratification has informed intensity of follow-up and resource allocation. The ADHERE risk tree using BUN, SBP, and creatinine helps estimate in-hospital mortality risk, while older age, low SBP, hyponatremia, and renal dysfunction consistently predict poorer post-discharge outcomes across EF categories, and simple bedside or EHR-derived AKI risk tools can identify patients who need tighter lab surveillance due to a roughly one-in-three AKI risk in some cohorts [^115vvR3w] [^111oFb7N] [^115hy4Tv]. Hold on, I should verify the long-term risk of worsening renal function post-discharge; WRF within a year is a strong independent predictor of mortality, which justifies proactive outpatient renal monitoring and decongestion adjustments [^114DEh9c].

> Discharge planning needs to be explicit and actionable, so I will ensure the diuretic and GDMT plans are written, teach-back confirmed, and follow-up arranged within a week. A documented diuretic plan with dose adjustments tied to weight changes and symptoms, a target weight, salt guidance, and early clinic follow-up are core elements, while discharging patients on foundational GDMT and setting a clear titration roadmap improve long-term uptake and dose attainment, mitigating the high early readmission risk associated with persistent congestion and care transitions [^114GmdQw] [^113ggybE] [^1147u2vm] [^114xKoFp]. I should double-check that early post-discharge visits are emphasized; although specific timing may vary, guidance and outcomes literature support visits within 7 days for most patients, especially those high risk by biomarkers, renal indices, or clinical profile [^114GmdQw] [^114xKoFp].

> I will now examine special populations where tailored therapy changes outcomes. In self-identified African American patients with persistent NYHA III–IV HFrEF symptoms despite optimized GDMT, hydralazine–isosorbide dinitrate improves symptoms and survival and should be added, with attention to adherence and hypotension risk, while weekend discharges deserve caution given observational signals of higher in-hospital mortality for weekend terminations of care and potential structural constraints on safe transitions, warranting enhanced staffing or deferral when feasible [^116FpHKj] [^1133Lcfk]. For older adults, particularly those ≥ 75–85 years, I should verify that geriatric syndromes, low SBP, and renal impairment amplify risk; indeed, two-year mortality is high, and functional assessment, careful dosing, and close follow-up are essential while still pursuing GDMT benefits where tolerated [^115KWMYD] [^111oFb7N].

> Post-discharge surveillance in the first year requires a structured schedule and objective targets, so I need to ensure labs and clinical assessments align with risk. Early contact within days, frequent visits during the first month for diuretic and GDMT titration, and then spacing as stability permits are reasonable, with renal function at each visit, natriuretic peptide checks if symptoms recur or trajectory is unclear, and deliberate uptitration toward target doses to reduce mortality and HF readmissions, given the strong prognostic impact of WRF and persistent congestion [^114DEh9c] [^115RjDwu]. But wait, what if EF phenotype changes or de novo HF is diagnosed during admission; registry data remind me that EF categories and clinical profiles evolve, so reassessment of EF and phenotype-informed therapy over time is prudent to maintain alignment with the best-available evidence [^114eTxwE].

> Finally, I should confirm that the overall approach remains consistent with both ACC/AHA/HFSA and ESC guidance despite some framing differences. The four pillars for HFrEF, vasodilator-first strategy in hypertensive AHF, prompt loop diuretics with structured escalation in congestive normotensive AHF, restricted inotrope use with norepinephrine preference in shock, and explicit discharge and follow-up planning are harmonized themes, and where thresholds differ, I have reconciled them to prioritize safety and physiologic logic in real-world care [^111624Dr] [^113wxM4D].

The treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) centers on **rapid stabilization** and **early IV loop diuretics** [^113SBt7a] to relieve congestion and improve symptoms [^113ReMqF]. For hypertensive ADHF, add **IV vasodilators** [^114SCbGq] if SBP > 110 mmHg [^111xDjpu] to reduce preload and afterload. In hypotension or shock [^117PGTsj], use inotropes/vasopressors [^113eFAzu] and consider mechanical support [^113KXF8g]. Identify and treat precipitants [^112w5FN9], monitor renal function/electrolytes [^111aocJJ], and initiate or optimize guideline-directed medical therapy before discharge [^112cif67] to reduce readmissions and mortality [^114GmdQw] [^113ggybE].

---

## Initial assessment and stabilization

- **Rapid assessment**: Evaluate airway, breathing, circulation, and mental status; initiate oxygen or noninvasive ventilation for hypoxemia or respiratory distress.

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Monitor blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and urine output.

- **Laboratory tests**: Obtain BNP/NT-proBNP, troponin, renal function, electrolytes, and lactate.

- **Imaging**: Perform chest X-ray and echocardiography to assess cardiac function and identify precipitating factors.

---

## Pharmacological management

### Diuretics

- **IV loop diuretics**: Administer promptly [^113SBt7a] to relieve congestion and improve symptoms [^113ReMqF].

- **Dose adjustment**: Titrate to achieve adequate diuresis; consider higher doses [^112hogBK] or add a second diuretic if response is inadequate [^1151Ln3a].

- **Monitoring**: Monitor renal function and electrolytes daily during active diuresis [^111aocJJ].

---

### Vasodilators

Consider **IV vasodilators** such as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside [^114SCbGq] in hypertensive ADHF (SBP > 110 mmHg) [^111xDjpu] to reduce preload and afterload. They are **contraindicated** in hypotension or cardiogenic shock [^111xDjpu].

---

### Inotropes and vasopressors

- **Indications**: Use in patients with hypotension (SBP < 90 mmHg) or cardiogenic shock [^117PGTsj] to maintain perfusion [^113eFAzu].

- **Agents**: Dobutamine, milrinone, or levosimendan may be considered based on clinical scenario [^1135ZdXt].

- **Risks**: Long-term use is associated with increased mortality [^117KByBa]; reserve for bridge therapy [^114ddutk] or palliative care in advanced HF [^113V9CYw].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Consider **mechanical circulatory support** (intra-aortic balloon pump, Impella, or ECMO) for refractory cardiogenic shock [^113KXF8g] and **ultrafiltration** for severe fluid overload refractory to diuretics.

---

## Identification and management of precipitating factors

Common precipitants include **acute coronary syndromes, arrhythmias, infections, uncontrolled hypertension, medication nonadherence, and renal dysfunction** [^112w5FN9]; **management** entails promptly addressing underlying causes to prevent recurrence and improve outcomes [^113ggybE].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment of therapy

Monitoring entails **continuous assessment** of vital signs, urine output, and overall clinical status [^113ggybE], complemented by regular laboratory evaluation of renal function, electrolytes [^111aocJJ], and relevant biomarkers. Adjust therapy by **titrating diuretics** [^112hogBK] and other medications based on clinical response and laboratory results [^113ggybE].

---

## Discharge planning and follow-up care

Before discharge, confirm **clinical stability**, including resolution of congestion, stable renal function, and optimization of medical therapy [^114GmdQw]. Provide **patient education** on medication adherence, dietary restrictions, and symptom monitoring. Arrange **early outpatient follow-up** and consider home health services to reduce readmissions [^114xKoFp].

---

## Prognostic factors influencing outcomes

Positive prognostic factors include **early initiation of guideline-directed medical therapy, effective management of precipitating factors, and close follow-up care**; **negative prognostic factors** include **advanced age, renal dysfunction [^114DEh9c], hypotension, hyponatremia, and recurrent hospitalizations**.

---

The management of acute decompensated heart failure requires a comprehensive approach, including rapid stabilization, pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, identification and management of precipitating factors, and careful monitoring and adjustment of therapy. Effective **discharge planning and follow-up care** are essential to reduce readmissions and improve patient outcomes.

### Acute kidney injury and its associated factors among patients with acute decompensated heart failure admitted to the University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia: a hospital-based cross-sectional study [^114VDzC8]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Low credibility.

Prior studies have identified various risk factors that could influence the occurrence of AKI in hospitalized ADHF patients. Comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are among the most common risk factors for the development of AKI in patients with ADHF. Additionally, increased baseline serum creatinine (SCr), a history of AKI, older age, hemodynamic abnormalities at admission, and sepsis are strong predictors of AKI.

Echocardiographic and electrocardiographic features, such as the presence of diastolic dysfunction and atrial fibrillation (AF), have also been reported to predict the occurrence of AKI. Acute kidney injury in patients with ADHF is linked to poorer short- and long-term outcomes, including higher mortality, hospitalization, and readmission rates and worsening of heart failure progression. A meta-analysis has shown that the presence of AKI in hospitalized ADHF patients is associated with a 5.14-fold increase in mortality.

Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa, with a population of more than 120 million people. The literature, mostly from developed nations, has indicated that AKI complicates a significant proportion of patients admitted for ADHF, with varying prevalence results. However, data on the magnitude of AKI in low-resource settings such as Ethiopia are lacking. The profile of AKI may differ from that of more developed countries. Studies on renal dysfunction in Western countries have involved mainly elderly patients with ischemic heart disease. However, the prevalence and predictors of AKI in younger, mainly…

### Magnitude of and prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality after hospital discharge for acute decompensated heart failure based on ejection fraction findings [^112E9f3A]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a worldwide epidemic that affects nearly 1 million US adults and results in considerable morbidity, functional disability, and mortality. To better understand and characterize the epidemiology of this increasingly prevalent clinical syndrome, a classification schema for heart failure (HF) has been recently created based on ejection fraction (EF) findings. The 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) guidelines characterized EF strata as preserved EF (pEF; ≥ 50%), reduced EF (rEF; ≤ 40%), and borderline preserved EF (BpEF; 41–49%). This new classification schema was recommended because several research groups had used different EF cutoffs for differentiating patients with pEF from those with rEF findings, producing varying study results and difficulties in interpretation and extrapolation.

Prior epidemiological studies have identified a number of important prognostic factors associated with poor long-term outcomes for patients with ADHF, including advanced age, male sex, hyponatremia, lower systolic blood pressure, poorer kidney function, and several comorbid conditions. Many of these earlier studies examined the role of various prognostic factors in patients with HF that had not further been stratified according to EF findings. Among those that did, none used the 2013 AHA/ACC guidelines recommending specific EF cut points. Furthermore, few data exist on the prognosis or the factors associated with poor long-term prognosis.

### Use of biomarkers to predict readmission for congestive heart failure [^114JFGVF]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a major reason for repeated hospitalizations. Identifying patients with ADHF who are at risk for readmission is critical so that preventive interventions can be implemented. Biomarkers such as B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), high-sensitivity troponin I, and galectin-3 (Gal-3) assessed at discharge may be useful; however, their role in predicting short-term readmission is not well defined in the literature.

We enrolled and gathered follow-up data for 101 participants admitted to our facility from April 2013 to March 2015 with a primary diagnosis of ADHF. Gal-3, high-sensitivity troponin I, and BNP were obtained within 48 hours before hospital discharge after management of ADHF. Gal-3 was assessed using two commercially available assays. We compared subjects who were readmitted with those who were not.

- **Discharge BNP as a predictor**: Discharge BNP was found to be a significant predictor of 30- and 60-day readmission (area under the curve [AUC] 0.69 [p = 0.046], AUC 0.7 [p = 0.005], respectively). The addition of Gal-3 to discharge BNP provided significantly improved prediction of 60-day readmission.

- **Gal-3 as a predictor**: Gal-3 alone was found to be a significant predictor of 60-day readmission in patients with preserved ejection fraction (AUC 0.85, p < 0.001). The net reclassification improvement was 55.2 (p = 0.037).

Using multivariate analysis, for every 100 pg/L BNP increase, the probability of readmission increased by approximately 10%, and for every 1-ng/ml Gal-3 increase, the probability further increased by 8%. A statistically significant net reclassification improvement was not found on examination.

### Development and validation of a risk score for prediction of acute kidney injury in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: a prospective cohort study in China [^115hy4Tv]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Although several risk factors for acute kidney injury (AKI) have been identified, early detection of AKI in acute decompensated heart failure patients remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a risk score for early prediction of AKI in these patients.

- **Methods and results**: A total of 676 consecutive acute decompensated heart failure participants were prospectively enrolled from six regional central hospitals. Data from 507 participants were analyzed. Participants from four of the six hospitals (n = 321) were used to develop a risk score and conduct internal validation. External validation was conducted on participants from the other two hospitals (n = 186). Sequential logistic regression was used to develop and validate the risk score. The C statistic and calibration plot assessed the discrimination and calibration of the proposed risk score. The overall occurrence of AKI was 33.1% (168/507). The risk score, ranging from 0 to 55, demonstrated good discriminative power with an optimism-corrected C statistic of 0.859. Similar results were obtained from external validation with a C statistic of 0.847 (95% CI 0.819–0.927). The risk score showed good calibration with no apparent over- or under-prediction observed from calibration plots.

- **Conclusions**: The novel risk score is a simple and accurate tool that can help clinicians assess the risk of AKI in acute decompensated heart failure patients, assisting them in planning and initiating the most appropriate disease management.

### Heart failure in Europe: Guideline-directed medical therapy use and decision making in chronic and acute, pre-existing and de novo, heart failure with reduced, mildly reduced, and preserved ejection fraction - the ESC EORP Heart Failure III Registry [^114eTxwE]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2024). High credibility.

Clinical characteristics vary significantly between patients with acute heart failure (AHF) and those attending outpatient visits. Patients with AHF compared to those at outpatient visits were more commonly treated by general cardiologists and presented more frequently with de novo heart failure. This suggests that outpatient heart failure visits predominantly involve patients with established heart failure and that many diagnoses are not made until hospitalization. The clinical characteristics and hemodynamic profiles indicate that congestion was common and significant in AHF cases, yet not universal, which underscores the variability and complexity of presentation, signs, and symptoms in AHF patients.

In most registries and cohorts, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) comprises approximately half of the patient population, with heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) forming the other half. Notably, there is an increasing prevalence of HFpEF. The recent modification in the HFmrEF definition from a range of 40–49% to 41–49% has notably minimized the HFmrEF cohort size. This shift results from digit bias, given that ejection fraction (EF) is frequently reported in 5% increments. In the ESC Heart Failure Long‐Term Registry, 21% of patients were classified with HFmrEF defined as 40–49%, and 7% had an EF 'exactly' at 40%, leading to their reclassification as HFrEF under the new 41–49% definition, thus reducing HFmrEF to only 14%. In the current HF III, the distribution was recorded as 57% for HFrEF, 17% for HFmrEF, and 26% for HFpEF, maintaining a significant HFmrEF segment. The changes in EF categories over time before enrollment in HF III are anticipated in forthcoming follow‐up analyses.

The diverse EF categories have been thoroughly characterized in preceding studies and were largely corroborated in the present analysis.

### 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure [^113u92iX]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2022). High credibility.

The "2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure" replaces the "2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure" and the "2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA Focused Update of the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure". This updated guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose, and manage patients with heart failure.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 2020 to December 2020, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant clinical trials and research studies, published through September 2021, were also considered. This guideline was harmonized with other American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines published through December 2021.

Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The 2022 heart failure guideline provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence for the treatment of these patients. These recommendations present an evidence-based approach to managing patients with heart failure, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Many recommendations from the earlier heart failure guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data.

### Pathophysiology and therapeutic approaches to acute decompensated heart failure [^114xKoFp]. Circulation Research (2021). Low credibility.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) continues to be an entity with incompletely understood pathophysiology and limited therapeutic options. Although agents for the management of chronic heart failure (HF) continue to expand and the arsenal of guideline-directed medical therapies is robust, the same cannot be said for the management of ADHF. This is clinically relevant as acute HF (AHF) events and repeat hospitalizations are associated with a worse prognosis and progressive multiorgan failure. There are over 1 million hospitalizations per year for HF in the United States and Europe, with an astounding 24% readmission rate within 30 days and 50% within 6 months.

- **Prognosis and statistics**: Patients with readmission for cardiovascular disease within 90 days of discharge for HF hospitalization have a higher risk of mortality independent of the exact amount of time from discharge. One in 6 patients admitted for HF die within 30 days of hospitalization. These grim statistics for ADHF, in contrast to the promising future of chronic HF management, prompt the need for a better understanding of the distinct entity of ADHF.

- **Medical management**: Suboptimal medical management of ADHF often results in persistent congestion upon hospital discharge and subsequent increased risk of rehospitalization, morbidity, and mortality.

In light of the stagnating clinical outcomes with ADHF, the American College of Cardiology released an expert consensus decision pathway in 2019 to assist in risk assessment, management, and evaluation of clinical trajectory for patients with ADHF. The highlight of this document lay in the importance of effective discharge planning, transitional care strategies, and close follow-up to reduce early rehospitalization rates.

Regarding the medical management of heart failure, particularly in managing pre-heart failure (pre-HF), the ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend the placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD). This approach aims to reduce total mortality in patients who are at least 40 days post-myocardial infarction, have a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 30%, and present with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I symptoms while on guideline-directed medical therapy. Furthermore, there must be a reasonable expectation of meaningful survival for more than one year.

### In-hospital and postdischarge mortality among patients with acute decompensated heart failure hospitalizations ending on the weekend versus weekday: The ARIC study community surveillance [^1133Lcfk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Hospital staffing is usually reduced on weekends, potentially impacting inpatient care and postdischarge coordination of care for patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). However, investigations of in-hospital mortality on the weekend versus weekday, and post-hospital outcomes of weekend versus weekday discharge are scarce.

- **Methods and results**: Hospitalizations for ADHF were sampled by stratified design from four US areas by the Community Surveillance component of the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study. ADHF was classified by a standardized computer algorithm and physician review of the medical records. Discharges or deaths on Saturday, Sunday, or national holidays were considered to occur on the "weekend".

In-hospital mortality was compared between hospitalizations ending on a weekend versus weekday. Post-hospital (28-day) mortality was compared among patients discharged alive on a weekend versus weekday. From 2005 to 2014, 39,699 weighted ADHF hospitalizations were identified (19% terminating on a weekend). Demographics, comorbidities, length of stay, and guideline-directed therapies were similar for patients with hospitalizations ending on a weekend versus weekday.

In-hospital death doubled on the weekend compared with weekday (12% versus 6%) and was not attenuated by adjustment for potential confounders (odds ratio, 2.37; 95% CI, 1.93–2.91). There was no association between weekend discharge and 28-day mortality among patients discharged alive.

- **Conclusions**: The risk of in-hospital death among patients admitted with ADHF appears to be dependent on the timing of hospital discharge.

### Executive summary: HFSA 2006 comprehensive heart failure practice guideline [^1176cf1V]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2006). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a syndrome characterized by high mortality, frequent hospitalization, reduced quality of life, and a complex therapeutic regimen. Knowledge about HF is accumulating so rapidly that individual clinicians may be unable to readily and adequately synthesize new information into effective strategies of care for patients with this syndrome. Trial data, though valuable, often do not give direction for individual patient management. These characteristics make HF an ideal candidate for practice guidelines. The 2006 Heart Failure Society of America comprehensive practice guideline addresses the full range of evaluation, care, and management of patients with HF.

### Magnitude of and prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality after hospital discharge for acute decompensated heart failure based on ejection fraction findings [^117BoomV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Age is an established predictor of mortality for patients with ADHF and other serious chronic diseases, and our regression analyses showed advanced age to be the most significant predictor of postdischarge mortality during the first year after discharge from the hospital. In our study population, 55% of patients with reduced ejection fraction (rEF), 65% of patients with borderline preserved ejection fraction (BpEF), and 66% of patients with preserved ejection fraction (pEF) were aged 75 years or older. Consequently, we further divided patients in the three EF strata into two age groups, under 75 and 75 years or older, to examine whether there were differences in various prognostic factors between younger and older patients hospitalized with ADHF.

- **Impact of age on prognostic factors**: The important prognostic factors significantly associated with an increased risk of dying during the first year after hospital discharge for ADHF for comparatively younger patients with rEF included a history of previously diagnosed stroke, systolic blood pressure findings under 150 mm Hg on admission, hyponatremia, and elevated BUN levels. Factors associated with an increased risk of dying during the first year after hospital discharge for those aged 75 years or older with rEF included a history of previously diagnosed COPD or peripheral vascular disease and those with elevated BUN levels.

### Angiotensin-neprilysin inhibition in acute decompensated heart failure [^112cif67]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). High credibility.

The study PIONEER-HF, published in 2019, addresses heart failure and was conducted by Eric J. Velazquez and colleagues in the New England Journal of Medicine. The primary question investigated was the role of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with HFrEF who were hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure (HF).

- **Study design**: Multi-center, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial (RCT).

- **Population**: The study included 881 patients, comprising 246 females and 635 males. The inclusion criteria required patients to have HFrEF and be hospitalized for acute decompensated HF. Key exclusion criteria were: receipt of sacubitril/valsartan within the past 30 days, serum potassium levels > 5.2 mEq/L at screening, hypersensitivity or contraindications to the study drugs, known hepatic impairment, and eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

- **Interventions**: Participants were divided into two groups: 440 patients received sacubitril/valsartan at a target dose of 97 mg of sacubitril with 103 mg of valsartan twice daily, and 441 patients received enalapril at a target dose of 10 mg twice daily.

- **Primary outcome**: There was a significant increase in the time-averaged reduction in the N-terminal pro-BNP concentration from baseline through weeks 4 and 8 (0.53 vs. 0.75; OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.59).

- **Secondary outcomes**: There was a significant increase in the reduction of high-sensitivity troponin T concentration (36.6 vs. 25.2; OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.29). There was no significant difference in death rates (2.3% vs. 3.4%; HR 0.66, 95% CI 0.3 to 1.48). However, there was a significant decrease in rehospitalization for HF (8% vs. 13.8%; HR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.84).

### Applicability of heart failure clinical practice guidelines in low- and middle-income countries [^113ytBPL]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Low credibility.

There was near universal consultation of either the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) or the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America (ACC/AHA/HFSA), or both, heart failure guidelines by 95% of all respondents. Clinicians in high‐income countries consulted them significantly more, albeit only by a small amount, than those in low‐ and middle‐income countries (95.7% vs. 94.4%; p = 0.0113).

In low‐ or middle‐income countries, 97.7% of clinicians in India, the only such country for which we had sufficient data to make analysis reasonable, consulted the ESC or ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines. Only 18% consulted the Indian statement as well, and merely 1.7% of these clinicians consulted only the Indian statement.

### Guideline-directed medical therapy after hospitalization for acute heart failure: Insights from the CONNECT-HF [^1147u2vm]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Use of beta blockers at discharge was associated with its use at 12 months (OR, 14.7 [95% CI, 12.0–18.1]), whereas atrial fibrillation or flutter and site excess readmission rate ≥ 1 were associated with nonuse at 12 months. Use at discharge was associated with achieving ≥ 50% of the target dose at 12 months (OR, 9.01 [95% CI, 7.62–10.6]), although older age, atrial fibrillation or flutter, and a history of chronic heart failure were associated with not achieving this target at 12 months. Atrial fibrillation or flutter was associated with a reduced rate of escalation and an increased rate of deescalation.

- **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/Angiotensin receptor blocker/Angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor**: Use of ACEi/ARB/ARNI at discharge (OR, 6.65 [95% CI, 5.60–7.90]) was associated with its use at 12 months, whereas older age and chronic kidney disease were associated with nonuse at 12 months. Use at discharge (OR, 4.02 [95% CI, 3.07–5.26]) and higher systolic blood pressure were associated with achieving ≥ 50% of the target dose at 12 months, whereas older age, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation or flutter, ischemic cause, and ≥ 2 heart failure admissions in the past 1 year were associated with not achieving this target at 12 months. Lower left ventricular ejection fraction was associated with an increased rate of escalation, whereas older age and chronic kidney disease were associated with a reduced rate of escalation.

- **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist**: Use of MRA at discharge (OR, 11.2 [95% CI, 9.14–

### Incidence and outcomes of acute heart failure with preserved versus reduced ejection fraction in SPRINT [^113L3qxK]. Circulation: Heart Failure (2021). Low credibility.

In the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), intensive blood pressure (BP) treatment reduced acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) events. Here, we report the effect on heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and their subsequent outcomes.

- **Methods**: Incident ADHF was defined as hospitalization or emergency department visit, confirmed and formally adjudicated by a blinded events committee using standardized protocols. HFpEF was defined as ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 45%, and HFrEF was EF < 45%.

- **Results**: Among the 133 participants with incident ADHF who had EF assessment, 69 (52%) had HFpEF and 64 (48%) had HFrEF (P value: 0.73). During an average 3.3 years follow-up in those who developed incident ADHF, rates of subsequent all-cause and HF hospital readmission and mortality were high, but there were no significant differences between those who developed HFpEF versus HFrEF. Randomization to the intensive arm had no effect on subsequent mortality or readmissions after the initial ADHF event, irrespective of EF subtype. During follow-up among participants who developed HFpEF, although a relatively modest number of events limited statistical power, age was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality, and Black race independently predicted all-cause and HF hospital readmission.

- **Conclusions**: In SPRINT, intensive BP reduction decreased both acute decompensated HFpEF and HFrEF events. After initial incident ADHF, rates of subsequent hospital admission and mortality were high and were similar for those who developed HFpEF or HFrEF. Randomization to the intensive arm had no significant effect on subsequent outcomes.

### Lower in-hospital mortality with beta-blocker use at admission in patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^116RG8vA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

It remains unclear whether beta-blocker use at hospital admission is associated with better in-hospital outcomes in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.

- **Methods and results**: We evaluated the factors independently associated with beta-blocker use at admission and the effect of beta-blocker use at admission on in-hospital mortality in 3,817 patients with acute decompensated heart failure enrolled in the Kyoto Congestive Heart Failure Registry. There were 1,512 patients (39.7%) receiving beta-blockers and 2,305 patients (60.3%) not receiving beta-blockers at admission for the index acute decompensated heart failure hospitalization. Factors independently associated with beta-blocker use at admission were previous heart failure hospitalization, history of myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, and estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m². Factors independently associated with no beta-blocker use were asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lower body mass index, dementia, older age, and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%.

Patients on beta-blockers had significantly lower in-hospital mortality rates (4.4% versus 7.6%; P < 0.001). Even after adjusting for confounders, beta-blocker use at admission remained significantly associated with lower in-hospital mortality risk (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.27–0.60; P < 0.001). Furthermore, beta-blocker use at admission was significantly associated with both lower cardiovascular mortality risk and lower non-cardiovascular mortality risk.

### Magnitude of and prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality after hospital discharge for acute decompensated heart failure based on ejection fraction findings [^115riF8c]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

We examined the differences in the characteristics of patients who died compared with those who survived the first year after hospital discharge in the three EF strata. Patients who died were significantly older (79 versus 74 years), were more likely to be white (96% versus 92%), had a longer stay in the hospital (7.9 versus 6.0 days), and were more likely to have been diagnosed previously with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; 37.1% versus 29.5%), atrial fibrillation (43.1% versus 32.3%), and heart failure (HF; 68.0% versus 57.2%). In addition, patients who died within the first year after hospital discharge had significantly lower average blood pressures (diastolic 71.9 versus 78.4 mm Hg; systolic 138.3 versus 148.8 mm Hg) but significantly higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels (37.9 versus 28.4 mg/dL).

- **Reduced ejection fraction (rEF) patients**: Those with rEF who died within one year after hospital discharge were more likely to have been previously diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary heart disease. Additionally, these patients had lower serum sodium and hematocrit findings at admission but higher BUN values.

- **Borderline preserved ejection fraction (BpEF) patients**: Patients with BpEF who died were more likely to have been previously diagnosed with atrial fibrillation and heart failure than those who survived, and they had higher BUN findings.

- **Preserved ejection fraction (pEF) patients**: Patients with pEF who died during this high-risk period were more likely to have a history of either chronic kidney disease or peripheral vascular disease and were less likely to have a history of hypertension.

### 2016 ESC and ACC/AHA/HFSA heart failure guideline update - what is new and why is it important [^111KwTB5]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is a global epidemic affecting millions of individuals worldwide. Although important progress has been made in the management of HF, this condition remains a common cause of morbidity and death. Since the publication of the previous sets of guidelines for the management of HF, new diagnostic and therapeutic options for HF have emerged. Now, both the ESC and the ACC/AHA/HFSA have simultaneously published an update of their guidelines incorporating, among others, recommendations for the use of new pharmacological therapies for the treatment of HF.

For this viewpoint article, we have asked the chairs of the ESC Task Force, the chairs of the ACC/AHA/HFSA Writing Committee, and an independent opinion leader in the field to offer their expert insight into the new guidelines, highlighting what is new, what the main differences are between the two sets of guidelines, and what steps should be taken to improve the guidelines in future updates.

### Approach to acute heart failure in the emergency department [^114q5Arz]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Acute heart failure (AHF) patients rarely present complaining of "acute heart failure". Rather, they initially present to the emergency department (ED) with a myriad of chief complaints, symptoms, and physical exam findings. Such heterogeneity prompts an initially broad differential diagnosis, and securing the correct diagnosis can be challenging. Although AHF may be the ultimate diagnosis, the precipitant of decompensation must also be sought and addressed. For AHF patients who present in respiratory or circulatory failure requiring immediate stabilization, treatment begins even while the diagnosis is uncertain.

The initial diagnostic workup consists of a thorough history and exam (with a particular focus on the cause of decompensation), an EKG, chest X-ray, laboratory testing, and point-of-care ultrasonography performed by a qualified clinician or technologist. We recommend initial treatment be guided by the presenting phenotype.

- **Hypertensive patients**: Particularly those in severe distress and with markedly elevated blood pressure, should be treated aggressively with vasodilators, most commonly nitroglycerin.
- **Normotensive patients**: Generally require significant diuresis with intravenous loop diuretics.
- **Hypotensive or circulatory collapse patients**: A small minority present with these conditions. These patients are the most difficult to manage and require careful assessment of intra- and extra-vascular volume status.

After stabilization, diagnosis, and management, most ED patients with AHF in the United States (US) are admitted. While this is understandable, it may be unnecessary. Ongoing research…

### Clinical and research considerations for patients with hypertensive acute heart failure: A consensus statement from the Society of Academic Emergency Medicine and the Heart Failure Society of America Acute Heart Failure Working Group [^112Doch9]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2016). Low credibility.

Management approaches for patients in the emergency department (ED) who present with acute heart failure (AHF) have largely focused on intravenous diuretics. Yet, the primary pathophysiologic derangement underlying AHF in many patients is not solely volume overload. Patients with hypertensive AHF (H-AHF) represent a clinical phenotype with distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms that result in elevated ventricular filling pressures. To optimize treatment response and minimize adverse events in this subgroup, we propose that clinical management be tailored to a conceptual model of disease based on these mechanisms. This consensus statement reviews the relevant pathophysiology, clinical characteristics, approach to therapy, and considerations for clinical trials in ED patients with H-AHF.

### In-hospital and postdischarge mortality among patients with acute decompensated heart failure hospitalizations ending on the weekend versus weekday: The ARIC study community surveillance [^1176cnzX]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Heart failure (HF) is the third most common diagnosis for patient hospitalization, excluding maternal/neonatal stays. The "weekend effect", characterized by worse patient outcomes following weekend admission, has been well described for many admission diagnoses. This phenomenon has been attributed to various causes, including decreased availability of supervising physicians and subspecialty care on weekends, reduced nurse staffing, higher illness severity among patients admitted on weekends, and delays in diagnosis and therapeutic procedures. Outcomes of weekend versus weekday admission have also been described among patients admitted with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in several large registries.

In contrast, there are no analyses of in-hospital death on the weekend versus weekday for patients admitted for ADHF, and the existing data on post-hospital outcomes by weekend or weekday discharge are both minimal and conflicting. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services prioritize in-hospital mortality and 30-day mortality as outcome metrics in the Hospital Quality Initiative. Examining inpatient mortality on the weekend versus weekday and post-hospital outcomes following discharge on the weekend versus weekday in a large, geographically diverse sample of patients admitted with ADHF may suggest actionable areas for intervention. To meet this objective, we analyzed ADHF hospitalizations captured by the Community Surveillance component of the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study. We expected that patients would…

### Prognostic value of blood urea nitrogen in patients hospitalized with worsening heart failure: insights from the acute and chronic therapeutic impact of a vasopressin antagonist in chronic heart failure (ACTIV in CHF) study [^115CRR9Q]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2007). Low credibility.

Hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is associated with a high postdischarge mortality and readmission rate. The association between baseline blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and clinical outcomes in patients admitted for ADHF was evaluated in a post-hoc analysis of the ACTIV in CHF trial.

- **Methods and results**: Patients were categorized into quartiles according to baseline BUN. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to test the association between BUN, mortality, and death or readmission within 60 days. Patients in the highest quartile (> 40 mg/dL) had the highest 60-day mortality (14.3%, 9.3%, 4.0%, 0%, respectively; P < .001) and the highest rate of death or heart failure hospitalization (30.0%, 21.3%, 18.4%, 8.6%; P < .001). After adjustment for covariates, BUN was a statistically significant predictor of both mortality and the composite endpoint of death or heart failure hospitalization at 60 days after hospital discharge. Serum creatinine and estimated creatinine clearance did not predict mortality after covariate adjustment.

- **Conclusions**: Higher baseline BUN is a powerful predictor of increased postdischarge mortality in patients hospitalized for heart failure, even in the absence of severe renal failure. Even mild to moderate elevations in baseline BUN were predictive. BUN remains an easily accessible risk stratification tool that physicians should closely monitor in the hospital setting.

### Brain natriuretic peptide at discharge as a predictor of 6-month mortality in acute decompensated heart failure [^115VqaD5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is well established in detecting acute decompensation of heart failure (ADHF). However, the role of BNP at discharge in predicting mortality is less established. Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammatory cytokines play an important role in the development of heart failure. This study aimed to examine the contribution of BNP, interleukin 6, and procalcitonin to mortality in ADHF.

- **Methods**: A cohort of 33 patients with ADHF was identified between March 2009 and June 2010 at Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel. The cohort was followed up for all-cause mortality during 6 months after hospital discharge. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the association between BNP, interleukin-6, and procalcitonin and all-cause mortality.

- **Results**: Compared to BNP at admission, BNP at discharge was more predictive for all-cause mortality. The area under the curve for BNP at admission and discharge was 0.810 (P = 0.004) and 0.864 (P = 0.001), respectively. Eleven patients (33.3%) who died during the follow-up period had higher BNP levels, with a median of 2031.4 (IQR, 1173.4–2707.2), than those who survived; median 692.5 (IQR, 309.9–1159.9) (P = 0.001). On multivariate analysis, BNP remained an independent predictor for 6-month all-cause mortality with a hazard ratio (HR) of 9.58 (95% CI, 2.0–45.89) for levels above the median compared to lower levels (P = 0.005). Albumin, procalcitonin, and interleukin 6 were not associated with all-cause mortality.

- **Conclusions**: BNP at discharge is an independent predictor for all-cause mortality in patients with ADHF. Compared with BNP at admission, BNP at discharge provides more predictive value.

### Magnitude of and prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality after hospital discharge for acute decompensated heart failure based on ejection fraction findings [^1179WBRe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Prospective studies have classified patients with heart failure (HF) into groups based on ejection fraction (EF) findings and examined predictors of mortality, typically assessing only two strata: those with preserved ejection fraction (pEF) and reduced ejection fraction (rEF) findings. Consistent with previous literature, older age was associated with worse prognosis across EF strata. Additionally, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), low systolic blood pressure, and serum sodium findings on admission increased the risk of mortality in each EF stratum. Interestingly, several factors differentiated patients with pEF and rEF that might be important for enhanced disease management, lifestyle practices, and/or heightened surveillance.

Further stratification of the EF groups by age significantly impacted the factors associated with the long-term prognosis for patients in each EF stratum examined in the present study. Atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and COPD, which have been reported as important prognostic factors in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), appeared to have a differential impact based on EF stratum and baseline age. Future clinical trials should include older patients with various comorbidities to better understand the effects of age and selected comorbidities on the long-term prognosis of patients with ADHF, its various EF strata, and the enhanced management of this clinical syndrome and its subtypes.

### Intravenous levosimendan vs. dobutamine in acute decompensated heart failure patients on beta-blockers [^111JSQi5]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2010). Low credibility.

Levosimendan or placebo for levosimendan (Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland) was administered as an initial loading dose of 12 µg/kg delivered over 10 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1 µg/kg/min for 50 minutes. The infusion rate was increased to 0.2 µg/kg/min for a further 23 hours. If dose-limiting events (DLEs) occurred (as described below) during administration of the loading dose, the loading dose was stopped. Upon resolution, the infusion could be restarted at 0.1 µg/kg/min and increased to 0.2 µg/kg/min or reduced to 0.05 µg/kg/min as appropriate. If DLEs occurred during the infusion, the dosage could be reduced to 0.1 or 0.05 µg/kg/min.

Dobutamine (Eli-Lilly, Solna, Sweden) or placebo for dobutamine (Orion Pharma, Espoo, Finland) was given as a continuous infusion without a loading dose, starting at a rate of 5 µg/kg/min for 1 hour, and increased to 10 µg/kg/min for a further 47 hours, unless the dosage was not tolerated during the first 60 minutes. If DLEs occurred during the infusion, the dosage could be reduced to 5 or 2.5 µg/kg/min.

The optimal dosage of β-blocker administered at baseline was, as far as possible, to be maintained throughout the study. If possible, diuretic treatment regimens were to remain constant.

- **Dose-limiting events (DLEs)**: Defined as symptomatic hypotension, heart rate ≥ 140 beats per minute (b.p.m.) constantly over 5 minutes, development of angina pectoris, electrocardiographic signs of significant myocardial ischemia, or suspicion of myocardial infarction. Development of new malignant tachyarrhythmia or excessive diuresis that was sustained despite reducing the dosage.

### 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: Executive summary: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116Q17e7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

The "2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure" replaces the "2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure" and the "2017 ACC/AHA/HFSA Focused Update of the 2013 ACCF/AHA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure". The 2022 guideline is intended to provide patient-centric recommendations for clinicians to prevent, diagnose, and manage patients with heart failure.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted from May 2020 to December 2020, encompassing studies, reviews, and other evidence conducted on human subjects that were published in English from MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Collaboration, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other relevant databases. Additional relevant clinical trials and research studies, published through September 2021, were also considered. This guideline was harmonized with other American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines published through December 2021.

Heart failure remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The 2022 heart failure guideline provides recommendations based on contemporary evidence for the treatment of these patients. The recommendations present an evidence-based approach to managing patients with heart failure, with the intent to improve quality of care and align with patients' interests. Many recommendations from the earlier heart failure guidelines have been updated with new evidence, and new recommendations have been created when supported by published data.

### Early identification of patients with acute decompensated heart failure [^112LRkwN]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2018). Low credibility.

Interventions to reduce readmissions after acute heart failure hospitalization require early identification of patients. The purpose of this study was to develop and test the accuracies of various approaches to identify patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) using data derived from the electronic health record.

- **Methods and results**: We included 37,229 hospitalizations of adult patients at a single hospital during 2013–2015. We developed four algorithms to identify hospitalization with a principal discharge diagnosis of ADHF: 1) presence of one of three clinical characteristics, 2) logistic regression of 31 structured data elements, 3) machine learning with unstructured data, and 4) machine learning with the use of both structured and unstructured data. In data validation, algorithm 1 had a sensitivity of 0.98 and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.14 for ADHF. Algorithm 2 had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.96, and both machine learning algorithms had AUCs of 0.99. Based on a brief survey of three providers who perform chart review for ADHF, we estimated that providers spent 8.6 minutes per chart review. Using this parameter, we estimated that providers would spend 61.4, 57.3, 28.7, and 25.3 minutes on secondary chart review for each case of ADHF if initial screening were done with algorithms 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Machine learning algorithms with unstructured notes had the best performance for identification of ADHF and can improve provider efficiency for the delivery of quality improvement.

### Magnitude of and prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality after hospital discharge for acute decompensated heart failure based on ejection fraction findings [^117Vc3py]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Our study has several strengths, including its population-based design and inclusion of only validated cases of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) that occurred among adult patients of all ages from a well-defined and characterized large metropolitan area. However, since this New England community is predominantly white, the generalizability of our findings to other races and ethnicities may be limited. More contemporary data are needed to extend the present findings.

We did not collect information on patients' socioeconomic, psychosocial, or cognitive status, or other factors that have been shown to affect long-term prognosis after ADHF. Additionally, we did not assess changes in various physiological factors or laboratory findings during each patient's index admission that may have been associated with reduced or increased risk of dying, or the role of novel serum biomarkers. Only those patients who had echocardiograms performed for clinical indications were included in the analysis, and a large percentage of patients in our surveillance study did not have an echocardiogram performed during the index hospitalization and were excluded from the present investigation.

Finally, we had only a single ejection fraction (EF) measurement available from the index hospitalization for each patient. Since EF findings may change over time, we cannot account for the impact of potentially changing EF values over time and how those changes may have affected the mortality profiles of at-risk patients.

### Magnitude of and prognostic factors associated with 1-year mortality after hospital discharge for acute decompensated heart failure based on ejection fraction findings [^111oFb7N]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). High credibility.

The results of this study of central Massachusetts residents who were hospitalized among all 11 metropolitan Worcester medical centers suggest that patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) who survived their acute index hospitalization had high 1-year postdischarge all-cause mortality rates. Patients with reduced ejection fraction (rEF) experienced the highest total death rates, whereas patients with preserved ejection fraction (pEF) experienced the highest postdischarge survival rates. Advanced age, previously diagnosed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), systolic blood pressure findings below 150 mm Hg at the time of hospital admission, and hyponatremia were associated with poorer postdischarge prognosis across all ejection fraction (EF) strata. In contrast, several prognostic factors differed between the three EF groups in our univariate and multivariable adjusted analyses. When the study population was further stratified according to age, different prognostic factors were associated with postdischarge mortality in our three EF comparison groups.

Previously published observational studies and clinical trials have primarily examined differences in the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with either pEF or rEF, with few describing the characteristics of patients with borderline ejection fraction (BpEF). These studies found that heart failure (HF) patients with lower EF values had a higher burden of preexisting diseases, including coronary heart disease and renal failure, and were primarily male. Patients presenting with pEF findings were typically older and mostly female. Our study agreed with the previous literature for patients in these two EF strata.

Regarding inpatient care for heart failure, specifically in the context of intravenous inotropes, the ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend considering the administration of continuous IV inotropic support as "bridge therapy". This is applicable for patients with advanced (stage D) heart failure refractory to guideline-directed medical therapy and device therapy, who are eligible for and awaiting mechanical circulatory support or cardiac transplantation.

### ED patients with heart failure: Identification of an observational unit-appropriate cohort [^117XSuR9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

To identify factors that define a low-risk cohort of patients with acute decompensated heart failure who are suitable for management in an observation unit, a prospective convenience sample of 538 patients who presented to an ED with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure was analyzed. Observation unit appropriateness was defined as a length of stay less than 24 hours and no adverse events (myocardial infarction, death, arrhythmia, or rehospitalization) during the 30-day follow-up period.

Study criteria were met by 499 patients (mean age, 61 ± 15 years), and 234 (47%) were women. Of these, 133 (27%) met the criteria for observation unit appropriateness. Independent predictors included systolic blood pressure greater than 160 (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.15–2.7) and normal troponin I (odds ratio, 14.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.9–105).

Initial blood pressure and troponin I can help identify patients with congestive heart failure at low risk for prolonged hospitalization and adverse events, making them reasonable candidates for observation unit management.

Regarding medical management for heart failure, more specifically with respect to diuretics, the ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend reserving the addition of thiazide (such as metolazone) to treatment with a loop diuretic for patients with heart failure and congestive symptoms not responding to moderate- or high-dose loop diuretics to minimize electrolyte abnormalities.

### Improved survival after heart failure: A community-based perspective [^112mUNDN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2013). Low credibility.

In‐hospital and 30‐day case-fatality rates for all hospitalized patients, as well as separately for incident (initial) cases of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), are presented. During the study period, 704 (7.2%) patients died during their index hospitalization, while 752 (8.3%) patients died within 30 days after hospital discharge. In 1995, 8.5% of patients admitted for ADHF died during hospitalization, with inconsistent declines in hospital death rates noted between 2000, 2002, and 2004. Similarly, 8.5% of patients died within 30 days following hospital discharge for ADHF in 1995, compared with 7.1% in 2004. Similar, albeit inconsistent, declining trends in in‐hospital and 30‐day all‐cause mortality rates were also observed in patients with an initial episode of ADHF.

After controlling for age, sex, and all major baseline comorbidities and physiologic variables, the multivariable-adjusted odds of dying during hospitalization and within 30 days after hospital discharge declined over time in both the total study population and in incident cases of ADHF. Similar to what had been observed in our crude unadjusted analyses, there was an inconsistent decline in in‐hospital death rates observed during the years under study after multivariable adjustment.

Regarding inpatient care for heart failure, specifically in relation to intravenous inotropes, the ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend considering the administration of continuous IV inotropic support as palliative therapy. This is advised for symptom control and the improvement of functional status in selected patients with stage D heart failure, despite optimal guideline-directed medical therapy, and when patients are ineligible for mechanical circulatory support or cardiac transplantation.

### The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE): Opportunities to improve care of patients hospitalized with acute decompensated heart failure [^115vvR3w]. Reviews in Cardiovascular Medicine (2003). High credibility.

The Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry (ADHERE) Algorithm is a clinical decision tool designed for patients presenting with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). This algorithm aids clinicians in risk stratification, guiding therapeutic decisions based on the severity of the patient's condition. It utilizes key parameters such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN), systolic blood pressure, and creatinine levels to predict in-hospital mortality.

The ADHERE Algorithm is particularly useful in the emergency department setting, where rapid assessment and treatment initiation are critical. It assists in identifying patients at high risk of adverse outcomes, thereby facilitating prompt intervention and potentially improving patient prognosis.

However, it is important to note that the ADHERE Algorithm may not be applicable to patients with acute heart failure secondary to acute coronary syndromes, severe valvular disease, or congenital heart disease. Additionally, it may not be suitable for patients with end-stage renal disease or those on dialysis, as their BUN and creatinine levels may be significantly altered.

- **Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level**: This input is "Yes" if the BUN is equal to or exceeds 43 mg/dL (15.35 mmol/L); otherwise, it is "No".

### Mortality and readmission rates in patients hospitalized for acute decompensated heart failure: A comparison between cardiology and general-medicine service outcomes in an underserved population [^113Todix]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

With recent legislation imposing penalties on hospitals for above-average 30-day all-cause readmissions for patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), there is concern these penalties will more heavily impact hospitals serving socioeconomically vulnerable and underserved populations.

- **Hypothesis**: Patients with ADHF and low socioeconomic status have better post-discharge mortality and readmission outcomes when cardiologists are involved in their in-hospital care.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively searched the electronic medical records for patients hospitalized for ADHF from 2001 to 2010 in three urban hospitals within a large university-based health system. These patients were divided into two groups based on whether a cardiologist was involved in their care. Measured outcomes were 30- and 60-day post-discharge mortality and readmission rates.

- **Results**: Out of the 7516 ADHF patients, 1434 patients were seen by a cardiologist (19%). These patients had lower 60-day mortality (5.4% vs. 7.0%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.52–0.96, P = 0.034) and lower 30- and 60-day readmission rates (16.7% vs. 20.6%; HR: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.66–0.89, P = 0.002, and 26.1% vs. 30.2%; HR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72–0.92, P = 0.003, respectively). There was no significant difference in the in-hospital mortality between the two groups. Compared with other races, white patients with systolic HF have marginally lower HF-related readmission rates when treated by cardiologists.

- **Conclusions**: In this cohort of ADHF patients from the Bronx, New York, involvement of a cardiologist resulted in improved outcomes.

### First symptoms and health care pathways in hospitalized patients with acute heart failure: ICPS2 survey. A report from the Heart Failure Working Group (GICC) of the French Society of Cardiology [^111bp7WK]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Hospital referral and admission**: Appendix S1 provides detailed information about patient referral to the hospital, according to type of symptom and time of appearance. The emergency medical assistance service (SAMU) was the most common type of referral (41.6%). Only 19.5% of the patients were referred by their cardiologist. SAMU‐referred patients were older and more likely to suffer from acute coronary symptoms and chest pain, as well as dyspnea. Patients referred by a general physician (GP) or a cardiologist were more likely to suffer from lower limb edema. Other symptoms, and recent weight gain in particular, were less frequently reported. Most patients referred by their GP or cardiologist had symptoms for over 15 days, including 76.8% of those referred by a cardiologist. Very few patients had consulted a cardiologist within 48 hours prior to hospitalization.

Patients were admitted to the hospital by different pathways, according to the type of referral and patient characteristics. Non-intensive care unit (ICU) was the most common way of recruitment (76.2%, including admission from ER department [48.0%], traditional cardiology units [19.6%], and consulting as outpatients [8.6%]), whereas only 23.8% were recruited from ICU.

Most SAMU-referred patients were admitted to ER or ICU. Patients referred by their GP or attending the hospital on their own most often attended the ER. The majority of cardiologist-referred patients (59.1%) were directly admitted to a non-intensive care unit and bypassed ER.

### ACC/AHA versus ESC guidelines on heart failure: JACC guideline comparison [^113wxM4D]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (with updates in 2016 and 2017) and 2016 European Society of Cardiology guidelines provide practical evidence-based clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of both acute and chronic heart failure (HF). Both sets of guidelines address noninvasive and invasive testing to establish the diagnosis of HF with reduced ejection fraction and HF with preserved ejection fraction. Extensive trial evidence supports the use of guideline-directed medical therapy and device-based therapies for the optimal management of patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction. Specific recommendations are also provided for HF with preserved ejection fraction, although the evidence is substantially weaker. The management of medical comorbidities is now addressed in both guidelines. Acute HF and end-stage disease requiring advanced therapies are also discussed. This review compares specific recommendations across the spectrum of HF phenotypes and disease severity, highlights areas where differences exist, and lists consequential studies published since the latest guidelines.

### Long-term mortality in older patients discharged after acute decompensated heart failure: A prospective cohort study [^115KWMYD]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Data are available on short- and intermediate-term mortality rates after discharge for acutely decompensated heart failure (ADHF). However, few studies specifically address ADHF outcomes in patients aged 75 years or over, who contribute more than half of all ADHF admissions. Our objectives here were to estimate the long-term mortality of patients aged 75 years or over who were discharged after admission for ADHF and to identify factors, especially geriatric findings, independently associated with 2-year mortality.

- **Methods**: This prospective cohort study in five French hospitals included consecutive patients aged 75 years or older and discharged after emergency-department admission for ADHF meeting Framingham criteria (N = 478; median age, 85 years; 68% female). Kaplan-Meier 1-year and 2-year survival curves were plotted. Admission characteristics independently associated with overall 2-year mortality were identified using multivariable Cox proportional-hazards regression.

- **Results**: Mortality was 41.7% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 37.2%-53.5%) after 1 year and 56.0% (95% CI, 51.5%-60.7%) after 2 years. By multivariable analysis, independent predictors of 2-year mortality were male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 1.36; 95% CI, 1.00–1.82), age > 85 years (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.19–2.07), higher number of impaired activities of daily living (HR, 1.11 per impaired item; 95% CI, 1.05–1.17), recent weight loss (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.14–2.28), and lower systolic blood pressure (HR, 0.86 per standard deviation increase; 95% CI, 0.74–0.99). Creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min showed significant results.

### Acute heart failure is a malignant process: But we can induce remission [^112w5FN9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

The epidemiology and causes of acute heart failure (AHF) are critical for understanding its impact globally. It is estimated that over 60 million people experience heart failure (HF) worldwide; however, precise figures for those admitted with AHF remain unknown due to the lack of objective diagnostic criteria. In the United States, 4.5 to 4.9 per 1000 people are admitted for HF as a primary diagnosis annually, resulting in approximately 1.5 million AHF admissions each year, which accounts for about 25% of HF patients. Extrapolating these ratios globally suggests that AHF leads to at least 20 million hospital admissions per year.

Several registries have identified potential causes of an AHF event. Acute coronary syndromes, valvular heart diseases, arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation, infections, uncontrolled hypertension, and medication nonadherence are commonly identified precipitants. Notably, in about half of the patients, no specific causes are identified, while in up to a quarter, multiple causes may be present. Understanding these causes is crucial for two reasons:

- **Prognostic information**: For instance, AHF following an acute coronary syndrome or infection is associated with higher short-term mortality than AHF associated with atrial fibrillation or uncontrolled hypertension.

- **Therapeutic implications**: Some causes of AHF may influence treatment strategies, as discussed later. Valvular heart disease is frequently associated with AHF and may result from either a new or worsening acute valvular lesion or through combined precipitants, such as an infection or arrhythmia in a patient.

This comprehensive understanding of the epidemiology and causes provides valuable insights for managing and potentially mitigating the adverse effects of AHF.

### In-hospital and postdischarge mortality among patients with acute decompensated heart failure hospitalizations ending on the weekend versus weekday: The ARIC study community surveillance [^115rRekA]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

Our analysis from ARIC Community Surveillance has several limitations. This was an observational study and was based on data available in the hospital record. We were unable to consider hospital readmissions, an important postdischarge outcome, or cause-specific mortality. Federal holidays were considered to occur on the "weekend", but observation of federal holidays may differ by hospital. However, only 2% of hospitalizations in this analysis terminated on a federal holiday.

Our analysis also has several noteworthy strengths. The Community Surveillance component of the ARIC study represents four geographically diverse regions of the United States. Rather than relying solely on ICD-9 codes, ADHF hospitalizations were classified by a standardized computer algorithm and physician review. Clinical data were collected by certified abstractors following standardized protocols, and mortality outcomes were ascertained by linking records with the National Death Index.

### Departments involved during the first episode of acute heart failure and subsequent emergency department revisits and rehospitalisations: an outlook through the NOVICA cohort [^115pVT9J]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

We investigated the natural history of patients following a first episode of acute heart failure (FEAHF) requiring emergency department (ED) consultation. The study focused on the frequency of ED visits and hospitalisations, departments admitting patients during the first and subsequent hospitalisations, and factors associated with difficult disease control.

Consecutive patients diagnosed with FEAHF, with or without a previous heart failure diagnosis, were included in the study across four EDs over three periods (2009, 2011, 2014). Diagnosis was adjudicated by local principal investigators. The clinical characteristics of the index event were prospectively recorded, and all post-discharge ED visits and hospitalisations related or unrelated to acute heart failure (AHF) were retrospectively ascertained, as were the departments involved in subsequent hospitalisations. 'Uncontrolled disease' during the first year after FEAHF was identified if patients attended the ED three or more times, were hospitalised two or more times for AHF, or died.

Overall, 505 patients with FEAHF were included and followed for a mean of 2.4 years. In-hospital mortality was 7.5%. Among the 467 patients discharged alive, 288 died with a median survival of 3.9 years (95% confidence interval, 3.5–4.4). A total of 421 patients (90%) revisited the ED, accounting for 2342 ED visits, with 42.4% requiring hospitalisation and 34.0% related to AHF. Additionally, 357 patients (77%) were hospitalised, resulting in 1054 hospitalisations, of which 94.1% occurred through the ED, and 51.4% were AHF-related. AHF-related hospitalisations predominantly occurred in internal medicine (28.0%), short-stay units (26.3%), and cardiology.

### Head-to-head comparison between recommendations by the ESC and ACC/AHA/HFSA heart failure guidelines [^111624Dr]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2022). High credibility.

Recommendations represent the core messages of guidelines and are particularly important when the body of scientific evidence is rapidly growing, as in the case of heart failure (HF). The main messages from two latest major HF guidelines, endorsed by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Failure Society of America (ACC/AHA/HFSA), partially overlap, starting from the four pillars of treatment for HF with reduced ejection fraction.

There are some notable differences, in part related to the timing of recent publications, most notably, the Universal Definition of HF paper and the EMPEROR-Preserved trial, and in part reflecting differing views of the natural history of HF. There is a clear differentiation between stages A and B HF in the ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines. Different approaches are proposed to specific issues such as risk stratification and implantable cardioverter defibrillator use for primary prevention in HFrEF patients with non-ischaemic aetiology.

The ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines emphasize some issues particularly relevant to the US setting, such as the cost-effectiveness of therapies and the impact of health disparities on HF care. A comparison between guideline recommendations may provide readers a deeper understanding of the ESC and ACC/AHA/HFSA guidelines and help them apply sensible approaches to their own practice worldwide. This comparison may also help further harmonize recommendations in future guidelines by identifying areas for improvement.

### 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Committee on Clinical Practice Guidelines [^117KByBa]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

In terms of inpatient care for heart failure, and specifically concerning intravenous inotropes, the ACC/AHA/HFSA 2022 guidelines recommend recognizing that long-term use of either continuous or intermittent IV inotropic agents in patients with heart failure, for reasons other than palliative care or as a bridge to advanced therapies, is potentially harmful.
