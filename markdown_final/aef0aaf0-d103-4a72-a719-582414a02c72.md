## Question

Hep B core Ab positive meaning?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) means and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the serologic context and whether HBsAg and anti-HBs are present. Then, I should verify the clinical setting and risk factors that change pretest probability. Next, I will consider the major differential diagnoses for isolated anti-HBc. After that, I need to outline a practical, risk-based workup and management plan, including when to test HBV DNA and how to handle special populations like HIV, HCV, pregnancy, and immunosuppressed patients. Finally, I should confirm counseling points and follow-up, including vaccination decisions and reactivation risk mitigation.

> Let me first confirm the serologic context because interpretation hinges on the triple panel: HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc. If anti-HBc is positive with HBsAg positive, that indicates current infection, acute or chronic, and I should confirm HBsAg with a neutralization assay and proceed to HBV DNA, HBeAg/anti-HBe, and ALT to stage disease and guide therapy [^113Vf5hB] [^114DMToS]. If anti-HBc is positive with anti-HBs positive and HBsAg negative, that typically reflects resolved infection with durable immunity, though I should remember anti-HBs can wane over time and that cccDNA persists in the liver, so reactivation remains possible under immunosuppression [^113Vf5hB] [^116H1cHQ]. If anti-HBc is positive with HBsAg and anti-HBs both negative, that is the isolated anti-HBc pattern, which is the most ambiguous and requires careful, risk-based evaluation [^113TUWr4] [^114XN4gN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the clinical setting and risk factors because they shift the likelihood of occult infection or false positivity. In low-prevalence populations with no risk, a false-positive isolated anti-HBc is more likely, and repeating the assay can help confirm specificity, whereas in high-prevalence groups or those with HIV, HCV, or injection drug use, isolated anti-HBc more often reflects prior infection with waning anti-HBs or occult HBV infection [^113TUWr4] [^1166kCs3]. I should also ask about recent blood products or IVIG because passive transfer of anti-HBc can transiently appear, especially in hemodialysis or recent transfusion settings [^114dUgrt].

> Next, I should review the differential for isolated anti-HBc. Let me think about the main possibilities: prior resolved infection with loss of detectable anti-HBs, occult HBV infection with low-level HBV DNA despite negative HBsAg, the serologic window period of acute HBV where anti-HBc appears before anti-HBs, HBsAg escape mutants that yield false-negative HBsAg, or a false-positive anti-HBc result, particularly in low-risk individuals [^113TUWr4] [^111QCSP3]. I should double-check that the total anti-HBc assay includes both IgM and IgG; IgM anti-HBc is not routinely needed unless acute infection is suspected, and its presence would support a recent infection or flare rather than remote exposure [^113Vf5hB] [^111QCSP3].

> I will now examine the approach to occult HBV infection because this is the highest-stakes scenario. Occult HBV is defined by detectable HBV DNA in the absence of HBsAg, and its prevalence varies by population, ranging from about 0.06–0.98% in blood donors across endemic strata to roughly 5–12% in high-risk groups, with pooled sensitivity of anti-HBc to detect occult HBV around 77% and specificity around 76%, so anti-HBc alone is an imperfect surrogate for occult infection [^115Yequt]. Wait, let me verify the clinical relevance: occult HBV is associated with advanced liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma, and people with occult HBV can transmit HBV, particularly via transfusion or transplantation, so I should maintain a low threshold to test HBV DNA in at-risk patients with isolated anti-HBc [^114Vd13E].

> Let me consider special populations where isolated anti-HBc is common and consequential. In people with HIV, isolated anti-HBc occurs in roughly 7–19% and is linked to prior HBV exposure and impaired humoral responses. A small but meaningful proportion have detectable HBV DNA, so I should confirm chronic infection is excluded and consider HBV DNA testing if immunosuppression is planned or if ALT is abnormal [^115u6r1w] [^113TUWr4]. In HCV coinfection, isolated anti-HBc is frequent and the risk of HBV reactivation during DAA therapy, while lower than in HBsAg-positive patients, is not zero, so I need to ensure baseline HBV serologies are obtained before starting DAA and monitor ALT during treatment [^114v6gix] [^111HRdAV]. In pregnancy, infants of HBsAg-positive mothers may have passively acquired anti-HBc for up to 24 months, so anti-HBc testing is not indicated before age 24 months, and maternal triple-panel testing guides perinatal management and neonatal prophylaxis [^113TUWr4] [^114YkDap].

> Now, I should outline a practical, risk-based workup for isolated anti-HBc. First, I need to ensure the result is not a false positive by repeating the total anti-HBc assay, ideally with a different platform, and by reviewing recent blood product exposure. If the repeat is negative, I can consider the patient susceptible and proceed with vaccination if indicated [^113TUWr4] [^114LMZcK]. If the repeat is positive, I should assess risk: in immunocompetent, low-risk individuals without liver disease, observation with counseling is reasonable. In moderate-to-high risk patients or those facing immunosuppression, I should order HBV DNA with ALT to evaluate for occult infection and reactivation risk, recognizing that sensitive assays can detect viremia below 200 IU/mL in some cases [^113TUWr4] [^113okwYr]. But wait, what if resources are limited? In LMIC settings, HBcrAg can serve as an inexpensive surrogate for clinically significant viremia thresholds and may help triage who needs antiviral therapy when HBV DNA is unavailable [^111qcRvb] [^112Ghd99].

> Next, I should review management pathways based on results. If HBV DNA is undetectable and ALT is normal, I can reassure the patient of resolved infection and counsel on reactivation risk with future immunosuppression. If HBV DNA is detectable, that confirms occult infection and warrants antiviral therapy if immunosuppression is planned or if there is evidence of active liver injury, with entecavir or tenofovir as preferred agents and treatment continued through immunosuppression and for at least 6–12 months after the immunosuppressive course ends, especially for B-cell depleting agents [^1139N9mF] [^112sRDeK]. I should confirm that prophylaxis is initiated before or at the start of high-risk therapy and that monitoring includes ALT and HBV DNA every 1–3 months during and after immunosuppression, adjusting the plan if HBsAg seroreversion or viremia occurs [^1139N9mF] [^112sRDeK].

> I need to ensure vaccination decisions are aligned with serology and risk. If isolated anti-HBc reflects prior infection with waning anti-HBs, a single vaccine dose often elicits an anamnestic rise in anti-HBs, confirming immunity. If there is no anamnestic response, completing a full series is reasonable, and in people with HIV, some guidelines suggest one dose followed by a full series if anti-HBs does not exceed 100 mIU/mL, after confirming absence of chronic HBV [^1124hsJS]. Hold on, I should verify that anti-HBc alone is never used to claim immunity. Only anti-HBs at or above 10 mIU/mL after a documented series or a convincing anamnestic response supports durable protection, and waning anti-HBs does not negate established immunity in most immunocompetent adults [^113Vf5hB] [^116H1cHQ].

> Let me reconsider the counseling points I must deliver. Patients with isolated anti-HBc should be told they have evidence of prior HBV exposure and are not infectious in routine settings, but they carry a lifelong risk of HBV reactivation if they become immunosuppressed, so future clinicians must be informed before chemotherapy, biologics, or high-dose steroids are prescribed; they should also be counseled on standard HBV prevention and, if nonimmune, offered vaccination [^116H1cHQ] [^114d2ngE]. I should confirm that household and sexual contacts of persons with HBV infection or a history of HBV infection are screened and vaccinated as appropriate to prevent transmission and missed diagnoses [^116H1cHQ].

> Finally, I should double-check that my approach aligns with current guidelines. Universal adult screening with HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc is recommended, and in patients at risk of HBV reactivation, expert societies endorse testing for these markers and using HBV DNA when indicated to stratify prophylaxis versus monitoring, rather than relying on anti-HBc alone to infer occult infection or immunity [^112sRDeK] [^112Udc6V]. If I initially thought anti-HBc positivity alone might suffice to diagnose occult HBV, I need to correct that assumption; anti-HBc has only modest sensitivity and specificity for occult infection, so direct HBV DNA testing remains the diagnostic gold standard when the clinical stakes are high [^115Yequt] [^111QCSP3].

A positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) means **past or current HBV infection** [^113Vf5hB] and is not due to vaccination, as vaccines do not induce anti-HBc [^112UtcaA]. In immunocompetent patients, it usually reflects **resolved infection** with lifelong immunity, but in immunocompromised or high-risk patients, it may indicate occult HBV infection or reactivation risk [^114Vd13E] [^112sRDeK]. Confirm with HBsAg and anti-HBs, and if isolated anti-HBc is present in a high-risk patient, **test HBV DNA** to exclude occult infection or reactivation [^113TUWr4] [^111QCSP3].

---

## Clinical significance of anti-HBc positivity

Anti-HBc appears during acute infection and persists for life, serving as a **marker of past or current HBV exposure** [^113Vf5hB]. Its presence **does not distinguish** acute from chronic infection or resolved infection, so results must be interpreted with HBsAg and anti-HBs [^1139d42c].

---

## Interpretation of anti-HBc positivity in different clinical contexts

### Immunocompetent individuals

In immunocompetent hosts, anti-HBc positivity typically reflects **resolved HBV infection** with lifelong immunity; anti-HBs may wane to undetectable levels, but immunity persists [^114d2ngE]. Rarely, it indicates **occult HBV infection** — HBsAg-negative with low-level HBV DNA — and is usually clinically silent [^113okwYr].

---

### Immunocompromised individuals

In immunocompromised hosts, anti-HBc positivity carries a **higher risk of occult HBV infection** and reactivation during immunosuppression or chemotherapy [^112sRDeK]. Detectable HBV DNA in HBsAg-negative patients defines occult infection and carries a risk of reactivation with immunosuppression [^113TUWr4].

---

### Individuals with HIV or hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection

In HIV or HCV coinfection, isolated anti-HBc is common and often reflects **prior HBV exposure** with waning anti-HBs; occult infection is more frequent than in immunocompetent hosts [^1166kCs3]. Occult HBV is more prevalent in these populations and warrants **HBV DNA testing** when isolated anti-HBc is detected [^114Vd13E].

---

## Clinical implications and management

### Further diagnostic evaluation

- **HBsAg and anti-HBs**: confirm current vs past infection and immunity [^113Vf5hB].
- **HBV DNA testing**: indicated for isolated anti-HBc in immunocompromised, HIV/HCV-coinfected, or high-risk patients to exclude occult infection [^113TUWr4] [^113okwYr].
- **ALT and AST**: assess liver injury or reactivation [^1139d42c].

---

### Clinical management

- **Resolved infection**: no treatment; monitor if immunosuppression is planned [^112sRDeK].
- **Occult infection or high reactivation risk**: consider antiviral prophylaxis before immunosuppression [^1139N9mF].
- **Susceptible individuals**: vaccinate if anti-HBs is negative [^116H1cHQ].

## Interpretation of anti-HBc positivity

| **Clinical context** | **Interpretation** | **Recommended actions** |
|-|-|-|
| Immunocompetent individual | Resolved infection | No treatment; monitor if immunosuppression planned |
| Immunocompromised individual | Occult infection or reactivation risk | Test HBV DNA; consider antiviral prophylaxis |
| HIV or HCV coinfection | Prior exposure; occult infection risk | Test HBV DNA; monitor closely |
| Isolated anti-HBc | Uncertain; possible occult infection | Test HBV DNA; vaccinate if susceptible |

---

A positive anti-HBc indicates **prior HBV exposure** and is not vaccine-induced; interpret alongside HBsAg and anti-HBs, and **test HBV DNA** in high-risk patients to detect occult infection or reactivation risk [^113Vf5hB] [^113TUWr4].

### Comparison of high-throughput fully automated immunoanalyzers for detecting hepatitis B virus infection [^1123UM4g]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Context —

High-throughput automated immunoanalyzers for hepatitis B virus serologic markers have been introduced but have not been compared to existing systems.

Objective —

To compare hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody analyses between our Architect i2000 platform and newer high-throughput fully automated immunoanalyzers.

Design —

From May to June 2018, a total of 932, 914, and 1055 samples tested for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody, respectively, with the Architect i2000 system for routine testing in our center were tested again with Alinity i, Atellica IM, and Cobas e801 systems.

Results —

Total concordance rates among the systems were 98.0%, 89.5%, and 93.0% for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody, respectively. Cohen's κ values exceeded 0.8. The correlations between serum hepatitis B surface antibody levels quantified by all 4 systems were high (r > 0.85). The hepatitis B surface antibody averages were greater for the Alinity i, Atellica IM, and Cobas e801 than for the Architect i2000 (P < .001).

Conclusions —

Alinity i, Atellica IM, and Cobas e801 automated immunoanalyzers performed well when compared with the existing Architect i2000 system with regard to detection of hepatitis B viral infection. However, the new systems have higher titer and positivity rates for hepatitis B surface antibody and are more sensitive. Notably, the Atellica IM has a lower positive rate for total hepatitis B core antibody than does the Architect i2000.

### Hepatitis B core-related antigen: an alternative to hepatitis B virus DNA to assess treatment eligibility in Africa [^112Ghd99]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

To eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, it is essential to scale up testing and treatment. However, conventional tools to assess treatment eligibility, particularly nucleic acid testing (NAT) to quantify HBV DNA, are hardly available and affordable in resource-limited countries. We therefore assessed the performance of a novel immunoassay, hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg), as an inexpensive (US$ < 15/assay) alternative to NAT to diagnose clinically important HBV DNA thresholds (≥ 2000, ≥ 20 000, and ≥ 200 000 IU/mL) and to select patients for antiviral therapy in Africa.

Methods

Using a well-characterized cohort of treatment-naive patients with chronic HBV infection in The Gambia, we evaluated the accuracy of serum HBcrAg to diagnose HBV DNA levels and to indicate treatment eligibility determined by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, based on reference tests (HBV DNA, hepatitis B e antigen, alanine aminotransferase, liver histopathology, and/or FibroScan).

Results

A total of 284 treatment-naive patients were included in the analysis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), sensitivity, and specificity of serum HBcrAg were 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI].82-.93), 83.3%, and 83.9%, respectively, to diagnose HBV DNA ≥ 2000 IU/mL; and 0.94 (95% CI, .88-.99), 91.4%, and 93.2% for ≥ 200 000 IU/mL. A simplified treatment algorithm using HBcrAg without HBV DNA showed high AUROC (0.91 [95% CI, .88-.95]) with a sensitivity of 96.6% and specificity of 85.8%.

Conclusions

HBcrAg might be an accurate alternative to HBV DNA quantification as a simple and inexpensive tool to identify HBV-infected patients in need of antiviral therapy in low- and middle-income countries.

### New and old biomarkers for diagnosis and management of chronic hepatitis B virus infection [^114BTGsH]. Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Tests to detect the presence and activity of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are the cornerstones of diagnosis and management. Assays that detect or measure serum levels of HB surface antigen, HB surface antibody, and HB core antibody are used to identify patients with exposure to HBV, whereas other tests provide information on the level of virus replication, presence of specific variants, and presence of virus reservoirs. Newer diagnostic tests, used only in research settings so far, aim to quantify levels of intrahepatic HBV replication. Other tests have been developed to detect HBV infection in resource-limited settings. We review point-of-care tests (essential in global screening efforts), standard diagnostic tests used in routine clinical management, and newer tests that might be used in clinical trials of agents designed to cure HBV infection.

### Screening for hepatitis A and B antibodies in patients with chronic liver disease [^116NW3vx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic liver disease (CLD) is highly prevalent, and hepatitis C is one of the leading causes. Acute hepatitis A or B in patients with chronic hepatitis C can lead to more severe hepatic injury and a higher fatality rate than in patients without hepatitis C. Thus, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization recommend that persons with CLD be vaccinated against hepatitis A virus (HAV), and the ACIP and the National Institutes of Health recommend vaccination against both HAV and hepatitis B virus (HBV) in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Because coinfection with HAV or HBV in patients with chronic hepatitis C or CLD is common, antibody screening prior to hepatitis A or B vaccination can identify patients who are already immune to these viruses and thus do not need to be vaccinated. Selective hepatitis A vaccination (i.e., vaccination of patients who test negative for either HAV antibody immunoglobulin G or total antibodies to HAV) is most cost-effective in areas where the local prevalence of hepatitis A is higher than the national prevalence and in populations with higher background rates of HAV exposure compared with the general population, such as older adults, foreign-born patients, African Americans, and persons with CLD or hepatitis C. Although not usually recommended for healthy adults or those with compensated CLD because of virtually 100% postvaccination seroconversion, serologic testing after hepatitis A vaccination is recommended in patients with decompensated or advanced end-stage liver disease because of the much lower seroconversion rates in these patients. Selective vaccination against HBV in patients with CLD or hepatitis C is also recommended. Testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibodies to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is considered the most efficient and reasonably cost-effective method to screen for hepatitis B serologic markers because HBsAg identifies individuals with both acute and chronic HBV infection, and anti-HBs identify those who are immune secondary to vaccination or past infection. Testing for antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen is needed to further distinguish between immunity due to vaccination and immunity due to past infection, but it is not recommended as the only screening test for HBV immunity. Postvaccination testing for hepatitis B seroconversion is recommended in all patients with CLD, especially in those with more advanced disease, because the rate of seroconversion is generally lower than in healthy adults. If patients with CLD are not adequately protected after a standard course of hepatitis B vaccination, a repeat course of vaccination using the standard schedule or an accelerated schedule (days 0, 7, and 21) should be considered.

### Clinical practice guideline management of blood borne viruses within the haemodialysis unit [^116ETDGb]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

For those who are not immune to HBV infection, we recommended HBsAg testing at least every 3 months for normal risk patients. Testing for HBsAg is sufficient for the diagnosis of HBV infection in the majority of dialysis patients. However occult HBV infection (the presence of HBV DNA detectable by real time PCR in the absence of detectable HbsAg) has been reported in 1.3–3.8% of chronic haemodialysis patients, although the risk in UK is likely to be considerably lower. There are reports of transmission of HBV infection from patients with occult HBV infection though, to date, not in association with haemodialysis. NAT may be indicated in such isolated cases.

Patients who have antibodies to the hepatitis B core antibody (Anti HBc) are at increased risk of viral reactivation compared to those who are core antibody negative. This patient group should be screened at least 3 monthly. The risk of viral reactivation is increased during periods of immunosuppression. We would recommend vaccination of this cohort - and use of prophylactic antiviral therapy in situations where the risk of reactivation is enhanced.

HBsAg testing should not be performed within 2 weeks of receipt of a Hepatitis B vaccine as the assay may detect the vaccine and cause concern that there is current infection. If testing and vaccination are undertaken at similar time points the serum sample should be drawn before the vaccine is administered.

Our previous guidelines and KDIGO guidelines recommend 6 monthly testing for HCV antibody using a 3rd generation assay. HCV antibody tests are unable to distinguish between resolved HCV infection and current HCV infection. In addition HCV antibodies may not be detectable for several months after HCV infection. In these patients HCV RNA positive result would indicate current infection. Patients who are HCV antibody-positive and HCV RNA-negative have resolved infection but remain at risk for re-infection if exposed. Detection of HCV viraemia relies on NAT technologies. Therefore patients who are HCV antibody positive and HCV RNA negative (i.e. those with resolved infection), should undergo screening for HCV reinfection every three to six months using NAT.

ASCO 2020 Provisional Clinical Opinion — HBV screening before systemic anticancer therapy states that all patients with cancer anticipating systemic anticancer therapy should be tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV) by 3 tests — hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG, and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) — prior to, or at the beginning of, systemic anticancer therapy; anticancer therapy should not be delayed for the results of the screening tests, and findings of chronic HBV (HBsAg-positive) or past HBV (HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc–positive with either negative or positive anti-HBs) infection require further action (Type of recommendation: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Strength of recommendation: strong).

### Isolated anti-HBV core phenotype in anti-HCV-positive patients is associated with hepatitis C virus replication [^112u9acS]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Recovery from hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is associated with the presence of antibodies against HBV surface (HBs) antigen and HBV core (HBc) antigen. However, anti-HBs antibodies are lost in many cases, and only anti-HBc antibodies persist. A higher frequency of the anti-HBc-alone pattern has been demonstrated for anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive patients. In this report, 1126 anti-HCV-positive/anti-HBc-positive patients were studied, and the role of HCV replication in influencing the presence or absence of anti-HBs antibodies was investigated. The anti-HBc-alone phenotype was significantly more frequent in HCV-viraemic than in HCV-recovered patients. This finding represents new information regarding the immunopathogenesis of chronic HCV infection and supports previous data indicating impaired humoral immune responses in HCV infection.

### Isolated antibody to hepatitis B core antigen in human immunodeficiency virus type-1-infected individuals [^114XZDi6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

We screened 651 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1-infected subjects for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). Of a total of 387 subjects who tested negative for both HBsAg and anti-HBs, 142 underwent further testing for isolated presence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). Of these 142 subjects, 60 (42%) tested positive for anti-HBc (isolated anti-HBc). Individuals coinfected with HIV-1 and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were more likely to have isolated anti-HBc than were subjects with HIV-1 alone (80% vs. 16%, respectively). Our findings suggest that individuals with HIV-1/HCV coinfection for whom there is no serological evidence for hepatitis B virus when screened with HBsAg and anti-HBs will be positive for anti-HBc in > 75% of cases. A screening strategy that tests only for HBsAg and anti-HBs in HIV-1-infected patients will miss a large number of individuals with isolated anti-HBc.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to serologic testing, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider confirming HBsAg positivity on the same immunoassay with a neutralization step or a second different rapid diagnostic test assay for the detection of HBsAg in settings or populations with a low HBsAg seroprevalence of < 0.4%.

### What is needed to move toward single-step diagnosis of current HCV infection? [^111ZrpGF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

If testing in a low-prevalence population (eg, 1%–2%), even with 97% sensitivity, the negative predictive value of a test would still be extremely high approximately 99.9%. However, in higher-prevalence populations (eg, PWID with prevalence approximately 40%), the negative predictive value would only be 98%. At its current sensitivity, core Ag test would likely have to be used with a paradigm of testing all core Ag-negative/HCV antibody-positive tests for HCV RNA. The cost-effectiveness of this strategy would likely depend on the viremic prevalence among antibody-positive people, which will go down as more and more people are treated. Ultimately, the availability of HCV core Ag test could be helpful if algorithms could be designed to test core Ag, with a plan to treat if positive but follow-up with reflex antibody and then RNA testing in those who test core Ag negative/HCV antibody positive. The cost-effectiveness and efficiency of such a strategy would have to be assessed to determine in which settings it would be most useful. Development of a POC core Ag test, ideally with improved sensitivity over existing assays, would be a major advance and would likely be not only cost-effective but significantly cost-saving (Table 1).

### Hepatitis B core-related antigen to indicate high viral load: systematic review and meta-analysis of 10, 397 individual participants [^111qcRvb]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

To eliminate hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, scale-up of testing and treatment in resource-limited countries is crucial. However, access to nucleic acid testing to quantify HBV DNA, an essential test to examine treatment eligibility, remains severely limited. We assessed the performance of a novel immunoassay, HBV core-related antigen (HBcrAg), as a low-cost (less than US $15/assay) alternative to nucleic acid testing to indicate clinically important high viremia in chronic HBV patients infected with different genotypes.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases through June 27, 2018. Three reviewers independently selected studies measuring HBV DNA and HBcrAg in the same blood samples. We contacted authors to provide individual participant data (IPD). We randomly allocated each IPD to a derivation or validation cohort. We applied optimal HBcrAg cut-off values derived from the derivation set to the validation set to estimate sensitivity/specificity.

Results

Of 74 eligible studies, IPD were obtained successfully for 60 studies (81%). Meta-analysis included 5591 IPD without antiviral therapy and 4806 treated with antivirals. In untreated patients, the pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and optimal cut-off values were as follows: 0.88 (95% CI, 0.83–0.94) and 3.6 log U/mL to diagnose HBV DNA level of 2000 IU/mL or greater; and 0.96 (95% CI, 0.94–0.98) and 5.3 log U/mL for 200,000 IU/mL or greater, respectively. In the validation set, the sensitivity and specificity were 85.2% and 84.7% to diagnose HBV DNA level of 2000 IU/mL or greater, and 91.8% and 90.5% for 200,000 IU/mL or greater, respectively. The performance did not vary by HBV genotypes. In patients treated with anti-HBV therapy the correlation between HBcrAg and HBV DNA was poor.

Conclusions

HBcrAg might be a useful serologic marker to indicate clinically important high viremia in treatment-naïve, HBV-infected patients.

### High levels of serum hepatitis B virus DNA in patients with' anti-HBc alone': role of HBsAg mutants [^114jMfWn]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2011). Low credibility.

It remains unclear how the detection of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) in the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody (anti-HBs) should be interpreted and whether all patients with this pattern need to be tested for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA. This study aimed at reassessing the significance of 'anti-HBc alone' in unselected sera referred to the clinical laboratory and determining whether significant HBV viraemia can be found in this setting. Of the 6431 patients tested for HBsAg, total anti-HBc and anti-HBs in a Paris hospital over a 1-year period, 362 (5.6%) had 'anti-HBc alone' (24.8% of anti-HBc-positive patients). Only 11 of the 362 sera (3.0%) were found to be false positive. One patient was in the resolving phase of acute hepatitis B. HBV-DNA was detected in 10 of 362 (2.8%) patients, using a commercial standardized assay (threshold: 350 IU/mL). Viral loads exceeded 10⁴ copies/mL in 6 of 10 patients. Mutations in the HBsAg immunodominant region were identified in seven of the viraemic patients. HBsAg was detected in only two cases when retested by one of the latest, multivalent assays. Neither human immunodeficiency virus nor hepatitis C virus serostatus distinguished between patients with and without HBV-DNA. In conclusion, 'anti-HBc alone' should be considered a risk marker for a so-called 'false occult' HBV infection with significant viraemia. Indeed, results in this hospital population indicate that a small proportion of patients with 'anti-HBc alone' have high viral loads, revealing the occurrence of infection with HBV mutants that escape detection even by multivalent HBsAg assays.

Other HBV viral endpoints

All participants were tested for anti‐HBc at the 35‐year time point, of whom 8 persons were positive for anti‐HBc (Table 4). Mean age of these 8 persons was 47.8 years. Four of these persons had never been positive for anti‐HBc on any of their follow‐up visits, whereas the 4 others had been positive for anti‐HBc on ≥ 1 follow‐up visit. None of the 8 persons were positive for HBsAg or HBV DNA. One person had abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) at the time of the positive result (presumed because of alcohol use; after a period of sobriety, ALT and AST levels returned to normal). None revealed any clinical signs or symptoms of hepatitis on chart review. Over the course of all follow‐up time points, 28 persons have had a positive result for anti‐HBc on one or more visit. The overall rate of anti‐HBc core positivity within the cohort is 1.48 (95% CI, 0.98, 2.14) per 1000 person‐years of follow‐up. This rate did not differ by age or sex, but was higher among persons who did not initially respond to the three‐dose primary series (5.96 per 1000 person‐years) compared to persons who did respond (p < 0.001; 1.18 per 1000 person‐years). During the course of the 35 years of follow‐up, none of the 28 persons with evidence of a breakthrough infection had evidence, by history or in their medical records, for acute clinical hepatitis or developed chronic HBV infection.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^113Vf5hB]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

HBsAg: The presence of HBsAg indicates HBV infection, either acute or chronic, except when it might be transiently positive shortly after a dose of HepB vaccine. The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) defines chronic infection as the presence of HBsAg for at least 6 months.
Anti-HBs: The appearance of anti-HBs after a decline of HBsAg indicates recovery from HBV infection. Among immunocompetent persons never infected with HBV, anti-HBs at concentrations of ≥ 10 mIU/mL at 1–2 months after completion of a HepB vaccine series indicates immunity. Although certain persons might have anti-HBs of ≥ 10 mIU/mL after partial vaccination, whether this confers long-term protection is unknown. Among vaccine responders who completed a vaccine series, anti-HBs can decline over time to levels of < 10 mIU/mL; however, the majority are still immune and will mount an immune response to a vaccine challenge ≥ 35 years after vaccination. Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) can provide anti-HBs for 4–6 months after administration; therefore, testing for anti-HBs ≤ 6 months after HBIG administration is not an accurate measure of a person's immune status.
Total anti-HBc: Total anti-HBc develops in all HBV infections, resolved or current, and typically persists for life. Persons whose immunity to HBV is from a vaccine do not develop anti-HBc. Assays for total anti-HBc detect both immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to HBcAg; no test for IgG anti-HBc alone is commercially available. During the typical course of chronic infection, total anti-HBc and HBsAg will be present, whereas IgM anti-HBc will disappear (Figure 1). IgM anti-HBc should be ordered only when acute HBV infection is a concern.
Other markers (HBV DNA, HBeAg, and anti-HBe): HBV DNA is a measure of viral load. HBeAg is a marker for viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) can be used to monitor response to treatment and chronic HBV infection progression. After identifying a person with HBV infection, testing for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA can provide information on the level of viral replication and infectivity and help guide clinical management.

Background information on HBV, including virus description, transmission, clinical features, natural history, and HepB vaccination seroprotection and coverage, is available (Supplementary Appendix 1).

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^1139d42c]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) evaluation in the setting of abnormal aminotransferases specifies when to test, core screening markers, and follow-up. Testing for hepatitis B should be performed in all patients with persistently elevated AST/ALT levels. Chronic hepatitis B infects ~1.5 million Americans and over 280 million individuals world-wide. Hepatitis B screening involves testing for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), the hepatitis B core antibody total, and the hepatitis B surface antibody, which together indicate infection, prior exposure, or immunity (natural or vaccine-mediated). Chronic infection is confirmed by presence of the HBsAg and/or positive virion on a highly sensitive HBV DNA assay. Individuals confirmed to have chronic hepatitis B should be referred to physicians with expertise for further characterization and staging, including assessment of HBeAg, HBeAb and HBV DNA, and the diagnosis of acute hepatitis B is made by a positive immunoglobulin M (IgM) hepatitis B core antibody and HBsAg in the setting of an acute hepatitis.

### Response to hepatitis B vaccine in HIV-1-positive subjects who test positive for isolated antibody to hepatitis B core antigen: implications for hepatitis B vaccine strategies [^112FE9zP]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-positive subjects who test positive for isolated antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) should be vaccinated with hepatitis B vaccine is not certain. Development of an anamnestic response after vaccination would suggest previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, in which case vaccination is not necessary.

Methods

Sixty-nine HIV-1-positive subjects who tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) received vaccination with standard hepatitis B vaccine. Twenty-nine subjects (42%) tested positive for anti-HBc, and 40 (58%) tested negative for anti-HBc. An anamnestic response was defined as an anti-HBs titer of ≥ 10 IU/L within 4 weeks of the first vaccination.

Results

The overall anamnestic response rate was 16% and was not significantly different between subjects who tested positive for anti-HBc (24%) and those who tested negative for anti-HBc (10%) before vaccination (P = 0.18). Approximately 50% of subjects who tested positive for anti-HBc also tested positive for antibody to hepatitis Be antigen (anti-HBe). The anamnestic response rate was higher in subjects who tested positive for both anti-HBc and anti-HBe (43%) than in subjects who tested positive for anti-HBc but negative for anti-HBe (7%) (P = 0.035). After a complete series of vaccinations, HIV-1/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected subjects were less likely to achieve high anti-HBs titers than were subjects infected with HIV-1 alone.

Conclusions

After hepatitis B vaccination, the anamnestic response rate in HIV-1-positive subjects who tested positive for isolated anti-HBc but negative for anti-HBe was low and was comparable to that in subjects who tested negative for anti-HBc. This finding suggests that testing for anti-HBc alone may not be a reliable assessment of protection from HBV infection. HIV-1/HCV coinfection may be associated with impaired responses to hepatitis B vaccine, and evaluation of strategies to improve immunogenicity of the vaccine in such individuals is warranted.

### Hepatitis B [^116LK5KX]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

HBV diagnostic criteria — per Table 4 — are specified for three states. For chronic hepatitis B, criteria include HBsAg-positive > 6 months, serum HBV DNA > 20,000 IU/mL (10⁵ copies/mL), persistent or intermittent increase in ALT/AST levels, and liver biopsy showing chronic hepatitis with moderate or severe necroinflammation. For inactive HBsAg carrier state, criteria include HBsAg-positive > 6 months, HBeAg-negative, anti-HBe+, serum HBV DNA < 2,000 IU/mL, persistently normal ALT/AST levels, and liver biopsy confirms absence of significant hepatitis. For resolved hepatitis B, criteria include previous known history of acute or chronic hepatitis B or the presence of anti-HBc ± anti-HBs, HBsAg-, undetectable serum HBV DNA*, and normal ALT levels; very low levels may be detectable using sensitive PCR assays.

### Level of hepatitis B (HB) core antibody associates with seroclearance of HBV DNA and HB surface antigen in HB e antigen-seronegative patients [^115KH5bs]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Although a low level of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is a marker of hepatitis B virus (HBV) seroclearance, additional biomarkers are needed for more accurate prediction. We investigated whether quantification of antibody against HBV core protein (anti-HBc) can identify patients with undetectable levels of HBV DNA and HBsAg seroclearance among those who were HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-seronegative.

Methods

We performed a retrospective analysis of data from a community-based cohort of individuals (30–65 years old) in Taiwan who were HBsAg seropositive, anti-HCV negative, and free of cirrhosis and/or liver cancer, recruited from 1991 through 1992, and evaluated every 6–12 months until June 30, 2004. We measured levels of anti-HBc in blood samples from 2500 participants who were seronegative for HBeAg. The first date at which a sample tested negative for HBV DNA or HBsAg, and remained negative in subsequent tests, was designated as the date of spontaneous HBV DNA undetectability or HBsAg seroclearance. We calculated cumulative incidences of HBV DNA undetectability and HBsAg seroclearance; associations between level of anti-HBc and undetectability of HBV DNA or HBsAg seroclearance were estimated by Cox proportional hazard regression. The effects of time on the associations between level of anti-HBc and HBsAg seroclearance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analysis.

Results

After a 12-year follow-up period, higher proportions of subjects with levels of anti-HBc < 3 log IU/mL had undetectable levels of HBV DNA (58%) and HBsAg seroclearance (53%) than subjects with higher levels of anti-HBc (29.6% and 19.8%, respectively) (P < .001). For subjects with levels of HBsAg < 10² IU/mL and anti-HBc < 3 log IU/mL, the adjusted rate ratio of HBV DNA undetectability was 16.45 (95% CI, 11.15–24.28) and of HBsAg seroclearance was 17.95 (95% CI, 12.49–25.81), compared to subjects with higher levels of HBsAg and anti-HBc. A model that included level of anti-HBc as a parameter identified subjects with HBsAg seroclearance within 10 years with an AUROC of 82%; this value was significantly higher than that from models that include only level of HBV DNA and HBsAg (P < .0001).

Conclusions

In a retrospective analysis of a large cohort of patients with chronic HBV infection in Taiwan, we associated levels of anti-HBc < 3 log IU/mL with undetectable HBV DNA and HBsAg seroclearance occurred within 10 years; patients who also have levels of HBsAg < 10 2 IU/mL have greater odds. Combining data on levels of HBsAg, HBV DNA, and anti-HBc is able to identify HBeAg-seronegative patients who can achieve HBsAg seroclearance with an AUROC value of 82%.

FIGURE 2
Acute hepatitis B virus infection with recovery

Abbreviations: anti-HBc = antibody to hepatitis B core antigen; anti-HBe = antibody to hepatitis B e antigen; anti-HBs = antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen; HBeAg = hepatitis B e antigen; HBsAg = hepatitis B surface antigen; HBV DNA = hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid; IgM = immunoglobulin class M.

In certain persons, anti-HBc is the only serologic marker detected. Isolated anti-HBc-positivity can be detected following HBV infection in persons who have recovered but whose anti-HBs levels have waned; in populations with a high prevalence of HBV infection, isolated anti-HBc likely indicates previous infection with loss of anti-HBs. Some chronically infected persons with isolated anti-HBc-positivity have circulating HBsAg that is not detectable by a laboratory assay. HBV DNA has been detected in < 10% of persons with isolated anti-HBc, although the presence of detectable HBV DNA might fluctuate. These persons are unlikely to transmit infection except under circumstances in which they are the source of a large exposure, such as a blood transfusion. Persons who are HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive can experience reactivation of infection during chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy, with reappearance of HBsAg. Infection with a mutant HBV strain can result in positive laboratory tests for HBsAg, total anti-HBc, anti-HBs, and HBV DNA, with a negative IgM anti-HBc.

Perinatal HBV infection in a child aged ≤ 24 months is typically asymptomatic although fulminant hepatitis can occur; a positive HBsAg test, positive HBeAg test, or detectable HBV DNA may be considered laboratory evidence of perinatal HBV in an infant born to an HBV-infected mother if timing criteria are met. Infants who are born to HBsAg-positive mothers and who do not become infected might have detectable anti-HBc for up to 24 months after birth from passively acquired maternal antibody.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to patients with malignancy, ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain careful monitoring with HBsAg and ALT testing every 3 months (with subsequent HBV DNA testing if a hepatitis flare develops) in patients with past HBV receiving anticancer therapies not clearly associated with a high risk of HBV reactivation (regimens not including anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies or stem cell transplantation), with the initiation of antiviral therapy only if HBsAg becomes positive or hepatitis DNA > 1,000 IU/mL in the setting of a hepatitis flare.

### Can the serological status of anti-HBc alone be considered a sentinel marker for detection of occult HBV infection? [^115mND4F]. Journal of Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Some individuals have "occult" infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), defined as presence of HBV genome in the serum or liver tissue without HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) in the serum. The aim of this study was to investigate whether serum antibodies against HBV core antigen in isolation ("anti-HBc alone") are a useful marker of "occult" HBV in patients with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. "Anti-HBc alone" was detected in the sera of 119/6,544 (1.8%) asymptomatic outpatients referred to the diagnostic laboratory for routine testing for viral hepatitis, 62/607 (10.2%) drug users, and 42/195 (21.5%) patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Using three in-house nested-PCR amplification assays to detect HBV preS-S (S), precore-core (C), and Pol viral regions, respectively, "occult" HBV sequences were found in 9 of the 223 sera (4.0%) with "anti-HBc alone". The highest prevalence of "occult" HBV sequences (5.9%) was detected in "anti-HBV alone" sera of individuals referred to the diagnostic laboratory without HCV antibodies. Direct sequencing of all PCR products confirmed the specificity of the PCR reactions and revealed the predominance of HBV genotype D. The data presented in this study suggest that detection of "anti-HBc alone" could reflect unrecognized "occult" HBV infection and that physicians should consider investigating such patients with HBV molecular tests.

### Long-term serologic follow-up of isolated hepatitis B core antibody in HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected women [^116vVziV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Isolated antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) is a common serologic finding in persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but the outcome and clinical significance are uncertain.

Methods

We performed repeated hepatitis B virus (HBV) serologic tests on women who participated in the Women's Interagency HIV Study and who had isolated anti-HBc at study entry.

Results

Repeated serologic tests were performed for 322 women (282 HIV-infected and 40 HIV-uninfected) at a median of 7.5 years after study entry. Seventy-one percent of women retained isolated anti-HBc serologic status, 20% acquired antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs), and 2% acquired hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). In unadjusted analysis, increasing age, injection drug use, and hepatitis C viremia were negatively associated with acquisition of anti-HBs. For HIV-infected women, predictors of acquisition of anti-HBs were an increase in CD4 cell count and the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Receipt of drugs with activity against HBV and self-reported HBV vaccination did not predict anti-HBs acquisition. In the multivariable regression model, HAART use remained a significant predictor of anti-HBs acquisition, whereas women with hepatitis C viremia were more likely to retain isolated anti-HBc serologic status.

Conclusions

Isolated anti-HBc status remained stable over time for the majority of women, especially women with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. Development of anti-HBs was predicted by HAART use and an increase in CD4 cell count. We conclude that a proportion of HIV-infected women with isolated anti-HBc have prior natural HBV infection with anti-HBs that is at an undetectable level because of immune dysfunction. Isolated anti-HBc in the presence of chronic hepatitis C virus infection may be attributable to a different phenomenon, such as dysfunctional antibody production.

AGA Clinical Practice Guideline on hepatitis B virus reactivation (HBVr) provides risk-stratified management and screening directives as follows: "The panel agreed on 4 recommendations". "Based on evidence and baseline risk assessment, the panel made a strong recommendation in favor of antiviral prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of HBVr". "For individuals at moderate risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of antiviral prophylaxis". "For individuals at low risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of monitoring alone without antiviral prophylaxis". "Monitoring should be performed at 1- to 3- month intervals, and must include assessment of hepatitis B viral load in addition to assessment of alanine aminotransferase". For screening, the panel issued "a strong recommendation in favor of testing for HBV, given universal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidance for hepatitis B for all adults 18 years and older by testing for HBV surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody; stratifying screening practices by magnitude of HBVr risk is no longer needed".

Clinical Considerations

Frequency of periodic testing should be a shared decision between the patient and provider and based on individual risk factors, including age and immune status. For periodic testing, providers should consider using the triple panel test or AASLD's testing strategies (e.g. anti-HBc followed by HBsAg and anti-HBs, if positive).

Having multiple sex partners can increase the risk for exposure to HBV and other STIs; however, evidence is insufficient to specify the number of sex partners and the optimal time frame for screening to identify cases of chronic infection. Thus, clinical judgment should be used to determine risk for exposure with consideration of the number of partners, type of sex, frequency of sex, and timing of the last serologic test when recommending testing for persons with multiple sex partners.

In the interest of completing adult HBV screening, prenatal visits are an opportunity to offer the triple panel to a pregnant person and link the patient to care or vaccinate as needed. Pregnant persons with a history of appropriately timed triple panel screening and without subsequent risk for exposure to HBV (i.e. no new HBV exposures since triple panel screening) only need HBsAg screening. Testing pregnant persons known to be chronically infected or immune enables documentation of the HBsAg test result during that pregnancy to ensure timely prophylaxis for exposed infants.

Universal screening complements a robust HepB vaccination program. Documentation of HepB vaccine administration in the medical record provides verification of vaccination. Per ACIP recommendations, providers should only accept dated records as evidence of HepB vaccination. For persons who are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated (e.g. did not complete a full series), HepB vaccine should be administered immediately after collection of the blood for serologic testing. Persons with evidence of active HBV infection (i.e. HBsAg positive) or a past HBV infection (i.e. total anti-HBc positive) do not need additional vaccine doses.

Persons with Isolated Core Antibody

Persons with isolated anti-HBc should have their immune status and risk history considered before deciding next steps. Links to performance characteristics on all FDA-approved total anti-HBc assays are available (Supplementary Table 21). The specificity of total anti-HBc tests is 99.8%. However, if a person does not have risk factors, the result might be a false positive; repeat testing with the same assay is warranted to confirm the results. A false-positive isolated core antibody result means the person is susceptible and should be offered HepB vaccine per current ACIP recommendations.

A 2001–2018 national survey found the prevalence of isolated positive anti-HBc to be 0.8% (approximately 2.1 million persons). Among patients exposed to HBV, an isolated positive anti-HBc result might be the result of loss of anti-HBs after past resolved infection, occult infection (i.e. HBsAg is negative, but HBV DNA is positive), being in the window period before appearance of anti-HBs, or an HBsAg mutant infection (i.e. an infection that is not picked up by an HBsAg test unable to detect mutants). Patients who are immunosuppressed should be considered at risk for HBV reactivation, and HBV DNA testing is recommended to assess for occult infection. Among infants, an isolated anti-HBc result might be a consequence of passive placental transfer from an HBsAg-positive mother, which is why testing for anti-HBc is not indicated before age 24 months.

Patient Education

Patient education should be conducted in a culturally sensitive, nonstigmatizing manner in the patient's primary language (both written and oral whenever possible). Bilingual, bicultural, and medically trained interpreters should be used when indicated.

Reporting

Acute and chronic cases of HBV infection should be reported to the appropriate state or local health jurisdiction in accordance with requirements. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists publishes case definitions for the classification of reportable cases of HBV infection. CDC has updated guidance for health departments on viral hepatitis surveillance and case management.

### Isolated hepatitis B core antibody is associated with HIV and ongoing but not resolved hepatitis C virus infection in a cohort of US women [^1135VXbZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

To characterize predictors of isolated hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and HIV-uninfected women, we compared 702 women with anti-HBc and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) with 490 women with isolated anti-HBc (1.8% of whom had detectable hepatitis B virus [HBV] DNA). Factors independently associated with isolated anti-HBc without viremia were detectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, HIV positivity, history of injection drug use, > 10 lifetime sex partners, and HIV RNA level > 100,000 copies/mL. Anti-HBs levels were lower among anti-HCV-positive women. Isolated anti-HBc was rarely explained by occult HBV in this cohort but may be explained by the influence of viral coinfections on anti-HBs level or durability.

Interpretation of Serologic Markers

Serologic markers for HBV infection include HBsAg, antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs), immunoglobulin class M (IgM) antibodies to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc), and immunoglobulin class G (IgG) anti-HBc (IgG anti-HBc). At least one serologic marker is present during the different phases of infection. HBV DNA is a measure of viral load and reflects viral replication (Table 1). Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) can be detected in persons with acute or chronic HBV infection; the presence of HBeAg correlates with viral replication and high infectivity; antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) correlates with the loss of replicating virus, although reversion to HBeAg positivity can occur.

After review of articles meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 articles were included (Supplementary Table 12). In 10 U.S. studies, the prevalence of current HBV infection (on the basis of HBsAg positivity, HBV DNA positivity, or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes) among persons with HCV infection ranged from 0.2% to 5.8% (median = 1.2%). Among persons with HCV infection, the prevalence of ever being exposed to HBV ranged from 24.7% to 62.6% (median = 43.0%); this finding was based on anti-HBc positivity, regardless of other HBV test results. Isolated anti-HBc positivity ranged from 36.9% to 53.8% (median = 39.5%) among patients with HCV infection.

HBV Reactivation During Direct-Acting Antiviral Therapy for HCV

FDA requires a boxed warning about the risk for HBV reactivation to be added to drug labels of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) medication for HCV infection. The boxed warning directs health care professionals to screen and monitor for HBV infection in all patients receiving DAA treatment.

In a published systematic review of HBV reactivation during DAA therapy among patients with HCV infection, the overall risk for HBV reactivation was 24% (95% CI = 19%–30%) in patients with untreated chronic HBV infection and 1.4% (95% CI = 0.8%–2.4%) in patients with resolved HBV infection. The risk for HBV reactivation–related hepatitis (i.e. symptomatic) was 9% (95% CI = 5%–16%) in patients with chronic HBV infection; HBV reactivation–related hepatitis did not occur in patients with resolved infection. Three of 1,621 patients with chronic HBV infection had a major clinical event related to the reactivation (liver decompensation or failure), but there were no deaths.

Four studies were published after the 2018 systematic review. In two national cohort studies of U.S. veterans with chronic HCV infection prescribed DAA therapy, HBV reactivation was rare (< 0.1%) and more frequent among patients who were HBsAg positive. Similarly, two other U.S.-based cohort studies of patients with HCV coinfected with HBV did not detect any cases of DAA-associated HBV reactivation.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis C virus infection, more specifically with respect to patients with HBV co-infection, AASLD/IDSA 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain HBsAg for assessment of active HBV coinfection and HBV core antibodies and HBV surface antibodies for assessment of prior infection in all patients initiating direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV infection.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1146p3dU]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) testing methods and confirmatory approach — The sensitivity and specificity of the lone FDA-approved point-of-care test are similar to laboratory-based assays, but a positive HCV-antibody test indicates current (active) HCV infection, a past resolved infection, or rarely a false-positive result, and a test to detect HCV viremia is necessary to confirm active HCV infection. Ideally, a positive HCV-antibody test automatically reflexes to HCV-RNA testing, which requires a single blood collection and avoids a return visit for confirmatory testing. Collection of dried blood spots is an option for sequential HCV-antibody and reflex HCV-RNA testing, and dried blood spot collection can be accomplished with a fingerstick rather than venepuncture and transport does not require an intact cold chain, making this advantageous where phlebotomy is a testing barrier. An FDA-approved quantitative or qualitative HCV-RNA assay should be used; immunocompromised persons and those with possible HCV exposure in the prior 6 months may be HCV antibody–negative, and HCV-RNA testing is a consideration for these individuals. If clarification is needed to differentiate resolved infection from biologic false positivity, repeat testing with a different HCV-antibody assay can be undertaken, and a false positive result is more likely when the anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio is low.

AGA Clinical Decision Support Tool: HBVr — evaluation begins with establishing baseline serology in at-risk individuals using suggested tests hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B core antibody, and HBV-DNA. Risk-based management recommends, for High Risk, "Recommend antiviral prophylaxis over monitoring alone (strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence)"; for Moderate Risk, "Suggest antiviral prophylaxis over monitoring alone (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence)"; and for Low Risk, "Suggest monitoring alone over using antiviral prophylaxis (conditional recommendation, low certainty evidence)". Glucocorticoid dosing definitions are "Glucocorticoids (prednisone or equivalent): low dose, < 10 mg; moderate dose, 10–20 mg; high dose, > 20 mg". Notes specify that "Antiviral prophylaxis should be started before the start of risk-imposing therapy and continued for at least 6 months after discontinuation of risk-imposing agents (at least 12 months for B cell-depleting agents)", that "Using anti-HBs status to guide antiviral prophylaxis for all-risk groups is not supported by the evidence", and that "The risk for HBV reactivation refers to the duration of the risk-imposing state or up to one year, unless otherwise noted; longer-term risk has higher uncertainty".

### A cautionary note to hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-negative test results in pregnant women in an area prevalent of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B [^111NEfNP]. Journal of Medical Virology (2023). Medium credibility.

The recent WHO 2020 guidelines recommend pregnant women testing positive for HBsAg with a high HBV DNA viral load (≥ 200 000 IU/ml or ≥ 5.3 log₁₀ IU/ml) receive antiviral (tenofovir) prophylaxis to prevent MTCT of HBV, in addition to the mandatory birth dose and three‐dose hepatitis B vaccination in all infants. In situations where HBV DNA testing is not available, HBeAg can be used as an alternative to determining eligibility for this peripartum prophylaxis, thus reducing the incidence of MTCT in low‐income settings.

The disease spectrum and natural history of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) are diverse and variable. It is recognized HBeAg as a reliable marker of HBV replication and infectivity. After acquiring the infection perinatally, CHB patients enter the immune‐tolerant (IT) phase in the initial few decades of life, with high levels of HBV DNA and positive HBeAg, but with minimal hepatic damage. In most individuals, successful immune clearance will lead to the low‐replicative (LR) phase, also known as the "inactive carrier" (IC) phase, which is characterized by seroconversion from HBeAg‐positive to HBeAg‐negative, with or without the appearance of antibody to HBeAg (anti‐HBe), suppression of HBV DNA, and normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. This phase confers a good prognosis with survival rates comparable to noninfected populations. Among some patients, for a yet uncertain reason, the immune pressure associated with seroconversion selects for HBV variants that express little or no HBeAg. Most of these patients harbor HBV variants in the precore (PC) and/or the basal core promoter (BCP) regions that impair or abolish HBeAg production. This phase, referred to as HBeAg‐negative chronic hepatitis B (e‐CHB), has continuing active HBV DNA replication with various grades of liver diseases manifested by variable ALT levels, with or without clinical and histological evidence of cirrhosis.

Interpretation of HBV serologies — test combinations map to infection status and assay caveats: For chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection the pattern across HBsAg, anti–hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), and anti–hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is "Chronic HBV infection + + −"; for past HBV infection, patterns are "Resolved − + +" and "Isolated core − + −". The legend clarifies "(+) refers to a reactive (or positive) test result; (−) refers to a nonreactive (or negative) test result". Testing guidance specifies "Anti-HBc should be total immunoglobulin (Ig) or IgG test (not IgM, which if positive would indicate acute HBV infection)", and assay performance/caveat notes "Although the sensitivity and specificity of the anti-HBc test exceeds 99%, positive anti-HBc test results may, in rare cases, indicate a false-positive result (eg, after administration of intravenous Ig). As such, clinical assessment and evaluation may be warranted".

Viral hepatitis and hepatitis A virus screening in HIV — Persons with HIV should be screened for evidence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection upon initiation of care by detection of HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), and antibody to hepatitis B total core antigen (anti-HBc or HBcAb), and if HBsAg is positive, HBV viral load should be ordered; persons with HIV should be screened for evidence of immunity to hepatitis A virus (HAV) with HAV immunoglobulin (IgG). Persons with HIV should be screened for HCV antibody upon initiation of care and, if positive, HCV RNA should be ordered to assess for active HCV infection; curative therapy should be offered to all who are diagnosed with active HCV. HCV RNA testing is indicated ≥ 12 weeks post- completion of anti-HCV treatment, HCV RNA should be used for screening if HCV infection within the last 6 months is suspected or there is a history of prior HCV infection that has cleared, and HCV RNA testing should be considered in persons with advanced immunosuppression (CD4 cell count < 200 cells/µL). Infants born to persons with HBV and/or HCV should be tested for HBV and HCV transmission, and persons who are not immune to HAV and HBV should be immunized according to current national guidelines.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection — diagnosis and screening in patients with HIV includes that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Preventive Services Taskforce, and the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) recommend screening patients with HIV infection for chronic HBV, and initial testing should include serologic testing for surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total), and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) (AII). In acute infection, HBsAg can be detected 4 weeks (range 1–9 weeks) after exposure and anti-HBc immunoglobulin M is usually detectable at the onset of symptoms. Chronic HBV infection is defined as persistent HBsAg detected on 2 occasions at least 6 months apart, and patients with chronic HBV infection should be further tested for HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA; active disease, which can be HBeAg-negative or HBeAg-positive, can be distinguished from inactive disease by the presence of serum HBV DNA and persistent or fluctuating alanine transaminase (ALT) elevations. Patients whose past infection has resolved are HBsAg-negative with positive anti-HBs and/or anti-HBc, although covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) may remain in hepatocyte nuclei, and with severe immune suppression a patient may become serum HBsAg-positive again with HBV viremia. The presence of an isolated anti-HBc test result usually signifies infection with HBV in the past with subsequent loss of anti-HBs and occurs in 7% to 19% of patients with HIV infection, and incidence of HBV viremia in patients with HIV infection and isolated anti-HBc ranges from 1% to 36%.

Future Directions

CDC will review these recommendations as new treatments, tests, epidemiology, HepB vaccination rates, and experience gained from implementation of these recommendations become available; recommendations will be revised as needed. The work group did not conduct a systematic review to reassess any of the groups at increased risk for HBV infection from the 2008 guidelines; future recommendations might modify the groups recommended for periodic testing. Additional data on the ideal frequency of periodic testing is needed. Continued collaboration with laboratories to bundle the three HBV tests (HBsAg, anti-HBs, and anti-HBc) would facilitate ordering the tests together as a triple panel. In addition, reporting a triple panel summary result will aid providers in correctly interpreting results. Finally, a better understanding of the prevalence of HDV in the United States is needed to inform recommendations for HDV screening among persons with HBV infection.

A lack of anti-HBc antibodies during chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a serological pattern that is rarely observed. In our series of 39 patients with such a confirmed profile, mutations within the precore/core gene were rarely found and the lack of antibody detection was mostly explained by concurrent immunosuppression and the low sensitivities of the serological assays.

### Prevention of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices [^112UtcaA]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A confirmed positive HBsAg result indicates current HBV infection, either acute or chronic. All HBsAg-positive persons are infectious. If HBsAg persists for > 6 months, spontaneous clearance is unlikely, and the infection is deemed chronic. HBV DNA can be detected prior to the detection of HBsAg in an infected person. Occult infection occurs when HBsAg is undetectable despite the presence of HBV DNA. Transient HBsAg positivity can occur up to 18 days following vaccination (up to 52 days among hemodialysis patients) and is clinically insignificant.

In acute HBV infection, anti-HBc (initially both IgM and IgG) appears 1–2 weeks after the appearance of HBsAg (Figure 2). IgM anti-HBc often becomes undetectable within 6 months, and IgG anti-HBc predominates and remains detectable for a lengthy period of time, often life-long. The presence of IgM anti-HBc is indicative of acute infection, while IgG anti-HBc indicates past infection. In persons who recover from HBV infection, HBsAg is eliminated from the blood and anti-HBs develops, typically within 3–4 months. The presence of anti-HBs is generally indicative of immunity to HBV infection. Anti-HBs also can be detected for 4–6 months following HBIG administration. Persons who recover from natural HBV infection are typically positive for both anti-HBs and anti-HBc, whereas persons who respond to HepB vaccine are positive only for anti-HBs. Approximately 0.5%–2% of persons with chronic infection spontaneously clear HBsAg yearly; anti-HBs will develop in the majority of these persons.

### Hepatitis A and B immunity and vaccination in chronic hepatitis B and C patients in a large United States cohort [^111pviM9]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Hepatitis A and B vaccines are effective in preventing superinfection and sequelae in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C. We describe immunity and vaccination against hepatitis A and B in chronic hepatitis patients from the US Chronic Hepatitis Cohort Study.

Methods

We identified chronic hepatitis B and C patients with healthcare utilization during 2006–2008 and 12 months of enrollment. We used electronic laboratory records to determine immunity and medical and billing records for vaccination history. Immunity against hepatitis A was defined by positive hepatitis A antibody or documented vaccination. Immunity against hepatitis B was defined as hepatitis B surface antibody level ≥ 10 mIU/mL or core antibody positive, or by documented vaccination.

Results

Among 1635 chronic hepatitis B patients, 978 (59.8%) were immune or vaccinated against hepatitis A, 122 (7.5%) had negative hepatitis A antibody tests, and 535 (32.7%) had no testing or vaccination record. Among 5328 chronic hepatitis C patients, 2998 (56.3%) were immune or vaccinated against hepatitis A, 659 (12.4%) had negative hepatitis A antibody tests, and 1671 (31.4%) had no testing or vaccination record. Additionally, 3150 (59.1%) chronic hepatitis C patients were immune or vaccinated against hepatitis B, 1003 (18.8%) had a negative test result, and 1175 (22.1%) were neither tested for nor vaccinated against hepatitis B.

Conclusions

Approximately 40% of chronic hepatitis B and C patients are susceptible to or have no documented immunity or vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B. Clinicians should consider antibody testing and vaccination for this vulnerable population.

### The significance of' anti-HBc only' in the clinical virology laboratory [^113WY1i6]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Isolated detection of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) in the absence of surface antigen (HBsAg) or antibody (anti-HBs) has been reported, particularly among individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The significance of this phenomenon is unknown and it is unclear whether all individuals with such serological pattern need further molecular investigations.

Objectives

To determine the prevalence of 'anti-HBc only' in samples referred to a clinical virology laboratory and to evaluate its significance and possible mechanisms.

Study Design

Samples identified as anti-HBc positive (389/4359, 8.9%) during an 11-month period were investigated for HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HCV and anti-HIV. 'Anti-HBc only' samples were tested for HBV DNA using a nested qualitative PCR. Viral loads were measured in samples with detectable HBV DNA and the DNA sequences were analysed.

Results

Of 379 samples with detectable anti-HBc, 155 (40.9%) were 'anti-HBc only'. HBV DNA was detected in 6/151 (4%), all of which had a viral load < 400 copies per ml. Anti-HIV was found in 50/151 (33.1%) and anti-HCV in 14/151 (9.3%). Of these, only one of the HIV infected patients had detectable HBV DNA. Phylogenetic analysis of the HBV surface gene from three patients showed a variety of genotypes (A, E and G). One sequence had a mutation in codon 144, which has previously been reported to give false negative HBsAg results.

Conclusions

'Anti-HBc only' is a common phenomenon in the clinical virology laboratory but only a small proportion of samples had detectable HBV DNA. The presence of HBsAg mutants with possible false negative HBsAg test result is of concern. Samples with 'anti-HBc only' could be used to monitor the emergence of these mutants.

### Should antihepatitis B virus core positive or antihepatitis C virus core positive subjects be accepted as organ donors for liver transplantation? [^115SCaA2]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2007). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of liver transplantation as a routine surgical procedure for the treatment of end-stage liver disease, there has been an increasing gap between the number of available grafts and the number of patients on the waiting list. This has led transplant centers to expand the donor pool by different means. One of them has been the introduction of living donor liver transplantation. Other strategies include using less than optimal allografts from deceased donors, the so-called marginal donors, which include the use of grafts from older subjects, livers with moderate amounts of steatosis, or from donors with markers of past or current infection with hepatitis viruses who have absent or minimal liver biochemical or histologic injury. In this review, we will focus on the current use of allografts from donors with antihepatitis B core antibody and/or antibodies against hepatitis C virus in cadaveric and living donor liver transplantation.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^111JH1PH]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of acute HCV infection — testing recommendations and timing: HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing are recommended when acute HCV infection is suspected due to known exposure, clinical presentation, or elevated aminotransferase levels. HCV RNA typically becomes reliably detectable within 2–3 weeks after exposure, whereas HCV antibody typically occurs 2–3 months after exposure, on average; therefore, the best laboratory evidence is a positive HCV-RNA test in the setting of a negative HCV-antibody test or a positive HCV-antibody test after a prior negative anti-HCV test. When there has been a discrete, known, or suspected exposure, baseline HCV-antibody and HCV-RNA testing should be performed within 48 hours of the exposure; if baseline testing is negative, repeat testing for HCV antibody and HCV RNA is recommended, with frequency tailored to objectives (e.g., monthly testing to identify and treat acute infection).

Guideline 5.3 – BBV infection: identification of patients for whom immunisation against HBV is not indicated

Hepatitis B vaccine is not indicated in patients who have current (Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive or HBV DNA positive) or confirmed past HBV infection. Presence of the anti HBc antibody in isolation should not be taken as confirmation of previous HBV infection. Patients identified to be core antibody positive who are at risk of reactivation of HBV (particularly immunosuppression) may need to be vaccinated and the case should be discussed with a local virologist. (2B).

Rationale

Although there is no documented harm associated with the administration of the HBV vaccine to patients with natural immunity, it is recommended that anti-HBc and anti-HBs antibodies should be checked prior to immunisation. Patients who have a positive anti HBs antibody and who have a detectable anti HBc usually have natural immunity to HBV and therefore may not need vaccination. However, detection of Hepatitis B core antibody should not be used in isolation to determine immunity or previous infection and these patients may still require vaccination.

The need for pre-immunisation screening for anti HBc to avoid unnecessary immunisation should be guided by the likelihood that an individual has been exposed to HBV or previous vaccine as a study in the USA suggests that pre-immunisation screening is cost-effective only in populations in which the prevalence of HBV infection exceeds 30%.

Hepatitis B core antibody detected reports can arise from many scenarios. (Table 5 - interpretation of HBV results prior to vaccination).
Recent receipt of blood products (core antibody is passively acquired and is a frequent finding in patients who have received blood, plasma, IVIg or similar in the last few weeks, testing a serum sample predating the blood products is required to determine patient status), (HBV vaccination will be required)
Occult infection: HBV DNA will be detected and Anti HBs antibody levels are usually low (HBV vaccination not required)
False positive: discussion with local virology team to determine if referral to reference lab can be helpful (HBV vaccination required)

Table 5
Interpretation of HBV results prior to vaccination (1B)

Although patients are routinely considered as having HBV transmission in the past and not infectious to others, there is an increasing evidence that these persons may replicate or may start to replicate under special circumstances (immunosuppression, cachexia). Any patient with confirmed past HBV infection who is going to be significantly immunosuppressed is at risk of reactivation and a pre-emptive management plan should be made with a Hepatitis B specialist.

### HBV and targeted synthetic (ts) DMARDs: what have we learned from bDMARDs and tsDMARDs? [^111Hd5K3]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

In these cases, the absence of HBsAg is couterbalanced by the presence of hepatitis B core antigen and by the presence of the immunological response anti-hepatitis B core antibody (HBc Ab) positivity. Detection of anti-hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) antibody, as a surrogate marker of OBI, is useful when an HBV DNA test is not available or when intermittent viraemia is suspected, but it should be kept in mind that a negative anti-HBc Ab, still with OBI, may occur. In fact, not all anti-HBc-positive subjects are HBV DNA positive, and the absence of an anti-HBc antibody does not completely exclude seronegative OBI.

Therefore, OBI can be classified into two groups, seropositive OB+ (80%–99% of the OBIs are anti-HBc and/or anti-hepatitis B surface (anti-HBs) positive) and seronegative OBI− (1%–20% are anti-HBc and anti-HBs negative), on the basis of the HBV antibody profile. In people with seropositive OBI, HBsAg may have become negative either following the resolution of acute hepatitis B or after decades of HBsAg-positive chronic HBV infection. Otherwise, people with seronegative OBI might have progressively lost the hepatitis B antibodies.

Why does this happen? Because in the liver, the episomal HBV cccDNA exists as a chromatinised viral minichromosome, and since hepatocytes have a very long half-life, this means that HBV infection, once initiated, may continue for life even if efficient immune control is achieved. In fact, cccDNA in OBI cases is fully replication competent and can reactivate. In the vast majority of cases, OBI does not appear to lead to any clinical sequelae, and so detection of HBV DNA in serum/plasma is not reasonable for all subjects who are anti-HBc positive and/or anti-HBs positive. Detection of HBV DNA should be reserved to patients with OBI receiving chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy, including the established and emerging new biological response modifiers. Indeed, if viraemic, they should be treated similarly to HBsAg-positive patients. Indeed a subset of people with OBI are infected with HBV S variants carrying mutations in the S gene ('S-escape' mutations), resulting in the production of modified HBsAg that is not recognised by some commercially available HBsAg assays. Circulating HBV DNA levels in these people may be comparable with those detected in HBsAg-positive individuals.

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and Web of Science databases for articles published in any language between Jan 1, 2010, and Aug 14, 2019. We included original articles and conference abstracts of any study design that reported the proportion of HBsAg-negative adults (aged ≥ 18 years) who are positive for HBV DNA (ie, people with occult HBV infection). The prevalence of occult HBV infection was pooled, using the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model, in the general population and specific groups defined by the type of study participants (blood donors; other low-risk populations; high-risk populations; and people with advanced chronic liver disease), and stratified by HBV endemicity in each country. We also assessed the performance of anti-HBc as an alternative biomarker to detect occult HBV infection. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42019115490.

Findings

305 of 3962 articles were eligible, allowing a meta-analysis of 140521993 individuals tested for HBV DNA. Overall, only two studies evaluated occult HBV infection in the general population, precluding unbiased global and regional estimates of occult HBV infection prevalence. In blood donors, occult HBV infection prevalence mirrored HBV endemicity: 0.06% (95% CI 0.00–0.26) in low-endemicity countries, 0.12% (0.04–0.23) in intermediate-endemicity countries, and 0.98% (0.44–1.72), in high-endemicity countries (p = 0.0012). In high-risk groups, occult HBV infection prevalence was substantial, irrespective of endemicity: 5.5% (95% CI 2.9–8.7) in low-endemicity countries, 5.2% (2.5–8.6) in intermediate-endemicity countries, and 12.0% (3.4–24.7) in high-endemicity countries. The pooled sensitivity of anti-HBc to identify occult HBV infection was 77% (95% CI 62–88) and its specificity was 76% (68–83).

Interpretation

A substantial proportion of people carry occult HBV infection, especially among high-risk groups across the globe and people living in highly endemic countries. Occult HBV infection should be part of the global viral hepatitis elimination strategy.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to indications for screening (before anticancer therapy), ASCO 2020 guidelines recommend to test for HBV with 3 tests (HBsAg, HBcAb total immunoglobulin or IgG, and HBsAb) before or at the beginning of treatment in all patients with cancer anticipating systemic anticancer therapy while not delaying initiation of treatment.

### Hepatitis C guidance 2019 update: American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases-Infectious Diseases Society of America recommendations for testing, managing, and treating hepatitis C virus infection [^1112Bw2z]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

HBV/HIV screening and immunization in HCV — Screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) with an FDA-approved hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) assay and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with an FDA-approved HIV-antigen/antibody test is recommended; persons who test positive for HBsAg require additional monitoring during HCV treatment due to HBV reactivation risk, and anti-HBV therapy is another consideration for these patients. For persons who test negative for HBsAg but positive for hepatitis B core antibodies (with or without hepatitis B surface antibodies) have resolved HBV infection, and no further workup or additional monitoring is needed. Primary prevention measures for persons without coinfection include counseling about how to avoid contracting HIV and HBV and immunization against HBV and hepatitis A virus (HAV) as needed, and the CDC also recommends pneumococcal vaccination for all persons with chronic liver disease.

Diagnosis

Diagnosis of acute or chronic HBV infection requires serologic testing (Table 5). Because HBsAg is present in both acute and chronic infection, presence of IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (IgM anti-HBc) is diagnostic of acute or recently acquired HBV infection. Antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) is produced after a resolved infection and is the only HBV antibody marker present after vaccination. The presence of HBsAg and anti-HBc, with a negative test for IgM anti-HBc, indicates chronic HBV infection. The presence of total anti-HBc alone might indicate acute, resolved, or chronic infection or a false-positive result.

* - = negative test result; + = positive test result.

† To ensure that an HBsAg-positive test result is not false positive, samples with repeatedly reactive HBsAg results should be tested with a neutralizing confirmatory test cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.

§ Persons positive for only anti-HBc are unlikely to be infectious, except under unusual circumstances involving direct percutaneous exposure to large quantities of blood (e.g. blood transfusion or organ transplantation) or mutant HBsAg-related infection.

Treatment

No specific therapy is available for persons with acute HBV infection; treatment is supportive. Persons with chronic HBV infection should be referred for evaluation to a provider experienced in managing such infections. Therapeutic agents approved by FDA for treatment of chronic HBV infection can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication and remission of liver disease.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the prevention and treatment of hepatitis B virus reactivation in at-risk individuals [^112pm5MH]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA HBV reactivation guideline — Recommendation 4 for individuals at potential risk of HBVr with future immunosuppression ("Strong recommendation, moderate certainty evidence") specifies that, given universal CDC screening, stratifying screening by HBVr risk is unnecessary and outlines initial testing steps: "Given universal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) screening guidance for hepatitis B for all adults aged ≥ 18 years by testing for HBsAg, anti-HBs, and total anti-HBc, stratifying screening practices by magnitude of HBVr risk is no longer needed". It also states, "It is reasonable to test initially for serologic markers alone (at minimum for HBsAg, anti-HBc) followed by viral load testing (HBV-DNA) if HBsAg and/or anti-HBc is positive".

### Prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Vd13E]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Despite an increasing number of occult HBV infection studies, the worldwide prevalence patterns of occult HBV infection remain unknown and its clinical relevance has been controversial. However, emerging evidence is shifting scientific opinion. There is increasing evidence that occult HBV infection is associated with advanced chronic liver disease, especially hepatocellular carcinoma, and that people with occult HBV infection can transmit HBV infection. In addition, an estimated 8–29% of recipients from blood donors with occult HBV infection are infected with HBV. These findings suggest that the role of occult HBV infection on global elimination targets might be highly underestimated, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), where HBV DNA measurement remains largely inaccessible, leading to undiagnosed occult HBV infection cases.

By contrast, antibody to HBV core antigen (anti-HBc), a marker of current or past HBV infection, is easier to detect using immunoassays and more accessible at a low cost in LMICs. Anti-HBc is often used as a surrogate marker to detect seropositive occult HBV infection (ie, occult HBV infection cases positive for anti-HBc), especially in blood banks in LMICs. However, the overall performance of anti-HBc to identify occult HBV infection cases has not been well investigated, and it is uncertain whether anti-HBc is a reliable alternative to HBV NAT to identify occult HBV infection.

The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to evaluate: (1) the global and regional prevalence of occult HBV infection on the basis of studies of the general population; (2) the occult HBV infection prevalence in subgroups defined by the type of study participants and by the HBV endemicity in each country; (3) whether the estimates vary with methodological differences, including the analytical sensitivity of HBsAg or HBV DNA assays used; and (4) the sensitivity and specificity of anti-HBc to detect occult HBV infection.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^111QCSP3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Hepatitis B — serologic dynamics, window period, and chronic infection markers: In acute infection, HBsAg appearance predates clinical symptoms by 4 weeks and remains detectable for 1–6 weeks; HBs antibody indicates recovery and immunity, and in most self-limited acute infections HBsAg and HBs antibody are not detectable simultaneously in serum or plasma. HBc IgM antibody appears during acute or recent infection and remains detectable for about six months, with a serologic "window" from 6 to 8 months after infection when HBsAg disappears and HBs antibody becomes undetectable, during which infection can be diagnosed by detecting HBc IgM. HBc total antibodies appear at symptom onset and persist for life. A chronic hepatitis B carrier state is defined by persistence of HBsAg for at least 6 months; in chronic hepatitis B, HBeAg in serum or plasma is a marker of high viral replication, and loss of HBeAg with emergence of HBe antibody is usually associated with improvement of underlying hepatitis and reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis; disappearance of HBeAg may denote a precore mutant virus when high HBsAg and HBV DNA are present with HBe antibody. HBV DNA is present in serum or plasma in acute and chronic infection, and quantification of HBV DNA in serum or plasma may be included in the initial evaluation and management of chronic hepatitis B infection, especially when serologic results are inconclusive or when deciding treatment initiation and monitoring patient's response; other molecular tests include viral genotype, genotypic drug resistance mutations, and core promoter/precore mutations.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the prevention and treatment of hepatitis B virus reactivation in at-risk individuals [^113jZw59]. Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Hepatitis B reactivation (HBVr) can occur due to a variety of immune-modulating exposures, including multiple drug classes and disease states. Antiviral prophylaxis can be effective in mitigating the risk of HBVr. In select cases, clinical monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis is sufficient for managing the risk of HBVr. This clinical practice guideline update aims to inform frontline health care practitioners by providing evidence-based practice recommendation for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals.

Methods

The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework was used to assess evidence and make recommendations. The panel conducted a systematic evidence review to identify new studies since publication of the first version of this clinical practice guideline in 2014. The Evidence to Decision framework was used to develop recommendations regarding the role of antiviral prophylaxis and monitoring without antiviral prophylaxis for management of HBVr. Clinical recommendations were based on the balance between desirable and undesirable effects, patient values, costs, and health equity considerations.

Results

The panel agreed on 4 recommendations. Based on evidence and baseline risk assessment, the panel made a strong recommendation in favor of antiviral prophylaxis for individuals at high risk of HBVr. For individuals at moderate risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of antiviral prophylaxis. For individuals at low risk of HBVr, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of monitoring alone without antiviral prophylaxis. Monitoring should be performed at 1- to 3-month intervals, and must include assessment of hepatitis B viral load in addition to assessment of alanine aminotransferase. For individuals deemed to be at-risk of HBVr, the panel agreed on a strong recommendation in favor of testing for HBV; given universal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention screening guidance for hepatitis B for all adults 18 years and older by testing for HBV surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, and total hepatitis B core antibody, stratifying screening practices by magnitude of HBVr risk is no longer needed.

Conclusions

This document provides updated guidance for the management of HBVr in at-risk individuals. Limitations and gaps in the evidence are highlighted. This guideline is expected to require updating in 5 years from publication.

### Hepatitis Delta virus propagation enabled by hepatitis C virus-scientifically intriguing, but is it relevant to clinical practice? [^1159tXJd]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2021). Medium credibility.

In vitro cell culture experiments and animal models have demonstrated that hepatitis delta virus (HDV) can theoretically propagate being enveloped by human pathogenic viruses other than hepatitis B virus (HBV), namely hepatitis C virus (HCV) and dengue virus. However, the clinical relevance of these findings and whether HDV replication occurs in real-world hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative HCV patient cohorts remain unknown. To this aim, we analysed 323 HCV-RNA-positive and HBsAg-negative sera for the presence of HDV-RNA and anti-HDV antibodies (anti-HDV). All 323 (100%) samples were negative for HDV-RNA. Interestingly, 8/316 samples tested positive for anti-HDV. The HBV serology of these eight patients showed a positive result for HBV core antibodies (anti-HBc) indicating a seroconversion of an acute HBV infection in the past. None of the anti-HBc-negative patients were positive for anti-HDV. Our results indicate a distinctly low probability of replicative HDV infection in HCV mono-infected patients in Germany. Current German clinical guidelines rightly recommend performing HDV screening only in HBsAg-positive patients. However, larger studies on this subject should be performed in regions that are endemic for chronic HBV/HDV as well as HCV infections.

### Safe use of livers from donors with positive hepatitis B core antibody [^114eLJ3h]. Liver Transplantation (2002). Low credibility.

Thirty-five patients received liver transplants using liver donors who had positive test results for the hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb). In the same time frame, 195 patients received HBcAb-negative liver donors. Mean follow up for patients receiving HBcAb-positive donors was 25 months. All patients receiving HBcAb-positive donors were monitored for recurrence of hepatitis B (HBV) with HBV DNA assays. There was no de novo HBV in recipients of HBcAb-negative grafts. In the group of patients receiving HBcAb-positive donors, 4 of 35 patients died within 3 months after transplant with no evidence of HBV recurrence at time of death. Four patients were transplanted for HBV-related disease and were postoperatively placed on lamivudine and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). HBV recurrence was seen in one of these patients. Of the remaining 27 patients, three of three mismatched patients (HBcAb-positive donor to HBcAb-negative recipient) developed de novo HBV (100%). Of 24 matched patients (HBcAb-positive donor to HBcAb-positive recipient), only two (7%) developed recurrent HBV allograft reinfection. All de novo and recurrent HBV infections were successfully managed with HBIG and lamivudine therapy. Survival for this subgroup of patients receiving HBcAb-positive donors for non-HBV-related liver disease was 100%. We conclude that the judicious use of HBcAb-positive donors is reasonably safe and associated with low morbidity and mortality, with the appropriate follow-up protocols. Additionally, lamivudine use can be reserved for those cases with de novo or recurrent HBV in the liver allograft, or, selectively, as prophylaxis in those recipients patients who are naïve to HBV and receive an HBcAb-positive donor.

Regarding specific circumstances for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to patients with HDV co-infection, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining reflex testing for anti-HDV antibody testing following a positive HBsAg test result and also for HDV RNA testing (where available) following a positive anti-HDV antibody test result as an additional strategy to promote diagnosis.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112nNYMu]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus/HIV coinfection — prior HBV exposure and reactivation: HBV reactivation has been reported in people with HIV and prior exposure to HBV (positive hepatitis B core antibody, negative HBsAg) when HBV-active agents are withdrawn as part of an ART regimen. Regardless of hepatitis B surface antibody level, people with HIV and prior HBV exposure are at low risk for reactivation and the associated hepatitis, which can result in serious hepatocellular injury. A monitoring strategy is considered a safe and effective way to assess HBV reactivation in low-risk people (BIII).

Antihepatitis B virus core-positive (hepatitis B surface antigen-negative) samples

Additional testing for anti-HBsAb was performed, and where anti-HBs was not detected at a level greater than 10 IU/l, the presence of anti-HBV core antibodies was confirmed using a second assay. Results were communicated to the requesting clinician either by telephone or by a secure e-mail, and a report was issued with the comment: 'Evidence of past, resolved hepatitis B virus infection. Potential for HBV reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy. Recommend referral to viral hepatology services'.

Where the presence of anti-HBc could not be confirmed, including testing of a repeat sample, the result was reported as indeterminate and where the index of suspicion of past HBV infection was very low, results were considered to be nonspecific and clinicians were advised to check for HBV markers if liver function tests became elevated during immunosuppression.

In some cases of positive and indeterminate anti-HBc results, it is deemed likely that the result was because of passively acquired antibodies from recently received blood products. Where possible, this is confirmed by testing of earlier and later samples. The pathway for managing patients with positive HBV serology is shown in Fig. 1.

The guideline was published on the hospital guidelines website and all hospital clinicians were advised of the policy by e-mail. In addition, six 30-min education sessions were conducted for clinical teams (consultants, junior doctors, nurse specialists and pharmacists) who regularly prescribe chemotherapy or immunosuppression, which specifically included all the major rituximab prescribers. Education sessions were a PowerPoint presentation delivered by S.M. or J.D. describing a case of HBV reactivation following rituximab therapy, explaining the clinical implications of HBV and summarizing the evidence on reactivation and rituximab use. A simple referral proforma for HBsAg-positive and anti-HBcAb-positive patients was developed to ease the process of referral to the viral hepatitis service.

### Screening and testing for hepatitis B virus infection: CDC recommendations-United States, 2023 [^116H1cHQ]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Persons with Resolved (Past) HBV Infection

Patients should be counseled about their history of HBV infection and risk for reactivation. Therapies with the highest risk for reactivation include B-cell depleting agents (e.g. rituximab and ofatumumab). American Society of Clinical Oncology and AASLD guidelines have more information on therapies and conditions associated with increased risk for reactivation, as well as recommendations for treatment. Antiviral therapy for HBV infection, when initiated before immunosuppressive or cytotoxic therapy, can prevent reactivation of disease. The systematic review indicated the prevalence of resolved HBV infection (i.e. HBsAg negative and anti-HBc positive) in the general population ranges from 4.8% to 14.0% (median = 6.2%). Notification, testing, and vaccination of household, sex partners, and needle-sharing contacts of patients with HBV infection or a history of HBV infection are recommended, as appropriate.

Persons Who Are Susceptible to HBV Infection

Persons who are susceptible to HBV infection should be told that they have never been infected with HBV and are not protected from future infection. All persons who are susceptible to infection should be offered HepB vaccine per ACIP recommendations. Anti-HBs concentrations can wane over time among vaccine responders. For persons with a clearly documented vaccination series who test negative for anti-HBs, refer to Prevention of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Vaccine should be offered to persons who have initiated, but not completed, the HepB vaccine series, regardless of anti-HBs status. HepB vaccine series completion is important for long-term immunogenicity.

Persons who are susceptible, refuse vaccination, and are at increased risk for HBV infection should be periodically tested. Frequency of periodic testing should be a shared decision between the patient and provider and be based on individual risk factors and immune status.

Persons Who Are Fully Vaccinated Against HBV Infection

Persons are considered fully vaccinated if they have completed a HepB vaccine series and can be reassured about protection against future illness. Vaccination status should be clearly documented in the medical record. Anti-HBs concentrations can wane over time among vaccine responders. For persons with a clearly documented vaccination series who test negative for anti-HBs, refer to Prevention of Hepatitis B Virus Infection in the United States: Recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for specific populations for whom revaccination might be recommended (e.g. patients on hemodialysis). Revaccination or booster doses are not routinely recommended for persons who are immunocompetent.

### Occult hepatitis B [^114VqU3m]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2002). Medium credibility.

Worldwide, chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is the primary cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and is one of the ten leading causes of death. Traditionally, people with chronic HBV infection have been identified with blood tests for HBV antigens and antibodies. Recently, another group of patients with chronic HBV infection has been identified by sensitive, molecular testing for HBV DNA. Members of this group are often referred to as having occult hepatitis B because they are HBV-DNA positive, but hepatitis B surface antigen negative. Occult hepatitis B occurs in a number of clinical settings. In this review, we examine occult hepatitis B in people co-infected with hepatitis C, in whom occult hepatitis B has been associated with advanced fibrosis and diminished response to interferon alpha. Although much more research is needed, existing reports justify a heightened awareness of the medical importance and means of testing for occult hepatitis B.

### Occult hepatitis B virus infection: a covert operation [^113okwYr]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2010). Low credibility.

Detection of occult hepatitis B requires assays of the highest sensitivity and specificity with a lower limit of detection of less than 10 IU/mL for hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and < 0.1 ng/mL for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). This covert condition is relatively common in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) that seems to exert some influence on the replicative capacity and latency of HBV. Detection of virus-specific nucleic acid does not always translate into infectivity, and the occurrence of primer-generated HBV DNA that is of partial genomic length in immunocompetent individuals who have significant levels of hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) may not be biologically relevant. Acute flares of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) that occur during the early phase of therapy for HCV or ALT levels that remain elevated at the end of therapy in biochemical nonresponders should prompt an assessment for occult hepatitis B. Similarly, the plasma from patients with chronic hepatitis C that is hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) positive (± anti-HBs at levels of < 100 mIU/mL) should be examined for HBV DNA with the most sensitive assay available. If a liver biopsy is available, immunostaining for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) should be contemplated and a portion of the sample tested for HBV DNA. This is another reason for optimal collection of a specimen (e.g. two passes with a 16-guage needle under ultrasound guidance). Transmission of HBV to immunosuppressed orthotopic liver transplant recipients by donors with occult hepatitis B (OHB) will continue to occupy the interests of the transplant hepatologist. As patients with OHB may have detectable HBV DNA in serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and/or liver that can be reactivated following immunosuppression or intensive cytotoxic chemotherapy, the patient needs to be either monitored or treated depending on the pretreatment serological results such as an isolated anti-HBc reaction or a detectable HBV DNA.

### Prevalence of occult hepatitis B virus infection in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11773vfj]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Search strategy and selection criteria

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched the MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and Web of Science databases for articles evaluating occult HBV infection prevalence published between Jan 1, 2010, and Aug 14, 2019, using the following search terms: "hepatitis B" AND "occult" AND "prevalence" (see the appendix [pp 2–3] for the full search strategy). We chose this search period due to the introduction of more sensitive assays for HBsAg and HBV DNA. Following duplicate removal, DL and KY screened each entry to identify articles meeting inclusion criteria.

We included original articles and conference abstracts of any study design from which we could calculate the occult HBV infection prevalence, without any language restriction. We defined occult HBV infection prevalence as the proportion of HBsAg-negative adults (age ≥ 18 years) who had a positive result at any level for HBV DNA by NAT on blood samples or liver tissue, regardless of anti-HBc status. A viral load threshold of less than 200 IU/mLwas not considered to define occult HBV infection, as most studies did not apply this cutoff. When acute window period infections (defined by detectable HBV DNA but undetectable HBsAg, which becomes detectable in later samples of the individual) were confirmed with subsequent samples from the same individual showing positivity for HBsAg, we excluded the individual or cohort. We included studies that systematically tested HBV DNA in people identified to be negative for HBsAg, irrespective of whether they had anti-HBc or antibodies against the HBV surface antigen (anti-HBs), and studies that tested HBV DNA in HBsAg-negative participants who were selected on the basis of anti-HBc or anti-HBs serostatus, or both. We excluded studies that only tested HBV DNA in less than 80% of HBsAg-negative individuals eligible for the occult HBV infection assessment without a clear explanation. We also excluded studies that included children or adolescents (aged < 18 years) or individuals receiving nucleoside or nucleotide analogues or interferon therapy. For any such studies, we included them only if the authors provided individual data. If occult HBV infection prevalence was reported in more than one cohort, either due to different assays used on the same study populations or when the study included distinct population types (eg, HIV-positive and HIV-negative people), separate data were extracted for distinct cohorts (referred to as separate studies hereafter). By applying these eligibility criteria, we included different types of studies that answer different questions: (1) studies evaluating HBV DNA in HBsAg-negative people to estimate the occult HBV infection prevalence, and (2) studies evaluating both HBV DNA and anti-HBc in HBsAg-negative people to compute the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of anti-HBc to indicate occult HBV infection.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116QAarU]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Hepatitis B virus infection — diagnosis and screening in adults and adolescents with HIV: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends testing all people over the age of 18, including those with HIV, for chronic HBV infection. Initial testing should include a triple screening panel for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc total), and anti-HBs. In acute infection, HBsAg can be detected 4 weeks (range 1–9 weeks) after exposure, and anti-HBc immunoglobulin M (IgM) is usually detectable at the onset of symptoms. See CDC's Clinical Testing and Diagnosis for Hepatitis B for information on how to interpret laboratory results.

### Hepatitis B core antibody positivity is not associated with risk of transaminase elevation following switch to dual antiretroviral therapy [^116DA3yB]. AIDS (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

The primary outcome measure was the time to grade ≥ 1 liver function test increase (LFTI), defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) level at least 1.25 times the upper limit of normal, in accordance with the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Pediatric Adverse Events. Specifically, the upper limits of normal used in our analyses were 41 IU/l for ALT and 40 IU/l for AST in men, and 33 IU/l for ALT and 32 IU/l for AST in women.

Secondary outcomes measures included time to grade ≥ 3 LFTI (i.e. more than five times the upper limit of normal), transaminase evolution over time after the switch and the rate of transaminase elevations during follow-up. Transaminase levels were typically measured every 4–6 months, in accordance with routine clinical practice. For the purpose of analysis, wherever necessary, values were grouped into 6-month intervals (± 90 days) to account for variability in follow-up timing and ensure comparability across participants.

### Predictors of the isolated hepatitis B core antibody pattern in HIV-infected and-uninfected men in the multicenter AIDS cohort study [^1166kCs3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The significance of hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) is unclear.

Methods

This cohort study included men enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort to determine clinical and laboratory predictors of isolated anti-HBc.

Results

A total of 2286 subjects (51% human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]-infected) were followed over 3.9 years. Overall, 16.9% (387) had at least 1 visit with isolated anti-HBc. The isolated anti-HBc pattern was stable 84% of the time, and transitioned to or from a pattern of past infection (anti-HBc and anti-HBs). Isolated anti-HBc was associated with HIV infection (odds ratio [OR], 2.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.73–2.79) and hepatitis C virus (HCV; OR, 4.21; 95% CI; 2.99–5.91). The HCV association was stronger for chronic HCV infection (OR, 6.76; 95% CI, 5.08–8.99) than for cleared HCV (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.83–5.03). HIV infection, chronic HCV, and cleared HCV infection all remained associated with isolated anti-HBc in multivariable models (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.33–2.29; OR, 6.24; 95% CI, 4.62–8.42; and OR, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.65–4.66, respectively). Among HIV-infected subjects, highly active antiretroviral therapy was negatively associated (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, .66-.95) with isolated anti-HBc.

Conclusions

Isolated anti-HBc is associated with HIV and HCV coinfection, especially active HCV replication, and most commonly occurs as a transition to or from the pattern of natural immunity (anti-HBc and anti-HBs). The isolated anti-HBc pattern likely represents resolved HBV infection with low or undetected anti-HBs.

### Positive hepatitis B virus core antibody in HIV infection – false positive or evidence of previous infection? [^115D6E5L]. Journal of Medical Virology (2015). Low credibility.

Isolated HBV core antibody (anti-HBc) is defined as the presence of anti-HBc with a negative HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs < 10IU/l). In patients infected with HIV with isolated anti-HBc, the aim was to determine: The prevalence of isolated positive anti-HBc; The most effective method of identifying which patients have had previous Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection; The prevalence of false positive anti-HBc. HBV serology results were identified from 539 patients infected with HIV sampled between January 2010 and December 2012. In those with an isolated anti-HBc and negative anti-HBe, a second anti-HBc test was carried out using a different assay. Samples were also screened for HBV DNA. The anti-retroviral regimens at time of screening were documented. 101/539 had an isolated anti-HBc. Of these, 32 (32%) had a positive anti-HBe (including 1 equivocal) and 69(68%) were anti-HBe negative. Of those negative for anti-HBe, 32 were tested for both DNA and a second anti-HBc. Of these 26 (81%) were on cART at time of HBV testing, with 25 (78%) on ART with anti-HBV activity. The prevalence of isolated anti-HBc was 19%. Only 32% were also anti-HBe positive, whereas 97% of those anti-HBe negative were positive on a second anti-HBc assay suggesting lack of utility of anti-HBe in resolving serological quandaries. One subject (3%) had a false positive anti-HBc. There was no evidence of chronic HBV but 78% patients were on HBV-suppressive combination anti-retroviral therapy.

### Hepatitis B surface antigen confirmatory testing for diagnosis of hepatitis B virus infection in Taiwan [^114hULPS]. Journal of Medical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

This study aimed to examine the application of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) confirmatory testing when diagnosing hepatitis B infection among young persons in Taiwan with a low prevalence rate of hepatitis B infection. HBsAg status, the presence of antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs), and the presence of antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) were compared among 403 graduate students (mean age 22.8 ± 0.7 years) and 1,745 undergraduate students (18.6 ± 1.0 years) from one university, and 367 adult subjects (41.1 ± 15.8 years) in 2008. Any HBsAg-positive subjects were tested with an HBsAg confirmatory test. Chi-square tests for trend and predictive values of positivity (PVP) when using HBsAg-positive only for determining confirmed cases of hepatitis B infection were compared across the three cohorts. The prevalence of HBsAg positivity among subjects decreased from 16.3% in the adults to 5.2% in the graduate students and then to 2.8% for the undergraduate students (P = 0.0007). The PVP of HBsAg testing when determining cases of hepatitis B decreased from 0.97 for the adults to 0.81 for the graduate students and then to 0.56 for the undergraduate students (P < 0.0001). Thus, a significant decrease in the true-positive rate of HBsAg among the students born after the introduction of hepatitis B vaccination was observed only when HBsAg testing was applied. Additional neutralization tests may therefore become mandatory for persons with a positive HBsAg test result who were born after the commencement of the universal neonatal hepatitis B vaccination program in Taiwan.

### The novel use of a routine quantitative system to analyze the activity, content and affinity of an antibody to hepatitis B core antigen [^114xm6DU]. Journal of Clinical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Currently, quantitative measurement of serum markers of HBV infection has been widely used, but commonly used analysis for specific antibodies only involves the measurement of the total antibody activity, and the binding affinity or protein content is rarely analyzed.

Objective

To investigate the detailed features of an antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) during different periods of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with a new method of analysis.

Study Design

Serum samples were collected from patients that were positive for the anti-HBc antibody. On the basis of the other serological markers in the samples, all patients were divided into a hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive group and an antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs)-positive group. All samples were diluted 2-, 20- and 200-fold. Anti-HBc quantification was measured with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay; total anti-HBc activity, protein content and affinity were calculated according to a measured value of each dilution. Serum HBV DNA load and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were also measured.

Results

The total anti-HBc activity in the HBsAg-positive group was statistically higher than that in the anti-HBs-positive group (p < 0.05). The anti-HBc protein content during active HBV infection was statistically higher than during the convalescence stage (p < 0.05), while anti-HBc affinity during HBV infection was lower than during recovery. There were correlations among total activity, affinity, protein content of anti-HBc, and ALT, HBV-DNA (p < 0.05).

Conclusions

It is potentially possible to predict the status of HBV infection by measuring total activity, protein content and affinity of anti-HBc.

### AASLD / IDSA practice guideline on treatment of chronic hepatitis B [^115Ukyvf]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Core concepts regarding chronic hepatitis B (CHB) phases and monitoring — Immune-tolerant is hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive with HBV DNA > 10,000,000 IU/mL and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) defined as < 35 U/L for males and < 25 U/L for females; HBeAg-positive immune active is HBeAg-positive with ALT elevated 2x upper limit of normal (ULN) or greater and HBV DNA > 20,000 IU/mL; HBeAg-negative immune active is HBeAg-negative with ALT elevated 2x ULN or greater and HBV DNA > 2000 IU/mL; inactive is HBeAg-negative with normal ALT and HBV DNA < 2000 IU/mL; and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-negative immune clearance has HBV DNA undetectable with ± antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs). As persons transition across phases over the lifetime of infection, regular monitoring is essential to identify when a change of management is indicated, including use of antiviral therapy.

### Isolated core antibody hepatitis B in sub-saharan African immigrants [^117DcHgA]. Journal of Medical Virology (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major health problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where prevalence is ≥ 8%, and is increasingly seen in African immigrants to developed countries. A retrospective audit of the medical records of 383 immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa attending the infectious diseases clinics at the Royal Melbourne Hospital was performed from 2003 to 2006. The HBV, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) serological results are reported, with a focus on the isolated core antibody HBV pattern (detection of anti-HBc without detection of HBsAg or anti-HBs). Two-thirds (118/174, 68%) of those tested had evidence of HBV infection with detectable anti-HBc. Chronic HBV infection (serum HBsAg detected) was identified in 38/174 (22%) and resolved HBV infection (both serum anti-HBs and anti-HBc detected) in 45/174 (26%). The isolated core antibody pattern was identified in 35/174 (20%), of whom only 1/35 (3%) had detectable serum HBV DNA on PCR testing, indicating occult chronic HBV (OCHB). Only 8/56 (14%) patients with negative anti-HBc had serological evidence of vaccination (serum anti-HBs detected). HIV infection was detected in 26/223 (12%). HCV antibodies were detected in 10/241 (4%), of whom 8 (80%) had detectable HCV RNA. Viral co-infection was detected in only 2/131 (1.5%) patients tested for all three viruses. The isolated core antibody HBV pattern was common among sub-Saharan African patients in our study. These patients require assessment for OCHB infection and monitoring for complications of HBV.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 69: hepatitis B in pregnancy: updated guidelines [^114YkDap]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

More than 290 million people worldwide, and almost 2 million people in the United States, are infected with hepatitis B virus, which can lead to chronic hepatitis B, a vaccine-preventable communicable disease. The prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection in pregnancy is estimated to be 0.7% to 0.9% in the United States, with > 25,000 infants born annually at risk for chronic infection due to perinatal transmission. Given the burden of disease associated with chronic hepatitis B infection, recent national guidance has expanded both the indications for screening for hepatitis B infection and immunity and the indications for vaccination. The purpose of this document is to aid clinicians caring for pregnant patients in screening for hepatitis B infection and immunity status, discuss the perinatal risks of hepatitis B infection in pregnancy, determine whether treatment is indicated for maternal or perinatal indications, and recommend hepatitis B vaccination among susceptible patients. The following are the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine recommendations: (1) we recommend triple-panel testing (hepatitis B surface antigen screening, antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen, and total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen) at the initial prenatal visit if not previously documented or known to have been performed (GRADE 1C); (2) we recommend universal hepatitis B surface antigen screening alone at the initial prenatal care visit for all pregnancies where there has been a previously documented negative triple-panel test (GRADE 1B); (3) we recommend that individuals with unknown hepatitis B surface antigen screening status be tested on any presentation for care in pregnancy; we also recommend that those with clinical hepatitis or those with risk factors for acute hepatitis B infection be tested at the time of admission to a birthing facility when delivery is anticipated (GRADE 1B); (4) we do not recommend altering routine intrapartum care in individuals chronically infected with hepatitis B; administration of neonatal immunoprophylaxis is standard of care in these situations (GRADE 1B); (5) we do not recommend cesarean delivery for the sole indication of reducing perinatal hepatitis B virus transmission (GRADE 1B); (6) we recommend that individuals with HBV infection can breastfeed as long as the infant has received immunoprophylaxis at birth (GRADE 1C); (7) we suggest individuals with hepatitis B infection who desire invasive testing may have the procedure performed after an informed discussion on risks and benefits in the context of shared decision-making and in the context of how testing will affect clinical care (GRADE 2C); (8) in individuals with hepatitis viral loads > 200,000 IU/mL (> 5.3 log₁₀ IU/mL), we recommend antiretroviral therapy with tenofovir (tenofovir alafenamide at 25 mg daily or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate at 300 mg daily) in the third trimester (initiated at 28–32 weeks of gestation) as an adjunctive strategy to immunoprophylaxis to reduce perinatal transmission (GRADE 1B); (9) we recommend administering hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobin within 12 hours of birth to all newborns of hepatitis B surface antigen-positive pregnant patients or those with unknown or undocumented hepatitis B surface antigen status, regardless of whether antiviral therapy has been given during the pregnancy to the pregnant patient (GRADE 1B); and (10) we recommend hepatitis B vaccination in pregnancy for all individuals without serologic evidence of immunity or documented history of vaccination (GRADE 1C).

### Isolated anti-HBc: the relevance of hepatitis B core antibody – A review of new issues [^113wAAku]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) is considered the most sensitive serological marker for history of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In a subset of anti-HBc carriers, anti-HBc is present in the absence of hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B surface antibody-a serological pattern known as "isolated anti-HBc" (IAHBc). IAHBc has been of clinical interest over the past several years, with growing data to suggest its role as a serological marker for occult HBV infection (OBI). This article reviews the clinical significance and association of IAHBc with hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection, risk of HBV reactivation during direct-acting antiviral therapy for HCV as well as immune suppression, and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Hepatitis B core-related antigen is also highlighted as an emerging laboratory assay that may identify OBI and predict HCC development in non-cirrhotic patients receiving nucleoside/nucleotide analog therapy.

### Hepatitis B [^111DvSXr]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

Isolated anti‑HBc interpretation — Some persons may test positive for anti‑HBc but not HBsAg or anti‑HBs, and isolated anti‑HBc can reflect different states: it may indicate chronic HBV infection with undetectable HBsAg but detectable HBV DNA (more so in the liver than in serum), it may be a marker of immunity after recovery with an anamnestic response after one dose of HBV vaccine, it may be a false‑positive particularly in low‑prevalence persons with no risk factors, or it may be the only marker during the window phase of acute hepatitis B where anti‑HBc IgM should be positive.

### Discrepant hepatitis B surface antigen results in pregnant women screened to identify hepatitis B virus infection [^114P8Rws]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To resolve discrepant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) results for pregnant women screened for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.

Study Design

A case was defined as discrepant HBsAg (reactive followed by non-reactive) result during the same pregnancy. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examined a convenience sample of cases passively reported by US Perinatal Hepatitis B Prevention Programs. Using a standard form, available results were obtained for hepatitis B tests and vaccination histories. Results were independently reviewed by 3 viral hepatitis experts and a clinical virologist to resolve discrepancies. The initial HBsAg result was classified as probable true positive, probable false positive, or unresolved.

Results

From April 2009-December 2011, 142 (75.9%) of 187 reported discrepant cases met the case definition. Of the 142 initial reactive HBsAg results, 113 (79.5%) were laboratory-confirmed, and 89 (62.7%) were resolved. Among these 89 cases, the initial test was a probable true positive in 14 (15.7%), and a false positive in 75 (84.3%). Total antibody to hepatitis B core antigen was positive for 11 (78.6%) of the true positive cases and negative for 67 (89.3%) of the false positive cases. True positives included 2 cases of resolving acute HBV infection and one case recently given hepatitis B vaccination.

Conclusions

In this retrospective analysis of discrepant HBsAg-reactive screening results from pregnant women, the majority were false positives, but true positives occurred. Testing for total hepatitis B core antibody, an indicator of past or current HBV infection, was useful for resolving discrepancies.

### Guidelines for the prevention, diagnosis, care and treatment for people with chronic hepatitis B infection [^113FEzZK]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2024). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for hepatitis B virus infection, more specifically with respect to monitoring of treatment response, WHO 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain HBV DNA nucleic acid testing (quantitative or qualitative) directly following a positive HBsAg serological test result as the preferred strategy to assess viral load level for monitoring treatment response.

### Hepatitis B [^111RHmR6]. IDSA (2009). Medium credibility.

Hepatitis B transmission and chronicity risk — HBV is transmitted by perinatal, percutaneous, and sexual exposure, as well as by close person-to-person contact, and HBV can survive outside the body for prolonged periods. The risk of developing chronic HBV infection after acute exposure ranges from 90% in newborns of HBeAg-positive mothers to 25% to 30% in infants and children under 5 and no less than 5% in adults, and immunosuppressed persons are more likely to develop chronic infection after acute infection. In settings such as the United States, the risk of transmitting HBV in daycare centers or schools is extremely low and HBsAg-positive children should not be isolated or prevented from participating in activities including sports. For screening, tests should include HBsAg and hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), and hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) can be utilized as long as those who test positive are further tested for both HBsAg and anti-HBs to differentiate infection from immunity.
