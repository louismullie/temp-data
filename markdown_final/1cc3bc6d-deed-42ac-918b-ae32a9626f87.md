## Question

What systemic conditions can cause elevated LFTs?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about systemic conditions that cause elevated liver function tests, organized by mechanism and with a practical evaluation framework. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and the core principle that "LFTs" are liver chemistries, not true function tests. Then, I should categorize systemic etiologies by mechanism: metabolic, infectious, cardiovascular, autoimmune, endocrine, hematologic, drug-induced, and malignancy-related. Next, I will map these to typical biochemical patterns to guide the workup. After that, I should outline a stepwise evaluation algorithm, including thresholds for urgency and when to image or biopsy. Finally, I will consider special populations and synthesize a concise, clinically usable summary with key takeaways anchored to guidelines and high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the foundational point: "liver function tests" are misnamed; ALT, AST, ALP, and bilirubin are liver chemistries that signal hepatocellular or cholestatic injury, whereas albumin, INR, and platelets better reflect synthetic function and fibrosis burden, so I need to avoid overinterpreting enzyme magnitude as a proxy for disease severity or prognosis without context [^111Zqb9T] [^112RBbyZ] [^117VSnab].

> I will now examine metabolic and nutritional contributors, since nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is the most common systemic cause of mild ALT/AST elevations; I should confirm risk factors such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance, and remember that "normal" ALT may be lower than many lab reference ranges, with true healthy ALT around 29–33 U/L in men and 19–25 U/L in women, so even modest elevations can be meaningful in the right phenotype [^112TeHbB] [^1155tM6b] [^112yo3Df].

> Wait, let me verify the alcohol-related piece: alcoholic liver disease often shows an AST:ALT ratio > 2, and GGT may be disproportionately elevated, but I should not jump to conclusions because GGT lacks specificity and can be elevated in diabetes, heart failure, and with medications; still, a high AST:ALT ratio in the right clinical context supports alcohol-related injury and warrants counseling and cessation support [^113zmXjm] [^116smHQK].

> Next, I should review infectious systemic causes; viral hepatitis remains common, but I must also consider COVID-19, where AST and ALT elevations occur in roughly 20–30% of hospitalized patients and correlate with severity and inflammatory burden, often reflecting systemic inflammation and hypoxia rather than direct viral cytotoxicity alone, so I need to interpret these in the context of CRP, ferritin, and clinical severity [^111oF6QC] [^116mgxHL] [^112Lsww8].

> Hold on, I should verify the cardiovascular contributors: right-sided heart failure and acute heart failure syndromes cause passive hepatic congestion and hypoperfusion, producing a cholestatic pattern with elevated ALP and bilirubin and sometimes transaminase surges in ischemic hepatopathy; recognizing this pattern prevents unnecessary hepatology workups and directs therapy toward hemodynamic optimization and heart failure management [^112XHkuB].

> I need to check autoimmune systemic diseases next; autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cholangitis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis can present with hepatocellular or cholestatic patterns, and I should remember that inflammatory bowel disease carries a notable risk of PSC, so unexplained cholestasis in IBD merits MRCP and autoimmune serologies, while Sjögren's syndrome and SLE can have subclinical liver involvement even without marked enzyme elevations, so I should maintain a low threshold for screening when systemic autoimmunity is present [^113JkQRa] [^1146qcAB] [^115pH8Zh].

> Let me consider endocrine disorders; both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can perturb liver enzymes, and thyroid testing belongs in the initial workup when the history or exam suggests thyroid disease, so I should add TSH early in unexplained mild transaminase elevations, especially with compatible symptoms or lipid abnormalities [^111AXKbt].

> I should double-check hematologic and oncologic systemic drivers: hemolysis elevates unconjugated bilirubin and can confound the picture, malignancy can cause cholestasis via infiltration or obstruction, and systemic inflammatory states modulate acute-phase proteins synthesized by the liver, altering albumin and impacting the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score; in these settings, liver test abnormalities often reflect systemic disease activity rather than primary hepatocellular injury [^112RBbyZ] [^112sRuv6].

> But wait, what if the pattern is drug-induced liver injury; I need to ensure a meticulous medication and supplement history because DILI is common and protean, with hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed patterns, and clinically significant DILI is often defined by AST/ALT > 5× ULN, ALP > 2× ULN, or bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dL with enzyme elevation; culprits include methotrexate, NSAIDs, antituberculous agents, antiretrovirals, and increasingly immune checkpoint inhibitors, so I should correlate temporally and dechallenge when possible [^113s1NHW] [^113aypz1] [^114MkkWd].

> Next, I should review how patterns guide the differential; a hepatocellular pattern with AST/ALT predominance suggests viral hepatitis, NAFLD/NASH, alcohol, ischemia, or autoimmune hepatitis, whereas a cholestatic pattern with ALP and GGT predominance points toward biliary obstruction, PBC, PSC, or hepatic congestion; isolated hyperbilirubinemia should be fractionated to distinguish unconjugated causes like Gilbert syndrome or hemolysis from conjugated causes like cholestasis or hepatocellular disease, and I should confirm hepatic origin of ALP with GGT or isoenzyme analysis when uncertain [^1155asMt] [^114Kk3U6] [^113Fviv2].

> I will now examine the evaluation algorithm; first, confirm the abnormality and repeat if mild and the patient is asymptomatic, because 16–30% of mild elevations resolve on retesting, but if persistent, proceed with a structured history, exam, and a standard liver etiology screen including hepatitis B/C serologies, iron studies, autoimmune markers, and right upper quadrant ultrasound; if ALP is elevated, confirm hepatic origin with GGT and image for obstruction or infiltrative disease, and if cholestatic with negative imaging, evaluate for PBC/PSC; if hepatocellular with negative initial screen, assess for NAFLD/NASH and metabolic comorbidities and consider noninvasive fibrosis risk scoring with FIB-4 or transient elastography to stratify risk [^116smHQK] [^113z2Ems] [^112TeHbB].

> Hold on, I should verify urgency thresholds; severe transaminase elevations, especially > 5× ULN, or any elevation with jaundice, coagulopathy, or encephalopathy warrant urgent evaluation for acute liver failure and potential transplant referral, and massive AST/ALT > 10,000 U/L should prompt consideration of ischemic hepatitis or toxic injury; in these scenarios, delay in escalation can be harmful, so I need to act promptly [^114WBWDB] [^112o4UP2].

> Let me consider special populations; in children and adolescents, NAFLD/MASLD is prevalent, so I should screen at-risk youth with annual ALT and use pediatric thresholds for concern, and if enzymes are persistently elevated, broaden to viral, autoimmune, and metabolic etiologies; in pregnancy, ALP rises physiologically and albumin falls, but I must promptly recognize pregnancy-specific liver diseases like HELLP and acute fatty liver; in older adults, I should maintain vigilance because presentation is often subtle and biopsy remains safe and informative when the etiology is unclear [^1162tkme] [^112KJXaG] [^115LahNR] [^114nec2p].

> I should confirm extrahepatic sources of AST/ALT when the pattern is discordant; AST is abundant in cardiac and skeletal muscle, so in the setting of myocardial injury, rhabdomyolysis, or inflammatory myopathies, creatine kinase and clinical correlation can prevent misattribution to liver disease, and the De Ritis ratio may help flag systemic mitochondrial injury patterns in sepsis or COVID-19 rather than pure hepatocellular disease [^113Fviv2] [^111YD3zf].

> Let me reconsider the key takeaways to ensure internal consistency: most persistent LFT abnormalities reflect NAFLD/NASH, alcohol, or viral hepatitis, but systemic diseases frequently contribute via metabolic dysregulation, immune mechanisms, hemodynamic effects, or drug toxicity; magnitude alone does not determine prognosis, so I must integrate pattern recognition, risk factors, and noninvasive fibrosis assessment to triage appropriately, reserving biopsy for unresolved diagnostic uncertainty or staging needs [^112TeHbB] [^117VSnab] [^113iKdyp].

Elevated liver function tests (LFTs) reflect **hepatocellular or cholestatic injury** and are not themselves diagnostic; interpretation must be guided by clinical context and pattern recognition [^1155Yms9]. The most common systemic causes are **metabolic syndrome and diabetes** (via NAFLD/NASH) [^114L1CMd], **alcohol use** [^112yo3Df], **viral hepatitis** (HBV, HCV) [^114L1CMd], and **drug-induced liver injury** (including NSAIDs, statins, antiepileptics, antibiotics, and biologics) [^113s1NHW]. Other important contributors include autoimmune hepatitis, hemochromatosis, Wilson disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, thyroid dysfunction, celiac disease, HIV, COVID-19, heart failure, and malignancy. Evaluation should follow a **stepwise approach** [^1155Yms9]: confirm the abnormality, assess risk factors, and order targeted labs and imaging [^115PkWRv]; management focuses on treating the underlying cause and avoiding hepatotoxins [^112o4UP2].

## Metabolic and endocrine disorders

- **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/metabolic syndrome**: Strongly associated with obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia; typically presents with mild ALT/AST elevations [^116mi66H].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Independent risk for NAFLD and NASH; persistent ALT/AST elevations warrant evaluation for steatotic liver disease [^117EiSdw].

- **Thyroid dysfunction**: Both hypo- and hyperthyroidism can cause mild transaminase elevations [^111AXKbt].

- **Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)**: Associated with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance, contributing to NAFLD and elevated LFTs [^1162DFko].

---

## Infectious diseases

- **Viral hepatitis**: HBV and HCV are common causes of chronic hepatocellular injury [^notfound].

- **HIV infection**: Multiple mechanisms, including ART hepatotoxicity, coinfections, and metabolic effects [^116CrpnV].

- **COVID-19**: Frequently causes mild ALT/AST elevations; severe cases may show AST-predominant injury and cholestasis [^111oF6QC] [^116mvcWW].

---

## Autoimmune and genetic disorders

- **Autoimmune hepatitis**: Persistent ALT/AST elevations with positive autoantibodies [^notfound].

- **Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)**: Cholestatic pattern with elevated ALP and positive antimitochondrial antibodies [^114sDDx7].

- **Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)**: Cholestatic pattern, often associated with IBD [^113JkQRa].

- **Hereditary hemochromatosis**: Iron overload causing hepatocellular injury [^1155asMt].

- **Wilson disease**: Copper accumulation causing hepatocellular injury [^1155asMt].

- **Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency**: Genetic disorder causing liver disease [^1155asMt].

---

## Cardiovascular and respiratory conditions

In cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, **heart failure** (right-sided or congestive) causes hepatic congestion and ischemia, leading to cholestatic or hepatocellular injury [^113Fviv2]. Hypoxia from respiratory failure or severe anemia can cause ischemic hepatitis with marked AST/ALT elevations [^114WBWDB].

---

## Hematological and oncological conditions

In hematological and oncological conditions, **hemolysis** elevates unconjugated bilirubin and can mimic hepatocellular injury [^112RBbyZ]. Malignancy may involve direct hepatic infiltration, metastasis, or paraneoplastic liver injury.

---

## Medications and toxins

- **Drug-induced liver injury (DILI)**: Common and diverse; includes NSAIDs, statins, antiepileptics, antibiotics, and biologics [^notfound].

- **Alcohol**: Causes alcoholic liver disease with characteristic AST:ALT ratio > 2 [^notfound].

- **Acetaminophen**: Can cause severe hepatocellular injury, especially in overdose [^114sDDx7].

---

## Nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders

Nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders include **celiac disease**, which is associated with mild transaminase elevations that often resolve on a gluten-free diet [^112yo3Df]. Malnutrition can alter liver enzyme levels and affect liver function [^notfound].

---

## Evaluation and management

Evaluation should **confirm the abnormality** and classify the pattern as hepatocellular, cholestatic, or mixed [^115PkWRv]. Management focuses on **treating the underlying cause**, avoiding hepatotoxins, and monitoring for complications [^112o4UP2].

---

Elevated LFTs reflect a wide range of systemic conditions; a **structured, context-aware approach** is essential for accurate diagnosis and management [^1155FJc1].

### Care of the patient with abnormal liver test results [^1155Yms9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Liver tests are commonly performed in primary care and may signal the presence of acute or chronic liver disease. Abnormal results are defined by standardized rather than individual laboratory thresholds and must be interpreted in the context of a patient's history and examination. The pattern and severity of liver injury may provide clues about the cause of disease and should guide diagnostic evaluation with serologic testing and liver imaging. A systematic, stepwise approach to the evaluation and management of abnormal liver test results is recommended to optimize high-value care.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® abnormal liver function tests [^112SbFyr]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver function tests are commonly obtained in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Various overlapping lab patterns can be seen due to derangement of hepatocytes and bile ducts function. Imaging tests are pursued to identify underlying etiology and guide management based on the lab results. Liver function tests may reveal mild, moderate, or severe hepatocellular predominance and can be seen in alcoholic and nonalcoholic liver disease, acute hepatitis, and acute liver injury due to other causes. Cholestatic pattern with elevated alkaline phosphatase with or without elevated γ-glutamyl transpeptidase can be seen with various causes of obstructive biliopathy. Acute or subacute cholestasis with conjugated or unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can be seen due to prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic causes. We discuss the initial and complementary imaging modalities to be used in clinical scenarios presenting with abnormal liver function tests. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Changes in liver function tests, congestion, and prognosis after acute Heart Failure: the STRONG-HF trial [^112XHkuB]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute heart failure (AHF) represents a clinical syndrome that engenders a cascade of systemic effects due to impaired cardiac function and the ensuing elevated left ventricular filling pressure. Central to these systemic manifestations is the impact of right-sided congestion of visceral organs, notably affecting the liver, spleen, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. The liver, in the setting of AHF, often exhibits deranged function as a consequence of passive congestion and hypoperfusion, which, in turn, can be detected and monitored through liver function tests (LFTs). These tests, which include markers such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (tBil), among others, serve as indirect indicators of the hemodynamic burden on the liver as well as the AHF's severity and progression.

Cachexia and sarcopenia are systemic conditions characterized by the loss of muscle mass with or without loss of fat mass. This is a feared complication in chronic diseases such as cancer and end-stage liver disease but has also been increasingly recognized in patients with HF as it severely affects patient quality of life, functional independence, and overall prognosis. Recent observations suggest a potential link between low levels of ALT and the presence of cachexia/sarcopenia, adding a layer of complexity to their role in evaluating patients with AHF. We therefore aimed to assess the association between LFTs and the clinical presentation, including congestion status, and outcomes in patients hospitalized for AHF in the STRONG-HF (Safety, Tolerability and efficacy of Rapid Optimization, helped by NT-proBNP testinG, of Heart Failure therapies) trial. We also aimed to assess trajectories of LFTs during rapid up-titration of HF guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) as compared to usual care (UC).

When should liver blood tests be checked?

There are a range of settings where requesting liver blood tests should be considered to determine the presence, or severity, of liver disease:

Non-specific symptoms

Liver disease tends to develop silently with no signs or symptoms, and there is evidence that the majority of people with late-stage liver disease are undiagnosed. However, inflammatory liver diseases including autoimmune liver disease and viral hepatitis can be associated with symptoms. For example, 75% of patients with AIH have one or more non-specific symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea or anorexia. These diseases can be effectively treated, and are often diagnosed late, so the presence of these non-specific symptoms would be an indication to check routine liver blood tests, accepting that there are many other causes for these symptoms.

Evidence of chronic liver disease

Patients with symptoms or signs of cirrhosis, portal hypertension or liver failure, including ascites, peripheral oedema, spider naevi and hepatosplenomegaly, need liver blood tests to monitor their function. In that regard the inclusion of INR is important to fully define their synthetic function.

Conditions which are associated with a high risk of developing liver disease

Autoimmune liver disease is more common in patients with pre-existing autoimmune diseases, and liver blood tests may be appropriate if clinical symptoms change to suggest development of liver disease — for example, pruritus in primary biliary cholangitis. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) have a particular notable risk of developing the autoimmune cholestatic liver disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis; disease prevalence is estimated at just under 10%. Primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease is associated with increased complications relating to liver disease, as well as increased colorectal cancer risk. Periodic monitoring of liver blood tests is therefore common practice, with a low clinical threshold for investigation of cholestatic liver blood tests by MRI. In the absence of currently approved medical therapy ongoing efforts clinically focus on early recognition of disease with subsequent risk stratification, in order to facilitate timely consideration of trial-based intervention.

### COVID-19 and liver injury: where do we stand? [^115fpMxt]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

At the end of 2019, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was identified as the cause of a severe acute respiratory syndrome (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19) in Wuhan, a city in the Hubei Province of China. It rapidly spread as an epidemic throughout China, finally resulting in a worldwide pandemic. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, up to 02 June 2020 a total of 6,245,352 cases of COVID-19 have been reported, including 376,427 deaths.

Pneumonia and respiratory failure appear to be the most frequent serious manifestations of COVID-19, while the spectrum of illness severity ranges from mild (most cases) to critical disease, with an overall case fatality rate of 2.3%. However, despite its "respiratory preference", COVID-19 can be recognized as a systemic disease with multiple organ involvement. In this context, recently published data have described abnormal liver function tests, mainly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), as the most common extrapulmonary finding in COVID-19 cases.

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels in the asymptomatic patient [^114h9YzH]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Mild elevations in liver chemistry tests such as alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase can reveal serious underlying conditions or have transient and benign etiologies. Potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. The history should be thorough, with special attention given to the use of medications, vitamins, herbs, drugs, and alcohol; family history; and any history of blood-product transfusions. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and thyroid disease, can cause or augment liver transaminase elevations. The recent American Gastroenterological Association guideline regarding the evaluation and management of abnormal liver chemistry tests proposes a practical, algorithmic approach when the history and physical examination do not reveal the cause. In addition to liver chemistries, an initial serologic evaluation includes a prothrombin time; albumin; complete blood count with platelets; hepatitis A, B, and C serologies; and iron studies. Depending on the etiology, management strategies may include cessation of alcohol use, attention to medications, control of diabetes, and modification of lifestyle factors such as obesity. If elevations persist after an appropriate period of observation, further testing may include ultrasonography and other serum studies. In some cases, biopsy may be indicated.

### A systematic review of the prevalence of mildly abnormal liver function tests and associated health outcomes [^114L1CMd]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Liver function tests (LFTs) are commonly performed to investigate asymptomatic individuals or those with nonspecific symptoms. Understanding the prevalence of mildly abnormal LFTs in the general population and the prevalence of liver disease following abnormal LFTs has important implications for the planning of care pathways and the provision of healthcare services. A systematic review of the literature on the prevalence of abnormal LFTs in the general population and their respective health outcomes was conducted. A total of 37 studies reporting data on the prevalence of abnormal LFTs (published between 2000 and 2014) were identified from online database searches or were manually selected from article bibliographies. The prevalence of mildly abnormal LFTs, with one or more abnormal constituents in the LFT, was high at 10–21.7%. The prevalence of severe liver disease within cohorts with abnormal LFTs is relatively low (< 5%), and a large proportion of abnormal LFTs remains unexplained. Among individuals with unexplained abnormal LFTs, risk factors include obesity and insulin resistance. Common aetiologies for abnormal LFTs were non-alcohol-related fatty liver disease (NAFLD), followed by alcohol use and viral infections. In addition, normal LFTs do not rule out liver disease. The prevalence of abnormal LFTs depends on the definition and population but is likely to be between 10 and 20% in the general population. Abnormal LFTs are associated with a range of health outcomes but are not necessarily strongly diagnostic of severe liver pathology. Important areas of future research include further studies on the prevalence and predictive ability of LFTs in large, population-representative samples.

### Alanine aminotransferase: a clinical and regulatory tool for detecting liver injury-past, present, and future [^116xdYTr]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Assay of the serum activity of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase (ALT) has become the primary screening tool for detecting acute liver injury. But what does an elevated value mean? Not what it is too often mistakenly believed to indicate. It is not a test of liver function. It does not necessarily predict worse effects to come (in a given person). It is not a valid measure of severity of liver injury or dysfunction. It is too unspecific to be reliable in screening for relatively rare effects on the liver. Although these are substantial limitations, ALT is a very useful biomarker if understood and used properly. It is important to consider how and why these erroneous concepts came to have such wide acceptance, and how elevations of ALT activity for evaluating patients and subjects under study might be interpreted better.

What constitutes a standard liver blood test panel?

There are remarkably few data to determine what an optimal liver blood test panel should include, although this would be influenced by the clinical setting. The Health Technology Assessment commissioned Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Testing Strategies (BALLETS) study reported that ALT and ALP identified the vast majority of adults with necro-inflammatory liver disease. The routine addition of GGT led to a marginal increase in sensitivity but at the cost of a loss of specificity and a higher false-positive rate. But the analysis did not include adults with NAFLD or alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD), which account for 90% of liver mortality, in whom liver blood tests and the follow-on liver aetiology screen are seldom diagnostic. In this setting GGT and AST would aid the sensitivity of detecting such patients. Addition of GGT to a liver blood test panel increases the likelihood of an adult having abnormal liver blood tests from around 15% to 30%and, notably, a raised GGT is associated with increased liver as well as all-cause (including cancer) mortality, with the greatest risk being observed in those with the most significant elevations of GGT. In addition, the routine addition of AST to the initial panel did not improve the detection of specific disease.

### Evaluation of abnormal liver tests in the adult asymptomatic patient [^112Rymzo]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Liver blood tests, including bilirubin, aminotransferases, and alkaline phosphatase, are among the most commonly encountered tests in medicine. With roles including the investigation of symptoms, medication monitoring, assessment of chronic disease, and routine assessment, these tests serve many purposes and result in abnormality in up to 40% of patients.

Recent Findings

The toll of liver disease continues to rise and abnormal liver tests offer an opportunity to identify hepatic disease early, when treatment is most effective and before patients suffer the potential downstream consequences of cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. By utilizing diagnostic strategies including detailed history gathering, alcohol use assessment, recognition of metabolic syndrome, and identifying patterns of liver test abnormalities, clinicians can develop a systematic approach to address abnormal liver tests. For these reasons, developing an evidence-based, systematic approach to handling abnormal liver tests is critically important.

Summary

This review seeks to synthesize key elements of the best evidence, presently available guidelines, and expert opinion in drafting a strategy to aid clinicians and patients in the timely and accurate diagnosis of liver disease for the adult asymptomatic patient with abnormal liver tests.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112RBbyZ]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

What constitutes a liver blood test?

Liver blood tests are readily available biochemical laboratory tests, with the standard panel varying from hospital to hospital. They have historically been referred to as LFTs, yet the predominant abnormality relates not to liver dysfunction, but to elevations of hepatobiliary liver enzymes. For this reason this guideline will refer to liver blood tests and not LFTs as it more accurately captures their usage in clinical practice. Hepatobiliary enzymes, when interpreted in isolation convey information on the level of ongoing injury, whereas bilirubin, albumin and INR convey information on liver function, with platelets conveying information on the level of fibrosis. In this guideline an abnormal liver blood test is defined as being a value outside the standard reference interval, although there is an emerging literature suggesting that the current reference intervals for ALT may be too high.

Bilirubin is predominantly the by-product of the breakdown of the haem component of haemoglobin by the reticuloendothelial system. It exists in two forms, unconjugated and conjugated. Bilirubin is transported to the liver in its insoluble unconjugated form, where it is converted into soluble conjugated bilirubin in order to be excreted. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is usually due to haemolysis or impaired conjugation whereas conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is typically due to parenchymal liver disease or obstruction of the biliary system.

Most laboratories will routinely report total bilirubin, which comprises unconjugated and conjugated fractions. Elevations of either fraction will therefore lead to a rise in the measured bilirubin concentration. The most common cause of an isolated elevated bilirubin concentration is Gilbert's syndrome, which is an inherited disorder of metabolism and leads to impaired conjugation via reduced activity of the enzyme glucuronyltransferase.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis with systemic nonbiologic therapies [^113aypz1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Methotrexate safety monitoring — liver and hepatotoxicity: Liver function test monitoring is recommended every 3 to 6 months when results are normal, and abnormal elevations should prompt a repeat laboratory check in 2 to 4 weeks. For persistent elevations, a gastrointestinal (GI) referral is recommended. For patients with risk factors for hepatotoxicity, it may be reasonable to consider an alternative therapy to methotrexate; if methotrexate is chosen, recommended hepatotoxicity monitoring is similar to that in low-risk individuals, except noninvasive hepatic specific serology should be performed at baseline and annually thereafter, irrespective of total cumulative dose.

### Joint American Academy of Dermatology-National Psoriasis Foundation guidelines of care for the management of psoriasis with systemic nonbiologic therapies [^1145anJ4]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). High credibility.

Liver function test (LFT) monitoring — patients on methotrexate without risk factors: monitor every 3–6 months assuming no abnormal lab results. For elevations < 3-fold the upper limit of normal, repeat in 2–4 wk. For elevations ≥ 3-fold the upper limit of normal, closely monitor, repeat 2–4 wk, and decrease dose as needed. For persistent elevation in liver enzymes during 12 mo period or a decline in the serum albumin below the normal range in a patient with normal nutritional status, a consultation with GI and/or liver biopsy should be considered.

### Clinical significance of elevated liver transaminases in HIV-infected patients [^116CrpnV]. AIDS (2019). Medium credibility.

Elevation of liver transaminases is common in patients infected with the HIV. Although this is usually an incidental finding during regular work-up, HIV-infected patients with transaminase elevations require additional visits for laboratory studies and clinical assessments, and often undergo interruptions and changes in antiretroviral therapy (ART). Alanine aminotransferase is present primarily in the liver, thus being a surrogate marker of hepatocellular injury. Aspartate aminotransferase is present in the liver and other organs, namely cardiac and skeletal muscle, kidney and brain. Serum levels of both liver transaminases predict liver-related mortality. Moreover, serum fibrosis biomarkers based on alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase predict all-cause mortality. In a busy clinical setting, a diagnostic approach to elevated liver transaminases could be complicated given the frequency and nonspecificity of this finding. Indeed, HIV-infected individuals present multiple risk factors for liver damage and chronic elevation of transaminases, including coinfection with hepatitis B and C viruses, alcohol abuse, hepatotoxicity due to ART, HIV itself and frequent metabolic comorbidities leading to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This review provides an update on epidemiology of elevated liver transaminases, summarizes the main etiologic contributors and discusses the prognostic significance and a pragmatic approach to this frequent finding in the clinical practice of HIV medicine. With the aging of the HIV-infected population following the successful implementation of ART in Western countries, liver-related conditions are now a major comorbidity in this setting. As such, clinicians should be aware of the frequency, clinical significance and diagnostic approach to elevated liver transaminases.

### Liver intensive care for the general intensivist [^1169WfcC]. Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Liver injury or failure is observed in up to 20% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit and is associated with poor prognosis. Timely recognition and initiation of appropriate management are the most important steps in minimising adverse outcome for patients. Distinguishing between primary or secondary liver failure, and between acute or chronic liver disease aids appropriate management. This can be challenging in cases of limited history and delayed or protracted presentation. Liver failure should be considered as a multisystem disease, with numerous systemic manifestations that must be considered to optimise supportive intensive care unit care. In this narrative review, we summarise an approach to patients with deranged liver biochemistry admitted to a general intensive care unit. We focus on interpretation of patterns of deranged liver biochemistry and the necessary investigations required to identify the related aetiologies. We also propose an evidence-based approach to the management of liver failure and its extrahepatic manifestations. This review, in addition, clarifies when to seek expert advice or refer patients to a tertiary centre.

### Elevated liver enzymes: emergency department-focused management [^111MfEZb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Liver function test (LFT) abnormalities are a common problem faced by emergency physicians. This has become more common with the introduction of laboratory panels and automated routine laboratory testing. Fortunately, not all patients with irregularities in liver enzymes possess underlying pathology. This emergency medicine focused review provides a discussion of the various biochemical tests, their underlying biological basis, and an algorithmic approach to the interpretation of abnormalities.

Objective

Our aim was to provide emergency physicians with an overview of the evaluation and management of patients with elevated LFTs.

Discussion

The liver is a complex organ with multiple roles. The key biochemical markers of hepatic function can be organized into the groupings of hepatocellular, cholestatic, or functioning liver, based on underlying enzymatic roles. Pathologic alterations to these markers can be algorithmically assessed by separating disease processes of these groupings, followed by assessment of the magnitude of enzymatic elevation. This review conducts an in-depth evaluation of the differential diagnosis and emergency department-centered clinical response of elevated LFTs based on subcategories of mild, moderate, and severe transaminase elevation.

Conclusions

By understanding the biochemical basis of each LFT, it is possible to correlate laboratory findings to a patient's clinical presentation. An algorithmic approach can be taken to help narrow the spectrum of a differential diagnosis. This may assist providers in ensuring appropriate management and evaluation of the patient with elevated LFTs.

Importance of context

Interpretation of abnormal liver blood tests requires an understanding of the context in which they arise. This can be illustrated in the extreme by a patient receiving statin therapy who has an ALT of 80 U/L, who is well and requires continued treatment with the statin compared with a patient with end-stage alcohol-related liver disease with an ALT in the normal reference interval at 30 U/L and who may have a life expectancy of weeks. A common assumption is that the detected abnormality represents the first presentation of abnormal LFTs, when it should be standard practice to review previous blood test records and past/current medical history before requesting additional investigations and referrals.

Another setting in which liver bloods are commonly abnormal but not necessarily of clinical concern is pregnancy where the alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin are often elevated and reduced, respectively. Other changes in liver bloods in this setting may indicate worsening of pre-existing disease or the development of pregnancy-related disease, which would warrant prompt investigation.

Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)

### Mildly elevated liver transaminase levels: causes and evaluation [^112yo3Df]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Mild, asymptomatic elevations (less than five times the upper limit of normal) of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase levels are common in primary care. It is estimated that approximately 10% of the U.S. population has elevated transaminase levels. An approach based on the prevalence of diseases that cause asymptomatic transaminase elevations can help clinicians efficiently identify common and serious liver disease. The most common causes of elevated transaminase levels are nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease. Uncommon causes include drug-induced liver injury, hepatitis B and C, and hereditary hemochromatosis. Rare causes include alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, and Wilson disease. Extrahepatic sources, such as thyroid disorders, celiac sprue, hemolysis, and muscle disorders, are also associated with mildly elevated transaminase levels. The initial evaluation should include an assessment for metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (i.e., waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting lipid level, and fasting glucose or A1C level); a complete blood count with platelets; measurement of serum albumin, iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; and hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis B surface antigen testing. The nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score and the alcoholic liver disease/nonalcoholic fatty liver disease index can be helpful in the evaluation of mildly elevated transaminase levels. If testing for common causes is consistent with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and is otherwise unremarkable, a trial of lifestyle modification is appropriate. If the elevation persists, hepatic ultrasonography and further testing for uncommon causes should be considered.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^116mi66H]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) presentation with abnormal liver chemistries highlights when to suspect the condition and typical enzyme patterns. NAFLD is a highly prevalent condition associated with the metabolic syndrome and should be strongly considered in individuals with mild elevations of AST/ALT levels. Unlike alcoholic liver disease, there is no unique pattern of elevation for ALT and AST levels; in general, ALT is higher than AST levels, and levels are rarely above 300 IU/l.

### Imaging of hepatic toxicity of systemic therapy in a tertiary cancer centre: chemotherapy, haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, molecular targeted therapies, and immune checkpoint inhibitors [^114Nfakz]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to familiarise radiologists with the spectrum of hepatic toxicity seen in the oncology setting, in view of the different systemic therapies used in cancer patients. Drug-induced liver injury can manifest in various forms, and anti-neoplastic agents are associated with different types of hepatotoxicity. Although chemotherapy-induced liver injury can present as hepatitis, steatosis, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, and chronic parenchymal damages, molecular targeted therapy-associated liver toxicity ranges from mild liver function test elevation to fulminant life-threatening acute liver failure. The recent arrival of immune checkpoint inhibitors in oncology has introduced a new range of immune-related adverse events, with differing mechanisms of liver toxicity and varied imaging presentation of liver injury. High-dose chemotherapy regimens for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation are associated with sinusoidal obstruction syndrome. Management of hepatic toxicity depends on the clinical scenario, the drug in use, and the severity of the findings. In this article, we will (1) present the most common types of oncological drugs associated with hepatic toxicity and associated liver injuries; (2) illustrate imaging findings of hepatic toxicities and the possible differential diagnosis; and (3) provide a guide for management of these conditions.

### Part I: liver function in oncology: biochemistry and beyond [^114CKtcL]. The Lancet: Oncology (2008). Medium credibility.

The liver has a key role in the metabolism (ie, inactivation or activation) of many commonly used anticancer agents-cytotoxics or new biological agents. Therefore, assessment of liver function is a fundamental part of initial work-up and management of patients with cancer. An understanding of the meaning of conventional serum biochemical testing of liver function and status, what variables they are measuring, and usefulness for chemotherapy dosing is essential. Emerging awareness of the drawbacks of conventional serum biochemical testing and further understanding of the intricacies of liver function is leading to the development of alternative strategies for appropriate chemotherapy regimens and dosing. We present an overview of assessment of liver function and chemotherapy dosing. We consider the use of serum liver biochemical testing to predict liver function, potential causes of biochemical abnormalities in patients with cancer, and chemotherapy drugs that are associated with hepatotoxicity. Part II will overview the current knowledge surrounding chemotherapy dosing in the setting of liver dysfunction; as well as alternative tests of hepatic metabolic function that are beginning to be used as strategies for appropriate individualised chemotherapy administration.

### ACG clinical guideline: evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries [^117MpALN]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinicians are required to assess abnormal liver chemistries on a daily basis. The most common liver chemistries ordered are serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin. These tests should be termed liver chemistries or liver tests. Hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT levels compared with alkaline phosphatase levels. Cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase level as compared with AST and ALT levels. The majority of bilirubin circulates as unconjugated bilirubin and an elevated conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or cholestasis. Multiple studies have demonstrated that the presence of an elevated ALT has been associated with increased liver-related mortality. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33IU/l for males, 19 to 25IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. The degree of elevation of ALT and or AST in the clinical setting helps guide the evaluation. The evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C, assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease, screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. In addition, a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For the evaluation of an alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be undertaken. Total bilirubin elevation can occur in either cholestatic or hepatocellular diseases. Elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

Extent of abnormality

It is assumed that the magnitude of derangement of a liver blood test panel correlates with prognosis, and for this reason threshold values above the upper limit of the reference interval are commonly used when directing the need for further investigation. However, this assumption is not supported by the literature, and prognosis is more clearly determined by diagnosis and context within which the tests are requested. To illustrate this consider two patients; a patient with an acute hepatitis A infection can have ALT values > 1000 U/L, whereas a patient with hepatitis C can have an ALT within the normal reference interval, yet 10 years later the patient with hepatitis A is likely to be alive and well irrespective of how they are managed, whereas the patient with hepatitis C if not investigated and diagnosed is at substantial risk of progressing to end-stage liver disease. Indeed, the the most common causes of abnormal liver blood tests leading to chronic liver disease — namely non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol-related liver disease and hepatitis C, are frequently associated with only mild or moderate liver blood test abnormalities. Therefore, despite the increasing use of liver blood tests, patients continue to present with undiagnosed end-stage liver disease, which might have been preventable by earlier diagnosis.

Moreover, the current upper limit of normal for many of the liver enzymes (for example ALT) may be too high, which is probably a consequence of patients with occult NAFLD being included in the generation of normal serum ALT ranges. This is perhaps best appreciated in patients with chronic hepatitis B, where treatment guidelines recommend an ALT of > 30 U/L as being significant in males and > 19 U/L significant for females. Further, indirect evidence for this comes from the recognition that in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis their fibrosis stage progresses despite apparent control of their inflammatory process via perceived normal aminotransferase levels. This is compounded by the knowledge that many patients with significant liver fibrosis may have liver enzymes in the normal reference range and normal synthetic function, increasing the difficulty of their early identification. Thus, the clinical assessment of such individuals is critical in determining what the question is (do they have fibrosis?), which tests should be ordered and how should they be interpreted.

Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)

### Circulating markers of liver function and cardiovascular disease risk [^112GFrQG]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

Measurement of serum concentrations of various liver enzymes and other nonenzymatic proteins and metabolites of heme metabolism (eg, bilirubin) is often undertaken in clinical practice. Measurement of these liver function tests is simple, quick, and relatively inexpensive. However, interpreting the liver function test results in patients without evidence of liver disease is often challenging. Concentrations of some of liver enzymes, such as γ-glutamyltransferase or alkaline phosphatase, and concentrations of liver-derived metabolites, such as bilirubin, may be influenced by metabolic processes beyond the liver, sometimes making interpretation of the test results difficult. This scenario frequently occurs both in individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease and in patients with known cardiovascular disease, often resulting in the clinicians ignoring the test results. In this brief review, we discuss the evidence for associations between key serum liver function tests and cardiovascular disease risk and where associations are robust; we provide an interpretation for possible mechanistic links between the liver function test and cardiovascular disease.

Introduction

While the number of deaths from other common conditions is falling in the UK, those due to liver disease have been increasing dramatically, with a 400% increase in the standardised mortality rate over the period 1970–2010. Notably, for those patients younger than 65, the rise in standardised mortality rate for liver disease is > 500%, such that it now constitutes the fifth biggest cause of premature mortalitywith 64 000 years of working life lost every year. For morbidity, in England and Wales, 57 682 hospital admissions and 10 948 deaths were due to liver disease in 20 12. This rising burden of liver disease is mainly a reflection of the three the most common causes: alcohol-related liver disease, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and viral hepatitis, although autoimmune liver disease is also a significant contributor. The burden of liver disease in children differs from that in adults, as although non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is seen in all ages, reflecting the rise in childhood obesity, disease associated with injecting drug use and alcohol are rarely encountered. However, viral hepatitis is seen as a consequence of perinatal transmission, and its chronicity contributes to the disease burden seen in adults. Other causes of liver disease, such as biliary atresia or metabolic disorders, present almost exclusively in infancy or childhood, but progressive liver disease continues to evolve throughout childhood and into adulthood. There are concerted efforts to deal with this rising tide of liver disease such as the Lancet Commission on Liver Disease, the Alcohol Health Alliance and the Obesity Health Alliance.

Liver disease develops silently; there may be no signs or symptoms until the complications of liver failure or portal hypertension develop. At this late, often pre-terminal stage, the tests of liver function — bilirubin, albumin, international normalised ratio (INR) and platelet count — may be abnormal. In necro-inflammatory hepatitic diseases liver enzymes are frequently elevated, whereas in apoptotic diseases including fatty liver disease (alcohol and non-alcohol related), liver enzymes may be normal or elevated, but the degree of abnormality is not related to the stage of progression from simple fatty liver, through progressive fibrosis to cirrhosis. Since the current liver blood tests were developed in the 1950s, they have been the mainstay of liver disease identification, with the result that many patients with liver disease are not identified until they have developed significant liver fibrosis.

Abnormal liver chemistries — bilirubin and cholestasis evaluation: In contrast to indirect hyperbilirubinemia, conjugated (direct) hyperbilirubinemia generally implies the presence of parenchymal liver damage or biliary obstruction. There are two rare inherited conditions associated with direct hyperbilirubinemia: Dubin–Johnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome. An elevated bilirubin should be evaluated by determining conjugated and unconjugated fractions of bilirubin. If there are signs of acute liver failure, urgent hepatology consultation with referral to a liver transplant center should be undertaken immediately. Those who present with an elevation in alkaline phosphatase with normal AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels should have their alkaline phosphatase elevation confirmed with a GGT level and if elevated a right upper quadrant ultrasound of the liver should be ordered. If the imaging is normal, autoimmune markers should be ordered. A liver biopsy may ultimately be required to obtain a diagnosis. Extrahepatic causes such as hemolysis should also be assessed.

### Diagnosis and management of hepatitis in patients on checkpoint blockade [^114MkkWd]. The Oncologist (2018). Low credibility.

Many human tumors are recognized by the adaptive immune system, but these spontaneous antitumor responses are typically inadequate to mediate regression. Blockade of immune regulatory "checkpoint" receptors such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 and programmed cell death 1 can unleash antitumor immunity, resulting in tumor responses that can be durable. Alongside the enormous promise of immunotherapy for cancer, the immune dysregulation of checkpoint blockade has led to a plethora of new autoimmune adverse events. Hepatic toxicity occurs in 1%-17% of patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors, with the precise incidence dependent on both the drug used and the underlying malignancy. Hepatitis is most commonly a low-grade toxicity, but grade 3 and 4 hepatotoxicity does occur. Here we will answer frequently asked questions regarding immune-related hepatitis to assist in the recognition and management of this important condition.

Key Points

Immune related hepatitis is a potentially serious complication of checkpoint blockade. The differential for elevated liver function tests in patients on checkpoint blockade is broad. Diagnostic testing such as viral serologies, liver ultrasound, cross sectional imaging, and liver biopsy may help in the diagnosis of immune related hepatitis in select patients. Patients with underlying cirrhosis are an at risk population for whom current grading criteria may underestimate the severity of liver inflammation. Severe immune related hepatitis is best managed by a multi-disciplinary team that includes a hepatologist. Most patients with immune related hepatitis respond to corticosteroids, but a substantial fraction require treatment with a secondary immunosuppressive agent.

Evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries — initial steps should confirm the abnormality and structure history and examination. Before initiation of evaluation of abnormal liver chemistries, one should repeat the lab panel and/or perform a clarifying test (e.g. GGT if serum alkaline phosphatase is elevated) to confirm that the liver chemistry is actually abnormal. The initial history should assess risk factors for liver diseases including viral hepatitis, metabolic liver disease, exposures to toxins, and medications including alcohol and complementary-alternative medicines, associated diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic diseases, pulmonary disease, and cardiac disease as well as hereditary forms of liver disease. In those who present with jaundice and abdominal pain, obtaining a history of prior hepatobiliary disease including gallstones and inflammatory bowel disease is recommended. The physical examination of a patient with abnormal liver tests is typically normal, but certain findings might help to confirm the presence of chronic liver disease including jaundice, ascites, splenomegaly, palmar erythema, spiders, and hepatic encephalopathy.

ACG Clinical Guideline — abnormal liver chemistries evaluation and interpretation states that serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin are the most common liver chemistries; hepatocellular injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of AST and ALT compared with alkaline phosphatase, whereas cholestatic injury is defined as disproportionate elevation of alkaline phosphatase as compared with AST and ALT. A true healthy normal ALT level ranges from 29 to 33 IU/l for males, 19 to 25 IU/l for females and levels above this should be assessed. Evaluation of hepatocellular injury includes testing for viral hepatitis A, B, and C; assessment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcoholic liver disease; screening for hereditary hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson's disease, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; and a history of prescribed and over-the-counter medicines should be sought. For alkaline phosphatase elevation determined to be of hepatic origin, testing for primary biliary cholangitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis should be pursued. Total bilirubin elevation can occur from hepatocellular or cholestatic diseases; elevated total serum bilirubin levels should be fractionated to direct and indirect bilirubin fractions, and an elevated serum conjugated bilirubin implies hepatocellular disease or biliary obstruction in most settings. A liver biopsy may be considered when serologic testing and imaging fails to elucidate a diagnosis, to stage a condition, or when multiple diagnoses are possible.

5.2 Acute Serious Liver Injury

Acute serious liver injury has been observed with ELEVIDYS. Administration of ELEVIDYS may result in elevations of liver enzymes (e.g. GGT, ALT) and total bilirubin, typically seen within 8 weeks.

Patients with preexisting liver impairment, chronic hepatic condition or acute liver disease (e.g., acute hepatic viral infection) may be at higher risk of acute serious liver injury. Postpone ELEVIDYS administration in patients with acute liver disease until resolved or controlled. Patients with hepatic impairment, acute liver disease, chronic hepatic condition or elevated GGT have not been studied in clinical trials with ELEVIDYS [see Specific Populations (8.6)].

In clinical studies, liver function test increased (including increases in GGT, GLDH, ALT, AST, or total bilirubin) was commonly reported typically within 8 weeks following ELEVIDYS infusion, with the majority of cases being asymptomatic [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Cases resolved spontaneously or with systemic corticosteroids and resolved without clinical sequelae within 2 months. No cases of liver failure were reported.

Prior to ELEVIDYS administration, perform liver enzyme test [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Monitor liver function (clinical exam, GGT, and total bilirubin) weekly for the first 3 months following ELEVIDYS infusion. Continue monitoring if clinically indicated, until results are unremarkable (normal clinical exam, GGT and total bilirubin levels return to near baseline levels) [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Systemic corticosteroid treatment is recommended for patients before and after ELEVIDYS infusion [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Adjust corticosteroid regimen when indicated [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. If acute serious liver injury is suspected, a consultation with a specialist is recommended.

### Liver enzyme elevations inVolunteer infection studies: findings and recommendations [^111akGkQ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract.

Malaria volunteer infection studies (VISs) accelerate new drug and vaccine development. In the induced blood-stage malaria (IBSM) model, volunteers are inoculated with erythrocytes infected with Plasmodium falciparum. Observations of elevated liver enzymes in the IBSM model with new chemical entities (NCEs) promoted an analysis of available data. Data were reviewed from eight IBSM studies of seven different NCEs, plus two studies with the registered antimalarial piperaquine conducted between June 2013 and January 2017 at QIMR Berghofer, Brisbane, Australia. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was elevated (> 2.5 times the upper limit of normal [×ULN]) in 20/114 (17.5%) participants. Of these, 8.9% (10/114) had moderate increases (> 2.5–5 × ULN), noted in seven studies of six different NCEs ± piperaquine or piperaquine alone, and 8.9% (10/114) had severe elevations (> 5 × ULN), occurring in six studies of six different NCEs ± piperaquine. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was elevated (> 2.5 × ULN) in 11.4% (13/114) of participants, across six of the 10 studies. Bilirubin was > 2 × ULN in one participant. Published data from other VIS models, using sporozoite inoculation by systemic administration or mosquito feeding, also showed moderate/severe liver enzyme elevations. In conclusion, liver enzyme elevations in IBSM studies are most likely multifactorial and could be caused by the model conditions, that is, malaria infection/parasite density and/or effective parasite clearance, or by participant-specific risk factors, acetaminophen administration, or direct hepatotoxicity of the test drug. We make recommendations that may mitigate the risk of liver enzyme elevations in future VISs and propose measures to assist their interpretation, should they occur.

### Subphenotypes and the De ritis ratio for mortality risk stratification in sepsis-associated acute liver injury: a retrospective cohort study [^111YD3zf]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although both the R-factor and serum transaminase levels provided valuable insights into the risk associated with SALI outcomes, they did not match the prognostic performance of the De Ritis ratio. Our analysis demonstrated that only the higher categories of the De Ritis ratio, R factor, or ALT were significant discriminators for 30-day mortality in both the derivation and validation cohorts. This suggests a more pronounced hepatic dysfunction, as indicated by elevated bilirubin concentrations and INR values. Another possible explanation is that patients with higher De Ritis ratio (R) categories, elevated R factor, or increased ALT may be particularly susceptible to extrahepatic complications, which could escalate into a harmful multi-organ crosstalk associated with SALI.

What distinguishes the De Ritis ratio from other stratification methods is inclusion of AST, an enzyme that reflects not only hepatocellular injury but also damage in muscle and cardiac tissue. This broader scope has allowed the De Ritis ratio to demonstrate strong prognostic performance in sepsis and COVID-19, independent of SALI. For instance, studies have demonstrated that an elevated De Ritis ratio is linked to poor outcomes in conditions like COVID-19 and trauma, underscoring its broader applicability as a prognostic marker beyond liver-specific conditions. The ratio effectively captures the balance between liver-specific injury and systemic sources of AST, correlating strongly with the severity of systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction that are typical in sepsis. Therefore, the predictive power of the De Ritis ratio is likely rooted in its emphasis on AST, which is also localized within the mitochondria. Mitochondrial dysfunction, a recognized hallmark of sepsis, is intimately associated with impaired energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and organ failure, all of which significantly contribute to increased mortality in septic patients. In summary, incorporating AST alongside ALT as the well-known De Ritis ratio positions it as a particularly suitable marker for effectively stratifying risk in patients with SALI. This approach allows for a comprehensive assessment that captures not only hepatocellular damage but also systemic and mitochondrial dysfunctions, which are crucial to the pathophysiology of sepsis and closely linked to increased mortality. Additionally, our data indicate that the magnitude of ALT/AST elevation may not be the most critical factor in risk assessment. Notably, a De Ritis ratio of 2 or higher was significantly associated with increased mortality risk, which appeared to be driven more by low ALT levels rather than elevated AST (see Table 2). In fact, our findings suggest that transaminase levels alone are not reliable for stratification, despite their current prominence in clinical practice for assessing disease severity. In contrast, the De Ritis ratio appears to offer a more precise and clinically relevant approach being able to reconcile current clinical practice. Furthermore, the De Ritis ratio's simplicity and accessibility make it a proper candidate for straightforward clinical use, particularly in critical care settings where rapid, informed decision-making is essential.

### Ketorolac tromethamine (Ketorolac) [^114xXsrk]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Ketorolac tromethamine cannot be expected to substitute for
corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation
of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged
corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is
made to discontinue corticosteroids.

The pharmacological activity of ketorolac tromethamine in reducing
inflammation may diminish the utility of this diagnostic sign in detecting
complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

Hepatic Effect

Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients
with impaired hepatic function or a history of liver disease. Borderline
elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking
NSAIDs including ketorolac tromethamine. These laboratory abnormalities may
progress, may remain unchanged or may be transient with continuing therapy.
Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit
of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials
with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including
jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some
of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.

A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom
an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the
development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with ketorolac
tromethamine. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease
develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.),
ketorolac tromethamine should be discontinued.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: a systematic review [^1171BpVY]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

MANAGEMENT OF LIVER INVOLVEMENT IN COVID-19

The majority of patients with COVID-19 have no or mild liver function abnormalities during the illness. In mild COVID-19, hepatic damage may be transient and generally returns to normal without any special measures. Thus, management is generally supportive with monitoring of LFTs. A summary of the liver management and recommendations are given in Table 4. –

Table 4
Management of liver disease in COVID-19

Diagnostic aspects.

Liver function tests and abdominal imaging are the primary investigations done in relation to liver involvement in COVID-19 patients. Liver biochemistry including the liver enzymes (ALT and AST), serum bilirubin, albumin, and PT should be monitored for diagnosing liver damage. However, the reasons for derangement of these blood tests are multifactorial and systemic inflammatory response because of COVID-19 may play a greater role than liver injury. Nevertheless, the liver tests should be performed during admission to establish a baseline and also to identify patients with suspected or known underlying liver disease. Further biochemical investigations may be needed in patients with known liver disease for example, known hepatitis B, C, and so on. The optimal interval for undertaking LFTs is uncertain. It has been suggested that LFTs be monitored at least twice weekly in COVID-19 patients receiving potential liver-toxic medications, whereas those with abnormal LFT results or with preexisting liver disease should be monitored more frequently. Increased serum AST and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with normal ALT levels should raise the suspicion of alternative diagnoses such as skeletal muscle or myocardial injury. Abnormal LFTs are frequently noted at admission before antiviral treatment of COVID-19 is commenced. Abnormal LFTs at the onset of a COVID-19 infection may indicate underlying chronic liver disease (CLD)and the treating physicians should take this into account. The imaging modalities include abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography scans. The imaging findings are nonspecific and are usually indicated when there is suspicion of portal venous thrombosis or biliary obstruction.

### Liver dysfunction in COVID-19: a useful prognostic marker of severe disease? [^111gVrPV]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Risk factors and prognostic markers of severe disease remain to be fully determined, although some studies have suggested a correlation between abnormal liver function and adverse outcomes. Further studies are needed to investigate this further.

Methods

This retrospective study enrolled patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who were admitted to Kingston Hospital in the UK. Data collected included age, sex, ethnicity, comorbidity profile, biochemical markers of liver function and the acute phase response, and overall outcome.

Results

Between 16 March 2020 and 30 April 2020, a total of 343 patients were admitted to the acute medical team at Kingston Hospital. Excluding those with a history of liver disease, 299 patients had liver function tests performed with abnormalities demonstrated in 44.8% of individuals. Derangement of liver function was associated with greater need for ventilatory support (p < 0.001), admission to high dependency unit or intensive care (p < 0.001) and increased length of hospital stay (p < 0.001). Of note, liver dysfunction was more common in those of non-white ethnicity (p = 0.007) and correlated with higher levels of C reactive protein (p = 0.01) and ferritin (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Abnormal liver function is associated with a negative outcome among those hospitalised with COVID-19. The cause for this association is unclear, but correlation between abnormal liver function and higher serum levels of acute phase proteins suggest that dysregulation of the immune system in response to SARS-CoV-2 may be contributory.

Response to abnormal liver blood tests: outcomes and pathways￼

As indicated in figure 1 the presence of unexplained clinical jaundice or suspicion of possible hepatic or biliary malignancy should lead to an immediate referral. In all other adults with incidentally raised liver enzymes it is important to take a careful history and perform a targeted clinical examination to look for the cause. Liver enzymes can occasionally be raised owing to intercurrent illness, although when liver blood tests were repeated, 84% of tests remained abnormal on retesting after 1 month, and even at 2 years 75% remained abnormal. Thus, in a patient with abnormal liver blood tests it is not recommended to simply repeat the same panel of tests but to determine the cause unless there is a high index of clinical suspicion that it is a transient finding. In children, there should be a low threshold for referral to a paediatrician for further investigation, as the most common causes of liver dysfunction in adults are less common in children, and there is a wider differential diagnosis.

Figure 1
Response to abnormal liver blood tests. This figure details the initial response to abnormal liver blood tests. Boxes in yellow indicate the initial evaluation of the clinical presentation. Patients with marked derangement of liver blood tests, synthetic failure and/or suspicious clinical symptoms/signs should be considered for urgent referral to secondary care (red box). For the remainder, a clinical history alongside evaluation of the pattern of liver blood test derangement will determine choice of pathway and is shown in the grey boxes. A grey box indicates all the tests that should be requested at that stage rather than a hierarchy within it. The presence of metabolic syndrome criteria should be sought to support a diagnosis of NAFLD. For children, the text should be consulted for modification of recommendation. Areas of diagnostic uncertainty are indicated in orange boxes and the decision for repeat testing or referral to secondary care will be influenced by the magnitude of enzyme elevation and clinical context. Green boxes indicate final/definitive outcomes for users of the pathway. *Abnormal USS may well include extrahepatic biliary obstruction due to malignancy, which should result in urgent referral.

### Nabumetone [^116qisWS]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

General: Nabumetone tablets cannot be expected to substitute for corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is made to discontinue corticosteroids.

The pharmacological activity of nabumetone tablets in reducing fever and inflammation may diminish the utility of these diagnostic signs in detecting complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

Hepatic Effects: Borderline elevations of 1 or more liver function tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking NSAIDs including nabumetone tablets. These laboratory abnormalities may progress, may remain unchanged, or may be transient with continuing therapy. Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some of them with fatal outcomes have been reported. A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with nabumetone tablets. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, reaction, etc.), nabumetone tablets should be discontinued.

### Vancomycin-induced elevation of liver enzyme levels [^1123b8xu]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of oral vancomycin-induced elevation of liver enzyme levels.

Case Summary

A 57-year-old man with multiple medical conditions requiring systemic antibiotic therapy developed numerous Clostridium difficile-associated enterocolitis episodes. The patient did not respond adequately to oral metronidazole, as evidenced by his continuing diarrhea. He was treated with oral vancomycin on 5 separate occasions (with doses from 125 to 500 mg/day), each of which resulted in significant elevations in alanine aminotransferase (to 371 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (to 203 U/L) levels. The elevations resolved on each occasion with discontinuation of vancomycin.

Discussion

Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, has primary activity against gram-positive bacteria. Oral vancomycin can be used for the treatment of C. difficile-associated enterocolitis in patients who fail to respond to or are intolerant to metronidazole therapy. Oral vancomycin has very poor bioavailability and, as of May 4, 2006, has not been associated with hepatic toxicity. Inflammatory bowel disease processes can result in increased absorption of oral vancomycin.

Conclusions

This is the first reported case of oral vancomycin-induced elevation of hepatic enzyme levels. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated that this was a probable adverse drug-associated event.

### The relationship between the presence and site of cancer, an inflammation-based prognostic score and biochemical parameters. initial results of the Glasgow inflammation outcome study [^112sRuv6]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Cancer incidence is increasing in the United Kingdom, as well as on a global basis. Over one in three people in the United Kingdom will develop cancer during their lifetime with around 150 000 people dying each year as a consequence. Such a burden of disease accounts for a significant proportion of annual healthcare spending in the United Kingdom, the United States and worldwide.

In the West of Scotland there has been a longstanding interest in the role of the systemic inflammatory response in determining outcome in cancer. Although it is recognized that the development of cancer has a genetic basis, there is increasing evidence that host inflammatory responses have a pivotal role in the development and progression of cancer. This is consistent with the hypothesis that chronic exposure to inflammatory processes, either through infection, social conditions or lifestyle, enhances the ageing process.

Recently, the presence of a systemic inflammatory response, as evidenced by an elevated C-reactive protein concentration sampled incidentally in a large hospital-based cohort, was associated with a shorter duration of cancer and non-cancer survival.reported a similar relationship in a systematic review of the prognostic value of albumin. These acute phase proteins, produced exclusively in the liver, have been shown to be a major factor in the progressive nutritional and functional decline of patients with cancer. Also, C-reactive protein and albumin concentrations have been combined to form the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS) and have been reported to be independently associated with reduced survival in patients with a variety of operable and inoperable cancers.

It is also of interest that liver function tests, such as bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase (Alk phos) and γ -glutamyl transferase (GGT), as well as serum calcium, have also been reported to predict cancer and non-cancer outcomes. There is also some evidence that liver function tests are altered as part of the systemic inflammatory response in patients with lung and gastrointestinal cancer.

Therefore, to definitively examine the interrelationships between the above biochemical parameters, the mGPS and the presence of cancer the Glasgow Inflammation Outcome Study was undertaken. The aim of this initial study was to examine the effect of cancer on markers of systemic inflammation induced by the liver (mGPS) and on levels of routine biochemical parameters (bilirubin, Alk phos, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), GGT and adjusted calcium).

### Tocilizumab (tocilizumab-anoh) [^116RfACf]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Elevated Liver Enzymes

Liver enzyme abnormalities are summarized in Table 1. In patients experiencing liver enzyme elevation, modification of treatment regimen, such as reduction in the dose of concomitant DMARD, interruption of tocilizumab-IV, or reduction in tocilizumab-IV dose, resulted in decrease or normalization of liver enzymes [see Dosage and Administration (2.10)]. These elevations were not associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin, nor were they associated with clinical evidence of hepatitis or hepatic insufficiency [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4)].

In the all-exposure population, the elevations in ALT and AST remained consistent with what was seen in the 24 week, controlled clinical trials.

In Study WA25204, of the 1538 patients with moderate to severe RA [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] and treated with tocilizumab, elevations in ALT or AST > 3 × ULN occurred in 5.3% and 2.2% patients, respectively. One serious event of drug induced hepatitis with hyperbilirubinemia was reported in association with tocilizumab.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113z2Ems]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Recommendations list

Recommendation 1: Initial investigation for potential liver disease should include bilirubin, albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), together with a full blood count if not already performed within the previous 12 months. (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 1: Further evidence is required to establish the cost-effectiveness of case finding for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in high-risk groups before it can be recommended. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 2: Abnormal liver blood test results should only be interpreted after review of the previous results, past medical history and current medical condition. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 3: The extent of liver blood test abnormality is not necessarily a guide to clinical significance. This is determined by the specific analyte which is abnormal (outside the reference range) and the clinical context. (level 5, grade D)
Recommendation 4: Patients with abnormal liver blood tests should be considered for investigation with a liver aetiology screen irrespective of level and duration of abnormality. Abnormal refers to an analyte which is outside the laboratory reference range (level 2b, grade B)
Recommendation 5: In adults a standard liver aetiology screen should include abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody (with follow-on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) if positive), anti-mitochondrial antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, antinuclear antibody, serum immunoglobulins, simultaneous serum ferritin and transferrin saturation. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 6: In children, ferritin and transferrin saturation may not be indicated, but autoantibody panel should include anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody and coeliac antibodies. Alpha-1-antitrypsin level and caeruloplasmin (age > 3 years) should be included, and abnormalities discussed with an appropriate inherited metabolic disease specialist. (level 2b, grade C)
Recommendation 7: Adults with NAFLD should undergo risk stratification to determine the extent of their liver fibrosis (figures 1 and 2). First-line testing should use either fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) or NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) – see table 3 (level 2b, grade B). Calculation facilities for FIB-4 and NFS should be incorporated in all primary care computer systems. (level 5, grade D) Second-line testing requires a quantitative assessment of fibrosis with tests such as serum enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) measurements or Fibroscan/acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) elastography. (level 2b, grade B) We recommend that hepatologists at a local level champion this idea and discuss it with commissioners of health to deal with the burden of liver disease in their area.
Recommendation 8: Consider referral to alcohol services for all adults with alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD) with evidence of alcohol dependency as defined by an AUDIT score of > 19. (level 3b, grade C)
Recommendation 9: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available). (level 2b, grade B)
Research Recommendation 2: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.
Recommendation 10: Adults with abnormal liver blood tests, even with a negative extended liver aetiology screen and no risk factors for NAFLD, should be referred/discussed to a gastroenterologist with an interest in liver disease/hepatologist for further evaluation (figure 1). (level 4, grade C)

### The liver in COVID-19: prevalence, patterns, predictors, and impact on outcomes of liver test abnormalities [^116mgxHL]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic unprecedented in over a century, with ≈35 million cases, and more than 1 million deaths globally. Though predominantly a lower respiratory illness, other organ injuries are well-recognized. Among these, liver injury is of major interest.

Objective

To define prevalence, pattern, predictors, and impact of liver injury among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Methods

Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were collected retrospectively among patients admitted to St. Luke's University Hospital with COVID-19 between 1 March and 18 April 2020. Association of liver tests (LTs) with mortality and need for mechanical ventilation, adjusted for demographic, clinical and biochemical predictors, was examined.

Results

Data were available on 551 patients. Prevalence of any or ≥ 3 × upper limit of normal transaminase elevation on was 61.2 and 9.4% on admission, and 72.1 and 22.4% at peak. Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase elevations were less common on admission (11.4 and 12.6%, respectively), and at peak (17.7 and 22%, respectively). All liver test (LT) elevations were consistently predicted by inflammatory markers. Hyperbilirubinemia predicted mortality on admission and at peak. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had opposite impact on mortality with AST positively, and ALT negatively associated with mortality. Hence, besides hyperbilirubinemia, AST:ALT ratio emerged as the best marker for mortality among the LTs.

Conclusion

LT elevations among patients presenting with COVID-19 are very common, though majority are mild. Admission and peak bilirubin ≥ 1 mg/dl, as well as admission and peak AST:ALT ratio were significant predictors of mortality, along with age, myocardial injury, and chronic medical illness.

### Genome-wide association study of serum liver enzymes implicates diverse metabolic and liver pathology [^111HEq2g]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Liver disease and its most serious complications of acute liver failure, cirrhosis, and liver cancer are leading and rising causes of mortality worldwide. Liver enzymes such as alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) are the most commonly-used laboratory indicators of liver disease and are increased in most common liver diseases. ALT and AST are traditionally considered markers of hepatocellular injury and ALP a marker of cholestasis. Liver enzyme elevations have been associated with greater liver-related mortality – and are used in clinical practice guidelines to direct treatment decisions in liver disease –. Beyond liver disease, the presence of elevated liver enzymes has been associated with increased all-cause mortality and risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.

Liver enzymes are partially genetically-determined, with heritability estimated around 0.5 based on twin studies. Previously-published exome- or genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of genetic variants influencing liver enzyme concentrations identified loci in/near genes affecting bile acid transport, lipid/carbohydrate metabolism, glycobiology, and the immune system. A more detailed understanding of genetic risk factors for liver enzymes may identify further mechanisms and pathways to yield deeper insight into the biology of liver diseases as well as identify those at high risk due to their genome. However, the existing studies on this topic utilized relatively small cohorts.

We aimed to further characterize the genetic architecture of liver disease with a GWAS to identify loci associated with ALT, AST, or ALP, using two cohorts with in total almost ten times as many participants than those of previously-published liver enzyme GWAS. In this work, we identify 378 loci associated with ALT, AST, and/or ALP at genome-wide significance. These loci are implicated in diverse metabolic and liver-related pathology, and are expressed in a wide range of cell types within the liver.

### Ketotolac tromethamine [^114mo5ge]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Ketorolac tromethamine cannot be expected to substitute for
corticosteroids or to treat corticosteroid insufficiency. Abrupt discontinuation
of corticosteroids may lead to disease exacerbation. Patients on prolonged
corticosteroid therapy should have their therapy tapered slowly if a decision is
made to discontinue corticosteroids.

The pharmacological activity of ketorolac tromethamine in reducing
inflammation may diminish the utility of this diagnostic sign in detecting
complications of presumed noninfectious, painful conditions.

Hepatic Effect

Ketorolac tromethamine should be used with caution in patients
with impaired hepatic function or a history of liver disease. Borderline
elevations of one or more liver tests may occur in up to 15% of patients taking
NSAIDs including ketorolac tromethamine. These laboratory abnormalities may
progress, may remain unchanged or may be transient with continuing therapy.
Notable elevations of ALT or AST (approximately 3 or more times the upper limit
of normal) have been reported in approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials
with NSAIDs. In addition, rare cases of severe hepatic reactions, including
jaundice and fatal fulminant hepatitis, liver necrosis and hepatic failure, some
of them with fatal outcomes have been reported.

A patient with symptoms and/or signs suggesting liver dysfunction, or in whom
an abnormal liver test has occurred, should be evaluated for evidence of the
development of a more severe hepatic reaction while on therapy with ketorolac
tromethamine. If clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease
develop, or if systemic manifestations occur (e.g., eosinophilia, rash, etc.),
ketorolac tromethamine should be discontinued.

### COVID-19 and liver injury: a meta-analysis [^111oF6QC]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Aims

The number of cases with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has exceeded seven million worldwide. However, the data describing the global prevalence of liver injury associated with COVID-19 is lacking secondary to the novelty of this ongoing pandemic. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine the association between COVID-19 and liver injury.

Methods

A systematic literature search of indexed databases including, PubMed, Medline, and Embase databases from inception to 14 April 2020, was used to identify studies that reported data of liver chemistry in patients diagnosed with COVID 19. The overall prevalence of abnormal liver chemistry and relevant 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the pooled results studies.

Results

Sixty-four studies with 11 245 patients with COVID-19 were included. The pattern of abnormal liver enzymes was notable for higher aspartate aminotransferase (AST) than alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The overall global prevalence of elevated AST, ALT, total bilirubin, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase was 23.2, 21.2, 9.7, 15.0, and 4.0%, respectively. The prevalence of elevated AST was substantially higher among those with severe cases (45.5%) compared to non-severe cases (15.0%). Co-existing chronic liver disease presented up to 37.6% of patients with COVID-19.

Conclusion

A fourth of COVID-19 patients had elevated liver enzymes and associated with disease severity. Our study may be used as a guide for clinicians and epidemiologists to proactively identify other sources of injury and illness in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. Intensive monitoring for liver injury may be needed in cases with severe COVID-19.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117C8yTD]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Except in the neonatal period, the majority of measurable bilirubin should be conjugated, even in individuals with significant liver disease. Hence if the majority of the elevated bilirubin comprises the unconjugated fraction then the cause, in the absence of haemolysis, is virtually always Gilbert's syndrome. As Gilbert's syndrome is not associated with liver disease or ill health, any such individuals should be fully reassured. In the neonatal period, there may be a physiological increase in total bilirubin, which is unconjugated. This may be pathological if high or prolonged. In neonates and infants in whom the conjugated bilirubin is > 25 μmol/L, referral to a paediatrician for urgent assessment of possible liver disease is essential.

Albumin is a protein that is produced only in the liver and has multiple biological actions, including maintenance of oncotic pressure, binding of other substances (such as fatty acids, bilirubin, thyroid hormone and drugs), metabolism of compounds, including lipids, and antioxidant properties. As albumin is only produced by the liver, the serum albumin concentration is often considered as a marker of the synthetic function of the liver. However, overinterpretation of the measured concentrations of albumin as a marker of the severity of liver disease is not always merited. Albumin concentrations are reduced in many clinical situations, including sepsis, systemic inflammatory disorders, nephrotic syndrome, malabsorption and gastrointestinal protein loss.

Evaluation of persistently elevated ALT in children — For children with persistently elevated ALT, perform a comprehensive evaluation to identify the underlying cause. Refer to Table 1 for detailed guidance on necessary tests, including viral hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and cardiometabolic disorders. Review all current and recent medications that may cause liver injury or contribute to hepatic steatosis. In adolescents aged 12 years and older, screen for substance use, including alcohol and recreational drugs, which can elevate ALT or contribute to steatosis, using validated questionnaires for youth. Consider inborn errors of metabolism if there are atypical signs or symptoms, such as early onset (particularly before 3 y of age), rapidly progressive or acute disease, absence of overweight/obesity, or additional involvement of other organ systems, particularly neurological signs or symptoms.

### The concept of rebalanced hemostasis in patients with liver disease: communication from the ISTH SSC working group on hemostatic management of patients with liver disease [^114EEzou]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia of liver disease is likely multifactorial, and the mechanisms involved include decreased platelet production by thrombopoietin deficiency and direct megakaryocyte toxicity, decreased platelet half‐life due to splenomegaly and hypersplenism, and possibly autoantibodies. 9 Although it has long been thought that platelet function was also impaired, more recent studies have suggested that platelet function in patients with liver disease is intact or perhaps even enhanced, recognizing the limitations of assays in earlier studies. 16 Specifically, platelet function testing is unreliable in samples with a reduced platelet count. Importantly, most platelet function tests capture only part of all platelet functions, and it is unclear which test best reflects the in vivo hemostatic capacity of platelets. In addition, it is likely that in vivo, the anemia of cirrhosis impairs platelet function given the role of red blood cells in the process of platelet margination.

Decreased hepatic synthesis is likely and largely responsible for the decrease in plasma levels of coagulation and fibrinolytic proteins although consumption of hemostatic proteins by low‐grade intrahepatic or systemic activation of the hemostatic system may contribute. 17 Similarly, consumption of platelets by intrahepatic or systemic platelet activation may contribute to the thrombocytopenia of liver disease. Evidence for activation of coagulation in the diseased liver is mainly derived from animal models in which liver injury leads to decryption of hepatocyte tissue factor, which drives local coagulation activation. 18 While the apparent procoagulant nature of the (activated) vascular endothelium, combined with elevations of activation markers of coagulation, may suggest low‐grade disseminated intravascular coagulation, elevation of these markers may also be explained by reduced clearance of these proteins by the diseased liver.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) — persistent abnormal liver enzyme tests are found in approximately 20% to 30% of individuals with IBD. In most cases the cause will fall into 1 of 3 main categories: extraintestinal manifestations of the disease process, medication toxicity, or an underlying primary hepatic disorder unrelated to IBD. This latter possibility is beyond the scope of this clinical report but does need to be considered in anyone with elevated liver enzyme levels.

### Loss of life expectancy by 10 years or more from elevated aspartate aminotransferase: finding aspartate aminotransferase a better mortality predictor for all-cause and liver-related than alanine aminotransferase [^116iCHjp]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) are 2 commonly ordered liver function tests, and ALT has long been considered more liver-specific than AST. Between the 2, the one which is better in predicting liver or non-liver-related mortality remains unsettled.

Methods

The cohort, 416,122 adults, came from a self-paying comprehensive health surveillance program during 1994–2008 and was followed up till 2008. Mortality came from National Death Index, with 10,412 deaths identified. Hazard ratios (HRs), computed by Cox model, and life expectancy, by life table method, were presented for 5 levels of AST and ALT with elevated AST or ALT defined as ≥ 40 IU/L. Liver disease included liver cancer and other liver conditions.

Results

There were 3 times more elevated ALT (15.4%) than AST (5.7%). However, those with elevated AST had higher mortality for all-cause (HR = 2.44), for liver disease (HR = 27.2), and for liver cancer (HR = 47.6) than its ALT counterparts (HR = 1.69, 10.8, and 20.2, respectively). Elevated AST also lost more years of life expectancy (10.2) than those lost by ALT (5.2) and larger than most common risks. Elevated AST had increased mortality from all cancers (HR = 3.57), stroke (HR = 1.36), respiratory diseases (HR = 1.34), and injuries (HR = 1.82), other than just liver disease. All-cause mortality remained significantly increased, when high risk groups were excluded, such as frequent drinkers, hepatitis carriers, those died from nonmedical conditions, those died in the first 3 years, or advanced fibrosis index based on 4 factors or aspartate transaminase-to-platelet ratio index. Results were consistent between those returned for second visits and those analyzed in initial visits.

Discussion

Those with elevated AST (≥ 40 IU/L) had life expectancy cut short by 10.2 years, doubled the number of years lost with elevated ALT. For all-cause and for liver-related mortality, AST was an important predictor, better than ALT.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^112XLmib]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Clinical pattern recognition for liver blood tests

There are three common patterns of abnormal liver test results whose recognition can aid diagnosis:
Isolated raised bilirubin — most commonly caused by Gilbert's syndrome (affects 5–8% of the population). Consider haemolysis in patients with anaemia. Repeat liver blood tests on a fasting sample with a full blood count and a direct and indirect bilirubin; the total bilirubin should rise further, owing to the indirect component, and there should be no evidence of anaemia. If the patient is anaemic, haemolysis needs to be excluded by requesting reticulocyte count/lactate dehydrogenase/haptoglobin. If the unconjugated bilirubin is more markedly elevated (> 40 μmol/L) then rarer causes such as Crigler-Najjar syndromeshould be considered and genetic testing undertaken.
Cholestatic — predominantly raised ALP and GGT indicate cholestasis. Common causes include primary biliary cholangitis, PSC, biliary obstruction (stones, strictures, neoplasia, etc), hepatic congestion and drug-induced liver injury. In children, additional disorders that may present with cholestasis include biliary tract abnormalities and genetic disorders of bile synthesis and excretion. However, an isolated raised ALP may be caused by vitamin D deficiency and not be liver related, or it may relate to raised values during periods of rapid growth in childhood, and thus the presence of a concomitantly elevated GGT can help confirm the cause of liver disease. In children with specific inherited disorders of bile acid synthesis and transport, however, GGT is characteristically low or normal. In these disorders, cholestasis occurs without GGT elevation.
Hepatitic — predominantly raised ALT and AST indicate hepatocellular liver injury (hepatitis). Common causes include viral hepatitis, NAFLD, ARLD, AIH and drug-induced liver injury. Details of the approach to these liver blood test abnormalities are given in the subsequent section on outcomes and pathways.

### Acute versus acute-on-chronic liver failure: comparative analysis of clinical outcomes in beijing, China [^112U6UTd]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Liver diseases affect more than 50% of the global population and are responsible for approximately 62.6% of deaths in the Asia Pacific region. Liver failure (LF) is characterized by the impaired function of multiple major organ systems, including the liver, coagulation system, central nervous system, kidneys, circulatory system, and respiratory system, accompanied by systemic inflammation. This condition may be precipitated by acute factors.

Acute liver failure (ALF) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) are the two primary forms of liver failure. Typically, both conditions are associated with a poor prognosis and pose substantial challenges globally, leading to high mortality rates and imposing significant societal burdens. ALF occurs in patients with a normal liver, while ACLF occurs in patients with or without a previous diagnosis of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Both conditions can potentially result in the development of sequential multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), thereby increasing the risk of mortality and adverse functional outcomes. This progression contributes to elevated short-term (28-day) mortality rates.

However, there are relatively few research related to these two types of liver failure. Furthermore, the strategies employed for managing organ failure in general critical care settings may not be entirely suitable for patients with liver failure. Early identification and effective management of liver failure and its associated complications can potentially improve patient outcome. This study aims to compare the occurrences of MODS and the prognoses of patients with two types of liver failure.

### Liver injury in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116YT6gE]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) infection is a global health threat. To inform the liver community on the potential relevance of COVID-19, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published data on liver injury in patients with COVID-19 infection.

Methods

We searched PubMed and Google Scholar through 22 March according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Pooled data were analyzed by using random-effects meta-analyses.

Results

A total of 14 studies combining data from 2.871 patients were identified. The prevalence of pre-existing liver disease was reported at 3.1%. The pooled prevalence of elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were 26% [95% confidence interval (CI), 20–32%] and 19% (95% CI, 14–26%), respectively. Only two studies reported the prevalence of elevated liver function tests according to normal ward versus ICU and here the frequency of elevated levels of AST was 50% and 62% versus ALT 40.8% and thus quantitatively higher in ICU-treated patients. Mean levels of absolute AST levels were 33U/L (95% CI, 30.21–36.09), while mean ALT levels were 31U/L (95% CI, 27.52–34.57). Cholestatic liver function tests were only incompletely reported in 510 patients. Here, mean levels of alkaline phosphatase were 71U/L across three studies, and mean levels of gamma-glutamyl transferase were 40.6U/L across four studies.

Conclusions

Emerging data on LFTs in COVID-19 are heterogeneous indicating mild LFTs involvement in every fourth to fifth patients with numerical more prevalent AST over ALT elevations. Prospective studies are needed to define the clinical relevance of liver injury in COVID-19.

### AASLD practice guidance on the clinical assessment and management of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^112TeHbB]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Initial evaluation of a patient with NAFLD states that patients with NAFLD are most commonly referred with incidentally noted hepatic steatosis on imaging or elevated liver chemistries; normal laboratory reference ranges may exceed what is appropriate for NAFLD, in which a true normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ranges from 29 to 33 U/L in men and from 19 to 25 U/L in women; initial evaluation should include screening for metabolic comorbidities, assessment of alcohol intake, exclusion of other causes of liver disease, and physical examination to identify signs of insulin resistance and advanced liver disease; and when the clinical profile is atypical or accompanied by additional signs or symptoms suggesting additional/alternate etiologies, less common causes of steatosis or steatohepatitis should be excluded.

### Traditional markers of excessive alcohol use [^113zmXjm]. Addiction (2003). Low credibility.

Aims

The blood tests used traditionally as markers of excessive drinking are the liver enzymes, gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and the red blood cell volume (mean corpuscular volume: MCV). Here we review the nature of these markers' association with alcohol use, their practical application in detecting, assessing or monitoring drinking and increases in understanding of these markers in the past 10 years.

Design

Articles were identified via Medline search and perusal of bibliographies.

Findings

The conventional markers have imperfect sensitivity and specificity, but have an added clinical role in the detection of complications of drinking, and of comorbid conditions that may increase risk of drinking. GGT may in part be a marker of the oxidative stress associated with ethanol metabolism. Markers are more likely to be elevated in those aged more than 30 years and in regular drinkers with a longer drinking history. The markers may be useful in opportunistic case finding, in motivating patients to change drinking and in monitoring treatment response. Increased prevalence of obesity and hepatitis C must be considered in interpretation of liver enzyme results. The liver enzymes are prognostic indicators for several medical conditions and for mortality.

Conclusions

These conventional tests are widely available and relatively inexpensive. While having limited sensitivity and specificity in detection of excessive drinking, they also provide valuable data on complications of drinking, comorbid conditions that may be affected by drinking and, in some cases, prognosis.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^113Fviv2]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is produced mainly in the liver (from the biliary epithelium) but is also found in abundance in bone and in smaller quantities in the intestines, kidneys and white blood cells. Levels are physiologically higher in childhood, associated with bone growth, and in pregnancy due to placental production. Pathologically increased levels occur mainly in bone disease (eg, metastatic bone disease and bone fractures) and cholestatic liver disease — for example, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, common bile duct obstruction, intrahepatic duct obstruction (metastases) and drug-induced cholestasis. Furthermore, hepatic congestion secondary to right-sided heart failure can also lead to cholestasis (elevated ALP levels and/or bilirubin).

When ALP is elevated in isolation, the measurement of γ-glutamyltransferase can indicate whether the ALP is of hepatic or non-hepatic origin. While there are no data on the most likely causes of an isolated raised ALP in an asymptomatic population, the the most common cause is likely to be vitamin D deficiency, or normal increase seen in childhood due to rapid growth. Other causes include Paget's disease and bony metastases. If doubt still exists, the use of electrophoresis to separate the isoenzymes of ALP can differentiate hepatic from non-hepatic causes of increased ALP.

AST and ALT are enzymes present in hepatocytes and are released into the blood stream in response to hepatocyte injury or death (hepatitis). Elevations in either of these enzymes are the the most common abnormality seen on liver blood test profiles. Both enzymes are present in many differing types of tissue, but ALT is considered more liver-specific since it is present in low concentrations in non-hepatic tissue, and non-liver related elevations are uncommon. However, AST is abundantly present in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle and so may be elevated in patients with myocardial infarction or myositis. Although ALT is considered a more specific indicator of liver disease, the concentration of AST may be a more sensitive indicator of liver injury in conditions such as alcohol-related liver disease and in some cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). In children, creatine kinase measurement may help to determine whether an isolated rise in ALT or AST is due to an underlying skeletal muscle disorder, such as muscular dystrophy.

### AASLD practice guidance on drug, herbal, and dietary supplement-induced liver injury [^113s1NHW]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Diagnostic approach to drug-induced liver injury (DILI) — DILI is largely a clinical diagnosis of exclusion, and initial laboratory testing includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total and direct bilirubin, with serum albumin and international normalized ratio (INR) as severity markers. Clinically significant DILI is commonly defined as any one of the following: serum AST or ALT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) or ALP > 2× ULN (or pretreatment baseline if baseline is abnormal) on two separate occasions at least 24 h apart; total serum bilirubin > 2.5 mg/dl with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP; or INR > 1.5 with elevated AST, ALT, or ALP. Although DILI can present with lower abnormalities, up to 20% of individuals in the general population have mildly increased liver biochemistries due to NAFLD, alcohol, and other common conditions.

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^1133f5Yq]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Liver blood or function tests (LFTs), which are perceived to be inexpensive, are checked ever more frequently in both primaryand secondary care in an attempt to exclude liver disease, for the monitoring of potential adverse effects of drugs on the liver such as statins, and for the investigation of the generally unwell patient. These tests often produce an abnormal result, the clinical significance of which is unclear. In many cases though they are requested in response to non-specific symptoms where there is little potential link between symptoms and likelihood of liver disease, or the blood tests are performed for unrelated reasons such as chronic disease monitoring. This commonly presages a cycle of additional liver blood test testing in an otherwise asymptomatic individual, and notably, most patients referred to hospital with abnormal liver tests do not have any evidence of significant liver disease. For example, University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust received 130 849 requests for liver blood tests in 2016, from 82 general practices and of these, 38 636 (30%) contained at least one abnormal result, defined as being outside the stated reference range. The Abnormal Liver Function Investigations Evaluation (ALFIE) study from Tayside in Scotland showed that over a 10-year period 25% of the community population aged over 16 had liver blood tests, with about a third having at least one abnormal value. Although an abnormal aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was predictive of liver disease (HR = 4.2), the rate of detection was remarkably low, with only 3.9% of those with an abnormal value being diagnosed with significant liver disease within 5 years of the test. Thus, used in isolation, liver blood tests are neither specific diagnostic tools nor specific exclusion tools, whereas they can be more effectively used to assess the extent of liver fibrosis if incorporated into algorithmsor used in conjunction with other modalities.

Laboratory Tests

Adults treated for tuberculosis with rifampin should have baseline measurements of hepatic enzymes, bilirubin, serum creatinine, a complete blood count, and a platelet count (or estimate). Baseline tests are unnecessary in pediatric patients unless a complicating condition is known or clinically suspected.

Patients should be seen at least monthly during therapy and should be specifically questioned concerning symptoms associated with adverse reactions. All patients with abnormalities should have follow-up, including laboratory testing, if necessary. Routine laboratory monitoring for toxicity in people with normal baseline measurements is generally not necessary.

Question 2: What is the next best step in diagnosis?
A. Patch testing
B. Blood arsenic levels
C. Blood, hair, and nail tests
D. Complete blood count with peripheral smear
E. Liver function tests

Answers:

A. Patch testing – Incorrect. Allergy patch testing diagnoses allergic contact dermatitis, not systemic conditions such as arsenicosis.
B. Blood arsenic levels – Incorrect. Relying solely on blood arsenic levels is inadequate for diagnosing arsenicosis, as there could be false negatives resulting from prolonged consumption of low amounts of arsenic.
C. Blood, hair, and nail tests – Correct. Measurement of arsenic levels in blood, hair, and nails can confirm chronic arsenic exposure, supporting the diagnosis of arsenicosis. Our patient underwent the same and had raised arsenic in all the samples. Hair analysis revealed an arsenic content of 0.29 μg/g (normal, < 0.08 μg/g), whereas nail arsenic levels were elevated at 4.56 μg/g (normal, 0.2–3.0 μg/g). Blood arsenic levels were also increased at 8.23 μg/dL (normal, 0.17–5 μg/dL).
D. Complete blood count with peripheral smear – Incorrect. A complete blood count may show nonspecific abnormalities but would not confirm arsenicosis.
E. Liver function tests – Incorrect. Although liver function tests may show abnormalities in arsenicosis, they do not directly measure arsenic levels in the body.

### Autoantibodies associated with primary biliary cholangitis are common among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus even in the absence of elevated liver enzymes [^115pH8Zh]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

In several autoimmune conditions, the relation between onset of disease and epitope spreading with increasing numbers of specificities preceding clinical diagnosis has been subject to intense research [43, 44, 45]. From our data, it is not possible to judge whether the observed AILD autoantibodies in SLE/pSS cases without established AILD or elevated liver enzymes: (i) will precede clinical liver disease, (ii) only reflect a B cell hyperactivity with a general tendency to produce autoantibodies targeting a broad repertoire or (iii) simply reflect an epiphenomenon. The relatively long follow‐up of most included patients does not support the first alternative. Conversely, their autoimmune disease could later have affected organ systems (i.e. renal involvement), which required potent immunosuppressive therapy targeting B cells that may have hindered the development of AILD [46]. To scrutinize this further and evaluate potential pathogenic roles of these AILD‐associated autoantibodies, special focus should include strength of autoantibody binding and glycosylation analysis of Fc portions [47, 48, 49, 50].

The study has some limitations that should be mentioned. During the review of medical records ALT and AST were the most frequently assessed liver enzymes, whereas results of ALP and GGT were less frequently available (approximately 70%). In addition, as our data are entirely observational, liver enzymes were analysed more frequently in individuals who were on regular treatment with immunosuppressants, had a suspected liver disease, experienced side‐effects from therapies or had multiple co‐morbidities. Subsequently, cases with mild pSS/SLE who presented with elevated liver enzymes were not assessed as frequently. Nevertheless, the well‐characterized patient cohorts with longitudinal laboratory data sets, combined with reliable autoantibody analyses from the accredited Clinical Immunology Routine Laboratory in Linköping, constitute major strengths.

To conclude, this study demonstrates presence of AILD‐associated autoantibodies in a considerable proportion of well‐characterized patients with pSS and SLE without established or laboratory signs of liver disease. We are not aware that PBC‐associated autoantibodies have been reported in a substantial percentage of cases with SLE previously. However, the association between autoantibody findings and AILD was poor, as no significant difference in liver enzymes was observed between autoantibody‐negative and ‐positive cases.

### Severity of liver test abnormalities in coronavirus disease 2019 depends on comorbidities and predicts early in-hospital mortality [^111ydZco]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Liver chemistry abnormalities (LCA) are common in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but their causes and clinical impact have not been adequately studied. We assessed the associations between LCA and clinical characteristics, inflammatory serum markers, in-hospital mortality.

Methods

Ten thousand eight hundred fifty-six adult patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in 13 hospitals in New York (1 March to 27 April 2020) were analyzed retrospectively. Abnormalities of liver chemistries [aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, or total bilirubin] were defined as absent, mild-moderate (at least one value up to four times elevated), or severe.

Results

LCA were mild-moderate in 63.9% and severe in 7.6% at admission. Risk factors for severe LCA were male sex and chronic liver disease. Conversely, hypertension and diabetes mellitus were less likely associated with severe LCA. AST elevation correlated weakly to modestly with inflammatory markers. On adjusted analysis, in-hospital mortality was 1.56 times and 1.87 times increased in patients with mild-to-moderate and severe LCA, respectively. Diabetes, hypertension, male sex, and age greater than 60 years was associated with incremental risk of mortality with increase severity of LCA, especially in the first week of hospitalization. HTN was not associated with increased in-hospital mortality unless LCA was present.

Conclusion

Increasing severity of LCA on hospital admission predicts early in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. Mortality associated with the known risk factors, hypertension, diabetes, male sex, and old age was accentuated in the presence of LCA. AST correlated modestly with inflammatory markers.

### The liver is a common non-exocrine target in primary Sjögren's syndrome: a retrospective review [^115ycdfq]. BMC Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

The autoimmune destruction of exocrine glands that defines primary Sjögren's syndrome (1 degrees SS) often extends to non-exocrine organs including the liver. We aimed to determine the prevalence of liver disease in patients with 1 degrees SS and to evaluate the association of this complication with other non-exocrine features and serologic markers of autoimmunity and systemic inflammation.

Methods

We reviewed 115 charts of patients with 1 degrees SS and further analyzed the 73 cases that fulfilled the European Epidemiology Center Criteria, seeking evidence for clinical and subclinical liver disease.

Results

Liver function tests had been determined in 59 of the 73 patients. Of those, 29 patients (49.1%) had abnormal liver function tests including 20.3% with clinically overt hepatic disease. Liver disease was the most common non-exocrine feature in this cohort. Risk factors for abnormal liver function tests were distributed similarly between the patients with and without liver disease. In 60% of patients with abnormal liver function tests no explanation for this complication was found except for 1 degrees SS. Liver involvement was significantly more common in 1 degrees SS patients who also had evidence of lung, kidney and hematological abnormalities. Patients with abnormal liver function tests were also more likely to have an elevated sedimentation rate and a positive anti-ENA during the course of their disease.

Conclusion

Liver involvement is a common complication in 1 degrees SS. Its presence correlates with systemic disease. We consider that this complication should be routinely sought in patients with 1 degrees SS, especially when a positive anti-ENA or evidence of systemic inflammation is found.

### Involvement of the liver in COVID-19: a systematic review [^116mvcWW]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). Medium credibility.

Elevation in aminotransferase levels.

The commonest liver test abnormalities reported are mild to moderate elevations in ALT and AST levels (seen in 14–53% of cases). Significant elevations of ALT and AST are commoner in those with other digestive symptoms. Raised liver aminotransferases are associated with significantly longer hospital stays. A multicenter retrospective cohort study of 5,771 adult COVID-19 patients found AST to increase initially followed by ALT. Aspartate transaminase abnormalities were associated with the highest risk of mortality. Although ALT is more specific to the liver, higher AST levels may be associated with injury to other organs or because of mitochondrial injury and should thus be interpreted with caution.

Elevations in bilirubin levels.

Elevated bilirubin levels are observed in 20–40% of patients and 10% had very high levels. Bilirubin levels are significantly higher in those with severe disease and are associated with a poorer prognosis. Most of the studies do not indicate whether the hypebilirubinemia is of the direct or indirect type. A study from Spain found a biphasic pattern of hyperbilirubinemia, initially hepatocellular and later cholestatic in type. This suggests that the elevation of bilirubin may be because of both direct hepatic injury and cholestasis. In addition to the increase in serum total bilirubin levels, raised conjugated bilirubin levels and conjugated to unconjugated bilirubin ratios were observed in COVID-19 patients. The high bilirubin levels may also be related to hemolysis. Further studies would delineate the predominant pathogenesis of elevated bilirubin levels in COVID-19.

Acitretin initiation and monitoring — baseline and follow-up testing are specified as follows: Patients should have a full history and physical examination before beginning acitretin, and baseline laboratory studies should include fasting cholesterol and triglycerides, renal and liver function tests, and pregnancy tests in women; if acitretin is used in women of child-bearing potential, baseline and monthly pregnancy testing is essential. After initiation of treatment, patients should be closely monitored to avoid serious adverse effects, and fasting lipid profile and liver enzyme testing should be performed monthly for the first 3 months and then every 3 months. Triglyceride-lowering medications, such as a fibrate, may be necessary for elevated lipid levels, and because patients with psoriasis have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, physicians should recommend lifestyle changes that reduce hyperlipidemia in patients taking acitretin.

### Liver function test abnormalities at hospital admission are associated with severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection: a prospective cohort study [^112Lsww8]. Gut (2021). Medium credibility.

Association of liver biochemistry abnormalities at admission with severe COVID-19

COVID-19 patients who required ICU treatment showed significantly higher baseline levels of AST, ALT, GGT and TBIL (p < 0.05) and peak levels of AST, ALT, TBIL, GGT and ALP (p < 0.001) as well as significantly lower albumin levels at baseline and respective nadir (p < 0.001; online supplemental table 2). Patients with severe COVID-19 as defined by ICU admission and/or a COVID-19-related fatal outcome showed significantly lower albumin levels at baseline and respective minimal levels (p < 0.001) and significantly higher baseline levels of TBIL and AST (p < 0.05) as well as significantly higher peak levels of AST, TBIL, GGT and ALP (p < 0.001; online supplemental table 2).

AST and ALT elevation at hospital admission were associated with higher rates of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation (table 4): 50% of patients with abnormal AST and 51% with abnormal ALT but only 27% or 31% with normal AST or ALT at hospital admission were transferred to the ICU. The OR for ICU treatment for patients with AST elevation at baseline was 2.68 (95% CI 1.50 to 4.80) and 2.35 (95% CI 1.26 to 4.36) for patients with ALT elevation (online supplemental table 3). AST elevation was associated with a significantly increased risk of severe COVID-19 (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.25 to 3.87). However, neither AST nor ALT abnormalities at admission were related to mortality (p > 0.05; table 4).

Tacrolimus — indication, dosing, contraindications, monitoring, interactions, and reproductive considerations are outlined as expert consensus. Not FDA approved for psoriasis. Dosage is 0.05–0.15 mg/kg. Contraindications include patients with hypersensitivity to tacrolimus or its metabolites. Adverse effect profile is similar to cyclosporine, with most common adverse effects including tremor, headache, nausea, diarrhea, hypertension, and abnormal renal function test, and less common adverse effects including hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia, elevated liver function test, anemia, leukocytosis, dyspnea, fever, arthralgias, edema, diabetes, insomnia, and paresthesias. Baseline monitoring includes history and physical examination, complete blood count with differential, pregnancy test if indicated, BP, renal function test, LFTs, and TB. Ongoing monitoring — proper frequency is not established — and includes blood pressure, serum chemistry, renal function test, liver function test, and pregnancy test if indicated. Drug interactions include numerous drug interactions due to its metabolization by the cytochrome P450 system, and tacrolimus and cyclosporine should not be administered together. In pregnancy, it can be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit to mother justifies the potential risk to fetus. For nursing, tacrolimus should not be used by nursing mothers. For fertility, advise patients to use appropriate contraception before initiating therapy, and on the basis of animal studies, female and male fertility may be compromised by treatment.

Liver enzyme elevations are common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, and their diagnosis or management may be difficult because of the intricacies of the pathogenic mechanisms involved. These include hepatotoxicity related to the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen, idiosyncratic or immunoallergic mechanisms, and direct cytotoxicity enhanced by an underlying liver disease. Liver enzyme abnormalities may also reflect hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) infection, which each have their own risks for chronic immune-mediated liver disease (including hepatitis flare after immune reconstitution) and of direct cytotoxicity. Finally, other factors may affect liver deterioration, including alcohol-related liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis associated with metabolic syndromes (e.g., hyperlipidemia, diabetes, or being overweight) that are potentially HAART related, and use of medication or illicit drugs (e.g., methamphetamine). A better understanding of these complex interactions, including adjustments of dosages of antiretroviral drugs, will probably help in the management of HIV-infected patients with liver enzyme abnormalities.

### Chronic liver disease in an ageing population [^114nec2p]. Age and Ageing (2009). Low credibility.

The prevalence of chronic liver disease is increasing in the elderly population. With a mostly asymptomatic or non-specific presentation, these diseases may easily go undiagnosed. Abnormal liver function tests of unknown cause are a common reason for referral to secondary care. Investigating the older person with abnormal liver function is important; even with mild abnormalities, the same vigilance should be applied to an older person as in a young person. Liver biopsy is safe but often overlooked in this age group and may provide useful information to diagnose, direct therapy and prognosticate. Treatment options are similar for all age groups, with a few subtle differences, although further evidence is frequently required for the older population. Morbidity and age-adjusted mortality are often more severe in older people, and therefore early diagnosis and intervention is important. Presented here are the most common chronic liver diseases that geriatricians are likely to encounter in clinical practise. Their epidemiology, clinical features, investigation, treatment and mortality are described with a particular focus on the elderly population.

### Gastrointestinal and hepatic disease in the inflammatory myopathies [^116eiPBT]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Although muscle weakness is the pathognomonic feature of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, systemic organ involvement is not uncommon. The gastrointestinal and hepatic manifestations are well known. Oropharyngeal dysphagia is the most common gastrointestinal symptom and can be severe. Gastric and small intestinal motility disorders, including chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease have been described. Comprehensive cancer screening is warranted soon after the diagnosis of inflammatory myopathies due to high risk of occult malignancies. Elevated aminotransferases may suggest muscular injury rather than hepatic dysfunction. Knowledge regarding systemic involvement of inflammatory myopathies can assist in timely diagnosis of these complex disorders.

### Metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance are associated with normal-range aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and their ratio in Chinese women with polycystic ovary syndrome [^1162DFko]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

The tissue distribution of these enzymes provides further insights: while ALT is liver‐specific, AST is expressed in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Their differential elevation patterns make AST/ALT ratio a potential indicator of both hepatic and extrahepatic pathology. This is particularly relevant in PCOS, where AST/ALT ratio correlates with MS in adolescents and liver enzymes associate with IR in adults. PCOS patients exhibit systemic metabolic disturbances that can induce coordinated functional alterations in multiple organ systems, including the liver, heart, and kidneys. We therefore hypothesize that normal‐range variations in these parameters may reflect subclinical multisystem involvement, with AST‐dominant patterns potentially indicating cardiovascular strain (via creatine kinase) or renal dysfunction (via creatinine/urea), consistent with PCOS as a systemic metabolic disorder.

To the best of our knowledge, limited studies have systematically explored the correlation between normal‐range ALT, AST levels (< 40 U/L), AST/ALT ratio and metabolic disorders (MS or IR) in PCOS patients. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the associations between normal‐range AST, ALT and AST/ALT ratio with metabolic and endocrine parameters, including MS, IR, myocardial enzymes, and renal function, in Chinese women of reproductive age with PCOS.

### Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a practical approach to diagnosis and staging [^114221NJ]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is now the commonest cause of abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) in the UK with approximately a third of the population being affected. The exact prevalence is not known, but population studies from the United States and China using magnetic resonance spectroscopy estimate that approximately 30% of the general population have steatosis. It is a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis, to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), through to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. The majority have simple steatosis, but approximately 10–30% develop NASH and the development of NASH cirrhosis is associated with a poor long-term prognosis. Patients with NASH have increased liver-related and cardiovascular mortality. Many patients with NAFLD remain undiagnosed, and recognising those at risk is the first step. Clinicians overly rely on abnormal liver enzymes to identify patients with NAFLD, so patients with significant liver disease can be overlooked, potentially missing opportunities for intervention. Although liver biopsy is the gold standard method for diagnosing and staging NAFLD, the majority of patients can be effectively diagnosed non-invasively with tests that are routinely available in the clinic today. This review discusses a pragmatic approach to diagnosis and staging of NAFLD so that patients at the highest risk of liver-related complications can be identified.

### Elevated LFTs: to repeat or not to repeat? [^116smHQK]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Lilian White, MD Posted on February 3, 2025 Elevated liver function tests are reported in 10%–20% of the population, making this laboratory abnormality a common finding for family physicians. The most common cause of elevated LFTs, accounting for approximately one-third of cases, is metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease. Other causes include liver disease because of alcohol use, chronic hepatitis C or B, hereditary hemochromatosis, drug-induced liver injury, and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson disease, and extrahepatic causes. Elevated LFTs are associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. A study involving nearly 2, 000 patients found that with repeat laboratory testing, more than 30% of adults with initially elevated LFTs had normal LFTs after an average of 17 days.

Another study found that 84% of patients with elevated LFTs had persistent elevations on repeat testing 1 month later; however, less than 5% of these patients had specific disease of the liver, such as hepatitis or hemochromatosis; MASLD and excessive alcohol use were the most common causes. Based on these studies, 16%–30% of patients will have resolution of elevated LFTs on repeat testing. Therefore, repeating LFTs before an in-depth workup may reduce unnecessary testing for patients with transient elevations. A gamma-glutamyl transferase level can be helpful in assessing suspected liver injury due to alcohol use, with a sensitivity and specificity of approximately 60%. However, GGT is not specific for alcohol-induced liver injury and may also be elevated in renal failure, myocardial infarction, and diabetes, among other conditions.

For mildly elevated LFTs, a repeat test in four weeks is recommended by the recent AFP article, along with a focused history and physical. If LFTs continue to be mildly elevated, further laboratory evaluation focuses on markers of liver function and the differential diagnosis. Similarly, the American College of Gastroenterology guideline recommends repeating LFTs in cases of mild elevation, but a preferred time to repeat the test is not suggested.

### Special considerations in interpreting liver function tests… [^114sDDx7]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Various liver diseases are associated with typical ranges of AST and ALT levels. ALT levels often rise to several thousand units per liter in patients with acute viral hepatitis. The highest ALT levels — often more than 10, 000 U per L — are usually found in patients with acute toxic injury subsequent to, for example, acetaminophen overdose or acute ischemic insult to the liver. AST and ALT levels usually fall rapidly after an acute insult. 17 The higher the AST-to-ALT ratio, the greater the likelihood that alcohol is contributing to the abnormal LFTs. In the absence of alcohol intake, an increased AST-to-ALT ratio is often found in patients with cirrhosis. The elevated AST-to-ALT ratio in alcoholic liver disease results in part from the depletion of vitamin B.

Markers of Cholestasis Cholestasis results from the blockage of bile ducts or from a disease that impairs bile formation in the liver itself. AP and γ-glutamyltransferase levels typically rise to several times the normal level after several days of bile duct obstruction or intrahepatic cholestasis. The highest liver AP elevations — often greater than 1, 000 U per L, or more than six times the normal value — are found in diffuse infiltrative diseases of the liver such as infiltrating tumors and fungal infections. 20 The elevation of GGT alone, with no other LFT abnormalities, often results from enzyme induction by alcohol or aromatic medications in the absence of liver disease. The GGT level is often elevated in persons who take three or more alcoholic drinks per day. 21 Thus, GGT is a useful marker for immoderate alcohol intake.

In one study, 24 isolated AP elevations were evaluated in an unselected group of patients at a Veterans Affairs hospital. Most mild AP elevations resolved within six months, and almost all greater elevations had an evident cause that was found on routine clinical evaluation. Persistently elevated liver AP values in asymptomatic patients, especially women, can be caused by primary biliary cirrhosis, which is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the small bile ducts. Serum antimitochondrial antibody is positive in almost all of these patients.
