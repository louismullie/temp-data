## Question

How to treat eosinophilia pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat eosinophilic pneumonia, preserving the thinking process and self-verification style. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify eosinophilic pneumonia and why that matters for urgency and therapy. Then, I should verify the diagnostic criteria, including when to pursue BAL and what thresholds define alveolar eosinophilia. Next, I will review the differential and the need to exclude secondary causes. After that, I will outline treatment by subtype, including steroid dosing, taper, and when to consider biologics. Finally, I should confirm monitoring, relapse prevention, and special scenarios like drug-induced disease and pediatric or severe cases, making sure each step is supported by appropriate sources [^116uetMB] [^111ZexvV].

> Let me first confirm the classification because treatment urgency hinges on it. Eosinophilic pneumonia is broadly divided into acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), which presents abruptly with febrile respiratory failure and may mimic ARDS or severe CAP, and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP), which evolves over weeks to months with subacute dyspnea and migratory peripheral infiltrates; distinguishing these frames the intensity and timing of therapy and the likelihood of relapse, so I need to ensure I anchor on this before moving forward [^115PSwSN] [^116uetMB] [^111ZexvV].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic criteria before I commit to steroids. The diagnosis requires compatible clinical and imaging features plus demonstration of pulmonary eosinophilia, typically via BAL showing more than 10% eosinophils; peripheral blood eosinophilia supports the diagnosis but can be absent early in AEP, especially smoking-related cases, so I should not over-rely on blood counts at presentation [^116uetMB] [^111ZexvV] [^115iMYea]. I should also confirm that lung biopsy is generally not required unless the presentation is atypical or the diagnosis remains uncertain after BAL and exclusion of mimics, which avoids unnecessary morbidity [^1128kAUT].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I need to check for secondary causes because management changes if one is found. A meticulous history for new medications, smoking or vaping, occupational or environmental exposures, and travel with potential parasitic risk is essential; if a secondary cause is identified, removal of the inciting agent is foundational therapy alongside corticosteroids, and I should double-check for drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia in temporal clusters with new agents [^111ZexvV] [^117UT8Fc] [^111FURua].

> I will now examine the differential diagnosis to avoid misclassification. Entities that can mimic eosinophilic pneumonia include hypersensitivity pneumonitis, organizing pneumonia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and severe asthma with eosinophilia; I should confirm that extrathoracic features, ANCA testing, and bone marrow evaluation are considered when systemic eosinophilic disease is suspected, and that ABPA is excluded with appropriate serology and imaging before labeling disease as idiopathic [^116uetMB] [^114VuUy3] [^112dMV4w].

> Next, I should review treatment for acute eosinophilic pneumonia and ensure I get the steroid dose right. Systemic corticosteroids are the cornerstone, and in severe cases I should start high-dose intravenous therapy such as methylprednisolone 250 mg every 6 hours for 3–5 days, then transition to oral prednisone around 0.5–1 mg/kg/day, because clinical improvement is often dramatic within 24–48 hours; if there is no rapid response, I need to reconsider the diagnosis or look for an overlooked secondary cause [^112DM2dH] [^115n5tCh] [^111ZexvV]. But wait, what if the patient is already on antibiotics for presumed CAP? I should confirm that steroids are not delayed when AEP is suspected, as unnecessary antibiotics can be stopped once infection is excluded and steroid response confirms the diagnosis [^111ZexvV] [^114seCNc].

> Let me think about chronic eosinophilic pneumonia next, and I should double-check the taper strategy because relapses are common. Typical initial therapy is oral prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day with continuation for several weeks, followed by a slow taper over months; many patients require prolonged therapy, and a substantial proportion relapse during taper or after discontinuation, so I need to plan for a long horizon and counsel on adherence and adverse effects [^112DM2dH] [^117UT8Fc] [^111tXRyz]. I should confirm that inhaled corticosteroids may be added to reduce relapse risk in some reports, though high-quality evidence is limited, and I will individualize this based on asthma overlap and tolerance [^112DM2dH].

> I should confirm the approach to maintenance therapy in frequently relapsing CEP. Recent multicenter data suggest that a prednisolone maintenance dose around 7.2 mg/day achieves a 50% relapse-free rate, which helps me avoid overtreatment; I need to ensure I titrate to the lowest effective dose and reassess periodically, recognizing that relapse does not portend worse long-term outcomes but does necessitate ongoing therapy in many patients [^111tXRyz] [^111ZBcMe] [^1165BH3G].

> Hold on, I should verify when to escalate beyond steroids, especially in steroid-dependent or intolerant patients. Biologic agents targeting IL-5 or its receptor, such as mepolizumab, reslizumab, or benralizumab, have emerging case-based evidence for steroid-sparing remission in CEP; I need to ensure I select candidates with recurrent relapses or significant steroid toxicities and coordinate off-label use with close monitoring and shared decision-making given the limited but promising data [^112nWErt] [^115AkssX] [^1155S45x] [^111HiU8u]. Let me reconsider omalizumab; case reports suggest potential benefit in select CEP with allergic features, but I should confirm IgE-mediated atopy before considering it and set expectations about evidence quality [^111ChdSk].

> I need to ensure supportive care is not overlooked in severe presentations. Oxygenation support, careful fluid management, and consideration of lung-protective ventilation principles apply when AEP presents with ARDS physiology; I should double-check that extracorporeal support such as ECMO is reserved for refractory hypoxemia while definitive steroid therapy is initiated, as case reports document recovery even after ECMO when AEP is recognized and treated promptly [^111t6ft5] [^115ckLU4].

> Next, I should review monitoring and response assessment so I do not miss early failure. Clinical improvement typically occurs within 24–48 hours of steroids, with parallel declines in dyspnea, cough, oxygen requirement, peripheral eosinophil counts, and radiographic opacities; if there is no brisk improvement, I need to re-evaluate adherence, absorption, alternative diagnoses, or occult secondary causes and consider repeating imaging or BAL if the course is atypical [^112DM2dH] [^111ZexvV].

> I will now examine relapse prevention and long-term follow-up, and I should confirm that I am not over-tapering too fast. Relapse rates in CEP range from roughly one-third to over one-half, so I need to taper slowly, often over 6–12 months, and maintain the lowest effective dose; periodic assessment of symptoms, spirometry, and chest imaging helps detect early relapse, and I should educate patients to report recurrent cough, dyspnea, or fevers promptly [^111tXRyz] [^112DM2dH] [^117UT8Fc].

> But wait, what about special populations and scenarios; I should double-check pediatric considerations. In children, eosinophilic pneumonia is rare and the diagnostic approach mirrors adults with emphasis on excluding parasitic infection; corticosteroids remain the mainstay with generally excellent responses, and I need to monitor growth and bone health if prolonged steroids are required [^111mL3x8] [^1115bzkn].

> I should also review drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia because management is both cause-specific and steroid-responsive. Immediate withdrawal of the offending agent is essential, followed by systemic corticosteroids; I need to document the temporal relationship meticulously and consider rechallenge only in exceptional circumstances after full recovery and informed consent, given the risk of recurrence [^111FURua] [^111ZexvV].

> Let me verify the role of BAL thresholds and imaging patterns so I do not misclassify mimics. BAL eosinophilia greater than 10% supports eosinophilic pneumonia, while peripheral blood eosinophilia, although helpful, may be absent early in AEP; imaging patterns such as peripheral consolidation favor CEP, whereas diffuse ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening are more typical of AEP, and I should correlate these with clinical tempo to avoid anchoring bias [^116uetMB] [^111ZexvV] [^115PSwSN] [^114e4Xyf].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined, subtype-driven approach: confirm the diagnosis with BAL when suspected, exclude secondary causes rigorously, treat AEP urgently with high-dose systemic steroids and supportive care, manage CEP with prolonged oral steroids and a cautious taper, and consider IL-5–targeted biologics for steroid-dependent or relapsing disease; throughout, I should monitor closely for response, adverse effects, and relapse, adjusting therapy to the lowest effective dose to balance efficacy and safety [^111ZexvV] [^112DM2dH] [^112nWErt] [^111tXRyz].

Treatment of eosinophilic pneumonia centers on **systemic corticosteroids** [^117UT8Fc] as first-line therapy, with **prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day** for 2–4 weeks, then taper over 3–6 months to minimize relapse [^112DM2dH] [^111tXRyz]. Severe or acute cases may require **IV methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3 days** [^115n5tCh], followed by oral prednisone. Identify and stop **inciting exposures** (smoking, drugs, allergens) [^111ZexvV] [^113fLdTz]. For steroid-refractory or relapsing disease, consider **IL-5 biologics** (mepolizumab, benralizumab) [^112nWErt] [^1155S45x] or other immunosuppressants [^111mL3x8]. Supportive care includes oxygen, ventilation as needed, and monitoring for relapse and adverse effects [^115PSwSN] [^113HgcDE]. Prognosis is excellent with timely therapy, but relapses are common and require prolonged or maintenance steroids [^111tXRyz] [^117UT8Fc].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Accurate diagnosis is essential to guide therapy and exclude mimics; a **systematic approach** includes:

- **Clinical assessment**: Detailed history (travel, medications, smoking, occupational exposures) [^117UT8Fc] [^111ZexvV] and physical examination [^117UT8Fc].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC with differential, eosinophil count, ANCA, IgE, parasitic serologies, and drug allergy testing [^notfound].

- **Imaging**: Chest radiography and high-resolution CT (HRCT) to identify characteristic infiltrates and exclude other causes [^113E33My].

- **Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)**: Essential to demonstrate pulmonary eosinophilia (> 10% eosinophils) and exclude infection or malignancy [^116uetMB] [^113E33My].

- **Lung biopsy**: Reserved for atypical cases or when the diagnosis remains uncertain after noninvasive evaluation [^1128kAUT].

---

## General principles of treatment

Treatment of eosinophilic pneumonia follows **general principles**:

- **Identify and remove inciting factors**: Smoking cessation, discontinuation of offending drugs, and avoidance of environmental triggers [^111ZexvV] [^113E33My].

- **Systemic corticosteroids**: The cornerstone of therapy, with rapid clinical improvement typically observed within 24–48 hours [^115n5tCh] [^112DM2dH].

- **Supportive care**: Oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation if necessary, and monitoring for complications [^111t6ft5].

---

## Pharmacological treatment

### Systemic corticosteroids

Systemic corticosteroids are the **mainstay of treatment** for eosinophilic pneumonia:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended corticosteroid regimen** |
|-|-|
| Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) | - IV methylprednisolone 1 g/day for 3 days [^notfound] <br/> - Then oral prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day for 2–4 weeks [^notfound] |
| Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) | - Oral prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day for 2–4 weeks [^112DM2dH] <br/> - Gradual taper over 3–6 months [^notfound] |
| Steroid-refractory or relapsing disease | - Consider IL-5 biologics (mepolizumab, benralizumab) [^112nWErt] <br/> - Or other immunosuppressants (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil) [^notfound] |

---

Corticosteroids induce **rapid clinical improvement**, with symptoms and radiographic abnormalities typically resolving within days to weeks [^112DM2dH] [^115n5tCh]. Relapses are common, particularly in CEP, necessitating prolonged therapy or maintenance low-dose prednisone (5–10 mg/day) [^111tXRyz] [^112DM2dH].

---

### Alternative pharmacological therapies

For steroid-refractory or relapsing disease, **alternative therapies** include:

- **IL-5 biologics**: Mepolizumab and benralizumab have shown efficacy in reducing eosinophil counts and steroid requirements [^112nWErt] [^1155S45x].

- **Other immunosuppressants**: Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and methotrexate have been used in refractory cases, though evidence is limited [^notfound].

---

## Supportive care and monitoring

Supportive care and monitoring are essential to optimize outcomes and detect complications early. Oxygen therapy is provided to **maintain adequate oxygenation** [^111t6ft5], and mechanical ventilation is instituted for severe respiratory failure. Regular clinical assessments track symptoms, lung function, and imaging to detect relapse or complications [^113HgcDE]. Corticosteroid-related adverse effects — such as osteoporosis, hyperglycemia, hypertension, and infections — should be monitored and managed proactively [^113HgcDE].

---

## Prognosis and relapse management

Prognosis is **generally excellent** with timely and appropriate treatment, with most patients achieving complete clinical and radiographic resolution [^111ZexvV]. Relapses are common, particularly in CEP, and may require prolonged or repeated corticosteroid courses. Maintenance low-dose prednisone or alternative immunosuppressive therapies may be necessary to prevent recurrence [^111tXRyz] [^112DM2dH] [^112nWErt].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pediatric patients**: Corticosteroids remain the mainstay of therapy, with dosing adjusted based on body weight and clinical response [^111mL3x8].

- **Pregnancy**: Corticosteroids are considered safe during pregnancy, with careful monitoring of maternal and fetal outcomes.

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Increased risk of infections and complications necessitates close monitoring and individualized treatment plans [^114BaG9x].

---

Treatment of eosinophilic pneumonia centers on **systemic corticosteroids**, with removal of inciting factors and supportive care. Alternative therapies, such as IL-5 biologics, are considered for steroid-refractory or relapsing disease. Prognosis is excellent, but relapses are common, requiring prolonged therapy and careful monitoring.

### Acute eosinophilic pneumonia: a case report and review of the literature [^113BUqrn]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Since its original description in 1989, clinicians have documented many cases of acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP), but information regarding the appropriate timing of diagnostic testing and treatment continues to be lacking. As a cause of respiratory failure in relatively young individuals, AEP is one of the few diagnoses that will often dramatically alter the intensivist's current therapy. Evidence for effective therapy is anecdotal and may even suggest that the traditional treatment with steroids offers limited benefit. This review uses a patient with AEP to emphasize certain aspects of this illness and discusses the current literature regarding its features, diagnosis, and treatment.

Data Sources

A PubMed search from 1989 to 2008 was conducted using the search terms acute eosinophilic pneumonia, respiratory failure, eosinophilic lung disease, bronchoalveolar lavage, and smoking.

Data Extraction

Twenty-two articles were included in this review and ranged from case reports to randomized controlled trials. These studies demonstrate our current knowledge of this disease and, more importantly, emphasize areas in which we are lacking.

Conclusions

The diagnostic criteria and treatment of AEP is currently based on data from limited case series. Although these criteria are rigid, a wide variation in symptoms, diagnostic findings, and treatments reported further emphasizes our lack of knowledge regarding the pathophysiology of this illness. Important questions remain regarding this disease, including predisposing factors in patients with AEP and the benefit of treating with steroids.

### Eosinophilic pneumonias [^117UT8Fc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The eosinophilic pneumonias are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by an increase in eosinophils in lung tissue or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Many, but not all, of the eosinophilic pneumonias are also associated with a peripheral blood eosinophilia. The etiologies of eosinophilic lung disease are wide ranging and include parasitic infections, medications or other toxins, autoimmune and inflammatory disease, and malignancies. Some eosinophilic pneumonias have no proven cause or inciting event and are classified as idiopathic. An accurate diagnosis can prove difficult and often relies on a combination of a thorough history and physical examination, including travel and medication history, laboratory and radiographic evaluation, and, in some instances, bronchoscopic and histologic evaluation. Early and accurate diagnosis is imperative in certain diseases, such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia, as delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to fatal lung disease. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for many of the eosinophilic pneumonias, particularly for both acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonias, and prognosis is typically excellent provided treatment is initiated in a timely manner.

### Acute eosinophilic pneumonia. causes, diagnosis, and management [^111ZexvV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is an uncommon acute respiratory illness of varying severity that includes presentation as acute respiratory distress syndrome with fatal outcome. AEP may be idiopathic, but identifiable causes include smoking and other inhalational exposures, medications, and infections. The pathogenesis of AEP is poorly understood but likely varies depending on the underlying cause. Airway epithelial injury, endothelial injury, and release of IL-33 are early events that subsequently promote eosinophil recruitment to the lung; eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation appear to mediate subsequent lung inflammation and associated clinical manifestations. Crucial for the diagnosis are the demonstration of pulmonary eosinophilia in the BAL fluid and the exclusion of other disease processes that can present with acute pulmonary infiltrates. Although peripheral blood eosinophilia at initial presentation may be a clue in suggesting the diagnosis of AEP, it may be absent or delayed, especially in smoking-related AEP. Optimal management of AEP depends on the recognition and elimination of the underlying cause when identifiable. The cessation of the exposure to the inciting agent (e.g., smoking), and glucocorticoids represent the mainstay of treating AEP of noninfectious origin. If AEP is recognized and treated in a timely manner, the prognosis is generally excellent, with prompt and complete clinical recovery, even in those patients manifesting acute respiratory failure.

### Approach to eosinophilia presenting with pulmonary symptoms [^116uetMB]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement is characterized by the presence of peripheral blood eosinophilia, typically ≥ 500 cells/mm 3, by pulmonary symptoms and physical examination findings that are nonspecific, and by radiographic evidence of pulmonary disease and is further supported by histopathologic evidence of tissue eosinophilia in a lung or pleura biopsy specimen and/or increased eosinophils in BAL fluid, usually > 10%. Considering that there are a variety of underlying causes of eosinophilia with pulmonary manifestations and overlapping clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features, it is essential to approach the evaluation of eosinophilia with pulmonary findings systematically. In this review, we will describe a case presentation and discuss the differential diagnosis, a directed approach to the diagnostic evaluation and supporting literature, the current treatment strategies for pulmonary eosinophilia syndromes, and the levels of evidence underlying the recommendations, where available. Overall, optimal management of eosinophilic lung disease presentations are directed at the underlying cause when identifiable, and the urgency of treatment may be guided by the presence of severe end-organ involvement or life-threatening complications. When an underlying cause is not easily attributable, management of eosinophilia with pulmonary involvement largely relies on eosinophil-directed interventions, for which biologic therapies are increasingly being used.

### Eosinophilic pneumonias in children: a review of the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^111mL3x8]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2016). Low credibility.

Pediatric eosinophilic pneumonias (EPs) are characterized by a significant infiltration of the alveolar spaces and lung interstitium by eosinophils, with conservation of the lung structure. In developed countries, EPs constitute exceptional entities in pediatric care. Clinical symptoms may be transient (Löffler syndrome), acute (< 1 month and mostly < 7 days), or chronic (> 1 month). Diagnosis relies on demonstration of alveolar eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage, whether or not associated with blood eosinophilia. EPs are a heterogeneous group of disorders divided into: (i) secondary forms (seen mainly in parasitic infections, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, and drug reactions); and (ii) primary forms (eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia). Despite their rarity, the etiological approach to EP must be well-defined as some causes can be rapidly life-threatening without initiation of the proper treatment. This approach (i) eliminates secondary forms, with comprehensive history taking and minimal biological assessment, (ii) is oriented in primary forms by the acute or chronic setting, and the existence of extrapulmonary symptoms. Treatment of primary forms has traditionally relied on corticosteroids, usually with a dramatic response. Specific treatments or the adjunction of corticosteroid-sparing treatment or immunosuppressors are currently being evaluated in order to improve the prognosis and the side effects associated with corticosteroid treatment in a pediatric setting.

### Eosinophil responses during COVID-19 infections and coronavirus vaccination [^113Dcv2Y]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

Eosinophils are circulating and tissue-resident leukocytes that have potent proinflammatory effects in a number of diseases. Recently, eosinophils have been shown to have various other functions, including immunoregulation and antiviral activity. Eosinophil levels vary dramatically in a number of clinical settings, especially following eosinophil-targeted therapy, which is now available to selectively deplete these cells. There are key coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related questions concerning eosinophils whose answers affect recommended prevention and care. First, do patients with eosinophilia-associated diseases have an altered course of COVID-19? Second, do patients with eosinopenia (now intentionally induced by biological drugs) have unique COVID-19 susceptibility and/or disease course? This is a particularly relevant question because eosinopenia is associated with acute respiratory deterioration during infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, the causative agent of COVID-19. Third, do eosinophils contribute to the lung pathology induced during COVID-19 and will they contribute to immunopotentiation potentially associated with emerging COVID-19 vaccines? Herein, we address these timely questions and project considerations during the emerging COVID-19 pandemic.

### Predicting pneumonia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. have we unraveled the network of risks? [^1122svBE]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease strategy document recommends that ICS not be used in those with < 100 eosinophils/μl because that predicts a low probability of treatment benefit. The findings of Martinez-Garcia and colleagues suggest that these patients also have the highest pneumonia risk. Confirmation of these findings from other cohorts is needed and, if validated, then < 100 eosinophils/μl would be a biomarker of both reduced ICS effect and increased pneumonia risk.

ICS use increases pneumonia risk in RCTs, although this finding is not consistent across all studies. The risk appears ICS-dose dependent and is less commonly observed in less severe (using FEV 1 criteria) populations with fewer exacerbation or hospitalization events. Here, ICS use was not an independent risk factor for pneumonia in the Cox regression model in the overall population. However, ICS did appear to increase pneumonia risk in patients with both CBI and < 100 eosinophils/μl. Perhaps the inconsistent results from RCTs regarding ICS and pneumonia risk are related to variation between populations in the proportion of patients with CBI and/or < 100 eosinophils/μl. These findings demonstrate complex interactions between pneumonia risk factors, further highlighted in the network analysis model. Although clinical characteristics (e.g. age and lower FEV 1) have been commonly recognized as risk factors for pneumonia, this study suggests we should also look more closely at blood eosinophil counts and the results of repeated sputum cultures.

### Blood eosinophil count and pneumonia risk in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a patient-level meta-analysis [^111caYH7]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Inhaled corticosteroids are important in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but can slightly increase the risk of pneumonia in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD. Patients with circulating eosinophil counts of 2% or more of blood leucocytes respond better to inhaled corticosteroids than do those with counts of less than 2% and it was therefore postulated that blood eosinophil count might also have an effect on the risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD. In this post-hoc meta-analysis, we investigate whether a 2% threshold can identify patients who differ in their risk of pneumonia, irrespective of inhaled corticosteroid treatment.

Methods

From the GlaxoSmithKline trial registry, we selected randomised, double-blind, clinical trials of patients with COPD that had: inhaled corticosteroid arms (fluticasone propionate and salmeterol or fluticasone furoate and vilanterol); a control arm (not given inhaled fluticasone); and pre-randomisation measurements of blood eosinophil counts and were of at least 24 weeks in duration. With use of specified terms from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities we identified pneumonia adverse events in patient-level data. We calculated number of patients with pneumonia events, stratified by baseline blood eosinophil count (< 2% vs ≥ 2% of blood leucocytes) and whether or not patients had received inhaled corticosteroids.

Findings

We identified ten trials (conducted between 1998 and 2011), with eosinophil count data available for 10861 patients with COPD. 4043 patients had baseline blood eosinophil counts of less than 2% and 6818 patients had baseline blood eosinophil counts of 2% or more. 149 (3·7%) patients with counts less than 2% had one or more pneumonia adverse events compared with 215 (3·2%) with counts of 2% or more (hazard ratio [HR] 1·31; 95% CI 1·06–1·62). In patients not treated with inhaled corticosteroids, 40 (3·8%) patients with less than 2% blood eosinophil counts had a pneumonia event versus 48 (2·4%) with 2% or more blood eosinophils (HR 1·53; 95% CI 1·01–2·31). In patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids, events occurred in 107 (4·5%) versus 164 (3·9%; HR 1·25; 95% CI 0·98–1·60), respectively.

Interpretation

Using 2% baseline eosinophil count as a threshold, patients with COPD with lower blood eosinophil counts had more pneumonia events than did those with higher counts. The magnitude of this increased risk was small and should be further explored in large, prospective studies. These data should be considered when making treatment decisions, alongside existing evidence that patients with COPD and baseline blood eosinophil counts less than 2% have a poorer response to inhaled corticosteroids.

Recommendation

We do not make a recommendation for or against ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia (defined as ≥ 2% blood eosinophils or ≥ 150 cells/μl), except for those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year requiring antibiotics or oral steroids or hospitalization, for whom we suggest ICS as an additive therapy (conditional recommendation, moderate certainty evidence).

Critical outcomes

Outcome prioritization by the panel resulted in ranking pneumonia, hospital admissions, exacerbations, dyspnea, and health-related QOL as critical outcomes.

Summary of the evidence

The expert medical librarian initially identified 2,953 citations in MEDLINE (n = 1,734), Embase (n = 1,187), and the Cochrane Library (n = 32), with deduplication resulting in n = 1,923 warranting abstract screening. An additional seven studies were identified through other means. The majority (99.4%) were ineligible either because of a nonrigorous study methodology or lack of relevance to the PICO question, and this resulted in screeners identifying eight studies for final review inclusion. All eight identified unique studies were RCTs (,–). The total sample size for the eight RCTs was 9,123 participants; 5,945 (65.2%) of these participants were in the treatment/intervention arms and 3,178 (34.8%) were in the control (comparator) arms.

The chosen thresholds for the percentage of eosinophils in blood (≥ 2% eosinophils) and the number of eosinophils per microliter of blood (≥ 150) were based on the values presented in the studies analyzed for the review.

Pneumonia (≥ 2% eosinophils)

Two studies (n = 4,131) assessed incidence of pneumonia in patients with ≥ 2% blood eosinophils. The studies revealed an increased risk of pneumonia with an ICS in addition to a long-acting bronchodilator (RR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.31–3.00; P = 0.001). There was moderate certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 26 more pneumonias per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 8 more to 52 more).

### Eosinophilic pneumonias [^115kbCL4]. Allergy (2005). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic pneumonias (EP) encompass a wide spectrum of lung diseases characterized by peripheral blood eosinophilia (> 1 x 10(9) eosinophils/l) and/or alveolar eosinophilia (> 25%). Blood eosinophilia may be lacking, as in the early phase of idiopathic acute EP, or in patients already taking oral corticosteroids. EP may present with varying severity, ranging from almost asymptomatic infiltrates to the acute respiratory distress syndrome necessitating mechanical ventilation. Possible causes of EP must be thoroughly investigated, especially drugs and the variety of parasitic infections (considering history of travel or residence in areas of endemic parasitic infection). However, chronic EP remains idiopathic in many cases. When present, extrathoracic manifestations lead to suspect Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) or the hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), the prognosis of which is dominated by cardiac involvement. Apart from the treatment of specific causes when possible, corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of symptomatic treatment for eosinophilic disorders, usually with a dramatic response, but frequent relapses when tapering or after stopping the treatment. The adjunction of immunosuppressants to corticosteroids is necessary in patients with CSS and poor prognosis factors. Imatinib has recently proven effective in the treatment of the myeloproliferative variant of the HES.

### The role and immunobiology of eosinophils in the respiratory system: a comprehensive review [^116cAoz3]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2016). Low credibility.

The eosinophil is a fully delineated granulocyte that disseminates throughout the bloodstream to end-organs after complete maturation in the bone marrow. While the presence of eosinophils is not uncommon even in healthy individuals, these granulocytes play a central role in inflammation and allergic processes. Normally appearing in smaller numbers, higher levels of eosinophils in the peripheral blood or certain tissues typically signal a pathologic process. Eosinophils confer a beneficial effect on the host by enhancing immunity against molds and viruses. However, tissue-specific elevation of eosinophils, particularly in the respiratory system, can cause a variety of short-term symptoms and may lead to long-term sequelae. Eosinophils often play a role in more commonly encountered disease processes, such as asthma and allergic responses in the upper respiratory tract. They are also integral in the pathology of less common diseases including eosinophilic pneumonia, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms. They can be seen in neoplastic disorders or occupational exposures as well. The involvement of eosinophils in pulmonary disease processes can affect the method of diagnosis and the selection of treatment modalities. By analyzing the complex interaction between the eosinophil and its environment, which includes signaling molecules and tissues, different therapies have been discovered and created in order to target disease processes at a cellular level. Innovative treatments such as mepolizumab and benralizumab will be discussed. The purpose of this article is to further explore the topic of eosinophilic presence, activity, and pathology in the respiratory tract, as well as discuss current and future treatment options through a detailed literature review.

### Biologics for the treatment of allergic conditions: eosinophil disorders [^112nWErt]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Eosinophil-associated diseases are characterized by a common pathogenetic background, represented by eosinophil-led inflammation and overexpression of interleukin (IL)-5. IL-5 and its receptor are excellent therapeutic targets for eosinophil-associated diseases. Three monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-5 currently are available: mepolizumab and reslizumab block circulating IL-5 preventing the binding to its receptor, whereas benralizumab binds to IL-5 receptor α. They have a steroid-sparing effect in eosinophil disorders, such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, hypereosinophilic syndrome, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. The biotechnological drugs targeting IL-5 are promising therapies; however, further studies are needed.

What pharmacologic treatments should be administered?

There are no well-designed, randomized, double blind placebo controlled trials to guide the pharmacologic therapy of the hospitalized ILD patient. Due to the challenge in differentiating lung infection from an acute presentation of ILD or acute exacerbation of preexisting ILD, treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics should be considered in all patients. Nevertheless, clinical experience suggests that patients with specific ILDs improve with corticosteroid treatment. ILDs that appear to be steroid responsive are COP, AEP, some cases of CTD-ILD (importantly, high doses of corticosteroids are not recommended in SSc-ILD), and drug-induced ILDs. Response rates correspond to the underlying pathology, with eosinophilic pneumonia and OP being the most steroid responsive. The majority of patients with COP respond to corticosteroid treatment and have resolution of symptoms and radiographic abnormalities within weeks to months of initiating therapy. A typical initial dose of corticosteroid is 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone, which is then tapered to 20 mg/day after several weeks. Relapses may occur when treatment is stopped or rapidly tapered. One year of treatment is often recommended. Corticosteroids are also useful in the management of AEP. Patients with AEP can have dramatic clinical improvement within 24–48 h after initiating corticosteroid treatment.

Whether corticosteroids or immunosuppressants benefit patients with AE-IPF or AE of ILD other than IPF is uncertain. Corticosteroids may be beneficial when chest imaging suggests organizing pneumonia is present. Because of reports that azathioprine is associated with worse outcomes in patients with IPF or other forms of DAD, the use of cytotoxic medications should not be used for management of these patients. In contrast to AE-IPF, there is a biologic rationale for treating AE of CTD-ILD patients with immunosuppressants. The driving force behind these diseases is believed to be hyperactivity of the immune system. Therefore, immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, or azathioprine may be useful in these patients.

### Rational use of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of COPD [^111MRf77]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions: recommendations for ICS in the COPD treatment paradigm

ICS overuse continues despite the narrow, specific recommendations for ICS use in global COPD guidelines, and the introduction of single-inhaler triple therapy is associated with a resurgence of this concerning trend.

Recent RCTs of single-inhaler triple therapy have demonstrated significant exacerbation and survival benefits, but this is largely attributed to ICS withdrawal in frequent exacerbators, representing a minority of COPD patients. As a result, healthcare regulatory bodies have rejected claims of survival benefit associated with triple therapy. Observational studies conducted in broader, more representative COPD populations have demonstrated that patients treated with LAMA/LABA have a similar or more often lower risk of exacerbations, mortality and pneumonia compared with patients treated with ICS –. In patients not fulfilling guideline criteria for ICS use, prescription of ICS puts them at unnecessary risk of pneumonia and other long-term adverse events, without any clear benefit in disease control. Inappropriate use of ICS also has cost implications for the management of COPD. ICS should therefore be reserved for the few, not the many, i.e. those with an eosinophilic, frequent/severe exacerbator phenotype. In patients not fulfilling guideline criteria, ICS should be withdrawn in line with global treatment guidelines.

### Omalizumab as a steroid-sparing agent in chronic eosinophilic pneumonia [^111ChdSk]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) is an idiopathic eosinophilic pulmonary disease characterized by an abnormal and marked accumulation of eosinophils in the lung. Common presenting complaints include cough, fever, dyspnea, wheezing, and night sweats. Common laboratory abnormalities are peripheral blood and BAL eosinophilia. The pathognomonic radiographic finding is bilateral peripheral infiltrates. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy, and dramatic improvement follows treatment. Relapses are common, and most patients require prolonged therapy. Side effects associated with chronic corticosteroid therapy must be monitored. Our case was that of a 36-year-old woman who had characteristic clinical and radiologic features. She was treated with corticosteroids but she needed prolonged therapy, and side effects occurred. Because the patient had high IgE levels and a positive skin prick test result, we used omalizumab for the treatment. The patient responded well. To our knowledge, this is the first CEP case in the literature successfully treated with omalizumab.

### Asthmatic adult with marked blood eosinophilia: is it truly asthma? [^112DM2dH]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The mainstay of treatment in CEP includes the use of steroids. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no consensus recommendation on the duration and dose of steroid therapy. In some studies, acutely unwell patients with rapidly progressive disease received 3 to 5 days of high-dose steroids (intravenous methylprednisolone 250 mg every 6 hours), after which they were converted to oral prednisolone once they are stabilised. All other patients were started on oral prednisolone, typically at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg/dayand tailed down after 2 weeks of treatment. Clinical improvement following steroid administration is typically dramatic, with response seen within 48 hours. An alternative diagnosis should be sought if patients do not improve quickly with steroids. Clinical response can be measured by improvement in symptoms, decline in pulmonary or peripheral blood eosinophilia, marked reduction or clearing of radiographic abnormalities, as well as physiological improvement on spirometry or diffusion coefficient.

Both symptomatic and radiographic relapse is common in CEP after cessation of therapy or during tailing of steroid doses. Time of relapse can occur any time from months to years after the initial presentation. Management of relapse includes increasing steroid dose up to 0.5 mg/kg/day for the next 1 to 2 weeks. Although the total dose and length of treatment may vary among patients, one study showed that up to three quarters of patients require prolonged steroid therapy, with a mean duration of 19 months. In the study by Marchand et al, up to 69% of patient were still on oral corticosteroid therapy over the mean follow-up period of 6.2 years. Some studies also recommend the use of inhaled corticosteroids to lower the rate of CEP relapse.

Learning points

Asthma is commonly associated with peripheral blood eosinophilia. However, markedly increased levels are not common in allergic asthma and a high index of suspicion for another cause is required especially if patients do not respond to inhaled corticosteroid therapy.
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) should be considered in a patient with asthma-like symptoms with blood and pulmonary eosinophilia.
Patients with CEP show dramatic response to systemic steroid therapy, though relapses during tailing of doses are common.

### Anti-interleukin (IL)-5 as a steroid-sparing agent in chronic eosinophilic pneumonia [^115AkssX]. The Journal of Asthma (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Anti-interleukin (IL)-5 therapy is a novel drug class clinically effective in patients with diverse eosinophil-related disorders such as allergic eosinophilic asthma, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), nasal polyposis, eosinophilic COPD, and other non-pulmonary disorders such as eosinophilic esophagitis. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) is a steroid responsive disorder, however, relapses are common following corticosteroid tapering. Case Study: We present the case of a 42-year-old woman with steroid-dependent relapsing CEP successfully treated with anti-IL-5 antibody. Results: Treatment with anti-IL-5 antibody resulted in remission with the ability to taper off the steroids, and no recurrence of the disease for 6months. Conclusion: Our case report supports the potential use of anti-IL-5 therapy for remission of patients with CEP with recurrent relapses. Whether, it would also be an effective initial therapy might also be an area that deserves future investigation.

### Pulmonary eosinophilic syndromes [^114686nb]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia, chronic eosinophilia, Churg-Strauss syndrome, and the hypereosinophilic syndrome are pulmonary eosinophilic syndromes characterized by an increased number of eosinophils in peripheral blood, in lung tissue, in sputum, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, or in all of these. These pulmonary eosinophilic syndromes generally are characterized by increased respiratory symptoms, abnormal radiographic appearance, and the potential for systemic manifestations. It is critical to exclude other causes of eosinophilia in patients who have lung disease, to make a quick diagnosis, and to treat aggressively with corticosteroids and other therapies to prevent long-term sequelae.

### Long-term use of mepolizumab in a case of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: extending interval dosing [^1155S45x]. The Journal of Asthma (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mepolizumab, a humanized anti IL-5 monoclonal antibody, has been used off-label for chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP), inducing disease remission and saving systemic corticosteroids.

Case Study

We present a case of CEP, requiring long-term corticosteroids therapy due to relapse upon withdrawal. Mepolizumab was started and maintained for 2years and 6months.

Results

Corticosteroids could be withdrawn and mepolizumab dose interval was spared up to 10 wk with no disease relapse.

Conclusion

Mepolizumab is shown to be useful for chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, allowing corticosteroid withdrawal. Dose interval may be individualized under close monitoring, for a more efficient treatment, reducing medical costs while improving patients' quality of life.

### Favorable response to asthma-dosed subcutaneous mepolizumab in eosinophilic pneumonia [^111eYF7F]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Mepolizumab targets eosinophils in the treatment of asthma. The dose used for asthma is considerably lower than that used for treating eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, a recently approved indication. While intravenous mepolizumab use has reported utility in non-asthma eosinophilic disorders, the efficacy of the subcutaneous asthma dosing of the drug for eosinophilic pneumonia is not known. Case study: A middle-aged female was diagnosed with eosinophilic pneumonia. The patient's clinical/radiologic/laboratory findings, response to treatment, and respiratory function studies are described. Results: A woman, born in 1962, had repeated pneumonia hospitalizations from 2007 through 2010. In October 2010, a lung biopsy showed findings consistent with chronic eosinophilic pneumonia and chronic asthma. The patient also had chronic sinusitis. Long term systemic corticosteroids were prescribed but the patient became oxygen dependent by 2014. Omalizumab was administered for 1 year starting in 2015 without improvement in symptoms. In 2016, mepolizumab 100mg subcutaneously every 4weeks was initiated. Symptomatic improvement with decreased oxygen and systemic corticosteroid requirements were noted. A chest CT performed in February 2018 showed marked improvement compared to a study in 2016. Interval spirometric improvements were noted. Peripheral blood eosinophils/mm 3 prior to mepolizumab were 237, and while on mepolizumab were 10. Conclusion: Parenchymal eosinophilic lung disease may respond to asthma-dosed mepolizumab. Mepolizumab treatment in asthma where concomitant interstitial disease is suspected, may offer an advantage over omalizumab in the ability to reduce eosinophils not only in airways, but also in lung parenchyma.

### Optimal dose of maintenance steroid therapy for relapse of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: a multicentre retrospective study [^111tXRyz]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP), first reported in 1969, is an idiopathic pulmonary disorder characterised by an abnormal and marked accumulation of eosinophils in the lungs. Most patients with CEP respond well to systemic steroid therapy, but relapses are common after tapering or discontinuing steroids. Previous reports have shown relapse rates ranging from 37% to 58%, with 28% of relapsed patients experiencing two or more relapses. Several predictors of relapse have been reported, including underlying asthma with a higher use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and smoking history as negative predictors, while centrilobular opacities on high-resolution CT scans and high serum surfactant protein D (SP-D) levels as positive predictors. However, the predictors have shown inconsistent results among studies, making it challenging to establish reliable predictors of relapse.

After successfully managing the initial episode, it is important to avoid overtreatment with steroid therapy and minimise potential side effects. Notably, relapse does not indicate a worse prognosis or increased morbidity, and airway obstructive abnormalities are typically of borderline clinical significance. In the real world, long-term maintenance steroid therapy (MST) is often necessary for managing repeated relapses. In such cases, the lowest effective dose (ED) of long-term MST is recommended to prevent relapse. Previous reports have indicated a range of prednisolone doses for MST, from 5.4 mg to 11.8 mg. However, the optimal dose has not yet been identified. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the optimal dose of MST required to prevent repeated relapses of CEP. Secondary objectives included identifying the serum eosinophil count at relapse and background factors of relapse. This study aims to minimise steroid doses for repeated relapses of CEP by evaluating the optimal MST dose.

### Rational use of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of COPD [^1177Cpuf]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Since findings on eosinophil thresholds can be affected by selection bias for certain patient populations (such as frequent exacerbators) in RCTs, as described earlier in this article, the threshold derived from observational studies may be more reliable. Several observational studies have shown that the optimal blood eosinophil count threshold for ICS response in terms of the ability to reduce exacerbations is considerably higher (300–450 cells/μl) – than findings from RCTs (100–150 cells/μl). However, other analyses have not replicated these findings. In a systematic review of 11 RCTs and 5 observational studies, an overall association between blood eosinophil count and the effect of ICS in reducing exacerbation risk was found. However, this association was not observed in four of the five observational studies, suggesting that the predictive effect of eosinophils may not apply to the real-world COPD population.

An observational study comparing initial COPD treatment with LABA/ICS or LAMA suggests that while the exacerbation benefit of initiating LABA/ICS is demonstrated only in patients with high blood eosinophil counts (> 300 cells/μl), the increased pneumonia risk with LABA/ICS is observed at all eosinophil concentrations. Based on this, the authors conclude that initial treatment with a LAMA should be preferred in patients with blood eosinophil concentrations ≤ 300 cells/μl due to its superior risk/benefit profile. A blood eosinophil threshold of ≥ 300 cells/μl forms the basis of the guidance for initial treatment of COPD in the GOLD 2022 strategy report, aiming to identify exacerbating COPD patients that are likely to derive the greatest benefit from ICS.

Key points
It is important to assess the number and type of exacerbations before prescribing ICS to patients with COPD (ICS reduce eosinophilic exacerbations but not infection-based exacerbations).
In patients with a history of frequent or severe exacerbations, global treatment guidelines recommend starting with dual bronchodilator therapy (LAMA/LABA).
Addition of ICS to LAMA/LABA is recommended for frequent/severe exacerbators with blood eosinophil levels ≥ 300 cells/µl (or ≥ 100 cells/µl if exacerbations are not well controlled by LAMA/LABA).

### Rethinking blood eosinophils for assessing inhaled corticosteroids response in COPD: a post hoc analysis from the FLAME trial [^111ThMJr]. Chest (2024). Medium credibility.

Take-home Points

Study Question: Is (1) blood eosinophil count (BEC) measured while patients are not receiving inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), (2) BEC measured while patients are receiving ICS, or (3) change in BEC during ICS treatment (BEC on treatment – BEC off treatment) associated with treatment response to long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA)/ICS vs LABA/long-acting muscarinic antagonist combinations?

Results: Higher BEC off ICS, higher BEC on ICS, and significant BEC suppression during ICS treatment corresponded to superior response to LABA/ICS in terms of preventing exacerbations and pneumonia. However, in 9% of participants, BEC changed significantly on ICS treatment. In this subgroup, higher BEC on ICS did not predict ICS treatment response.

Interpretation: Our findings advocate preferentially using BEC off ICS or BEC change during ICS treatment for guiding ICS treatment decisions.

COPD, a leading cause of death, disability, and chronic respiratory symptoms, is complex and heterogeneous, thus requiring a precision medicine therapeutic approach. Only patients with enhanced eosinophilic inflammation in the airways appear to respond to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Blood eosinophil count (BEC), a practical surrogate marker for airway eosinophilic inflammation, has been shown to predict ICS treatment response in randomized controlled trials (RCTs); higher BEC at the start of the study is associated with greater benefits for ICS treatment on exacerbations, health status, and pulmonary function. Because ICS may cause pneumonia and other side effects, BECs require a targeted ICS administration strategy in patients with COPD with increased exacerbation risk.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^116kRd3b]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Blood eosinophil count — blood eosinophil counts predict the magnitude of the effect of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in preventing future exacerbations, with a continuous relationship where no and/or small effects are observed at lower eosinophil counts and incrementally increasing effects at higher counts; ICS-containing regimens have little or no effect at a blood eosinophil count < 100 cells/μL, whereas a blood eosinophil count ≥ 300 cells/μL identifies the top of the continuum and patients with the greatest likelihood of treatment benefit; lower blood and sputum eosinophils are associated with greater presence of proteobacteria, notably haemophilus, and increased bacterial infections and pneumonia, and may identify individuals with microbiome profiles associated with increased risk of clinical worsening due to pathogenic bacterial species.

### A rare case of acute eosinophilic pneumonia induced by vaping-associated lung injury: a case report [^113fLdTz]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The eosinophilic lung diseases (ELD) represent a heterogeneous group of pulmonary conditions, which manifest by the presence of peripheral blood eosinophilia in the absence of other causes. Although eosinophils are found normally with few numbers (less than 2%) on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), it is expected to be higher in case of ELD. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) known as a febrile illness associated with acute onset respiratory failure that is commonly misdiagnosed in the initial presentation as infectious pneumonia. The cause of AEP is most commonly unknown, but identifiable causes include smoking, inhalational exposures, medications, and infections have all been linked to a higher acquisition rate of the disease. Inflammation occurs through excessive activation of type-2 immune cells and release of type-2 cytokines such as interleukin-5 (IL-5). This results in eventual inflammatory cascade with excessive eosinophil recruitment to the lung parenchyma. The treatment of AEP depends on the underlying cause when recognized, but glucocorticoids are the treatment of choice when AEP is caused by noninfectious causes.

### Predicting pneumonia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. have we unraveled the network of risks? [^1117dfsC]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Univariate analysis showed that older age, lower FEV 1, presence of bronchiectasis, exacerbation rates, and < 100 eosinophils/μl were associated with CBI. These risk factors were also associated with pneumonia risk, as was CBI and ICS treatment. A multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression model showed that age, FEV 1, CBI, and < 100 eosinophils/μl were all independently associated with pneumonia. Of note, ICS use itself was not associated with pneumonia in the overall population, although ICS further increased the risk of pneumonia in those with CBI and < 100 eosinophils/μl.

Few studies of pneumonia in COPD have included blood eosinophil counts as a risk factor, mostly showing either a weak or no association. Martinez-Garcia and colleagues also found that higher eosinophil thresholds (e.g. < 150 or < 300 cells/μl) were not associated with pneumonia risk, but very low eosinophil counts (< 100 cells/μl) were associated with pneumonia, and this was the most important risk factor in the adjusted Cox regression model, ahead of age and FEV 1. This is an observational study, in contrast to previous analyses of eosinophils and pneumonia risk that were based on data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and differences in study design or population characteristics may explain the varying results. Also, the way that pneumonia was defined varied, and even when chest radiographs are obtained for all exacerbations and independently adjudicated as to the presence of infiltrates, the differentiation of the two events can be challenging.

### Eosinophilic lung diseases [^1128kAUT]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

The eosinophilic lung diseases may manifest as chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, or as the Löffler syndrome (generally of parasitic etiology). The diagnosis of eosinophilic pneumonia is made when both characteristic clinical-imaging features and alveolar eosinophilia are present. Peripheral blood eosinophils are generally markedly elevated; however, eosinophilia may be absent at presentation. Lung biopsy is not indicated except in atypical cases after multidisciplinary discussion. The inquiry to possible causes (medications, toxic drugs, exposures, and infections especially parasitic) must be meticulous. Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia may be misdiagnosed as infectious pneumonia. Extrathoracic manifestations raise the suspicion of a systemic disease especially eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Airflow obstruction is frequent in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and hypereosinophilic obliterative bronchiolitis. Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy, but relapses are common. Therapies targeting interleukin 5/interleukin-5 are increasingly used in eosinophilic lung diseases.

### Pulmonary eosinophilia [^115PSwSN]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

Eosinophils may infiltrate the lung tissue, thus impairing gas exchange and causing several symptoms as dyspnea, fever, and cough. This process may be secondary to several factors, including drugs or parasite migration, or primary (idiopathic). Acute eosinophilic pneumonia is life-threatening and presents frequently in young smokers as an acute hypoxemic respiratory failure of generally less than a week with bilateral lung infiltrates, frequently misdiagnosed as severe community-acquired pneumonia. This patients present without peripheral eosinophilia but usually have more than 25% eosinophils on bronchoalveolar fluid. Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia is a protracted disease of usually more than a month before presentation, with a predilection for middle aged asthmatic patients. Hypoxemia is mild-moderate, and there are usually more than 1,000 eosinophils/mm3 of peripheral blood. Bronchoalveolar fluid has high eosinophil levels (usually more than 25%). Migratory peripheral infiltrates are seen in the chest x-ray film. Both acute and chronic eosinophilic pneumonia are treated by glucocorticoids and respiratory support as well as avoidance of any recognized trigger.

### Benralizumab treatment and 3-dimensional bronchial tree changes in chronic eosinophilic pneumonia [^114GxMSB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: Global (2025). Medium credibility.

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) is an eosinophilic pulmonary disease that is often complicated by severe asthma characterized by eosinophil infiltration into the pulmonary interstitium and alveolar spaces. The standard treatment involves systemic corticosteroids, but relapses are common during tapering or discontinuation. Consequently, patients with CEP frequently need repeated and prolonged corticosteroid courses, which have adverse effects such as hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, myopathy, and increased infection risk. Benralizumab, a mAb targeting IL-5 receptor-α (IL-5Rα), is approved for severe asthma, reducing exacerbations and improving lung function in clinical trials. However, reports on benralizumab use in patients with CEP are limited. We present 2 cases of patients with CEP and severe asthma that were successfully treated with benralizumab, allowing corticosteroid discontinuation and resulting in achievement of remission.

### Comparing initial LABA-ICS inhalers in COPD: real-world effectiveness and safety [^114kb5qk]. Respiratory Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Guidelines for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with multiple exacerbations and eosinophilia recommend a long-acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combined inhaler, with no distinction between different agents. We compared the effectiveness and safety of budesonide-formoterol versus fluticasone-salmeterol on the incidence of exacerbations and pneumonia in a real-world clinical practice setting of COPD, particularly considering eosinophilia, an important marker for ICS effectiveness.

Methods

We identified a cohort of patients with COPD, new users of a LABA-ICS during 2002–2018, age 50 or older, from the UK's CPRD database, and followed for one year. The hazard ratio (HR) of exacerbation and of pneumonia was estimated using the Cox regression model, weighted by fine stratification of the propensity score of treatment initiation.

Results

The cohort included 24,973 of budesonide-formoterol and 61,251 initiators of fluticasone-salmeterol. The adjusted HR of a first moderate or severe exacerbation with budesonide-formoterol relative to fluticasone-salmeterol was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.95–1.01), while for severe exacerbation it was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85–0.99). The HR of severe pneumonia with budesonide-formoterol was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.70–0.83), and was particularly decreased with higher blood eosinophil count, dropping to 0.62 (95% CI: 0.51–0.77) at > 300 cells/μL.

Conclusion

In a real-world clinical setting of COPD treatment, a budesonide-formoterol inhaler was generally as effective at reducing the incidence of moderate-severe exacerbations as fluticasone-salmeterol. However, budesonide-formoterol was more effective than fluticasone-salmeterol at reducing the incidence of severe exacerbation and the risk of severe pneumonia, particularly in patients with higher blood eosinophil counts.

### Monoclonal antibodies in idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: a scoping review [^111HiU8u]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

The extent of the evidence for management with monoclonal antibodies (omalizumab, mepolizumab, benralizumab, reslizumab) is limited but could be promising for cases of ICEP with frequent relapses and cases where the use of corticosteroids is contraindicated. The extent of the evidence for management with dupilumab is even more limited. Well-designed studies that evaluate quality of life and outcomes during a clear follow-up period are needed. To our knowledge, this is the first scoping review of the literature detailing the extent of the evidence for the management of ICEP with monoclonal antibodies.

### From DREAM to REALITI – A and beyond: mepolizumab for the treatment of eosinophil-driven diseases [^116h8vsC]. Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

Early studies demonstrated the association of blood and tissue eosinophilia with bronchial asthma, and the relationship between elevated eosinophil counts in blood and sputum and disease severity. This was supported during the clinical development of mepolizumab, which showed that mepolizumab induces sustained, significant reductions in blood eosinophil counts with improved clinical outcomes in patients with severe asthma who had an eosinophilic phenotype. Furthermore, blood eosinophil count was identified as a treatable trait and was established as a validated pharmacodynamic and predictive biomarker for response to mepolizumab in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma.,

Experience has shown that an understanding of pathobiology in one disease can be extended to other diseases, in which biological pathways overlap. Moreover, in‐depth knowledge of a disease with a relatively straightforward pathogenesis may benefit from understanding and identification of treatment options in diseases with more complex underlying mechanisms. Indeed, this has occurred in other fields. For example, tocilizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets the IL‐6 receptor, was first approved in Castleman disease and later approved for other IL‐6‐related diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, and is now being evaluated for the treatment of severe COVID‐19 pneumonia. Overall, discovery of the importance of eosinophils during the development of mepolizumab for asthma, along with the confirmation that neutralizing IL‐5 results in eosinophil reduction and disease control in HES, paved the way for mepolizumab treatment in other eosinophilic disorders.

### Optimal dose of maintenance steroid therapy for relapse of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: a multicentre retrospective study [^111ZBcMe]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Background

Long-term maintenance steroid therapy (MST) is often necessary for repeated relapses of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP). Because relapse does not indicate a worse prognosis, determining the optimal steroid dose to avoid overtreatment presents a clinical challenge. Our primary objective was to evaluate the optimal MST dose to prevent repeated relapses, and the secondary objectives included identifying serum eosinophil count at relapse and background factors of relapse.

Methods

A multicentre retrospective study was conducted on patients with steroid-treated CEP. Background characteristics were compared between the non-relapse and relapse groups. The optimal MST dose was determined based on dose at relapse and the final relapse prevention dose. Additionally, serum eosinophil count at relapse was assessed.

Results

A total of 79 patients were included, with 44 in the non-relapse group and 35 in the relapse group. The prednisolone doses required to achieve relapse-free rates of 50% (ED 50) were 7.2mg (95% CI, 4.6 to 23.6). The median serum eosinophil count at relapse was 1125/µL (IQR, 735–2108). No clinically significant background factors were identified between the non-relapse and relapse groups.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrated that a prednisolone dose of 7.2mg achieved a 50% relapse-free rate in the relapse group. Based on these findings, we encourage clinicians to evaluate individual minimum effective steroid doses.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^115pbFHR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia (≥ 150 eosinophils)

Two studies (n = 4,267) assessed incidence of pneumonia in patients with ≥ 150 blood eosinophils/μl. The studies revealed an increased risk of pneumonia with an ICS in addition to a long-acting bronchodilator (RR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.23–1.95; P < 0.001). There was moderate certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE (absolute risk effect was 44 more pneumonias per 1,000 patients; 95% CI, 18 more to 76 more).

Hospital admissions

Hospital admissions were not reported in the studies and therefore could not be analyzed.

Exacerbations (≥ 2% eosinophils)

Six studies (n = 5,517) assessed rates of COPD exacerbations in patients with ≥ 2% blood eosinophils (,–). The studies revealed a reduced risk of exacerbations with an ICS in addition to a long-acting bronchodilator versus a long-acting bronchodilator (rate ratio, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67–0.92; P = 0.004). There was moderate certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE. Assuming a baseline risk of COPD exacerbation in this subgroup of one exacerbation per patient per year, the absolute risk effect was 209 fewer exacerbations per 1,000 patients (95% CI, 313 fewer to 76 fewer).

Exacerbations (≥ 150 eosinophils/μl)

Six studies (n = 8,106) assessed rates of COPD exacerbations in patients with ≥ 150 blood eosinophils/μl (,–). The studies revealed a reduced risk of exacerbations with an ICS in addition to a long-acting bronchodilator versus a long-acting bronchodilator (rate ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59–0.84; P < 0.001). There was moderate certainty in estimates of effect based on GRADE. Assuming a baseline risk of COPD exacerbation in this subgroup of one exacerbation per patient per year, the absolute risk effect was 285 fewer exacerbations per 1,000 patients (95% CI, 390 fewer to 152 fewer).

### Optimal dose of maintenance steroid therapy for relapse of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: a multicentre retrospective study [^1165BH3G]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Background

Long-term maintenance steroid therapy (MST) is often necessary for repeated relapses of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP). Because relapse does not indicate a worse prognosis, determining the optimal steroid dose to avoid overtreatment presents a clinical challenge. Our primary objective was to evaluate the optimal MST dose to prevent repeated relapses, and the secondary objectives included identifying serum eosinophil count at relapse and background factors of relapse.

Methods

A multicentre retrospective study was conducted on patients with steroid-treated CEP. Background characteristics were compared between the non-relapse and relapse groups. The optimal MST dose was determined based on dose at relapse and the final relapse prevention dose. Additionally, serum eosinophil count at relapse was assessed.

Results

A total of 79 patients were included, with 44 in the non-relapse group and 35 in the relapse group. The prednisolone doses required to achieve relapse-free rates of 50% (ED 50) were 7.2 mg (95% CI, 4.6 to 23.6). The median serum eosinophil count at relapse was 1125 /µL (IQR, 735–2108). No clinically significant background factors were identified between the non-relapse and relapse groups.

Conclusion

Our study demonstrated that a prednisolone dose of 7.2 mg achieved a 50% relapse-free rate in the relapse group. Based on these findings, we encourage clinicians to evaluate individual minimum effective steroid doses.

### Predicting pneumonia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. have we unraveled the network of risks? [^111vPJkR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) reduce exacerbation rates in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but may also cause adverse effects, including pneumonia. Blood eosinophil counts can predict the clinical response to ICS and < 100 eosinophils/μl is associated with a low probability of a reduction in exacerbation rates. Based in part on these data, the use of ICS in clinical practice is becoming more personalized, weighing the possibility of benefit (using exacerbation history and blood eosinophil counts) against the risk of adverse events, including pneumonia.

In this issue of the Journal, Martinez-Garcia and colleagues (pp.) report the relationships between pneumonia risk and ICS use, blood eosinophil counts, and chronic bacterial infection (CBI) of the airways (assessed using sputum samples) from a cohort of 201 patients with COPD followed for a median of 84 months. Previous studies have shown that pneumonia risk factors in COPD include ICS use, older age, lower FEV 1, lower body mass index, and previous pneumonia. An important novel aspect of this study is that bacterial infection data is included in the analysis of pneumonia risk. Bacterial isolates were detected in 42.3% of patients on at least one occasion, whereas CBI was present in 22.4%.

### Novel therapies for eosinophilic disorders [^112RWgVU]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Current therapies for eosinophilic disorders are limited. Most treatment approaches remain empirical, are not supported by data from controlled clinical trials, involve the off-label use of agents developed for treatment of other diseases, and tend to rely heavily on the use of glucocorticoids and other agents with significant toxicity. Great progress has been made in the discovery, preclinical development, and clinical testing of a variety of biologics and small molecules that have the potential to directly or indirectly influence eosinophils, eosinophilic inflammation, and the consequences of eosinophil activation.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^117Vw4vJ]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Anti-inflammatory therapy in stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and combinations: Regular treatment with ICS increases the risk of pneumonia especially in those with severe disease. An ICS combined with a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) is more effective than the individual components for improving lung function and health status and reducing exacerbations in patients with exacerbations and moderate to very severe COPD. We do not encourage the use of a LABA+ICS combination in COPD; if there is an indication for an ICS the combination LABA+long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)+ICS has been shown to be superior to LABA+ICS and is therefore the preferred choice. Triple inhaled therapy of LABA+LAMA+ICS improves lung function, symptoms and health status, and reduces exacerbations compared to LABA+ICS, LABA+LAMA or LAMA monotherapy, and recent data suggest beneficial effect of triple inhaled therapy versus fixed-dose LABA+LAMA combinations on mortality in symptomatic COPD patients with a history of frequent and/or severe exacerbations. If patients with COPD have features of asthma, treatment should always contain an ICS. Independent of ICS use, there is evidence that a blood eosinophil count < 2% increases the risk of pneumonia. Combinations can be given as single or multiple inhaler therapy, and single inhaler therapy may be more convenient and effective than multiple inhalers.

### Optimal dose of maintenance steroid therapy for relapse of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: a multicentre retrospective study [^113HgcDE]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Long-term steroid therapy is a significant independent predictor of numerous adverse effects, which are dose- and duration-dependent. Major risks include infections, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and osteoporosis. Furthermore, even doses of prednisolone less than 5 mg/day have been associated with an increased risk of fractures and serious infections. However, short-term use may also lead to serious adverse effects, particularly at higher doses. One study reported that 30 mg/day of prednisolone for 1 month carried a similar risk of serious infection as 5 mg/day for 3 years. Some studies have suggested that very low doses of steroids (eg, prednisolone at a dose less than 5 mg/day) are associated with fewer adverse effects. A placebo-controlled trial of 5 mg/day add-on prednisolone over 2 years in patients with rheumatoid arthritis revealed an increase in mild to moderate infections, with other glucocorticoid-specific adverse effects being rare. However, the threshold duration for steroid therapy where adverse events become more frequent remains unclear. In steroid therapy for repeated relapses of CEP, the decision to continue maintenance therapy at the optimal dose or to discontinue therapy and resume therapy at relapse remains an issue for future investigation. Alternate-day low-dose prednisone therapy may also help reduce side effects, but the optimal dose for preventing relapse has not been clearly defined.

In our study, the prednisolone dose at the time of relapse was 10 mg or lower in all relapse groups. Relapses with high doses of prednisolone should trigger a thorough investigation for other potential causes of eosinophilic pneumonia, such as vasculitis, drugs, fungal or parasitic infections. Biological therapies approved for severe asthma may offer a safer alternative to control relapses of idiopathic CEP, allowing for a reduction in steroid dose and sometimes replacing steroid therapy. However, the available evidence is limited and primarily composed of case reports and series. Given that 46% of the relapse group had asthma complications, the low rate of concomitant biologic use is notable. Therefore, more aggressive combination therapy with biologics should be considered, especially for patients on high-dose or long-term MST.

Our study revealed that the median serum eosinophil count was 1125 /µL (IQR, 735–2108). Currently, symptoms and chest imaging remain the most reliable and efficient guides for therapy. The absence of absolute serum eosinophil count criteria for steroid therapy complicates determining optimal doses for repeated relapses. Although relapse generally does not worsen prognosis and airway obstructive abnormalities are of borderline clinical significance, CEP can cause long-term issues, including persistent pulmonary impairmentand irreversible fibrosis.

### Pharmacologic management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^113rwXR7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Committee discussion

According to the available evidence, the addition of ICS to a long-acting bronchodilator in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia was associated with a significantly increased risk of pneumonia and a significantly decreased risk of exacerbations. Patients with blood eosinophilia treated with ICS plus long-acting bronchodilators experienced 26–44 more pneumonias per 1,000 patients, and 209–285 fewer COPD exacerbations per 1,000 patients.

However, the panel recognized that the studies included within this PICO question analyzed the effects of ICS and long-acting bronchodilators in patients with elevated blood eosinophils as subgroup analyses. In many cases, the subgroup analyses were performed post hoc after the primary trial results had already been published. In addition, nonstandardized thresholds were used in the various studies to define "eosinophilia". Thus, the panel believed the quality of the available studies providing the evidence was not optimal, and hence the committee was reluctant to recommend ICS for all patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia. However, given the weight of the evidence presented in PICO 2, which shows that ICS are beneficial in patients with a history of exacerbations, the panel concluded that patients with blood eosinophilia and a history of exacerbations would likewise benefit from the addition of ICS to a long-acting bronchodilator.

The panel believed that the addition of ICS to a long-acting bronchodilator in patients with blood eosinophilia and a history of exacerbations is feasible, and the burden of therapy would be acceptable to patients. A cost-effectiveness analysis was not performed because the literature was not fully examined in this regard. However, the panel did note that combination inhaled steroid/long-acting bronchodilator therapy is more expensive than long-acting bronchodilator monotherapy, and this could pose health-equity challenges to patients of limited means who might be unable to obtain the drug because of cost or lack of availability. The burden of use for patients was not deemed to be a factor that would preclude patients from choosing a long-acting bronchodilator with ICS over a long-acting bronchodilator therapy without ICS. After considering these issues, the panel did not suggest ICS as an additive therapy to long-acting bronchodilators in patients with COPD and blood eosinophilia, except for those patients with a history of one or more exacerbations in the past year.

### Change is in the air: key questions on the 'treatable traits' model for chronic airway diseases in primary care [^115DX4tv]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale for implementing a Treatable Traits approach in clinical practice

Conceptual advantages

Asthma and COPD guidelines have traditionally advocated a stepwise approach to adjusting treatment based on symptom control and reducing the risk of exacerbations. This has been instrumental in improving outcomes for patients, as shown by reductions in hospital admission and mortality in the 1990s to early 2000s. However, progress has stalled with no overall improvements to asthma and COPD mortality observed between 2001 and 2017. This slowed progress may be attributed to the fact that guidelines are largely informed by evidence derived from grouped mean data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). This may result in treatment algorithms biased towards the greatest efficacy for the majority, but not necessarily the most appropriate treatment for each individual patient. Further, the stepwise approach assumes that (1) symptoms are driven by the same mechanisms in individual patients, and (2) symptom control is achieved by following the 'one-size-fits-all' treatment algorithm, although this is not always the case. In fact, in many patients, elimination of symptoms and restoration of normal lung function cannot be achieved, and pursuing this unattainable goal by progressively increasing treatment may lead to patient and clinician frustration, as well as adverse effects from high-dose treatment. This is particularly pertinent for inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), where 80–90% of the maximal therapeutic effect may be achieved at low doses in most patients. Escalation to higher doses of ICS should be preceded by both confirmation of adherence to treatment and the presence of the relevant biological processes targeted by corticosteroids (elevated blood eosinophils or fractional exhaled nitric oxide [FeNO]). In addition, current asthma guidelines advocate stepping down treatment when asthma symptoms are controlled. While stepping down treatment may be appropriate in certain circumstances, a universal step-down model risks the false assumption that treatment targets and disease characteristics are homogenous in all patients. It also assumes that a short-term increase in treatment can, in some way, change the underlying disease pathophysiology to reduce future requirement for treatment. By contrast, in COPD, the Global Initiative for Chronic Lung Disease (GOLD) recommends assessing two key TTs (dyspnoea and exacerbations) to manage patients during follow-up and rarely recommends stepping down treatment, with the exception of patients on ICS who suffer from, or are at risk of, pneumonia, in whom stopping ICS is an option for consideration.

### Practical approach to the patient with hypereosinophilia [^111FjYud]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Markedly increased blood eosinophilia (ie, ≥ 1.5 x 10(9)/L), whether discovered fortuitously or found with signs and symptoms of associated organ involvement, commands diagnostic evaluation and often therapeutic interventions. This degree of hypereosinophilia is often but not uniformly associated with eosinophilic infiltration of tissues that can potentially lead to irreversible, life-threatening organ damage. Initial approaches focus on ascertaining that eosinophilia is not secondary to other underlying disease processes, including helminthic parasite infections, varied types of adverse reactions to medications, and other eosinophil-associated syndromes, such as eosinophilic gastroenteritides, eosinophilic pneumonias, and Churg-Strauss syndrome vasculitis. If evaluations exclude eosinophilia attributable to secondary causes or other eosinophil-related syndromes or organ-specific diseases, attention must be directed to considerations of varied other forms of the hypereosinophilic syndromes, which include myeloproliferative variants, lymphocytic variants, and many of still unknown causes. Cognizant of the capacities of eosinophils to mediate tissue damage, the varied causes for hypereosinophilia are considered, and a contemporary stepwise practical approach to the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hypereosinophilia is presented.

A 43-year-old woman presented with a presumed lower respiratory tract infection, with symptoms of persistent cough, lethargy, fevers and night sweats. Initial general practitioner assessment revealed raised C reactive protein and a leucocytosis comprising both a neutrophilia and an eosinophilia. The patient was initially treated for bacterial pneumonia. Despite treatment, the patient's condition did not improve and hospital admission was arranged for further investigation. Initial physical examination was unremarkable. A chest X-ray revealed bilateral, symmetrical, peripheral consolidation with an upper zone predominance. Subsequently, endobronchial washings revealed abundant eosinophils. A diagnosis of idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia was made, and the patient responded well to oral corticosteroids with complete resolution of radiological appearances 1month later.

### Balancing benefits and risks: Do inhaled corticosteroids modify the lung microbiome? [^116YUKKk]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are common and powerful antiinflammatory medications. Because of their myriad effects on the immune system, they are capable of both facilitating infections and ameliorating their outcomes. In pulmonary medicine, chronic oral glucocorticoid therapy is a well-recognized risk factor for infections such as Pneumocystis pneumonia. However, glucocorticoids also serve as adjunctive treatment for severe Pneumocystis pneumonia, coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. The appropriate use of inhaled glucocorticoids in chronic inflammatory lung diseases is similarly complex. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the first line of therapy for asthma, for which they improve outcomes, but their use in COPD is much more complicated. Current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines recommend restricting ICS use to patients with a significant history of COPD exacerbations or peripheral eosinophilia because of the increased risk of pneumonia seen with these drugs in COPD. Thus, in COPD, we recognize that although glucocorticoids prevent and treat COPD exacerbations, they also increase the risk of pulmonary infection.

### Dupilumab (Dupixent) [^1117ZmNV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3	Eosinophilic Conditions

Patients being treated for asthma may present with clinical features of eosinophilic pneumonia or eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). These events may be associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Healthcare providers should be alert to vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, kidney injury, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients with eosinophilia. Cases of eosinophilic pneumonia were reported in adults who participated in the asthma development program. Cases of EGPA have been reported with DUPIXENT in adults who participated in the asthma development program as well as in adults with co-morbid asthma in the CRSwNP development program. Advise patients to report signs of eosinophilic pneumonia and EGPA to their healthcare provider. Consider withholding DUPIXENT if eosinophilic pneumonia or EGPA are suspected.

5.4	Acute Symptoms of Asthma or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or Acute Deteriorating Disease

DUPIXENT should not be used to treat acute symptoms or acute exacerbations of asthma or COPD. Do not use DUPIXENT to treat acute bronchospasm or status asthmaticus. Patients should seek medical advice if their asthma or COPD remains uncontrolled or worsens after initiation of treatment with DUPIXENT.

5.5	Risk Associated with Abrupt Reduction of Corticosteroid Dosage

Do not discontinue systemic, topical, or inhaled corticosteroids abruptly upon initiation of therapy with DUPIXENT. Reductions in corticosteroid dose, if appropriate, should be gradual and performed under the direct supervision of a healthcare provider. Reduction in corticosteroid dose may be associated with systemic withdrawal symptoms and/or unmask conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy.

5.6	Patients with Co-morbid Asthma

Advise patients with co-morbid asthma not to adjust or stop their asthma treatments without consultation with their physicians.

5.7 Psoriasis

Cases of new-onset psoriasis have been reported with the use of DUPIXENT for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and asthma, including in patients without a family history of psoriasis. In postmarketing reports, onset of psoriasis varied from weeks to months after the first dose of DUPIXENT and resulted in partial or complete resolution of psoriasis with discontinuation of dupilumab, with or without use of supplemental treatment for psoriasis (topical or systemic). Those who continued on dupilumab received supplemental treatment for psoriasis to improve associated symptoms. Advise patients to report new-onset psoriasis symptoms to their healthcare provider. If symptoms persist or worsen, consider dermatologic evaluation and/or discontinuation of DUPIXENT.

### Imaging of eosinophilic lung diseases [^113E33My]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic lung diseases encompass a broad range of conditions wherein patients present with pulmonary opacities and eosinophilia of the serum, pulmonary tissue, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Many of these entities can be idiopathic or are secondary to parasitic infection, exposure to drugs, toxins, or radiation. These diseases exhibit a wide range of imaging findings, including consolidation, ground-glass opacities, nodules, and masses. Diagnoses often require bronchoalveolar lavage and/or biopsy to confirm respiratory eosinophilia and to exclude other entities, such as infection or malignancy. Treatment entails administration of corticosteroids, removal of inciting agents, and treatment of underlying infection.

### Blood eosinophils and inhaled corticosteroid / long-acting β-2 agonist efficacy in COPD [^1136azDM]. Thorax (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are an important treatment for COPD. Exacerbations, defined as acute worsening of symptoms necessitating treatment with antibiotics and/or systemic corticosteroids or hospitalisation, are a key determinant of COPD morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. Compared with placebo, ICS such as fluticasone propionate (FP) and budesonide reduce exacerbations by up to 20% as monotherapy, and up to 30% in combination with a long-acting β 2 -agonist (LABA). National and international guidelines on the management of COPDrecommend that patients with COPD at risk of exacerbations receive ICS/LABA maintenance therapy.

The TOwards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study showed that ICS treatment was associated with an increased risk of non-fatal pneumonia in patients with FP-treated COPD, now recognised as an ICS class effect. The reconsideration of potential risks associated with ICS treatment, weighed against its known benefits, has motivated the search for biomarkers to inform COPD treatment decisions.

A predictive marker for ICS (or ICS/LABA) effectiveness in preventing COPD exacerbations could aid clinical decision-making by identifying patients likely to gain the most benefit from ICS-based treatment. Blood eosinophil count may provide such a marker. Studies have demonstrated associations between airway eosinophilia and exacerbations of chronic bronchitisand COPD. Exacerbations are heterogeneous, presenting as one of four distinct phenotypes, and airway eosinophilia in the stable state was found to be predictive of subsequent exacerbation phenotype. Relationships between sputum eosinophilia and steroid responsiveness in COPD have also been reported. The use of systemic corticosteroids in patients experiencing acute exacerbations of COPD has shown greater benefit in patients with a blood eosinophil level of ≥ 2% versus those with < 2%. There is also evidence for an association between airway eosinophilia with response to systemic corticosteroids for FEV 1 and quality of life. A recent retrospective analysis of data from two parallel 1-year studies of once-daily ICS/LABA, fluticasone furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) in patients with moderate-to-very severe COPD showed a greater reduction of moderate and severe exacerbations in patients with a blood eosinophil level ≥ 2% vs < 2% when treated with FF/VI compared with VI alone.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) — initial pharmacotherapy and ICS use: Commence treatment as in the current GOLD strategy report with symptomatic treatment with long-acting bronchodilators (LABA and LAMA); use of inhaled corticosteroids is strongly favored for patients with ≥ 2 exacerbations/year requiring oral corticosteroids (OCS) or blood eosinophils ≥ 300/μL; ICS should not be used alone without LABA and/or LAMA; inhaled therapy should be optimized to reduce the need for OCS; in patients with features of COPD, high-dose ICS should be avoided because of the risk of pneumonia.

A middle-aged woman presented with symptoms suggestive of allergic asthma but with markedly elevated peripheral eosinophilia. She did not respond to inhaled corticosteroids, thereby prompting further investigations. Chest radiograph was normal. CT of the chest revealed bi-apical ground glass opacities. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed predominantly eosinophilic yield. Autoimmune screen was negative. Bone marrow biopsy showed a normocellular marrow with increased eosinophils. A diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) was made after exclusion of other causes of eosinophilia. Treatment of her CEP with systemic corticosteroids (prednisolone 0.5mg/kg/day) resulted in dramatic improvement in symptoms and peripheral eosinophilia.

### Optimal dose of maintenance steroid therapy for relapse of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: a multicentre retrospective study [^115AyQ5W]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In this study, the prednisolone doses required to achieve relapse-free rates of 50% (ED 50) were 7.2 mg (95% CI, 4.6 to 23.6) in the relapse group. To the best of our knowledge, no other study has assessed the optimal MST dose associated with CEP relapse. In cases of repeated relapse, tapering of steroids to near ED 50 should be prioritised once the disease is controlled. Additionally, clinicians should evaluate individual minimal EDs and consider indications for additional biological therapy.

Relapses are typically managed by resuming or increasing steroid therapy. A previous prospective study has shown no significant difference in the relapse rate between the 3- and 6 month prednisolone treatment groups for CEP. This result supports our hypothetical model assuming a Markov process where the relapse group had a permanent possibility of relapse regardless of previous steroid treatment. The ED 50 of prednisolone doses in this study was 7.2 mg, falling within the average range of 5.4–11.8 mg reported in previous studies. One issue contributing to variability in maintenance doses reported across studies is overtreatment because of non-optimised dosing for relapse prevention. The 7.2 mg prednisolone dose calculated as ED 50 in this study may not represent the optimal MST dose, as individual requirements vary. Another issue involves determining steroid doses relative to body weight. Prednisolone was calculated as a pure dose owing to the narrow distribution of mean (± SD) height (161.9 ± 9.4 cm) and weight (55.6 ± 8.7 kg) in the relapse group. For individuals with obesity, the dose should be based on ideal, rather than total, body weight. Obesity affects the uptake, storage and metabolism of glucocorticoids; however, findings on this relationship are mixed. One study reported that each 1% increase in baseline body mass index was linked to a 2.9% decrease in cortisol wake-up levels and total area under the curve, suggesting that a higher body mass index suppresses cortisol.

### Acute eosinophilic pneumonia: correlation of clinical characteristics with underlying cause [^115iMYea]. Chest (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is an uncommon disease, often indistinguishable from ARDS or community-acquired pneumonia at initial presentation. AEP can be idiopathic, but identifiable causes include medications and inhalational exposures, including cigarette smoke.

Methods

Using a computer-assisted search, we retrospectively identified and reviewed the medical records of all patients diagnosed with AEP between January 1, 1998, and June 30, 2016, at our institution. Demographic and clinical data were extracted, including exposures (occupational, environmental, recreational, pharmacologic, and smoking), laboratory and radiologic findings, treatments, hospitalization (including ICU stay), and subsequent clinical course.

Results

Among 36 consecutive patients with AEP, 11 were smoking-related cases, six were medication-related cases and 19 were idiopathic. Smoking-related AEP included six first-time smokers and five ex-smokers who had resumed smoking after a period of abstinence. Patients with smoking-related AEP were younger compared with both medication-related and idiopathic AEP cases (median age: 22 vs 47.5 vs 55 years, respectively; p = 0.004). Patients with smoking-related AEP were less likely to be associated with peripheral eosinophilia at presentation (36% vs 50% vs 58%; p = 0.52) but more likely to be hospitalized (100% vs 50% vs 63%; p = 0.039), including a longer ICU stay, compared with medication-related and idiopathic cases.

Conclusions

AEP is associated with a good prognosis when recognized and treated promptly. Compared with medication-related and idiopathic AEP, smoking-related AEP was less likely to be associated with peripheral eosinophilia at presentation but was characterized by more severe disease manifestations.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is traditionally classified into acute, subacute and chronic forms. A high index of suspicion and a detailed investigation into the patient's environment is the key to diagnosis and treatment of HP. Eosinophilic lung diseases can be broadly categorized as idiopathic (acute eosinophilic pneumonia, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis and hypereosinophilic syndromes), those with known cause (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, drugs, parasitic and non-parasitic infections), and those associated with other known lung diseases (asthma, interstitial lung diseases and lung cancers). A detailed review of drug intake, toxin exposures, and travel history is essential in the differential diagnosis of eosinophilic lung diseases.

### Guidelines on the management of acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111t6ft5]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2019). High credibility.

GRADE recommendation statement

The use of corticosteroids in established ARDS should be the subject of a suitably powered, multicentre RCT with long-term follow-up (GRADE Recommendation: research recommendation).

GRADE recommendation justification

Current evidence includes the possibility of substantial patient benefit and the risk of harm appears small, although the group noted that the trials did not include longer term follow-up of survivors. However, the evidence is of low to very low quality from clinical trials, which were mostly conducted before the current era of lung protective ventilation. In addition, the lack of sufficient power in any individual study or in the combined MA and the heterogeneity of the dose, timing and agent used also influenced the decision. The group believed that a position of equipoise exists and the research recommendation reflects this view.

As a caveat, it is worth mentioning that specific steroid responsive disorders may mimic ARDS, for example, pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia and diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.

Implications for future research

A large, multicentre study on steroids in established ARDS is currently planned.

### Inhaled steroids, circulating eosinophils, chronic airway infection, and pneumonia risk in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A network analysis [^111LbYBQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) is controversial, because it can reduce the risk of future exacerbations of the disease at the expense of increasing the risk of pneumonia. Objectives: To assess the relationship between the presence of chronic bronchial infection (CBI), reduced number of circulating eosinophils, ICS treatment, and the risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD. Methods: This was a post hoc long-term observational study of an historical cohort of 201 patients with COPD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease II-IV) who were carefully characterized (including airway microbiology) and followed for a median of 84 months. Results were analyzed by multivariate Cox regression and network analysis. Measurements and Main Results: Mean age was 70.3 years, 90.5% of patients were male, mean FEV 1 was 49%, 71.6% of patients were treated with ICS, 57.2% of them had bronchiectasis, and 20.9% had < 100 blood eosinophils/μl. Pathogenic microorganisms were isolated in 42.3% of patients, and 22.4% of patients fulfilled the definition of CBI. During follow-up, 38.8% of patients suffered one or more episodes of pneumonia, with CBI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.635) and < 100 eosinophils/μl (HR, 1.975) being independently associated with the risk of pneumonia, particularly when both coexist (HR, 3.126). ICS treatment increased the risk of pneumonia in those patients with < 100 eosinophils/μl and CBI (HR, 2.925). Conclusions: Less than 100 circulating eosinophils/μl combined with the presence of CBI increase the risk of pneumonia in patients with COPD treated with ICS.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) triple therapy evidence — In randomized controlled trials of triple therapy with an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), long-acting antimuscarinic agent (LAMA), and long-acting beta agonist (LABA) among patients with moderate to severe airflow obstruction and a history of one or more moderate to severe acute exacerbations within the prior year, triple therapy decreased the frequency of moderate to severe exacerbations, improved QoL and improved FEV1 versus single or dual therapy, with no differences between separate versus combined devices; triple therapy did not increase serious or total adverse events, while studies inconsistently reported an association with increased pneumonia compared to LABA/LAMA. A meta-analysis estimated a number needed to treat of 38 to prevent an acute exacerbation versus LABA/LAMA dual therapy and a number needed to harm of 195 for pneumonia. The use of separate devices may require multiple inhaler types and techniques and thus limit adherence, and pre-specified secondary analyses showed benefit across groups but suggested heterogeneous magnitude of benefit among COPD phenotypes potentially influenced by frequency of exacerbations, active smoking status, and/or blood eosinophil counts.

COPD on LABA+LAMA+ICS — ICS withdrawal and eosinophil risk: Patients treated with LABA+LAMA+ICS should not have the ICS component withdrawn unless the inhaled corticosteroids were started inappropriately, there has been no response to ICS, they experience significant side-effects, or severe or recurrent pneumonia. The risks and benefits of discontinuing ICS should be considered. If blood eosinophils are ≥ 300 cells/μL de-escalation is more likely to be associated with the development of exacerbations.

### Co-treatment with steroid and dupilumab for eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis after eosinophilic pneumonitis caused by dupilumab [^111c8cLw]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Eosinophilic chronic rhinosinusitis (ECRS) is a Type 2 inflammatory disease that manifests as chronic inflammation of the paranasal sinus. IL-4/IL-13 receptor monoclonal antibodies (dupilumab) to suppress Type 2 inflammation have become a good treatment option for patients who are refractory to surgery. Most patients respond normally, although significant side effects such as eosinophilic pneumonia may occur, requiring discontinuation of dupilumab. Here, we present a case in which dupilumab administration caused a side-effect of eosinophilic pneumonia. A 65-year-old woman presented with nasal obstruction and olfactory dysfunction due to a nasal polyp. Her symptoms temporarily improved with dupilumab; however, dupilumab was discontinued due to eosinophilic pneumonia. Discontinuation of dupilumab resulted in the rapid resolution of eosinophilic pneumonia and reappearance of nasal polyps. We, therefore, resumed dupilumab treatment in combination with low-dose steroids; eosinophilic pneumonia did not flare up, and the nasal polyps shrank steadily. There is no established treatment strategy in cases where a side effect of eosinophilic pneumonia arises while treating ECRS with dupilumab. Based on the described case, we recommend that a combination of a low-dose steroids and dupilumab be considered as a treatment option to counter the side-effect of eosinophilic pneumonia induced by dupilumab alone.

5.7	Immunizations

Prior to initiating therapy with YESINTEK, patients should receive all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with YESINTEK should avoid receiving live vaccines. Avoid administering BCG vaccines during treatment with YESINTEK or for one year prior to initiating treatment or one year following discontinuation of treatment. Caution is advised when administering live vaccines to household contacts of patients receiving YESINTEK because of the potential risk for shedding from the household contact and transmission to patient.

### Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia [^114e4Xyf]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

A 44-year-old asthmatic male patient presented to the health centre with a 3-week history of coryzal symptoms, persistent productive sputum and shortness of breath. The chest X-ray (CXR) revealed symmetrical, perihilar airspace shadowed with peribronchial cuffing and bilateral reticular markings. The patient did not improve despite treatment, and hence a high resolution CT (HRCT) scan of the thorax was recommended. The HRCT showed smooth interlobular septal thickening, central perihilar soft tissue thickening and patches of ground glass changes. Both the CXR and HRCT findings, along with the symptoms and eosinophilia counts, were suggestive of idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia (IAEP) which was confirmed on bronchoalveolar lavage. The patient was successfully treated with steroids. This case highlights the symptoms, diagnosis, management and treatment of IAEP. A rapid diagnosis of this rare disease is essential since it can be completely cured with correct management but can be fatal if left untreated. Once properly treated, this disease does not recur.

### Circulating neutrophils levels are a predictor of pneumonia risk in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^1129us3U]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study objectives

This post-hoc meta-analysis evaluated data derived from 10 clinical trials within the GlaxoSmithKline plc. (GSK) clinical trial registry to assess the potential relationship between baseline blood neutrophil count and incidence of pneumonia in patients with moderate or severe COPD.

Search criteria and studies

The GSK clinical trials database was searched for GSK-sponsored trials of ≥ 24 weeks' duration with evaluable, patient-level data for baseline neutrophil and eosinophil counts. Selected trials were randomized, double-blind, clinical trials of COPD patients with at least one ICS-containing arm, a control arm (non-ICS containing), and pre-randomization measurements of blood neutrophil and eosinophil counts. Search criteria specified that a trial must include a fluticasone furoate (FF) plus vilanterol (VI) or fluticasone propionate (FP) plus salmeterol (SAL) arm. Therefore, the ICS-containing treatments considered for this study were FF or FP alone or in combination with a LABA, and the non-ICS-containing treatments included any treatment not containing FF or FP.

Patients included in these studies were aged ≥ 40 years, had an established diagnosis of COPD, and a smoking history of ≥ 10 pack-years, in line with American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines.

### Eosinophilic lung diseases [^116bAoBg]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

In the last 30 years studies have shown that the lungs have been the target of eosinophilic migration producing eosinophilic lung diseases (ELD) secondary to allergens, irritants, parasites, infections, antibodies and drugs. Specific diagnoses can be made by: (1) Peripheral blood eosinophilia and chest X-ray infiltrates. (2) Lung biopsy. (3) Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In developing countries ELD are most frequently associated with parasitic infection. This paper defines, classifies and presents the clinical characteristics and treatment of these diseases with emphasis on parasitic lung problems.

### Monoclonal antibodies in idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: a scoping review [^114Audzu]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

The findings of this review are not surprising, since management with biologics is recent and ICEP is a low-frequency entity. This study has limitations arising from the quality of the included studies, as they were all observational studies and case series, so its interpretation should be carried out taking into account these limitations. Given the characteristics of the included studies, it is not feasible to assess their quality. Furthermore, this makes it impossible to extrapolate the results to all patients with ICEP.

Research in this field needs to be expanded. There need to be more cohort studies or case-series studies in real-world settings, where the impact on the quality of life of the patients is considered and the follow-up time of the patients after the start of the evaluated drug is clearly described.

### Hypereosinophilic syndrome in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia [^114VuUy3]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe key diagnostic considerations in patients with pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia, with a special emphasis on raising awareness of hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), a disease that often involves the lungs and prompts investigation for clonal neoplastic processes that determine prognosis and treatment.

Data Sources

Studies and review articles were selected from PubMed and Scopus for relevance to pertinent topics.

Study Selections

The literature was screened for studies that described lung eosinophilia and HES. Studies relevant to the topic were included in this review.

Results

Pulmonary eosinophil infiltrates in lung biopsy specimens present a broad differential diagnosis, including eosinophilic pneumonia; hypersensitivity reactions, such as allergic bronchopulmonary fungal disease; and pulmonary manifestations of systemic diseases, such as eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. An additional important consideration in the differential diagnosis is pulmonary involvement by HES. HES is a rare syndrome that comprises a heterogeneous group of conditions characterized by persistent blood and/or tissue eosinophilia associated with organ dysfunction. Approximately one-third of HES cases are caused by neoplastic diseases, with the remaining cases classified as reactive or idiopathic. Lung involvement is seen in up to 67% of cases and may be the presenting manifestation of the disorder.

Conclusion

The differential diagnosis of pulmonary eosinophilia is broad and requires a multidisciplinary approach with clinicopathologic-radiologic correlation.

### Rational use of inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of COPD [^116Ajmib]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of treatment for asthma, but their role in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is debated. Recent randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in patients with COPD and frequent or severe exacerbations demonstrated a significant reduction (~25%) in exacerbations with ICS in combination with dual bronchodilator therapy (triple therapy). However, the suggestion of a mortality benefit associated with ICS in these trials has since been rejected by the European Medicines Agency and US Food and Drug Administration. Observational evidence from routine clinical practice demonstrates that dual bronchodilation is associated with better clinical outcomes than triple therapy in a broad population of patients with COPD and infrequent exacerbations. This reinforces guideline recommendations that ICS-containing maintenance therapy should be reserved for patients with frequent or severe exacerbations and high blood eosinophils (~10% of the COPD population), or those with concomitant asthma. However, data from routine clinical practice indicate ICS overuse, with up to 50–80% of patients prescribed ICS. Prescription of ICS in patients not fulfilling guideline criteria puts patients at unnecessary risk of pneumonia and other long-term adverse events and also has cost implications, without any clear benefit in disease control. In this article, we review the benefits and risks of ICS use in COPD, drawing on evidence from RCTs and observational studies conducted in primary care. We also provide a practical guide to prescribing ICS, based on the latest global treatment guidelines, to help primary care providers identify patients for whom the benefits of ICS outweigh the risks.

### Interstitial lung diseases in the hospitalized patient [^116HWXAK]. BMC Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are disorders of the lung parenchyma. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and prognosis of ILDs vary depending on the underlying disease. The onset of most ILDs is insidious, but they may also present subacutely or require hospitalization for management. ILDs that may present subacutely include acute interstitial pneumonia, connective tissue disease-associated ILDs, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, drug-induced ILDs, and acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Prognosis and response to therapy depend on the type of underlying ILD being managed.

Discussion

This opinion piece discusses approaches to differentiating ILDs in the hospitalized patient, emphasizing the role of bronchoscopy and surgical lung biopsy. We then consider pharmacologic treatments and the use of mechanical ventilation in hospitalized patients with ILD. Finally, lung transplantation and palliative care as treatment modalities are considered.

Summary

The diagnosis of ILD in hospitalized patients requires input from multiple disciplines. The prognosis of ILDs presenting acutely vary depending on the underlying ILD. Patients with advanced ILD or acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis have poor outcomes. The mainstay treatment in these patients is supportive care, and mechanical ventilation should only be used in these patients as a bridge to lung transplantation.

### Stability in eosinophil categorisation during subsequent severe exacerbations of COPD [^1173SsJv]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

The use of corticosteroids, inhaled (ICS) or systemic, plays an important role in the maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and in its associated acute exacerbations (AECOPD). Although beneficial for some, corticosteroids could be detrimental for others because of lack of efficacy combined with potential side effects such as pneumonia, hyperglycaemia, osteoporosis and venous thromboembolism. More and more focus is on how to select patients who probably will not benefit from corticosteroid use and in whom exposure to corticosteroids can safely be reduced or withheld.

In recent years, blood eosinophil count has shown to be a promising biomarker for establishing personalised treatment strategies to reduce corticosteroid use in COPD. Elevated blood eosinophil count, as a surrogate marker for sputum eosinophilia, is associated with better steroid responsiveness. In stable-state COPD, it has become clear that the blood eosinophil count, in combination with clinical assessment, can be used to determine the treatment effect of ICS use. This has been incorporated in the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2019 report.

Two studies found evidence for an eosinophil-guided strategy for systemic steroid use also in acute exacerbations. Defining an AECOPD to be eosinophilic and defining the stability of an eosinophilic AECOPD phenotype over time are both vitally dependent on the chosen cut-off level and the expression of the eosinophil as an absolute or a relative count. The study of Bafadhel et al was in outpatients with a cut-off level of eosinophil count > 2% of total leucocytes. The study of Sivapalan et al in inpatients used the cut-off of an absolute eosinophil count > 0.3×10⁹ cells/L. With their limitations, both studies showed that eosinophil-guided steroid use is non-inferior to standard systemic steroids during AECOPD and leads to a lower cumulative steroid exposure.

### Single-inhaler triple therapy in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a systematic review [^116LCSB5]. Respiratory Research (2019). Medium credibility.

The IMPACT study reported a benefit in the risk of time to all-cause mortality for triple therapy compared to LAMA/LABA. As none of the single-inhaler triple therapy studies were powered for a mortality outcome, these results should be treated with caution and investigated further. Two prospective, adequately-powered, large-scale studies with a primary outcome of mortality failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in mortality associated with the use of ICS-containing regimens.

Our review attempted to determine whether the benefits associated with triple therapy in COPD were clinically meaningful by assessing and comparing relative and absolute improvements in outcomes as well as the NNT. These latter results are of interest as they translate the results of randomised trials into a value that clinicians can use in decision making. Focusing on the 12-month trials, we found relatively high NNTs for therapy at 12 months (> 20) in terms of reducing the numbers of individuals experiencing exacerbations but lower NNTs (3 to 11) for reducing one exacerbation per patient per year. The discrepancy between these two numbers suggests that the impact of triple therapy is not necessarily to increase the number of patients staying exacerbation free, but that the largest effect is in reducing the number of events in patients having multiple events. Such patients are most likely the high-risk individuals with a higher rate of baseline exacerbations and blood eosinophilia as suggested by the subgroup data. The evidence therefore supports a targeted approach to triple therapy use in those patients at highest risk of exacerbation with higher levels of blood eosinophilia. It also implies that the vast majority of patients with a lower baseline risk of exacerbation and lower blood eosinophilia may experience less benefit from ICS, as reflected in the GOLD update. The increased risk of ICS, particularly in relation to pneumonia, is well documented, and likely to vary by treatment-related factors (e.g. regimen and dose) and study design-related factors (e.g. patient characteristics and definitions used). In the present study, the pneumonia risk for single-inhaler triple therapy ranged from no reported increase to a significant increase. Taking the study demonstrating the highest risk and translating it into an event-based number needed to harm (NNH) to induce pneumonia in at least one patient over one year, gives an NNH of 33.

### Eosinophilic pneumonia associated with azacitidine in a patient with myelodysplastic syndrome [^111FURua]. Respiratory Care (2012). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic pneumonia is characterized by cough, lung infiltrates on imaging, and by the presence of eosinophils in the alveoli and pulmonary interstitium. Azacitidine, a pyramidine nucleoside analog of cytidine, is FDA approved for the treatment of various myelodysplastic syndromes. We present a case of a 76-year-old man with recently diagnosed myelodysplastic syndrome, who developed eosinophilic pneumonia after initiating therapy with azacitidine. There was clinical and radiographic improvement with cessation of the drug and treatment with prednisone. Diagnosis of drug-induced eosinophilic pneumonia is established by having a temporal relationship between onset of symptoms and initiation of therapy, bronchoalveolar lavage or lung biopsy evidence of pulmonary eosinophilia, no other explanation for the disease, and improvement upon cessation of the offending agent. Our case illustrates the need for a high index of suspicion to identify adverse pulmonary reactions associated with newly developed medications.

### Eosinophilia in pulmonary disorders [^111JsCsM]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Lung disease associated with marked peripheral blood eosinophilia is unusual and nearly always clinically significant. Once recognized, it is generally easy to manage, albeit with long-term systemic corticosteroids. A failure to respond to oral steroids in the context of good compliance suggests a malignant cause for the eosinophilia. An important development is the introduction of antieosinophil therapies, particularly those directed against the interleukin 5 pathway, which is hoped to provide benefit in the full spectrum of eosinophilic lung disease as well as asthma, reducing the burden of side effects and resultant comorbidities.

### Association of blood eosinophils with corticosteroid treatment failure stratified by smoking status among inpatients with AECOPD [^111Az9Zo]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Table 2
The relationship between blood eosinophil percentage and corticosteroid treatment failure among inpatients with AECOPD

The treatment failure rates were 29.4% for the non-smoker group and 27.0% for the smoker group, respectively. After adjusting all covariates, the association between smoking and the risk of treatment failure was not significant for smoker group; the OR was 0.85 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.04), compared with non-smoker group (online supplemental table 1).

Without adjustment for confounders, the rate of treatment failure was the highest in the non-smoker and low eosinophilic group and lowest in the smoker and high eosinophilic group (table 3). After multivariable adjustment, the ORs for treatment failure were 0.70 (95% CI 0.52 to 0.96) for non-smoker and high eosinophilic group, 0.82 (95% CI 0.64 to 1.05) for smoker and low eosinophilic group, 0.62 (95% CI 0.47 to 0.81) for smoker and high eosinophilic group, compared with non-smoker and low eosinophilic group (table 3). The secondary outcomes are also presented in table 3, with results being approximately consistent with the primary outcome, except for incident pneumonia during hospitalisation, death during hospitalisation or within 30 days after discharge and AECOPD readmission within 30 days of discharge. In the multivariable model, the ORs for AECOPD readmission within 30 days after discharge were 0.42 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.88) for the non-smoker and high eosinophilic group, 0.50 (95% CI 0.31 to 0.81) for the smoker and low eosinophilic group and 0.67 (95% CI 0.40 to 1.12) for the smoker and high eosinophilic group (table 3).

### Acute eosinophilic pneumonia in the deployed military setting [^116fVS5h]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is a rare but important cause of severe respiratory failure most typically caused by cigarette smoking, but can also be caused by medications, illicit drugs, infections and environmental exposures. There is growing evidence that disease severity varies and not all patients require mechanical ventilation or even supplemental oxygen.

Objectives

To compare patients with AEP treated at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) to those in other published series, and to provide recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment of AEP.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was completed on forty-three cases of AEP which were identified from March 2003 through March 2010 at LRMC, Germany.

Results

Tobacco smoking was reported by 91% of our patients. Only 33% of patients in our series had a fever (temperature > 100.4 °F) at presentation. Peripheral eosinophilia (> 5%) was present in 35% on initial CBC, but was seen in 72% of patients during their hospital course. Hypoxemia, as measured by PaO2/FiO2 ratio, seemed to be less severe in patients with higher levels of bronchoalveolar (BAL) eosinophilia percentage.

Conclusions

Based on our experience and literature review, we recommend adjustments to the diagnostic criteria which may increase consideration of this etiology for acute respiratory illnesses as well as provide clinical clues we have found particularly helpful. Similar to recent reports of initial peripheral eosinophilia correlating with less severe presentation we found that higher BAL eosinophilia correlated with less severe hypoxemia.

### Asthmatic adult with marked blood eosinophilia: is it truly asthma? [^111Hz7tY]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Peripheral blood eosinophilia is frequently encountered in the general medical and respiratory clinics. Asthma is often associated with peripheral eosinophilia, however, marked levels of eosinophilia are uncommon and should warrant further investigation. The patient described in this article presented with an initial diagnosis of allergic asthma but failed to respond to inhaled corticosteroids. Marked blood eosinophilia prompted the investigation for other eosinophilic lung diseases, which eventually yielded a diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP). This article illustrates the importance of a high index of suspicion for eosinophilic lung diseases should patients previously diagnosed as allergic asthma fail to respond to therapy, especially if this was associated with marked blood eosinophilia.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^1111cf8t]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

COPD exacerbations — systemic and inhaled glucocorticoids: Data indicate that systemic glucocorticoids in COPD exacerbations shorten recovery time and improve lung function, and also improve oxygenation, the risk of early relapse, treatment failure, and the length of hospitalization. A dose of 40 mg prednisolone-equivalent per day for 5 days is recommended; therapy with oral prednisolone is equally effective to intravenous administration, and nebulized budesonide alone may be a suitable alternative that provides similar benefits to intravenous methylprednisolone. Observational and safety data note that even short bursts are associated with subsequent increased risk of pneumonia, sepsis and death and use should be confined to patients with significant exacerbations, and longer courses are associated with an increased risk of pneumonia and mortality. Recent studies suggest that glucocorticoids may be less efficacious to treat acute COPD exacerbations in patients with lower levels of blood eosinophils. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT (STARR2), prednisolone therapy guided by blood eosinophil count during acute COPD exacerbation was non-inferior to standard care including systematic prednisolone treatment (30 mg per day for 14 days) and allowed a 33% reduction in the proportion of patients receiving prednisolone; the authors concluded that blood eosinophil-directed prednisolone can be used to safely reduce systemic glucocorticoid use in clinical practice.

### Eosinophilic lung diseases [^116sMZEe]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Eosinophilic lung diseases comprise eosinophilic pneumonia, which may present with chronic or acute onset, or as Löffler syndrome. The diagnosis of eosinophilic pneumonia relies on clinical imaging and the demonstration of alveolar eosinophilia. Lung biopsy is generally not necessary. Peripheral blood eosinophilia is common but may be absent at presentation in idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia, which may be misdiagnosed as severe infectious pneumonia. Extra-thoracic manifestations should raise the suspicion of Churg-Strauss syndrome. All possible causes of eosinophilia (especially fungus infection or drug or toxic exposure) must be thoroughly investigated before the diagnosis of idiopathic disease is made.

### Early diagnosis based on clinical history and BALF for successful management of smoking-induced acute eosinophilic pneumonia without unnecessary antibiotic usage: a case report [^114seCNc]. The Journal of Asthma (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) is a rapid onset and severe respiratory illness characterized by acute febrile respiratory insufficiency, eosinophilic infiltration in the lungs and unique findings on chest imaging. Difficulty in differentiating from other respiratory distress caused by community-acquired pneumonia may result in a delayed diagnosis or treatment with empirical antibiotics.

Case Study

Sixteen-year-old boy who developed AEP with marked eosinophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF, 36.6%), decreased diffusion capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (62%) and unique radiological findings. Although he initially denied tobacco use, on repeated thorough clinical history questioning, he eventually admitted beginning smoking 19 days before the onset of symptoms with gradually increasing frequency.

Results

His symptoms resolved quickly without use of antibiotics after cessation of tobacco and treatment with corticosteroids.

Conclusion

Careful clinical history taking regarding tobacco use combined with early examination of BALF and recognition of unique radiological findings are critical for proper management of AEP.

### Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia: a rare cause of hypoxic respiratory failure [^115ckLU4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic Acute Eosinophilic Pneumonia (IAEP) is a life-threatening cause of hypoxic respiratory failure. IAEP is challenging to diagnose as it may mimic infectious pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Distinguishing IAEP from these alternatives is important; the mainstay of treatment for IAEP is corticosteroids, a therapy which might not otherwise be indicated. Patients treated appropriately usually experience a full recovery. In this case report we describe the presentation, evaluation, and management of a 19-year old male who presented to the emergency department (ED) in respiratory failure from IAEP. The patient was a military trainee who recently moved to the United States from Saudi Arabia. He also recently began smoking cigarettes for the first time, a known risk factor for IAEP. Upon initial presentation, the patient was in respiratory distress and had an oxygen saturation of 82% on room air. His ED diagnostic workup included chest X-ray showing diffuse interstitial thickening and chest computed tomography that demonstrated diffuse nodular opacification of pulmonary parenchyma. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) where bronchoscopy yielded cytology with 30% eosinophilia. The patient ultimately required 3 days of extra corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) due to worsening hypoxic respiratory failure. After both intravenous and outpatient oral steroid treatments, the patient went on to have a full recovery with no ongoing respiratory issues. To our knowledge, this is the first case of IAEP requiring ECMO reported in the emergency medicine literature.

### Diagnosis in just over a minute: a case of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia [^114R6iki]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) is a rare interstitial lung disease characterized by subacute dyspnea, peripheral infiltrates on imaging, and pulmonary eosinophilia. We report a case of a 48-year-old man who presented to a "minute clinic" with cough and dyspnea. After improvement on a short course of steroids for a presumptive diagnosis of bronchospasm, he presented to our hospital with symptom recurrence. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed peripheral infiltrates and bronchoscopy confirmed pulmonary eosinophilia. In this clinical vignette, we review the typical presentation of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia, and the challenges of diagnosing a rare condition that may mimic more common causes of dyspnea, especially in a "minute clinic" setting.

### Unusual presentation of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia with mild peripheral eosinophilia [^115aiEeE]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) is a rare disorder of unknown aetiology which comes under the class of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases with eosinophilia. It is classically characterised by blood and pulmonary eosinophilia, peripheral consolidation on chest radiograph and prompt response to corticosteroid therapy. We report a case of CEP in a 66-year-old man, smoker showing bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with mild peripheral eosinophilia. Our study shows that CEP can be kept as a possibility if radiological pictures are consistent, even if peripheral blood eosinophilia is mild.

Table 1
Characteristics of patients with AECOPD by blood eosinophil percentage

There were 958 (28.2%) treatment failure events occurring, including 718 (21.1%) LOS > 14 days, 128 (3.8%) ICU transfer cases, 45 (1.3%) invasive mechanical ventilation cases, 108 (3.2%) incident pneumonia cases, 69 (2.0%) deaths during hospitalisation or within 30 days after discharge and 153 (4.5%) 30-day AECOPD readmissions. The rates of treatment failure were 32.9% and 22.2% for the low eosinophilic group and high eosinophilic group, respectively. After adjustment for all covariates, including age, gender, CCI, number of AECOPD hospitalisations in the previous year, white blood cell count and antibiotic use, the high eosinophilic group had a lower risk of treatment failure than the less eosinophilic group (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.87). As compared with the low eosinophilic group, the high eosinophilic group had 29.0% lower risk (95% CI 0.60 to 0.86) of LOS > 14 days, 69.0% lower risk (95% CI 0.18 to 0.52) of being transferred to the ICU, 60% lower risk (95% CI 0.71 to 0.93) of invasive mechanical ventilation and 58% lower risk (95% CI 0.22 to 0.81) of deaths during hospitalisation or within 30 days after discharge, respectively. There was no statistical difference in incident pneumonia during hospitalisation and 30-day AECOPD readmissions between the two eosinophilic groups (table 2).

5.7 Immunizations

Prior to initiating therapy with STELARA, patients should receive all age-appropriate immunizations as recommended by current immunization guidelines. Patients being treated with STELARA should avoid receiving live vaccines. Avoid administering BCG vaccines during treatment with STELARA or for one year prior to initiating treatment or one year following discontinuation of treatment. Caution is advised when administering live vaccines to household contacts of patients receiving STELARA because of the potential risk for shedding from the household contact and transmission to patient.

Non-live vaccinations received during a course of STELARA may not elicit an immune response sufficient to prevent disease.

5.8 Noninfectious Pneumonia

Cases of interstitial pneumonia, eosinophilic pneumonia, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia have been reported during post-approval use of STELARA. Clinical presentations included cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates following one to three doses. Serious outcomes have included respiratory failure and prolonged hospitalization. Patients improved with discontinuation of therapy and in certain cases administration of corticosteroids. If diagnosis is confirmed, discontinue STELARA and institute appropriate treatment [see Postmarketing Experience (6.3)].

### Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia: a paediatric case [^1115bzkn]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia (CEP) is a rare disorder in children, characterised by respiratory and systemic symptoms, with a generally good prognosis. A 11-year-old asthmatic girl was admitted to our clinic with a 3-month history of progressive cough, dyspnoea, weight loss and asthenia. Peripheral blood eosinophilia, multiple bilateral pulmonary infiltrates to the x-ray, multiple nodules with a surrounding ground-glass halo and peripheral predominance to the chest CT suggested the diagnosis of eosinophilic lung disease (ELD). Further investigations ruled out other ELD and supported diagnosis of CEP. The response to oral corticosteroids was dramatic, no relapses were reported in 2-year follow-up while the patient was under inhaled corticosteroids for pre-existing asthma.

### Consultation for elevated blood eosinophils: clinical presentations, high value diagnostic tests, and treatment options [^1153dfKq]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2018). Low credibility.

The workup of a patient found to have eosinophilia should follow a thorough path with a detailed history and physical examination aimed at eliciting eosinophilic organ involvement, followed by histological confirmation whenever possible. The differential diagnosis of hypereosinophilia is extensive, but a rational approach beyond the history and physical examination including serologic, blood, and bone marrow cell analyses, genetic testing, and radiologic imaging can distinguish many of the causes. Often input from specialists (eg, hematology, dermatology, pulmonary, gastroenterology, and neurology) can help narrow down the possibilities and eventually result in a specific diagnosis. An accurate diagnosis is key to choosing the optimal treatment for a particular condition, and this is certainly true for eosinophilic disorders. Myeloid neoplasms that present with eosinophilia, for example, may respond to medicines that the allergist may be less accustomed to using, such as immunosuppressive agents and kinase inhibitors. Similarly, newly approved biologics that target IL-5 and eosinophils may provide new options for management. What follows is a case-based approach that helps to underscore key features of diagnosis, management, and follow-up when faced with a patient with a potential eosinophil-related disorder.

Background

ALI encompasses a spectrum of pulmonary disorders that is often accompanied by life-threatening hypoxemic respiratory failure and diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Moreover, the origins of ALI are often complex (e.g. pneumonia, sepsis, or left atrial hypertension) and not easily attributed to a defined cause. In its most dramatic clinical form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), precipitous impairment of gas exchange is associated with a high mortality rate (38.5%), especially among elderly patients. Therapy for most patients with idiopathic ALI is limited to supportive care and infection prevention. Select studies have suggested a benefit of corticosteroid therapy in a subset of patients with ALI/ARDS (e.g.). However, large prospective studies have not supported a consensus opinion for the routine use of corticosteroids.

The pathogenesis of ALI remains unclear, largely a consequence of the heterogeneity of patients coming into the ICU and the broad clinical features characteristic of ALI. The cellular mechanisms contributing to lung tissue injury in ALI are for the most part unknown, although the potential involvement of neutrophils in the development of ALI remains the focus of many studies (see for example). In particular, neutrophil-derived products (e.g. extracellular matrix degrading proteinases and reactive oxygen species), inflammatory fibrotic cytokines, and growth factors have been postulated as causative agents underlying the onset and progression of disease.

For most patients with ALI, eosinophils have not been reported as a prominent histological feature, despite their potential tissue damaging capability and their presence in a number of other well defined pulmonary diseases such as asthma and acute eosinophilic pneumonia. However, among this larger literature there are some studies that have implicated this granulocyte as either a potentially important contributor to disease or, at the least, a diagnostic biomarker of events occurring in ALI patients. Interestingly, these studies suggested a "predictive" and "discriminative" value of eosinophil activity assessments in designing an effective therapy for patients exhibiting clinical features of ALI. Unfortunately, the lack of an observable eosinophil infiltrate at the histological level remains a significant confounding issue, especially for those patients who may have been treated (even briefly) with systemic corticosteroids. In turn, the typical absence of visible eosinophils in most cases of ALI that come to biopsy has limited the further development of hypotheses and experimental studies investigating a role(s) of eosinophils in ALI.

### What is eosinophilic pneumonia? [^114fkPQo]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Ever since the pioneering work of Paul Ehrlich at the end of the 19th century, physicians have been intrigued by the mysteries of the eosinophil. In addition to its important role in host defense, there is increasing evidence that the eosinophil is also capable of host lung cellular injury. 1, 2 When stimulated, eosinophils produce a number of potentially injurious substances, including major basic protein, eosinophilic cationic protein, eosinophil. -derived neurotoxin, reactive oxygen species, peroxidase, and collagenase. 1, 3 Although eosinophil activation is incompletely understood, the cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-3, interleukin-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor4–6 have recently been found to be involved in eosinophil growth, chemotaxis, and adhesion. When present in excessive numbers, eosinophils can serve as central mediators of a number of diseases involving many different organs, including the lung.

### Eosinophilic pneumonia… [^1168HMPP]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Two women, aged 49 and 39 years, had persistent fever, marked eosinophilia, and roentgenographic evidence of ill-defined, shifting infiltrations in the lungs. Biopsy specimens were obtained in both instances. In the former case the most striking lesion was an infiltration of lobular septums and of the perivascular adventitia with eosinophils; in the other case the findings included a similar infiltration, which formed small masses of the type seen in lobar pneumonia. The first patient made a complete recovery after the biopsy. In the second patient the administration of 20 mg. of prednisone twice daily promptly abated the fever and caused the eosinophilia to disappear within one day's time. Christoforidis AJ, Molnar W.

### Infiltrative eosinophilia… [^114Bs7Jc]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Infiltrative eosinophilia is a condition characterized by a marked relative and absolute increase in the circulating mature eosinophiles and an inflammatory reaction with a profuse infiltration of this cell. It has been reported in the literature under these various names: Loeffler's syndrome, tropical eosinophilia, † acute febrile eosinophilic asthma, 21 pulmonary eosinophilia, 21 pulmonary eosinophiliosis, ‡ eosinophilic infiltration of the lungs, § eosinophilic. asthma, 40 Weingarten's syndrome, 17 pseudotuberculosis of the lungs, ∥ benign eosinophilic leukemia, familial eosinophilia, pulmonary acariasis, lecithinophil eosinophilia, †grande eosinophilié sanguinaire, 68 eosinophile lung, ‡ eosinophilia with splenomegaly, § eosinophilic pneumopaty, ∥ and pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia.
61.

Since all the reported cases present many traits in common, differing only in the degree of severity of the symptoms and their duration, it seems convenient to group them under the term infiltrative eosinophilia. Although Loeffler's syndrome implies a short clinical course with transitory roentgenological pulmonary alterations, some of Loeffler's cases showed a tendency to chronicity,… DÍAS-RIVERA RS, RAMOS-MORALES F, CINTRÓN-RIVERA AA.

### Reevaluation of eosinophilic pneumonia and its diagnostic criteria… [^111XvhXS]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Eosinophilic pneumonia has been defined as pulmonary infiltration of the lung by eosinophils that may or may not be accompanied by an excess of these cells in the peripheral blood. However, the concept of this disease and its nomenclature have not yet been established. In the present study, the clinical course of 11 cases of eosinophilic pneumonia, which were clinico-pathohistologically diagnosed and found not to be associated with organic disorders producing peripheral blood eosinophilia, were investigated extensively and compared with various types of eosinophilic pneumonia, as previously reported. Of five cases of acute eosinophilic pneumonia with a history of symptoms before diagnosis, a short clinical course, and no recurrence, four cases showed peripheral blood eosinophilia, and four cases did not require treatment with steroids.

Of six cases of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia with a history of symptoms before diagnosis, a prolonged clinical course, and recurrence, all showed peripheral blood eosinophilia, four cases required treatment with steroids, and four cases were recurrent. In one case with simultaneous occurrence of asthma and another case with asthma that occurred 4 years after the appearance of eosinophilic pneumonia, abnormal shadows on chest roentgenograms had continued for several years. These results suggested that various types of previously reported eosinophilic pneumonia classified by sex, the presence or absence of peripheral blood eosinophilia, the degree of clinical symptoms or peripheral blood eosinophilia, and the degree of abnormalities on the chest roentgenograms should be extensively reevaluated.
