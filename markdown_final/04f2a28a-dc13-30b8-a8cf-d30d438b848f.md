## Question

Treating DM 2

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principles that guide therapy. Then, I should verify first-line pharmacologic choices and when to start. Next, I will examine how to individualize treatment based on comorbidities and patient factors. After that, I need to check intensification strategies, including combination therapy and insulin. I will then review special populations, monitoring and therapeutic inertia, and finally consider emerging therapies and synthesize a practical algorithm with key takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles so I don't jump to conclusions: type 2 diabetes is progressive, so therapy should be dynamic. Management must be patient-centered and shared decision-making is essential. Nonpharmacologic measures are core. And we should avoid therapeutic inertia by reassessing and adjusting every 3–6 months if targets are not met [^e3e4a63e] [^06fba6c6] [^cef07ab2].

> I need to verify first-line pharmacotherapy. Metformin remains the preferred initial agent unless contraindicated, owing to durable A1c lowering, low hypoglycemia risk, weight neutrality or modest loss, favorable safety profile, and low cost. This is consistently endorsed by ADA 2025, Canadian 2024, and AAFP 2024 guidelines, and supported by long-standing evidence and reviews [^e3e4a63e] [^209f8081] [^41baddc5] [^f58a303a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about starting only one drug. I should confirm when combination therapy at initiation is reasonable. ADA 2025 supports considering initial combination therapy to shorten time to individualized goals, particularly when A1c is significantly above target or when comorbidities warrant early cardiorenal benefit, aligning with a more outcomes-focused, risk-stratified approach [^d76bacae] [^e3e4a63e].

> Next, I should review how to individualize beyond metformin. I need to ensure I integrate cardiovascular and renal risk, obesity, hypoglycemia risk, age, and patient preferences. For established ASCVD or high risk, or CKD, add GLP-1 receptor agonists and/or SGLT2 inhibitors independent of baseline A1c because of mortality, MACE, and renal outcome benefits. For heart failure, prioritize SGLT2 inhibitors. For weight loss goals, prioritize GLP-1 RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors. For low hypoglycemia risk preference, avoid sulfonylureas. For older adults or those at fall risk, prioritize agents with low hypoglycemia risk and simplify regimens [^e3e4a63e] [^3a2b4cee] [^3326fef8] [^6cd2f727].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for GLP-1 RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors. The BMJ 2021 guideline, based on a large network meta-analysis, issues risk-stratified recommendations showing reduced death, MI, and kidney failure with these classes, with absolute benefits greatest in highest-risk patients, which underpins their early use in appropriate phenotypes [^3a2b4cee].

> I will now examine intensification after metformin. If dual therapy is needed, I should confirm comparative effectiveness. Meta-analyses indicate broadly similar A1c effects across second-line classes, so the choice should be driven by comorbidity profile, weight, hypoglycemia risk, and cost. Real-world data suggest tailoring to phenotype improves outcomes, reinforcing a "right drug for the right patient" approach [^4931cf90] [^0d9bec04].

> But wait, what if A1c remains above goal despite dual therapy? I should double-check the timing. Guidelines advise not delaying treatment modification; reassess adherence, barriers, and competing conditions, then escalate to triple therapy or add insulin, typically basal insulin first, while continuing metformin and other beneficial agents for cardiometabolic effects unless contraindicated [^39cd18dc] [^94fbcac5].

> Let me consider insulin therapy carefully. I should confirm indications and tactics. Start basal insulin when A1c is ≥ 10% or fasting glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dL, or when noninsulin regimens fail to reach targets. Use long-acting analogs to reduce hypoglycemia. Titrate every few days to fasting glucose targets. And provide structured education on hypoglycemia recognition and management to mitigate risks [^e3e4a63e] [^bb6429fc] [^48f35124] [^832f5dcc].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations. In older adults, individualize A1c targets upward (often 7.0–8.5%) to balance benefits and harms, avoid sulfonylureas when possible, and prefer agents with low hypoglycemia risk. In CKD, metformin is acceptable down to eGFR 30, and SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs with renal benefit should be prioritized. In pregnancy, insulin is standard. In youth, metformin is first-line with aggressive lifestyle intervention and close monitoring [^84a07256] [^3326fef8] [^e3e4a63e].

> I need to ensure I address nonpharmacologic care and weight. Nutrition therapy, physical activity, and weight management are foundational and should be individualized. A Mediterranean-style eating pattern improves glycemia, weight, and blood pressure. For obesity, escalate to structured programs, pharmacotherapy (e.g., semaglutide), or metabolic surgery when indicated. And embed diabetes self-management education and support to sustain behavior change [^178abf77] [^93ce15ee] [^81361103].

> Next, I should review monitoring and therapeutic inertia. Check A1c at least twice yearly if stable, more often if changing therapy. Screen for adherence, adverse effects, and social determinants like cost at every visit. And act within 3–6 months to intensify if targets are not met, as delays worsen outcomes. Shared decision-making and addressing barriers improve persistence and results [^cef07ab2] [^67df2bc0] [^a83d9d1a].

> Let me reconsider the evolving landscape so I don't miss important shifts. Guidelines increasingly emphasize cardiorenal risk reduction alongside glycemic control, endorse earlier combination therapy in appropriate patients, and call for precision approaches leveraging phenotype and, prospectively, pharmacogenomics. Emerging therapies and delivery systems (e.g., once-weekly insulins, oral GLP-1s) may further personalize care, but evidence standards now require demonstration of cardiovascular safety and meaningful outcomes [^e3e4a63e] [^0d6af2c3] [^d45b74ae].

> Finally, I should synthesize a practical algorithm and sanity-check it against guidelines. Start with metformin plus lifestyle in most, consider initial combination if A1c is markedly elevated or comorbidities warrant early cardiorenal benefit. Layer GLP-1 RA and/or SGLT2 inhibitor for ASCVD/CKD/heart failure or for weight loss. Add basal insulin if A1c remains above goal or is very high at presentation. Reassess every 3–6 months and escalate promptly. And throughout, align choices with patient values, access, and adherence realities to sustain long-term control and reduce complications [^e3e4a63e] [^d76bacae] [^39cd18dc].

---

Metformin is **first-line** [^e3e4a63e] for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated, with lifestyle therapy as the foundation [^81361103]. If A1c remains above goal, add a second agent based on comorbidities: SGLT2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for cardiovascular or renal disease [^3a2b4cee]; sulfonylureas or thiazolidinediones for cost or access constraints [^50574f92]; avoid sulfonylureas in older adults due to hypoglycemia risk [^3326fef8]. Insulin is indicated when A1c is ≥ 10% or fasting glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dL, or if dual therapy fails [^notfound]. Individualize targets and monitor for adverse effects, drug interactions, and adherence at each visit [^6e11d149] [^67df2bc0].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle therapy is **essential** and should continue throughout treatment [^81361103]:

- **Nutrition**: Emphasize whole foods, fiber, and reduced refined carbs; consider Mediterranean or DASH patterns [^178abf77].
- **Physical activity**: ≥ 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise plus resistance training [^notfound].
- **Weight management**: Aim for 5–10% weight loss; consider pharmacotherapy or bariatric surgery if BMI ≥ 27 kg/m² or ≥ 35 kg/m², respectively [^93ce15ee].
- **Smoking cessation**: Strongly recommended [^e45d1b7b].

---

## Pharmacologic therapy

### First-line therapy

Metformin is **preferred first-line** unless contraindicated (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², severe hepatic impairment, or high risk of lactic acidosis) [^e3e4a63e] [^209f8081]. It lowers A1c by ~1% [^notfound], is weight-neutral, does not cause hypoglycemia, and may improve cardiovascular outcomes [^f58a303a].

---

### Second-line therapy

Add a second agent if A1c remains above the individualized target after 3 months [^cef07ab2]. Selection should be **guided by comorbidities, hypoglycemia risk, weight, cost, and patient preference** [^6cd2f727]:

| **Medication class** | **Indications** | **Benefits** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| SGLT2 inhibitors | - ASCVD <br/> - Heart failure <br/> - CKD | - Cardiovascular and renal benefits <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Low hypoglycemia | - Genital infections <br/> - Euglycemic DKA [^notfound] |
| GLP-1 receptor agonists | - ASCVD <br/> - Obesity | - Weight loss <br/> - Cardiovascular benefits <br/> - Low hypoglycemia | - GI side effects <br/> - Injectable [^notfound] |
| Sulfonylureas | Cost-constrained settings | - Effective <br/> - Inexpensive | - Hypoglycemia <br/> - Weight gain [^notfound] |
| Thiazolidinediones | - Long-standing diabetes <br/> - Insulin resistance | - Durable A1c lowering | - Weight gain <br/> - Edema <br/> - Fractures [^notfound] |
| DPP-4 inhibitors | - Elderly <br/> - Low hypoglycemia risk | - Well tolerated <br/> - Oral | - Limited A1c effect <br/> - Costly [^notfound] |

---

### Insulin therapy

Initiate insulin when A1c is ≥ 10% or fasting glucose is ≥ 300 mg/dL, or if dual therapy fails [^notfound]. Start with **basal insulin** (glargine, detemir, or degludec) and titrate to fasting glucose 80–130 mg/dL [^notfound]. Continue metformin and other agents unless contraindicated [^94fbcac5]. For persistent hyperglycemia, add prandial insulin or consider a GLP-1/insulin co-formulation [^2c2109b2].

---

## Individualized treatment targets

A1c targets should be **individualized** [^e705dc37]:

- **Most adults**: A1c 7–8% if safely achievable [^84a07256].
- **Younger, healthier patients**: A1c < 7% if feasible without hypoglycemia [^notfound].
- **Older adults or comorbidities**: A1c 7.5–8.5% to minimize hypoglycemia [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitor A1c every 3–6 months [^cef07ab2] and assess adherence, adverse effects, and comorbidities at each visit [^67df2bc0]. Screen annually for **retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and foot disease** [^notfound].

---

## Emerging therapies

Newer agents such as **GIP/GLP-1 co-agonists**, oral GLP-1 receptor agonists, and once-weekly insulins are under study and may expand options for individualized care [^0d6af2c3] [^d45b74ae].

---

Effective T2DM care requires **metformin-based therapy** with timely intensification, comorbidity-driven add-ons, and ongoing lifestyle support, all aligned to patient goals and monitored regularly to prevent complications [^e3e4a63e].

Conclusions

No treatment is appropriate for all patients, nor is any one treatment optimal. The challenge is to find that treatment that best fits with what a patient is able and willing to do and embrace at this point in their diabetes journey, with an emphasis on shared-decision making and revisiting at future office visits. Prescribing a medication or making lifestyle recommendations that a patient is not willing or able to follow for any reason is not likely to lead to improvements in diabetes outcomes. The best treatment is one that is easy to implement and sustainable for the patient. Primary care often sees patients over the course of their lifetime and can revisit treatment options. Regardless of management decisions, frequent monitoring of glycaemia is crucial to assure therapeutic inertia is addressed.

### Type 2 diabetes mellitus: what is the optimal treatment regimen? [^d814d312]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment options for type 2 diabetes mellitus currently consist of insulin sensitizers, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, secretagogues, and insulin. However, the emphasis on initial therapy has been shifting from secretagogues and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors to insulin sensitizers such as metformin and the thiazolidinediones (TZDs). This article outlines the benefits of treatment with sensitizers vis à vis alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and secretagogues as part of a comprehensive treatment algorithm for type 2 diabetes. Secretagogues and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors effectively lower plasma glucose levels only, whereas insulin sensitizers reduce several important cardiac risk factors in addition to reducing plasma glucose levels. TZDs, in particular, are also beneficial for their ability to preserve or even rejuvenate pancreatic beta-cell function. The treatment algorithm has a layered approach, beginning with a combination of insulin-sensitizer therapy and incrementally progressing to triple oral therapy with the addition of secretagogues and, if necessary, the addition of subcutaneous insulin to maintain glycemic control.

### Type 2 diabetes therapies: a STEPS approach [^fc25c424]. American Family Physician (2019). Medium credibility.

A concise way to evaluate pharmacotherapy options for type 2 diabetes mellitus is to use the five patient-oriented STEPS criteria: safety, tolerability, efficacy, price, and simplicity. The first-line treatment option, metformin, is safe and fairly well-tolerated, has excellent long-term efficacy for patient-oriented outcomes, is moderately priced, and has a simple dosing regimen. However, most patients with type 2 diabetes require more than one medication. The STEPS approach can help choose subsequent medications if metformin does not provide adequate glycemic control.

### For debate ; pharmacological priorities in advanced type 2 diabetes [^713e3493]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2020). Medium credibility.

A multitude of therapeutic agents have been available to treat patients with Type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, many patients with advanced Type 2 diabetes continue to suffer from complications and premature death. To date, all available guidelines emphasize a variety of therapeutic aspects, goals, and pharmacological combinations, without directing the clinician as to which is a higher priority. The following review attempts to clarify which therapeutic option is more important for prognosis in patients with advanced type 2 diabetes. The body of evidence presented, reveal that the most important marker for prognosis is HbA1c. Each 1% incrementally higher HbA1c than ~7% is associated with 15%-45% reduced survival rates. Therefore, any agents that can achieve the time-sensitive objective of lowering HbA1c levels should be used.

### Current antihyperglycemic treatment guidelines and algorithms for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^70dcaafb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. While lifestyle interventions such as medical nutrition therapy and appropriately prescribed physical activity remain cornerstones of disease prevention and treatment, most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require pharmacotherapy for glycemic control. Fortunately, many of these patients are able to achieve desired glycemic targets with the use of currently available antihyperglycemic agents. Both not-for-profit disease-specific organizations and healthcare specialty societies have provided guidance about the appropriate selection of these therapies. Type 2 diabetes treatment guidelines and algorithms have been developed, taking into account a combination of evidence-based information and expert opinions, with various groups offering diverse glucose goals and approaches to hyperglycemia management. Virtually all recognize that type 2 diabetes is a multifaceted disease, necessitating an integrated yet individualized approach to patient care.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^437894b4]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable.Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should remain the first choice for therapy in all patients as other anti-hyperglycemic medications have proven to have additional benefits in certain populations. It is important to understand the risks and benefits of metformin and other anti-hyperglycemic medications before making any change in clinical practice.

### Current therapies for the medical management of diabetes [^9f98b75e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Diabetes affects a large and diverse number of individuals who share in common its risks for complications but who differ greatly from one another in age, health, and a number of circumstances influential to successful treatment. Because type 2 diabetes comprises the majority of diabetes cases, a number of agents have been developed for its treatment. Their unique properties offer opportunities to overcome some of the treatment limitations of older medicines and enable a more individualized and flexible approach to glucose-lowering. At the same time, new medications are accompanied by greater costs and uncertainties about their long-term benefits or safety, and thus the present state of care for type 2 diabetes places focus on a process of shared decision-making between the clinician and patient as to which treatments can optimize health while minimizing harms. We review the major classes of diabetes agents and provide some guidance for how one might approach decision-making in choosing among them.

### Pharmacotherapy for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: rationale and specific agents [^6da1edc1]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2007). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes, is characterized by abnormalities in hepatic glucose production, insulin resistance, and a progressive decline in beta-cell function over time. To treat effectively the individual with type 2 diabetes, the provider must have a thorough understanding of the underlying pathophysiology to provide treatment that precisely addresses the metabolic abnormalities. Currently, the provider who cares for subjects with type 2 diabetes can choose an antidiabetic agent from no less than eight pharmacologic classes. These classes include agents that increase insulin secretion, improve insulin action, and delay absorption of carbohydrates. The newer treatments available, specifically incretin therapy, address a previously unmet need in diabetes by modulating glucose supply. The currently available agents can be combined and combination therapy markedly improves glycemic control. This allows the provider to design regimens to specifically address underlying abnormalities. A review of all currently available agents is provided.

### Therapeutics for type-2 diabetes mellitus: a glance at the recent inclusions and novel agents under development for use in clinical practice [^6f0c6df3]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic, progressive, and multifaceted illness resulting in significant physical and psychological detriment to patients. As of 2019, 463 million people are estimated to be living with DM worldwide, out of which 90% have type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Over the years, significant progress has been made in identifying the risk factors for developing T2DM, understanding its pathophysiology and uncovering various metabolic pathways implicated in the disease process. This has culminated in the implementation of robust prevention programmes and the development of effective pharmacological agents, which have had a favourable impact on the management of T2DM in recent times. Despite these advances, the incidence and prevalence of T2DM continue to rise. Continuing research in improving efficacy, potency, delivery and reducing the adverse effect profile of currently available formulations is required to keep pace with this growing health challenge. Moreover, new metabolic pathways need to be targeted to produce novel pharmacotherapy to restore glucose homeostasis and address metabolic sequelae in patients with T2DM. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar databases for recently included agents and novel medication under development for treatment of T2DM. We discuss the pathophysiology of T2DM and review how the emerging anti-diabetic agents target the metabolic pathways involved. We also look at some of the limiting factors to developing new medication and the introduction of unique methods, including facilitating drug delivery to bypass some of these obstacles. However, despite the advances in the therapeutic options for the treatment of T2DM in recent years, the industry still lacks a curative agent.

### Effective utilization of oral hypoglycemic agents to achieve individualized HbA1c targets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^a657715a]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Prevention of the long-term complications of type 2 diabetes is enhanced by optimum glycemic control, especially in the early years post diagnosis. A maximum of three oral treatments may be required due to the progressive nature of type 2 diabetes. As more treatment options become available, it is essential that the correct treatments are used for each individual. By obtaining a thorough family, medical, and social history of the individual with diabetes and treating the most likely primary pathophysiology, in addition to having a clear HbA1c target and assessing the impact of all treatments commenced, good glycemic control is possible in most individuals with type 2 diabetes.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^d76bacae]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, general principles, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering combination therapy in adult patients with T2DM at treatment initiation to shorten time to attainment of individualized treatment goals.

### Oral antihyperglycemic therapy for type 2 diabetes: clinical applications [^58a25e1e]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Oral agents are the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes, and physicians now have a number of agents to choose from. However, more choices translate into more complex decision making. Many patients with diabetes have associated comorbidities, and most diabetic patients will require more than 1 agent to achieve good glycemic control. This article illustrates several of the pharmacologic approaches to type 2 diabetes through 4 situations that use principles of evidence-based medicine. The scenarios also highlight some of the difficulties in choosing the optimal pharmacologic treatment regimen for individual patients. Physicians should also recognize that type 2 diabetes is a multisystem disorder that requires multidisciplinary care, including education and ongoing counseling for effective patient self-management of the disease. Finally, patient preferences are a vital component of informed decision making for pharmacologic treatment of diabetes.

### Pharmacology and therapeutic implications of current drugs for type 2 diabetes mellitus [^5bb7d9f1]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2016). Medium credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global epidemic that poses a major challenge to health-care systems. Improving metabolic control to approach normal glycaemia (where practical) greatly benefits long-term prognoses and justifies early, effective, sustained and safety-conscious intervention. Improvements in the understanding of the complex pathogenesis of T2DM have underpinned the development of glucose-lowering therapies with complementary mechanisms of action, which have expanded treatment options and facilitated individualized management strategies. Over the past decade, several new classes of glucose-lowering agents have been licensed, including glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. These agents can be used individually or in combination with well-established treatments such as biguanides, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Although novel agents have potential advantages including low risk of hypoglycaemia and help with weight control, long-term safety has yet to be established. In this Review, we assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety profiles, including cardiovascular safety, of currently available therapies for management of hyperglycaemia in patients with T2DM within the context of disease pathogenesis and natural history. In addition, we briefly describe treatment algorithms for patients with T2DM and lessons from present therapies to inform the development of future therapies.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^c75549e5]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care guidelines

In 2008, the first ADA and European Association of the Study of Diabetes (EASD) consensus guidelines on management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes stated that metformin, along with lifestyle interventions, should be used as first-line therapy.While the guidelines of pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes in the United States have largely remained the same, recent updates in 2019 and 2020 have added additional components in light of compelling data from cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials. According to the ADA 2020 Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, metformin remains the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatment for type 2 diabetes unless contraindicated or not tolerated by the patient.Other glucose-lowering agents may be added to metformin considering patient preferences, hypoglycemic risk, and comorbidities.

While the ADA still recommends metformin as first-line therapy, the updated Standards of Care have become more outcomes-focused rather than solely concentrating on glycemic control. For this reason, in patients with certain comorbidities such as high-risk for or established ASCVD, heart failure or chronic kidney disease, it is recommended to consider GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors independently of baseline HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target.In 2019, the European Society of Cardiology, in collaboration with the EASD, went one step further in altering their treatment guidelines. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 RAs are now recommended as first-line therapy for patients with established ASCVD or high cardiovascular risk in Europe.Metformin should be considered as the first line in patients without CVD and at moderate cardiovascular risk.

### Personalizing guidelines for diabetes management: twilight or dawn of the expert? [^0f0ef4a8]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

This opinion article on the management of type 2 diabetes considers the old and new format of guidelines and critical changes in the character of such guidelines. We highlight limitations of the guidelines and make recommendations for how treatment can be more personalised.

Discussion

Published guidelines for the management of adult-onset non-insulin requiring diabetes have adopted a formulaic approach to patient management that can be overseen centrally and delivered by personnel with limited training. Recently, guidelines have taken a patient-centered, multiple risk-factor approach. Importantly, local funding issues are considered, but drive the final action and not the decision-making process. The nature of the disease can be determined by laboratory tests, including screening for diabetes-associated autoantibodies. The strategy remains step-up, with intensification of drug or insulin dose. As with past guidelines, there is an assumption that in each patient with type 2 diabetes, metformin is used initially, but targets and therapies then veer in different directions to create a matrix of options based on the features and responses of each individual. Factors to consider include: (A)ge, (B)ody weight, (C)omplications and co-morbidities, Diabetes (D)uration and (E)xpense, but also patient preference and patient response.

Summary

Guidelines for the management of type 2 diabetes have important limitations and a patient-centered, multiple target, multiple therapy approach is proposed.

### Intensifying treatment in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus: case reports [^f1464a48]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

There is no single correct treatment option for all patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Duration of diabetes and stage of the disease, level of control, lifestyle habits, and attitude toward disease management all affect the choice of treatment for any given individual. Indeed, the above factors should be especially considered when considering initiating insulin therapy in these patients. Basal insulin and premixed insulin remain the most common formulations used when initiating insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes and, as demonstrated in this article, both of these insulin strategies can be effective in controlling hyperglycemia when therapy is individualized to the patient.

### Management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in older patients: current and emerging treatment options [^8a00f3c9]. Diabetes Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are a rapidly emerging population that presents unique clinical challenges. This diverse patient group can differ widely in terms of physical and mental status, which can increase their risk of complications including hypoglycemia, falls, and depression. These factors can negatively impact their glycemic control, safety, and quality of life. The risk of hypoglycemic events is elevated among elderly patients with diabetes. In many cases, these events are related to antidiabetic therapy and the pursuit of strict glycemic control. Fear of a hypoglycemic episode, on the part of the patient and/or healthcare provider, is another major barrier to achieving glycemic control. Hypoglycemic events, even in the absence of awareness of the event (asymptomatic), can have negative consequences. To help manage these risks, several national and international organizations have proposed guidelines to address individualized treatment goals for older adults with diabetes. This article reviews current treatment guidelines for setting glycemic targets in elderly patients with T2DM, and discusses the role of emerging treatment options in this patient population.

### Optimal management of type 2 diabetes: the evidence [^1f678e11]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

This paper reviews the evidence in relation to the optimal target for HbA1c and outlines a global treatment algorithm for people with type 2 diabetes. While most guidelines recommend a general HbA1c target of 7%, recent large scale intervention studies have examined the potential benefits of lower targets. These studies have generally shown that lower HbA1c targets provide no macrovascular benefits and limited effects on microvascular complications while increasing rates of hypoglycaemia. Overall these studies do not support a general HbA1c target lower than 7.0%. However an individual's HbA1c target should be set and reviewed taking into account treatment benefits, safety, and tolerability. This may mean that an HbA1c target lower than 7% is appropriate for some when it can be easily and safely achieved but equally a higher HbA1c target may be appropriate in others. Clinicians and consumers are fortunate in having a wide range of pharmacological agents available to treat hyperglycaemia, however access to many of these options is limited in many middle and low income countries. Developing treatment algorithms is complex for several reasons. The major limitation is the limited evidence base for choosing particular treatment options or combinations of medications. However it is possible to derive a generic evidence-informed consensus algorithm which considers availability, access and cost of medications which can be adapted for local country use.

### Should metformin remain the first-line therapy for treatment of type 2 diabetes? [^15f0ee9d]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Metformin is a biguanide that is used as first-line treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and is effective as monotherapy and in combination with other glucose-lowering medications. It is generally well-tolerated with minimal side effects and is affordable. Although the safety and efficacy of metformin have been well-established, there is discussion regarding whether metformin should continue to be the first choice for therapy as other anti-hyperglycemic medications exhibit additional advantages in certain populations. Despite a long-standing history of metformin use, there are limited cardiovascular outcomes data for metformin. Furthermore, the available studies fail to provide strong evidence due to either small sample size or short duration. Recent data from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor cardiovascular and renal outcomes trials demonstrated additional protection from diabetes complications for some high-risk patients, which has impacted the guidelines for diabetes management. Post-hoc analyses comparing hazard ratios for participants taking metformin at baseline versus not taking metformin are inconclusive for these two groups. There are no data to suggest that metformin should not be initiated soon after the diagnosis of diabetes. Furthermore, the initiation of newer glycemic-lowering medications with cardiovascular benefits should be considered in high-risk patients regardless of glycemic control or target HbA1c. However, cost remains a major factor in determining appropriate treatment.

### Metformin – the gold standard in type 2 diabetes: what does the evidence tell us? [^f58a303a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2009). Low credibility.

Metformin is a cornerstone of oral antidiabetic treatment. Recent joint American and European guidelines recommend instituting metformin therapy along with lifestyle modification at the time type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is diagnosed. Metformin acts to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and improve glucose uptake, and it may exert protective effects on pancreatic islet cells. Although metformin therapy produces substantial reductions in HbA1c, it does not produce body weight gain, is not associated with substantial risk for hypoglycaemia and has neutral to positive effects on lipids and blood pressure. The major adverse events associated with metformin are gastrointestinal. T2DM progresses even with initially effective monotherapy, and most patients will therefore receive combination therapy. When selecting agents to coadminister with metformin, a physician must consider efficacy in glycaemic control, safety, tolerability and any effects that may compromise overall efficacy (e.g. effects on body weight, lipids or blood pressure). In this regard, incretin-based therapies have characteristics that make them particularly suitable for add-on therapy with metformin.

### Empagliflozin: role in treatment options for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^f4da0041]. Diabetes Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

The guidelines added the new recommendation, “In people with clinical cardiovascular disease in whom glycemic targets are not met, an SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated cardiovascular outcome benefit should be added to antihyperglycemic therapy to reduce the risk for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality (Grade A, Level 1A for empagliflozin)”. The guidelines refer to selecting an “SGLT2 inhibitor with demonstrated CV outcome benefit” possibly anticipating a class effect when outcome trials for other SGLT2 inhibitors are reported (Table 2).

Among cardiologists, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has recently revised their guidelines for CV disease prevention, including an update to the guidance on glucose control in patients with T2DM. Metformin remains the first-line option, but based on the results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study, the ESC recommends that an SGLT2 inhibitor should be considered very early in the course of diabetes management in patients with T2DM and existing CV disease. The ESC also updated their guidelines on heart failure to include empagliflozin to prevent or delay the onset of heart failure in patients with T2DM. As with general CV disease prevention recommendations, they continue to recommend metformin as first-line therapy for glycemic control and also point out that intensification of glucose control with agents other than empagliflozin does not reduce the risk of heart failure.

### Should metformin still be the first-line of treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus? A comprehensive review and suggested algorithm [^cfd63b7b]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

For more than a century, the high occurrences of coronary and peripheral artery diseases in diabetes mellitus patients has been well recognised; despite that, the ability to improve CV event rates by optimizing glycaemic control has remained elusive. Nevertheless, the last decade has seen several cardiovascular outcome clinical trials (CVOTs) of many antihyperglycemic agents that reported promising results for cardiovascular and renal outcomes. This leads to a hot debate on the ideal drug choice for first-line treatment in T2DM. The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence supporting the use of metformin, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and incretin-based therapies for the management of individuals with T2DM and, discuss the rationale for selection.

### Pharmacologic treatment of type 2 diabetes: oral medications [^5a0765e8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the oral and injectable pharmacologic treatment options for type 2 diabetes.

Data Sources

A literature search was conducted using PubMed electronic database for studies published in English between 1993 and September 2014. Search terms included diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes, and the individual name for each antidiabetic medication reviewed. In addition, manual searches were performed for cross-references from publications. Package inserts, United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Web site, Institute for Safe Medication Practices Web site, American Diabetes Association Web site and scientific session poster presentations, and individual drug company Web pages were also reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

This review focused on information elucidated over the past 10 years to assist prescribers in choosing optimal therapy based on individual patient characteristics. Studies leading to the approval of or raising safety concerns for the antidiabetic medications reviewed in this article were included.

Data Synthesis

In the past 10 years, there have been 4 novel oral antidiabetic medication classes and 9 new injectable agents and insulin products approved by the FDA for the treatment of type 2 diabetes as well as new information regarding the safety and use of several older antidiabetic medication classes. The distinctions were reviewed for each individual agent, and a comparison was completed if there was more than one agent in a particular therapeutic class. Using current information available, select investigational agents in phase III trials or those with a pending new drug application were highlighted.

Conclusion

There are now 9 distinct oral pharmacologic classes and a variety of insulin and noninsulin injectable medications available for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Metformin remains the first-line treatment option for most patients. When considering options for alternative or additional treatment, prescribers must weigh the benefits and risks using individual patient characteristics.

### Novel therapies with precision mechanisms for type 2 diabetes mellitus [^0d6af2c3]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2021). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the greatest health crises of our time and its prevalence is projected to increase by >50% globally by 2045. Currently, 10 classes of drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of T2DM. Drugs in development for T2DM must show meaningful reductions in glycaemic parameters as well as cardiovascular safety. Results from an increasing number of cardiovascular outcome trials using modern T2DM therapeutics have shown a reduced risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease. Hence, guidelines have become increasingly evidence based and more patient centred, focusing on reaching individualized glycaemic goals while optimizing safety, non-glycaemic benefits and the prevention of complications. The bar has been raised for novel therapies under development for T2DM as they are now expected to achieve these aims and possibly even treat concurrent comorbidities. Indeed, the pharmaceutical pipeline for T2DM is fertile. Drugs that augment insulin sensitivity, stimulate insulin secretion or the incretin axis, or suppress hepatic glucose production are active in more than 7,000 global trials using new mechanisms of action. Our collective goal of being able to truly personalize medicine for T2DM has never been closer at hand.

### Second-line pharmaceutical treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes [^32bb7fdd]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

The annual prevalence of type 2 diabetes remains high, impacting an estimated 11.3% of the US population and 9.3% of people worldwide. Current clinical treatment guidelines recommend targeting glycated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) less than 7% for most adults (to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01),although there is heterogeneity across recommendations, ranging between 6.5% and 8%, depending on the target population and risk of various microvascular and macrovascular complications. Moderate glycemic control, defined by HbA 1c within 7% to 8%, has been shown to improve macrovascular and microvascular outcomes in individuals with diabetes. Metformin is a preferred glucose-lowering drug and is often recommended at treatment initiation for patients with diabetes due to its tolerability, efficacy, and low cost. However, intensification of treatment with an additional agent is often needed to maintain glycemic levels in the recommended range. Indeed, an estimated one-third of the US population with HbA 1c greater than 7% is prescribed an additional drug to maintain glycemic control.However, the choice of such an add-on treatment is ambiguous, owing to the lack of direct comparisons of currently available agents. Additionally, evidence emerging from the characterization of clinical data suggests that the actual choices clinicians make in adding another agent onto metformin is highly variable across health systems, both in the US and worldwide. Therefore, to help inform clinical decision-making, it is imperative to fill this knowledge gap by comparing the effectiveness and safety of agents added on to metformin in a head-to-head fashion. However, such rigorous comparison across multiple therapeutic options is simply not feasible in the context of classical randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for myriad reasons, including but not limited to cost, time, patient follow-ups, and the combinatorial nature of diabetes treatment options.

### Options for combination therapy in type 2 diabetes: comparison of the ADA / EASD position statement and AACE / ACE algorithm [^6e576906]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Treating patients with diabetes is one of the most challenging and important activities a physician (primary care physician or specialist) can undertake. A key to successful therapy for type 2 diabetes is the insight that this condition is progressive and that the need for additional agents over time is normative. The ability to individualize therapy by patient and medication characteristics comes from experience and knowledge of pertinent clinical studies. However, guidelines from expert bodies such as the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists/American College of Endocrinology can help clinicians of all levels of expertise to approach therapy choices more rationally. There is unity across these guidelines about the role and benefits of metformin as first-line pharmacological treatment, probability of good efficacy, low risk of hypoglycemia, modest weight loss, and overall long-term data. Unfortunately, this unity does not extend to recommendations for subsequent pharmacological agents and their use in combination to intensify treatment when insulin is not (yet) appropriate. Across both statements, some drug classes seem more prominent, and looking at their benefit-risk profile, it is clear why this is the case. The most profound recent change in diabetes therapy has been the introduction of incretin therapies. Incretin therapies minimize 2 important adverse effects seen with many other therapies: hypoglycemia and weight gain. These agents have increased the range of options available for early intensification of treatment of type 2 diabetes. In combination with more established therapies, there are more opportunities than ever to accommodate patient preferences while improving glycemic control and harnessing extraglycemic benefits of a second (or third) agent.

### SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists for adults with type 2 diabetes: a clinical practice guideline [^3a2b4cee]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

What are the benefits and harms of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists when added to usual care (lifestyle interventions and/or other diabetes drugs) in adults with type 2 diabetes at different risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes?

Current Practice

Clinical decisions about treatment of type 2 diabetes have been led by glycaemic control for decades. SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists are traditionally used in people with elevated glucose level after metformin treatment. This has changed through trials demonstrating atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) benefits independent of medications' glucose-lowering potential.

Recommendations

The guideline panel issued risk-stratified recommendations concerning the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists in adults with type 2 diabetes• Three or fewer cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation against starting SGLT-2 inhibitors or GLP-1 receptor agonists.• More than three cardiovascular risk factors without established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak against starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD or CKD: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists.• Established CVD and CKD: Strong recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors and weak recommendation for starting GLP-1 receptor agonists.• For those committed to further reducing their risk for CVD and CKD outcomes: Weak recommendation for starting SGLT-2 inhibitors rather than GLP-1 receptor agonists.

How This Guideline Was Created

An international panel including patients, clinicians, and methodologists created these recommendations following standards for trustworthy guidelines and using the GRADE approach. The panel applied an individual patient perspective.

The Evidence

A linked systematic review and network meta-analysis (764 randomised trials included 421346 participants) of benefits and harms found that SGLT-2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists generally reduce overall death, and incidence of myocardial infarctions, and end-stage kidney disease or kidney failure (moderate to high certainty evidence). These medications exert different effects on stroke, hospitalisations for heart failure, and key adverse events in different subgroups. Absolute effects of benefit varied widely based on patients' individual risk (for example, from five fewer deaths in the lowest risk to 48 fewer deaths in the highest risk, for 1000 patients treated over five years). A prognosis review identified 14 eligible risk prediction models, one of which (RECODe) informed most baseline risk estimates in evidence summaries to underpin the risk-stratified recommendations. Concerning patients' values and preferences, the recommendations were supported by evidence from a systematic review of published literature, a patient focus group study, a practical issues summary, and a guideline panel survey.

Understanding The Recommendation

We stratified the recommendations by the levels of risk for CVD and CKD and systematically considered the balance of benefits, harms, other considerations, and practical issues for each risk group. The strong recommendation for SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with CVD and CKD reflects what the panel considered to be a clear benefit. For all other adults with type 2 diabetes, the weak recommendations reflect what the panel considered to be a finer balance between benefits, harms, and burdens of treatment options. Clinicians using the guideline can identify their patient's individual risk for cardiovascular and kidney outcomes using credible risk calculators such as RECODe. Interactive evidence summaries and decision aids may support well informed treatment choices, including shared decision making.

Conclusion

The evidence from this study can potentially be used to support better targeting of second-line T2DM therapy. The choice of which drug to offer after metformin should be based on the individual person’s phenotypic characteristics (including gender, age, BMI, eGFR and duration of T2DM), considering their treatment goals, extent of hyperglycaemia, comorbidities and the beneficial and adverse effects of each class of drug to select the right drug for the right patient.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: a consensus statement of the American diabetes association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^6b3ade39]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Process

The guidelines and algorithm that follow are derived from two sources. One source is the clinical trials that address the effectiveness and safety of the different modalities of therapy. Here, the writing group reviewed a wide variety of studies related to the use of drugs as monotherapy or in combination to lower glycemia. Unfortunately, the paucity of high-quality evidence in the form of well-controlled clinical trials that directly compare different diabetes treatment regimens remains a major impediment to recommending one class of drugs, or a particular combination of therapies, over another.

The second source of material that informed our recommendations was clinical judgement, that is, our collective knowledge and clinical experience, which takes into account benefits, risks, and costs in the treatment of diabetes. As in all clinical decision making, an evidence-based review of the literature must also be supplemented by value judgements, where the benefits of treatment are weighed against risks and costs in a subjective fashion. While we realize that others may have different judgements, we believe that the recommendations made in this new iteration of our treatment algorithm will guide therapy and result in improved glycemic control and health status over time.

### Type 2 diabetes [^1e89b04b]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Type 2 diabetes accounts for nearly 90% of the approximately 537 million cases of diabetes worldwide. The number affected is increasing rapidly with alarming trends in children and young adults (up to age 40 years). Early detection and proactive management are crucial for prevention and mitigation of microvascular and macrovascular complications and mortality burden. Access to novel therapies improves person-centred outcomes beyond glycaemic control. Precision medicine, including multiomics and pharmacogenomics, hold promise to enhance understanding of disease heterogeneity, leading to targeted therapies. Technology might improve outcomes, but its potential is yet to be realised. Despite advances, substantial barriers to changing the course of the epidemic remain. This Seminar offers a clinically focused review of the recent developments in type 2 diabetes care including controversies and future directions.

Choosing specific diabetes interventions and their roles in treating type 2 diabetes

Numerous reviews have focused on the characteristics of the specific diabetes interventions listed below (–). In addition, meta-analyses and reviews have summarized and compared the glucose-lowering effectiveness and other characteristics of the medications (–). The aim here is to provide enough information to justify the choices of medications, the order in which they are recommended, and the use of combinations of therapies. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of high-quality studies that provide head-to-head comparisons of the ability of the medications to achieve the currently recommended glycemic levels. The authors highly recommend that such studies be conducted. However, even in the absence of rigorous, comprehensive studies that directly compare the efficacy of all available glucose-lowering treatments and their combinations, we feel that there are enough data regarding the characteristics of the individual interventions to provide the guidelines below.

An important intervention that is likely to improve the probability that a patient will have better long-term control of diabetes is to make the diagnosis early, when the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes are usually less severe. Lower levels of glycemia at the time of initial therapy are associated with lower A1C levels over time and decreased long-term complications.

### Management of type 2 diabetes in developing countries: balancing optimal glycaemic control and outcomes with affordability and accessibility to treatment [^50574f92]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Consistent with the ADA/EASD consensus statement, a patient-centred approach is the key. Factors such as efficacy in achieving glycaemic control, reduction of microvascular and macrovascular outcomes, safety, patient adherence and barriers, such as cost and access to therapies, must be considered when deciding on a treatment for type 2 diabetes. Considering all of these factors, and particularly where cost is an issue, the ADA/EASD consensus statement recommends metformin followed by a second-line sulfonylurea.

This review will, therefore, consider the evidence for efficacy, outcomes, availability and accessibility of these treatment options in the management of type 2 diabetes in restricted-resource settings.

### Treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the older adult: a review [^28fd6511]. Endocrine Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

This review summarizes the particular challenges of diabetes in older individuals and the evidence base guiding the selection of treatment targets and strategies in this population.

Methods

An in-depth literature search was conducted to identify the evidence base from randomized, controlled, and population-based epidemiological studies, as well as guidelines derived from expert opinion.

Results

Older patients are a highly heterogeneous population with respect to the pathogenesis and course of diabetes and, as a group, manifest significant comorbidities that impact treatment goals and strategies. There is a lack of consensus regarding "optimal" glucose targets in older patients with diabetes. Hypoglycemia is more common in the older patient, contributes to increased morbidity and reduced quality of life, and limits treatment in many cases. Duration of diabetes, comorbidities, life expectancy, and functional status are other important factors to consider when identifying appropriate glycemic goals and choosing an antihyperglycemic agent for older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Conclusion

Current, limited treatment recommendations in older patients with T2DM are based on expert opinion due to the general lack of evidence from randomized controlled trials. This underscores the importance of individualizing pharmacologic therapy in these patients with a focus on the risk-to-benefit ratio. Additional trials in older patients are needed to assess drug safety, efficacy, and dosing.

### Effective utilization of oral hypoglycemic agents to achieve individualized HbA1c targets in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^cee963cd]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes is a progressive life-long condition that, if poorly managed, results in significant morbidity as a result of micro- and macrovascular complications. Macrovascular or cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes, accounting for 54% of deaths. Effective diabetes management to prevent the development of long-term complications requires intensive treatment of numerous risk factors, including hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia. In recent years, the treatment options to achieve optimum glycemic control have rapidly expanded. There are currently five groups of oral agents and two injectable therapies available (Fig. 1). The challenge for clinicians is determining which combination of treatment is most appropriate for an individual with type 2 diabetes, with the recommendation being that a maximum combination of three oral treatments are used.

Description

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) annually updates the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes to provide clinicians, patients, researchers, payers, and other interested parties with evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of patients with diabetes.

Methods

For the 2017 Standards, the ADA Professional Practice Committee updated previous MEDLINE searches performed from 1 January 2016 to November 2016 to add, clarify, or revise recommendations based on new evidence. The committee rates the recommendations as A, B, or C, depending on the quality of evidence, or E for expert consensus or clinical experience. The Standards were reviewed and approved by the Executive Committee of the ADA Board of Directors, which includes health care professionals, scientists, and laypersons. Feedback from the larger clinical community informed revisions.

### The prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^4621cbda]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

With a worldwide pandemic of type 2 diabetes upon us, it is imperative that effective and practical preventive strategies be developed for this disease which, once established, carries with it excess morbidity and mortality. This article reviews recently published data on the prevention of type 2 diabetes and compares the demonstrated effectiveness of each strategy, including lifestyle modification and several pharmacologic agents. Although much new information is available, many translational questions remain that chiefly concern the generalizability and applicability of these programs to clinical practice. Recent diabetes prevention guidelines are discussed, and a practical framework for their implementation is presented.

### Management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: a patient-centered approach: position statement of the American diabetes association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) [^e45d1b7b]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Glycemic management in type 2 diabetes mellitus has become increasingly complex and, to some extent, controversial, with a widening array of pharmacological agents now available (–), mounting concerns about their potential adverse effects and new uncertainties regarding the benefits of intensive glycemic control on macrovascular complications (–). Many clinicians are therefore perplexed as to the optimal strategies for their patients. As a consequence, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) convened a joint task force to examine the evidence and develop recommendations for antihyperglycemic therapy in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. Several guideline documents have been developed by members of these two organizations and by other societies and federations (,–). However, an update was deemed necessary because of contemporary information on the benefits/risks of glycemic control, recent evidence concerning efficacy and safety of several new drug classes, the withdrawal/restriction of others, and increasing calls for a move toward more patient-centered care.

This statement has been written incorporating the best available evidence and, where solid support does not exist, using the experience and insight of the writing group, incorporating an extensive review by additional experts (acknowledged below). The document refers to glycemic control; yet this clearly needs to be pursued within a multifactorial risk reduction framework. This stems from the fact that patients with type 2 diabetes are at increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality; the aggressive management of cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure and lipid therapy, antiplatelet treatment, and smoking cessation) is likely to have even greater benefits.

These recommendations should be considered within the context of the needs, preferences, and tolerances of each patient; individualization of treatment is the cornerstone of success. Our recommendations are less prescriptive than and not as algorithmic as prior guidelines. This follows from the general lack of comparative-effectiveness research in this area. Our intent is therefore to encourage an appreciation of the variable and progressive nature of type 2 diabetes, the specific role of each drug, the patient and disease factors that drive clinical decision making (–), and the constraints imposed by age and comorbidity. The implementation of these guidelines will require thoughtful clinicians to integrate current evidence with other constraints and imperatives in the context of patient-specific factors.

### Current progress in pharmacogenomics of type 2 diabetes: a systemic overview [^3a6a66f8]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent disease with incidences increasing globally at a rapid rate. The goal of T2DM treatment is to control glucose levels and prevent the aggravation of glycemic symptoms.

Treatment Options

T2DM regimen include metformin as the first-line, with sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione (TZD), GLP-1, DPP4I, and SGLT2 inhibitor as the second-line treatment options. However, even with a multitude of choices, patient-to-patient variability due to pharmacogenomic differences still prevail.

Conclusion

This review aims to discuss the responses of the major T2DM medications influenced by pharmacogenomics and investigate improved personalized therapy for T2DM patients.

### Insulin therapy in people with type 2 diabetes: opportunities and challenges? [^396d5cf6]. Diabetes Care (2014). Low credibility.

Given the continued interest in defining the optimal management of individuals with type 2 diabetes, the Editor of Diabetes Care convened a working party of diabetes specialists to examine this topic in the context of insulin therapy. This was prompted by recent new evidence on the use of insulin in such people. The group was aware of evidence that the benefits of insulin therapy are still usually offered late, and thus the aim of the discussion was how to define the optimal timing and basis for decisions regarding insulin and to apply these concepts in practice. It was noted that recent evidence had built upon that of the previous decades, together confirming the benefits and safety of insulin therapy, albeit with concerns about the potential for hypoglycemia and gain in body weight. Insulin offers a unique ability to control hyperglycemia, being used from the time of diagnosis in some circumstances, when metabolic control is disturbed by medical illness, procedures, or therapy, as well as in the longer term in ambulatory care. For those previously starting insulin, various other forms of therapy can be added later, which offer complementary effects appropriate to individual needs. Here we review current evidence and circumstances in which insulin can be used, consider individualized choices of alternatives and combination regimens, and offer some guidance on personalized targets and tactics for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus pharmacotherapy—recommendations 23–26—state that for adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease who are not good candidates for a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, we recommend a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist with proven renal protection to improve macroalbuminuria. In adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have cardiovascular disease or renal disease, we suggest that the addition of a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist be considered, even if the patient has already achieved their individualized target range for glycemic control. In adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, especially those 65 years and older, we suggest prioritizing drug classes other than insulin, sulfonylureas, or meglitinides to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia, if glycemic control can be achieved with other treatments. In adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have co-occurring cognitive impairment or risk of falls, there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against specific treatment strategies for glucose lowering to reduce the risk of harms.

### What next after metformin in type 2 diabetes? Selecting the right drug for the right patient [^4931cf90]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Meta-analyses comparing the effectiveness of the different drug classes have demonstrated similar clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c for all classes of second-line drugs when they are added to metformin as dual therapy, but with differences in weight gain and risk of hypoglycaemia. However, the real-world effectiveness of these drugs in routine clinical practice is less well understood. The purpose of this study was to explore the real-world efficacy profiles of OHAs following metformin monotherapy in terms of glycaemic control as a function of baseline phenotypic characteristics. By using data collected from routine primary care practice, the study will generate valuable evidence that is currently lacking to inform clinical decision making on the management of people with T2DM who have failed metformin monotherapy. A better understanding of patient profiles and treatment practices may lead to improved disease management through better targeting of second-line regimens according to demographic and clinical characteristics to achieve optimal clinical outcomes.

### Future challenges and therapeutic opportunities in type 2 diabetes: changing the paradigm of current therapy [^6319ab2a]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

5 CONCLUSIONS

Poor glycaemic control underscores the limitations of current treatment options and algorithms advocated in management guidelines. An unacceptably high proportion of people with T2DM, despite the many therapeutic options available, fail to reach their glycaemic targets due to a combination of factors, including poor adherence to therapy and clinical inertia from healthcare professionals. This review suggests a new treatment paradigm based around the early introduction of insulin and the rationale for a combination therapy of insulin plus a GLP‐1 RA in the form of an FRC. This may facilitate the likelihood of achieving and sustaining good glycaemic control with fewer side‐effects and better adherence. Improving clinical outcomes and controlling resource use in the management of people with T2DM is imperative especially as the demand for treatment continues to grow. Further studies are required to explore the clinical advantages, limitations and best ways to utilize this proposed new paradigm in the management of T2DM.

### New strategies for basal insulin treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^2243626e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical progression of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is well understood. Glycemic control gradually deteriorates, and progression of DM eventually leads to an increased risk for microvascular and macrovascular complications. Reassessment of current insulin treatment strategies leading to restoration of glycemic control is essential to prevent or stop the progression of type 2 DM and its complications.

Objective

The purpose of this article was to review the importance of instituting a strategy of basal insulin therapy in patients with type 2 DM.

Methods

Relevant articles were obtained through an online search of PubMed and MEDLINE for literature published from 1990 to 2003. The search terms used were insulin therapy, combination oral therapy, treatment failure, glycemic control, insulin analogues, insulin glargine, basal insulin, and microvascular complications.

Results

Large-scale intervention trials, such as the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), have reported that patients with type 2 DM treated with oral combination therapy are unable to maintain glycemic control. These observations have led to a reassessment of the role of insulin therapy in type 2 DM. The importance of tight glycemic control through the aggressive use of insulin early in the course of the disease is apparent from the UKPDS, Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, and other, smaller studies. Considerable evidence indicates that initiating a basal insulin-replacement strategy with an existing oral regimen can result in regaining glycemic control. Evidence emerging from recent studies indicates that use of intensive insulin therapy early in the course of the disease may have a positive clinical impact on outcome and slow the progression of complications. The availability of basal insulin analogues has expanded treatment options and improved the efficacy of therapeutic regimens for type 2 DM.

Conclusions

The available data suggest using an earlier transition from monotherapy to combination therapy to minimize disease-associated morbidity. The availability of new insulin analogues has expanded therapeutic options and offers the potential to enhance the efficacy of therapeutic regimens for type 2 DM as well as improve the ease and safety of treatment when glycosylated hemoglobin cannot be maintained <7% on > or =1 oral antidiabetic agent.

### From glucose lowering agents to disease / diabetes modifying drugs: a "SIMPLE" approach for the treatment of type 2 diabetes [^a94e76bb]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Since the busy primary care teams treat most patients with type 2 diabetes world-wide, treatment approaches should be as simple and convenient as possible. Yet, the recent increase in good therapy options, the surge of relevant data, and the need to "personalize" treatment—including their risk factors and possible cardiorenal complications—make this mission more complex than ever before. The development and characterization of the Diabetes\Disease Modifying Drugs provide us with a golden opportunity to simplify the treatment of type 2 diabetes, while reducing the disease's complications. Early combination therapy with two and sometimes three of the DMDs (SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA) and metformin, and lower HbA1c targets (< 6.5%), may halt and even regress the pathological basis of diabetes and improve patient’s prognosis.

ACP grading framework for evidence and recommendations using GRADE defines evidence certainty and recommendation strength categories as follows: High certainty is described as “Confident that the true effect lies close to the estimate of the effect (the intervention “results in” the effect).” Moderate certainty is “Moderately confident in the effect estimate: The true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a sizeable possibility that it is substantially different (the intervention “probably results in” the effect).” Low certainty is “Confidence in the effect estimate is limited: The true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect (the intervention “may result in” the effect).” Recommendation strength includes Strong (ACP recommends) when there is “Confidence that the benefits clearly outweigh risks and burden or vice versa,” it “Applies to most patients in most circumstances,” and “Only strong recommendations could be considered as quality indicators to guide the development of accountability, reporting, and payment programs”; and Conditional (ACP suggests) when “Benefits probably outweigh the risks and burden, or vice versa, but there is appreciable uncertainty,” it “Applies to many patients but may differ depending on circumstances or patients’ values and preferences,” and “Policymaking will require substantial debates and involvement of many stakeholders. Policies are also more likely to vary between regions. Quality indicators would have to focus on the fact that adequate deliberation about the management options has taken place.”

Characteristics to consider when individualizing therapy in older patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)

CAD coronary artery disease, CV cardiovascular, HbA1c glycosylated hemoglobin

When managing T2DM in the elderly, it is important to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. Older patients with diabetes are at a greater risk than are younger patients, even after adjusting for glycemic control. In addition, hypoglycemia presents a higher risk for comorbid events and mortality in elderly patients with diabetes compared with younger patients. Hypoglycemic events in the elderly are independently associated with an increased risk of fall-related fractures and acute cardiovascular events. These events have been shown to adversely impact health-related quality of life as much as, or to an even greater degree than, complications of T2DM. Furthermore, evidence suggests that severe hypoglycemic episodes may increase the risk of dementia in patients with T2DM. Conversely, the presence of geriatric syndromes may contribute to the increased risk of hypoglycemia and its complications in elderly patients with T2DM and should be assessed when evaluating hypoglycemia risk (Table 2) [,,,–].

Geriatric syndromes and additional factors that contribute to hypoglycemia in the elderly [,,–]

Elderly patients with diabetes are at increased risk for geriatric syndromes such as polypharmacy, urinary incontinence, depression, falls, chronic pain, and cognitive impairment

T2DM type 2 diabetes mellitus

The hypoglycemic risk associated with some antidiabetic agents may present the greatest barrier to optimal glycemic control in elderly patients. Therefore, diabetes therapies with the lowest rates of hypoglycemia should be considered for this patient population. Emerging treatment options that may meet this need include both approved and investigational incretin-based therapies and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, as well as ultra-long-acting insulins that are in late-stage clinical development. The aim of this article is to review current treatment guidelines for setting glycemic targets in elderly patients with T2DM, and to discuss the role of emerging treatment options for this patient population.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS/RESEARCH NEEDS

For antihyperglycemic management of type 2 diabetes, the comparative evidence basis to date is relatively lean, especially beyond metformin monotherapy. There is a significant need for high-quality comparative-effectiveness research, not only regarding glycemic control, but also costs and those outcomes that matter most to patients—quality of life and the avoidance of morbid and life-limiting complications, especially CVD. Another issue about which more data are needed is the concept of durability of effectiveness (often ascribed to β-cell preservation), which would serve to stabilize metabolic control and decrease the future treatment burden for patients. Pharmacogenetics may very well inform treatment decisions in the future, guiding the clinician to recommend a therapy for an individual patient based on predictors of response and susceptibility to adverse effects. We need more clinical data on how phenotype and other patient/disease characteristics should drive drug choices. As new medications are introduced to the type 2 diabetes pharmacopeia, their benefit and safety should be demonstrated in studies versus best current treatment, substantial enough both in size and duration to provide meaningful data on meaningful outcomes. It is appreciated, however, that head-to-head comparisons of all combinations and permutations would be impossibly large. Informed judgment and the expertise of experienced clinicians will therefore always be necessary.

### Development and potential role of type-2 sodium-glucose transporter inhibitors for management of type 2 diabetes [^78972546]. Diabetes Therapy (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Most patients with T2DM eventually succumb to the progressive nature of the disease and will, at some point, require multiple therapies to attain treatment targets. Only half the patients with T2DM achieve the HbA 1c target of less than 7%, despite the many different treatment options currently available. With SGLT2 inhibitors introducing an alternative means of managing glucose, we gain a further treatment option that may increase our ability to control T2DM. Experience will lead to better understanding of which patients are likely to respond best, and under what circumstances.

### Changing the treatment paradigm for type 2 diabetes [^908db666]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

The number of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients achieving, and even more importantly, maintaining glycemic target is limited. No specific data are available, but in the UKPDS, which comprised only newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients with no previous CV events, average A1C was ∼7%. This threshold value, however, was not maintained for >4 years, and more recent data indicated that <50% of this patient population is at target. Therefore, effective treatment for type 2 diabetes would require an early and effective intervention, though flexible enough to ensure longstanding metabolic control. To set new paradigms of treatment, strategies should be elaborated that identify and overcome current limitations. Many hurdles may hamper the possibility of a greater number of patients achieving target, and a tentative list of such factors is given in Table 1 and discussed in this article.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) affects an estimated 25.8 million people in the United States and is the 7th leading cause of death. While effective therapy can prevent or delay the complications that are associated with diabetes, according to the Center for Disease Control, 35% of Americans with DM are undiagnosed, and another 79 million Americans have blood glucose levels that greatly increase their risk of developing DM in the next several years. One of the Healthy People 2020 goals is to reduce the disease and economic burden of DM and improve the quality of life for all persons who have, or are at risk for, DM. Achieving this goal requires a concentrated focus on improving the management of diabetes and in targeting prevention of macrovascular complications.

### Therapeutics for type-2 diabetes mellitus: a glance at the recent inclusions and novel agents under development for use in clinical practice [^d45b74ae]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Since the ground-breaking work from the French physician Jean Sterne, who studied metformin for the first time in humans in the 1950s to treat DM,the industry has come a long way in investigating, developing, and delivering beneficial treatment modalities in T2DM. Most novel compounds produced for treatment have shown a potent anti-hyperglycaemic effect; however, they need to be examined further to ensure that their use is safe and well-tolerated in clinical practice. Various new therapeutic targets have been explored; however, an extension of previously known mechanisms has yielded greater success as in the case of sotagliflozin, for example. Innovations in delivery methods and reduction in dosing frequency will undoubtedly improve compliance with these formulations in the real world. Oral and once-weekly insulin, insulin patch pumps and once monthly GLP-1 analogues are an exciting prospect with the potential of conferring significant clinical benefits to patients.

The future appears to be bright; there are 129 active interventional studies in T2DM registered over the last 10 years, currently in phase 1 to phase 4 globally, based on data from ClinicalTrials.gov from March 2021. Can the academic and pharmaceutical industry come together and uncover an agent which reverses the underlying mechanisms fuelling dysglycaemia and normalizes glucose homoeostasis resulting in the cure of T2DM? Perhaps the advances in monoclonal antibody and gene therapy will provide this answer in the future.

### What next after metformin? Thinking beyond glycaemia: are SGLT2 inhibitors the answer? [^07c55b3b]. Diabetes Therapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Current T2DM Therapeutic Approach

In order to achieve normoglycaemia, patients with T2DM are initially managed with lifestyle modifications. For many patients whose blood glucose levels cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone, glucose-lowering medications are required. Metformin is the most widely accepted first-line treatment for T2DM due to its high efficacy in reducing plasma glucose, good safety profile, tolerability and low cost. It also has beneficial effects beyond glycaemic control such as improvements in endothelial dysfunction, haemostasis and oxidative stress, insulin resistance, lipid profiles and fat redistribution.

Although there is general agreement for the use of metformin as first-line treatment for almost all patients with T2DM, there is uncertainty regarding the choice of second-line therapy once metformin is no longer effective in achieving recommended glycaemic targets. Various drug treatments have been approved [e.g. sulfonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists]. However, the question of ‘what next after metformin?’, particularly in the context of the proliferation of therapy options, remains a complex clinical decision.

Specific members of the thiazolidinedione, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist classes have been associated with significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events, generally in those with established CVD. A personalized approach should consider these evidence-based therapies to optimize clinical outcomes.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes [^24784e3d]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to prevention of CVD, glucose-lowering medications, ESC 2023 guidelines recommend to consider initiating metformin to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with T2DM without ASCVD or severe target-organ damage at low, moderate,
high, or very high risk.

### Treat obesity to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus [^73ce9d7e]. Diabetes Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Obesity is a multifactorial chronic, relapsing progressive disease. It is a root cause of T2DM and harbors increased risk for diabetes-related complications. An obesity-centric treatment approach with sustained weigh loss helps target a key driver of T2DM much earlier in the disease course. Obesity management may also serve as a useful intervention in already established diabetes and its complications. Finally, obesity should be prevented or treated to prevent or treat type 2 diabetes and its complications.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus [^d2e74387]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

VA/DoD type 2 diabetes mellitus guideline—patient focus group findings note that participants found their diabetes impacted their daily life and described challenges such as managing co-occurring conditions and adhering to medication schedules. Participants shared that managing diabetes and adhering to testing and medication schedules was time-consuming and required attention and discipline, which for some hindered participation in life activities while for others became part of their routine. Some participants emphasized that negative health impacts from co-occurring conditions could make it difficult to follow prescribed nutrition and exercise plans. Participants stated that more available, structured, and/or frequent educational opportunities involving multiple types of clinicians would better help them understand and manage their diabetes, recognized the importance of education about diagnosis, impact, and treatment options, and expressed a desire for more options such as courses on diabetes self-management, nutrition, and exercise. Some participants shared that the emotional toll could be challenging and that structured opportunities to connect with other people with diabetes could help.
