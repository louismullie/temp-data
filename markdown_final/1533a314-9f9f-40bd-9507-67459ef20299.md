## Question

How does COVID-19 affect the white blood cell count and neutrophil levels?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how COVID-19 affects white blood cell (WBC) counts and neutrophil levels. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline hematologic pattern in COVID-19 and how it differs by severity. Then, I should quantify neutrophil changes and clarify what is signal versus noise in prognostication. Next, I will examine the NLR and its performance. After that, I will map the temporal evolution from acute to convalescent and longer-term sequelae. I will then review mechanistic links, including cytokines, monocyte-neutrophil axes, and NETs. I will also characterize peripheral smear abnormalities. Finally, I will translate this into clinical interpretation and cautionary notes about specificity and test accuracy, anchoring on meta-analyses and guideline perspectives to ensure I'm not over- or under-calling any associations [^116b8UVA] [^117Wvj3H].

> Let me first confirm the baseline hematologic phenotype. Across unselected COVID-19 cohorts, leukopenia is common, roughly 20–40%, whereas leukocytosis is less frequent overall, but the direction of WBC change tracks with clinical trajectory: milder illness tends toward leukopenia and severe/critical illness more often shows leukocytosis driven by neutrophilia; hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — WBC alone has low sensitivity for deterioration and mortality, so I should not overinterpret an isolated count without context [^111Wbtu2] [^115kXKmL]. I need to ensure I remember that increased or decreased WBC is not specific for COVID-19 versus other severe illnesses, especially in high comorbidity settings, which means pattern interpretation should be integrated with the overall clinical picture rather than used as a standalone diagnostic discriminator [^116jQ9jy].

> I will now examine neutrophil changes across severity. Meta-analytic syntheses show a stepwise increase in neutrophil counts with more severe disease, with standardized mean differences around 0.6–0.7 comparing severe versus non-severe, and even larger differences in non-survivors, consistent with intensified neutrophilia in ICU populations; wait, I should double-check that this reflects disease biology rather than just late bacterial superinfection — data suggest both hyperinflammatory COVID-19 responses and secondary infections can contribute, so serial assessment and clinical correlation are key [^1125XPUS]. Compared with survivors, non-survivors generally have higher neutrophil counts and higher total WBCs, reinforcing neutrophil expansion as a severity-linked signal rather than a universal feature in all cases [^111PsPuz]. Let me also consider pathophysiologic plausibility: neutrophil expansion tracks with hyperinflammation and immunothrombosis in severe COVID-19, further supporting the association beyond simple co-infection hypotheses [^113f1NYB] [^115ABgMb].

> Next, I should review the NLR as a prognostic marker. I need to check whether NLR independently predicts severity and mortality; meta-analyses and cohort studies consistently associate higher admission NLR with severe disease, ICU need, and short-term mortality, though optimal thresholds vary and should be applied contextually; but wait, what if the cutoff is cohort-specific — the literature indeed shows heterogeneity in thresholds, so trending NLR and integrating with other indices improves robustness [^116b8UVA]. I should confirm external validity: a hospital cohort analysis linked higher NLR with increased one-month mortality, supporting its use as part of an early risk stratification framework, and an admission nomogram combining age, NLR, and CT severity score predicted short-term progression, which aligns with my practice to combine physiologic and laboratory risk indicators rather than relying on a single metric [^114Fb6VY] [^113WVrCv].

> Let me think about the temporal evolution of neutrophil responses. In early disease, lymphopenia dominates and overall leukocytes may be modestly lower than non-COVID comparators; hmm, wait a minute, I should not overstate early neutropenia — it is not a consistent feature, but in mild cases relative neutrophil proportions may be less striking, whereas progression to severe disease shows rising neutrophil counts that parallel increases in CRP, LDH, and IL-6 and worsening oxygen needs over the first one to two weeks [^113QvZ3S] [^112C7rRN]. I should confirm convalescent changes: around 10 weeks after mild infection, some cohorts show persistently reduced neutrophil counts relative to controls, suggesting a transient marrow or homeostatic rebalancing effect that gradually resolves [^115ArJCM]. Over months 3–12 after severe disease, individuals with post-COVID interstitial changes exhibit a persistent neutrophil-associated immune signature in blood and airway, including NET-linked markers, and some have not fully normalized at 12 months, indicating long-tail immune remodeling in a subset [^114fspB6].

> I will now examine mechanistic drivers of neutrophilia. Hold on, I should verify whether hematopoietic skewing contributes; severe COVID-19 shows elevated IL-3 and suppressed Flt-3L, favoring myelopoiesis over lymphopoiesis, while G-CSF likely accelerates neutrophil production and egress, which biologically aligns with the observed NLR increases in critical disease [^1145vTCd]. Let me also consider the monocyte-neutrophil axis: in severe cases, an HLADR low CD9 low monocyte population expands and secretes neutrophil chemokines with monocyte-neutrophil aggregates in pulmonary microvasculature, linking innate cell crosstalk to vascular inflammation and neutrophil recruitment [^115ABgMb]. I should confirm the role of NETs: circulating NET markers correlate with respiratory support requirements, thrombosis, and mortality and decline with convalescence, supporting NET-driven immunothrombosis as a key pathobiologic feature in severe COVID-19 [^112ZqqB1].

> Next, I should review morphologic and functional abnormalities on peripheral smear. Reports consistently describe hypogranular neutrophils, pseudo–Pelger-Huet–like nuclear hyposegmentation, cytoplasmic vacuolation, increased apoptotic forms, and a left shift with bands and metamyelocytes, all consistent with emergency granulopoiesis and activation-induced injury; let me double-check that these changes intensify with severity — serial CBC with manual differentials in hospitalized cohorts shows numerically and morphologically abnormal WBC patterns that worsen with clinical progression, supporting their utility for daily monitoring [^111Wbtu2] [^111FVEMz].

> I need to check post-acute neutrophil dysfunction and special phenotypes. Case-level and cohort observations describe delayed, transient neutropenia weeks after COVID-19 pneumonia that resolves with observation in otherwise healthy patients, likely post-viral marrow suppression or immune-mediated kinetics, but I should verify exclusion of other causes before attributing to COVID-19 alone [^113zzsx5]. But wait, what if neutrophils become immunosuppressive rather than cytotoxic — polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cells (PMN-MDSCs) expand in severe and critical patients, particularly in those 60 years or younger; I almost concluded they predict in-hospital death, but hold on, I should verify — one study found PMN-MDSC levels associated with severity but not independently with mortality, underscoring that these populations may modulate host responses without serving as standalone prognostic markers [^11539ui6].

> Finally, I should translate this into clinical interpretation and safeguards. I need to ensure we use CBC with differential at baseline and serially in severe or critical cases, where guidelines suggest incorporating inflammatory markers for prognostication, but WBC metrics alone have limited diagnostic or prognostic sensitivity and should be combined with clinical severity, oxygenation, and imaging; NLR adds useful risk stratification but should be trended and contextualized rather than used as an isolated decision trigger [^113v9gSh]. Hold on, I should verify the test accuracy caveat: Cochrane reviews show low sensitivity of leukopenia for predicting mortality or deterioration and only moderate performance for leukocytosis and elevated neutrophil counts, reinforcing that single thresholds are insufficiently reliable for triage without broader clinical data [^115kXKmL] [^112e4Zo7]. I need to ensure that when neutrophilia accompanies hemodynamic instability, we also evaluate for sepsis and septic shock using standard criteria in patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, because missed bacterial co-infection can confound both laboratory interpretation and outcomes [^117Wvj3H].

COVID-19 causes **lymphopenia with neutrophilia** [^111Wbtu2] and an elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), especially in severe disease [^1125XPUS] [^114Vr4vR]. Neutrophilia and **high NLR** are linked to worse outcomes, including ARDS, ICU admission, and mortality [^114Fb6VY] [^116b8UVA]. Neutrophil activation and **NETs** [^115ABgMb] drive hyperinflammation, immunothrombosis, and organ damage [^112ZqqB1]. Leukocytosis is less common and nonspecific [^111Wbtu2], while neutropenia is rare [^115A4cSB] and usually transient. These changes reflect innate immune dysregulation [^116wWGoc] and help stratify risk and guide management [^111FVEMz].

## Changes in white blood cell count

COVID-19 alters WBC counts [^111Wbtu2]; **lymphopenia** is a hallmark [^113f1NYB], and neutrophilia occurs in severe disease [^1125XPUS].

- **Leukopenia**: Occurs in 20–40% of patients [^111Wbtu2], reflecting immune suppression or redistribution.
- **Leukocytosis**: Less common (3–24%) [^111Wbtu2] and often indicates secondary bacterial infection or severe inflammation [^114vFe6Q].
- **Lymphopenia**: Present in 30–75% [^111Wbtu2], especially in severe/critical illness [^1125XPUS], and correlates with worse outcomes [^116TG2K5].

---

## Neutrophil count and activation

Neutrophils are central to COVID-19 pathogenesis [^112o1GG7]; **neutrophilia** and activation correlate with severity [^114Vr4vR].

- **Neutrophilia**: Common in severe/critical cases [^1125XPUS] and associated with ARDS, ICU admission, and mortality.
- **Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR)**: Elevated NLR is a strong predictor of severity [^1125XPUS] and mortality [^114Fb6VY] [^116b8UVA].
- **Neutrophil activation**: Excessive activation and NETs [^112ZqqB1] drive hyperinflammation, immunothrombosis [^115ABgMb], and organ damage.

---

## Mechanisms underlying neutrophil changes

Neutrophil changes reflect **innate immune dysregulation** and hyperinflammation [^114Vr4vR].

- **Cytokine storm**: Elevated IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α promote neutrophil recruitment [^112o1GG7] and activation [^112ZqqB1].
- **NET formation**: NETs contribute to endothelial injury, microvascular thrombosis [^112ZqqB1], and organ dysfunction [^115ABgMb].
- **Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs)**: Neutrophilic MDSCs expand in severe disease, contributing to immunosuppression and dysregulation [^11539ui6].

---

## Clinical implications and prognostic significance

Neutrophil changes have prognostic value and guide management: neutrophilia and **high NLR** predict severe disease, ARDS, ICU admission [^1125XPUS], and mortality [^114Fb6VY] [^116b8UVA]. Serial CBC with differential and NLR aid risk stratification by identifying high-risk patients and guiding escalation [^111FVEMz] [^113v9gSh]. Neutrophil activation and NETs are potential therapeutic targets to mitigate hyperinflammation and thrombosis [^112ZqqB1] [^115ABgMb].

## Comparison with other viral infections

COVID-19 shows **distinct neutrophil patterns** compared with other viral infections.

| **Parameter** | **COVID-19** | **Influenza** | **SARS/MERS** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Neutrophilia | Common in severe cases [^1125XPUS] | Less prominent [^113JKKAj] | Variable |
| NLR | Elevated, strong prognostic marker [^1125XPUS] | Less pronounced [^113JKKAj] | Variable |
| NETs | Prominent, linked to thrombosis [^112ZqqB1] | Less prominent | Variable |

---

## Long-term hematological effects

COVID-19 can cause **persistent neutrophil activation** [^114fspB6] and immune dysregulation [^115ArJCM] after recovery. Ongoing activation and NETs may contribute to long COVID and pulmonary sequelae [^114fspB6], while **immune dysregulation** reflects sustained innate and adaptive changes that may underlie chronic symptoms and complications [^114fspB6].

---

COVID-19 causes **lymphopenia with neutrophilia**, with neutrophil activation and NETs driving hyperinflammation, immunothrombosis [^115ABgMb], and organ damage. Neutrophilia and high NLR predict severe outcomes [^116b8UVA] and are useful for risk stratification and management [^111FVEMz].

### Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio on admission to predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients: A meta-analysis [^116b8UVA]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), an inflammatory marker, was suggested to be predictive of severity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Here, we investigated whether NLR levels on admission could predict the severity and mortality of COVID-19 patients.

- **Methods**: A literature search was conducted on 23 July 2020 to retrieve all published articles, including grey literature and preprints, investigating the association between on-admission NLR values and severity or mortality in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed to determine the overall standardized mean difference (SMD) in NLR values and the pooled risk ratio (RR) for severity and mortality with the 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI).

- **Results**: A total of 38 articles, including 5,699 patients with severity outcomes and 6,033 patients with mortality outcomes, were included. The meta-analysis showed that severe and non-survivors of COVID-19 had higher on-admission NLR levels than non-severe and survivors (SMD 0.88; 95% CI 0.72–1.04; I² = 75.52% and 1.87; 95% CI 1.25–2.49; I² = 97.81%, respectively). Regardless of the different NLR cut-off values, the pooled mortality RR in patients with elevated vs. normal NLR levels was 2.74 (95% CI 0.98–7.66).

- **Conclusion**: High NLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 and mortality. Further studies need to focus on determining the optimal cut-off value for NLR before clinical use.

### Vascular neutrophilic inflammation and immunothrombosis distinguish severe COVID-19 from influenza pneumonia [^115ABgMb]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can lead to severe pneumonia, thrombotic complications, and non-pulmonary organ failure. Recent studies suggest intravascular neutrophil activation and subsequent immune cell-triggered immunothrombosis as a central pathomechanism linking the heterogeneous clinical picture of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to determine whether immunothrombosis is a pathognomonic factor in COVID-19 or a general feature of viral pneumonia, as well as to better understand its upstream regulation.

By comparing histopathological specimens of SARS-CoV-2 with influenza-affected lungs, we show that vascular neutrophil recruitment, NETosis, and subsequent immunothrombosis are typical features of severe COVID-19, but less prominent in influenza pneumonia. Activated neutrophils were typically found in physical association with monocytes. To explore this further, we combined clinical data of COVID-19 cases with comprehensive immune cell phenotyping and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid scRNA-seq data. We show that an HLADR low CD9 low monocyte population expands in severe COVID-19, releases neutrophil chemokines in the lungs, and might in turn explain neutrophil expansion and pulmonary recruitment in the late stages of severe COVID-19.

Our data underline an innate immune cell axis causing vascular inflammation and immunothrombosis in severe SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Hematological abnormalities in COVID-19: A narrative review [^111Wbtu2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

Twenty to 40% of COVID-19 patients have leucopenia, and 3–24% have leukocytosis. Lymphopenia (lymphocyte count ≤ 1,100 cells/μL) was seen in 30–75% of COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis performed by Huan and Pranata found a strong association between lymphopenia and severe COVID-19. CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes are predominantly reduced in the COVID-19 patients requiring ICU care. There was increased expression of PD-1 and Tim-3 in surviving T cells, suggesting functional exhaustion. Neutrophilia has been reported in severe COVID-19 patients, with an elevated neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio identified as a marker for in-hospital mortality and severe COVID-19 disease. Reactive lymphocytes have been described in many viral infections, including COVID-19. Reactive lymphocyte and antibody-secreting lymphocytes identified based on automated hematology analyzer scattergrams were shown to rise toward the second week of infection. Although not many studies have commented on changes in eosinophil counts in COVID-19, Zhang et al. found 52.9% of COVID-19 patients to have reduced eosinophil counts.

Zini et al. found morphological changes in neutrophils (such as abnormal shape of the nucleus and cytoplasmic granulation) and platelets (hyperchromatic forms). Apoptotic and immature granulocytes were observed in the peripheral blood smear and may be due to the perturbation of normal granulopoiesis. The cytokine storm and hyperinflammation were proposed as possible causal factors for these changes.

### Circulating markers of neutrophil extracellular traps are of prognostic value in patients with COVID-19 [^112ZqqB1]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2021). Low credibility.

The full spectrum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection ranges from asymptomatic to acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by hyperinflammation and thrombotic microangiopathy. The pathogenic mechanisms are poorly understood, but emerging evidence suggests that excessive neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation plays a key role in COVID-19 disease progression. Here, we evaluate if circulating markers of NETs are associated with COVID-19 disease severity and clinical outcome, as well as with markers of inflammation and in vivo coagulation and fibrinolysis.

One hundred six patients with COVID-19 with moderate to severe disease were enrolled shortly after hospital admission and followed for four months. Acute and convalescent plasma samples, as well as plasma samples from 30 healthy individuals, were assessed for markers of NET formation: citrullinated histone H3, cell-free DNA, and NE (neutrophil elastase). We found that all plasma levels of NET markers were elevated in patients with COVID-19 relative to healthy controls, that they were associated with respiratory support requirement and short-term mortality, and declined to those found in healthy individuals four months post-infection. The levels of the NET markers also correlated with white blood cells, neutrophils, inflammatory cytokines, and C-reactive protein, as well as with markers of in vivo coagulation, fibrinolysis, and endothelial damage.

Our findings suggest a role of NETs in COVID-19 disease progression, implicating their contribution to an immunothrombotic response.

- **The neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, and COVID-19 severity**: About 124 studies on the evaluation of neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils cells between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients were included. As shown in Figure S5, the neutrophil cell count and neutrophil cell ratio in the severe group were significantly higher than those in the non-severe group, with standardized mean differences (SMDs) of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.61–0.82; p < 0.01; Figure S5a) and 0.62 (95% CI, 0.35–0.88; p < 0.01; Figure S5b), respectively. The monocyte cell ratio and eosinophil cell count were significantly lower in the severe patients than in the non-severe patients of COVID-19, with SMDs of −0.36 (95% CI, −0.51 to −0.21; p < 0.01; Figure S5c) and −0.45 (95% CI, −0.59 to −0.31; p < 0.01; Figure S5d). Meanwhile, the monocyte cell count and basophil cell count were comparable between the two groups, with SMDs of −0.06 (95% CI, −0.15 to 0.04; p = 0.24; Figure S5e) and −0.14 (95% CI, −0.43 to 0.15; p = 0.34; Figure S5f), respectively.

- **Sub-analysis of only peer-reviewed studies**: A sub-analysis considering only peer-reviewed studies for each immune mediator was performed, and the results were presented in Table 2 without obvious differences compared to those of all the included literature analyzed.

### Delayed, transient and self-resolving neutropenia following COVID-19 pneumonia [^113zzsx5]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A novel coronavirus, identified as SARS-CoV-2, spread throughout the world in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many discoveries and clinical manifestations. A young patient is presented with new, self-resolving neutropenia presenting weeks following a prolonged hospital stay for COVID-19 pneumonia. Workup included analysis for underlying infection, nutritional abnormalities, malignancy, medication, and toxin exposure, all of which were negative. From 2020 to the present, few reports have described neutropenia associated with a recent COVID-19 infection. In particular, no reports have described a delayed presentation of neutropenia. The authors propose that the significant inflammatory response associated with COVID-19 likely led to this patient's postviral neutropenia. Furthermore, in young healthy patients, bone marrow biopsy may be deferred and a watchful-waiting approach may be taken to assess for neutropenia resolution.

### Immunological imprint of COVID-19 on human peripheral blood leukocyte populations [^115ArJCM]. Allergy (2021). Low credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a pandemic that is now claiming many lives. Several studies have investigated cellular immune responses in COVID-19-infected patients during the disease, but little is known regarding a possible protracted impact of COVID-19 on the adaptive and innate immune system in COVID-19 convalescent patients.

- **Methods**: We used multiparametric flow cytometry to analyze whole peripheral blood samples and determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels against the S-protein, its RBD-subunit, and viral nucleocapsid in a cohort of COVID-19 convalescent patients who had mild disease approximately 10 weeks after infection (n = 109) and healthy control subjects (n = 98). Furthermore, we correlated immunological changes with clinical and demographic parameters.

- **Results**: Even ten weeks after the disease, COVID-19 convalescent patients had fewer neutrophils, while their cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were activated, reflected as higher HLA-DR and CD38 expression. Multiparametric regression analyses showed that in COVID-19-infected patients both CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ effector memory cells were higher, while CD25+ Foxp3+ T regulatory cells were lower. In addition, both transitional B cell and plasmablast levels were significantly elevated in COVID-19-infected patients. Fever (duration, level) correlated with numbers of central memory CD4+ T cells and anti-S and anti-RBD, but not anti-NC antibody levels. Moreover, a "young immunological age", as determined by numbers of CD3+ CD45RA+ CD62L+ CD31+ recent thymic emigrants, was associated with a loss of sense of taste and/or smell.

### Early decrease in blood lymphocyte count is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^116TG2K5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). High credibility.

In the early stage, lymphocyte count can dynamically reflect the pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 patients. An early decrease in lymphocyte count is associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. This finding may indicate that COVID-19 patients with decreased lymphocytes after admission need more attention.

### Pragmatic recommendations for the use of diagnostic testing and prognostic models in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries [^113v9gSh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

A variety of laboratory investigations may aid in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. Some markers may predict disease severity and progression to ARDS, thromboembolic complications, or multi-organ failure. The U.S. NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines suggest performing the following laboratory tests as part of the initial evaluation of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 disease: a complete blood count with differential, metabolic profile, and liver and renal function tests. It also advises measuring the levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), D-dimer, and ferritin for their prognostic values, though not part of the standard care. The WHO interim guidelines on the management of COVID-19 disease (May 27, 2020, September 11, 2020), however, do not provide guidance on specific laboratory testing in COVID-19 patients. This section attempts to address this discrepancy with a focus on resource-constrained LMIC settings.

- **Search results**: MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through the end of September 2020. The search used combinations of MeSH terms and free-text words, including "COVID–19", "coronavirus", "SARS–CoV–2", and "laboratory findings" or "laboratory abnormalities". Few of the studies originated from LMICs. The search identified two useful systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The search did not identify any randomized clinical studies.

- **Evidence**: Lymphopenia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and low hemoglobin predict progression toward severe COVID-19. White blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts…

### Monocyte-driven atypical cytokine storm and aberrant neutrophil activation as key mediators of COVID-19 disease severity [^116wWGoc]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Epidemiological and clinical reports indicate that SARS-CoV-2 virulence hinges upon the triggering of an aberrant host immune response more so than on direct virus-induced cellular damage. To elucidate the immunopathology underlying COVID-19 severity, we perform cytokine and multiplex immune profiling in COVID-19 patients.

We show that hypercytokinemia in COVID-19 differs from the interferon-gamma-driven cytokine storm in macrophage activation syndrome and is more pronounced in critical versus mild-moderate COVID-19. Systems modelling of cytokine levels paired with deep-immune profiling shows that classical monocytes drive this hyper-inflammatory phenotype and that a reduction in T-lymphocytes correlates with disease severity, with CD8+ cells being disproportionately affected. Antigen-presenting machinery expression is also reduced in critical disease. Furthermore, we report that neutrophils contribute to disease severity and local tissue damage by amplification of hypercytokinemia and the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps.

Together, our findings suggest a myeloid-driven immunopathology, in which hyperactivated neutrophils and an ineffective adaptive immune system act as mediators of COVID-19 disease severity.

### Risk factors for severe disease and efficacy of treatment in patients infected with COVID-19: A systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression analysis [^114vFe6Q]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Our meta-analysis provides an in-depth analysis of the key epidemiological features, clinical characteristics, laboratory investigations, radiological findings, treatment details, and outcomes of COVID-19 from the published literature. We identified elevated LDH as a significant predictive marker of ARDS and found that both elevated leukocyte count and elevated LDH predict mortality. Treatment with the antiretroviral drug lopinavir-ritonavir was not associated with significant benefit, while corticosteroids were associated with possible harm.

Early recognition of severe infection may allow early intervention with supportive measures and therapeutics and improve outcomes. Our meta-regression identified five significant markers of ICU admission: increased leukocyte count, ALT, AST, elevated LDH, and increased procalcitonin. While 10.7% of patients had an increased leukocyte count in our meta-analysis, the degree of leukocytosis was modest (pooled mean leukocyte count was 6.0 × 10^9/L). Increased ALT and AST in severe COVID-19 may be a result of liver damage caused by the direct binding of SARS-CoV-2 to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2–positive cholangiocytes. In our analysis, LDH was the only marker that significantly predicted all three measured outcomes: ICU admission, ARDS, and mortality. LDH is released from cells upon damage to their cytoplasmic membrane and is not only a metabolic but also an immune surveillance prognostic biomarker. LDH increases the production of lactate, which leads to enhancement of immune-suppressive cells.

### Febrile neutropenia due to Covid-19 in an immunocompetent patient [^115A4cSB]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

While lymphopenia has been a common finding in Covid-19 infection, particularly in severe cases, febrile neutropenia has been very rarely reported in immunocompetent patients with Covid-19. Herein, we report the case of a 76-year-old hypertensive and diabetic man who was hospitalized with severe Covid-19 infection and developed delayed-onset severe neutropenia with neutropenic fever, which responded to treatment with antibiotics and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. This case highlights the importance of identifying a rare complication (febrile neutropenia in the fifth week) of Covid-19 infection in hospitalized patients by intensive monitoring and aggressive management for favorable outcomes.

### Distinct immunological signatures discriminate severe COVID-19 from non-SARS-CoV-2-driven critical pneumonia [^114Vr4vR]. Immunity (2021). Low credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected more than 150 million people worldwide and resulted in more than 3 million deaths as of April 2021. The causative agent is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The majority of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 are either asymptomatic or develop mild and self-limiting symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, approximately 8% of COVID-19 patients experience severe complications such as pneumonia, respiratory failure, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which frequently require intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation. Despite some clinical similarities to other severe respiratory infections causing multi-organ failure, COVID-19 presents unique clinical challenges that have not yet been overcome, with the in-ICU mortality rate remaining at approximately 50%. There is an urgent need to understand how mild and severe SARS-CoV-2 infections differ from each other and from other causes of severe respiratory syndrome.

Although the factors underpinning severe COVID-19 are not yet completely understood, evidence suggests that extreme respiratory distress in these patients is mediated primarily by immunopathology. Multiple studies have shown differences in the proportions of immune cell populations in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients compared with healthy individuals, in particular a marked lymphopenia that is accompanied by changes to the lymphocyte activation and exhaustion phenotype.

### Neutrophilic myeloid-derived suppressor cells and severity in SARS-CoV-2 infection [^11539ui6]. Laboratory Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

While we strive to live with SARS-CoV-2, defining the immune response that leads to recovery rather than severe disease remains highly important. COVID-19 has been associated with inflammation and a profoundly suppressed immune response.

- **Objective**: To study myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), which are potent immunosuppressive cells, in SARS-CoV-2 infection.

- **Results**: Patients with severe and critical COVID-19 showed higher frequencies of neutrophilic (PMN)-MDSCs than patients with moderate illness and control individuals (P = .005). Severe disease in individuals older and younger than 60 years was associated with distinct PMN-MDSC frequencies, being predominantly higher in patients of 60 years of age and younger (P = .004). However, both age groups showed comparable inflammatory markers. In our analysis for the prediction of poor outcome during hospitalization, MDSCs were not associated with increased risk of death; still, patients older than 60 years of age (odds ratio [OR] = 5.625; p = 0.02) with preexisting medical conditions (OR = 2.818; p = 0.003) showed more severe disease and worse outcomes. Among the immunological parameters, increased C-reactive protein (OR = 1.015; p = 0.04) and lymphopenia (OR = 5.958; p = 0.04) strongly identified patients with poor prognosis.

- **Conclusion**: PMN-MDSCs are associated with disease severity in COVID-19; however, MDSC levels do not predict increased risk of death during hospitalization.

### Hematological findings and complications of COVID-19 [^113f1NYB]. American Journal of Hematology (2020). Low credibility.

COVID-19 is a systemic infection with a significant impact on the hematopoietic system and hemostasis. Lymphopenia may be considered a cardinal laboratory finding, with prognostic potential. The neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and peak platelet/lymphocyte ratio may also have prognostic value in determining severe cases. During the disease course, longitudinal evaluation of lymphocyte count dynamics and inflammatory indices, including LDH, CRP, and IL-6, may help identify cases with a dismal prognosis and prompt early intervention to improve outcomes. Biomarkers such as high serum procalcitonin and ferritin have also emerged as poor prognostic factors.

Blood hypercoagulability is common among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Elevated D-Dimer levels are consistently reported, with their gradual increase during the disease course particularly associated with worsening disease. Other coagulation abnormalities, such as PT and aPTT prolongation and increased fibrin degradation products, along with severe thrombocytopenia, can lead to life-threatening disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), necessitating continuous vigilance and prompt intervention. Thus, COVID-19-infected patients, whether hospitalized or ambulatory, are at high risk for venous thromboembolism, and early and prolonged pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin is highly recommended. Lastly, the need for ensuring blood donations during the pandemic is also highlighted.

### Clinical significance of CBC and WBC morphology in the diagnosis and clinical course of COVID-19 infection [^111FVEMz]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Low credibility.

To investigate the clinical significance of numeric and morphologic peripheral blood (PB) changes in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-positive patients in predicting the outcome, as well as to compare these changes between critically ill COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative patients.

- **Methods**: The study included 90 COVID-19-positive (51 intensive care unit [ICU] and 39 non-ICU) patients and 30 COVID-19-negative ICU patients. We collected CBC parameters (both standard and research) and PB morphologic findings, which were independently scored by two hematopathologists.

- **Results**: All patients with COVID-19 demonstrated striking numeric and morphologic WBC changes, which were different between mild and severe disease states. More severe disease was associated with significant neutrophilia and lymphopenia, which was intensified in critically ill patients. Abnormal WBC morphology, most pronounced in monocytes and lymphocytes, was associated with more mild disease; the changes were lost with disease progression. Between COVID-19-positive and COVID-19-negative ICU patients, significant differences in morphology-associated research parameters were indicative of changes due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus, including higher RNA content in monocytes, lower RNA content in lymphocytes, and smaller hypogranular neutrophils.

- **Conclusions**: Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 should undergo a comprehensive daily CBC with manual WBC differential to monitor for numerical and morphologic changes predictive of poor outcome and signs of disease progression.

### Distinguishing between COVID-19 and influenza during the early stages by measurement of peripheral blood parameters [^113JKKAj]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. This study aims to examine the changes in peripheral blood parameters during the early stages of COVID-19 and influenza. We analyzed the peripheral blood parameters of 169 COVID-19 patients and 131 influenza patients during the early-onset stage. Results from the patients with COVID-19 were compared with those from healthy controls and influenza patients. In addition, results from patients with common and severe COVID-19 were further compared.

There were significant differences between COVID-19 and influenza patients in terms of age, white blood cell count, platelet count, percentage of neutrophils, percentage of lymphocytes, percentage of monocytes, percentage of eosinophils, percentage of basophils, neutrophil count, and monocyte count. Two parameters (monocyte count and percentage of basophils) were combined to clarify the diagnostic efficacy of COVID-19 and influenza, and the area under the curve was found to be 0.772.

Comparison of peripheral blood parameters from common COVID-19, severe COVID-19, and influenza patients revealed many differences during the early disease stages. The diagnostic formula developed by this study will be of benefit for physicians in the differentiation of COVID-19 and influenza.

### Increased age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and white blood cells count are associated with higher COVID-19 mortality [^114Fb6VY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), caused by the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV-2, was first reported from Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The present study assessed possible associations between one-month mortality and demographic data, SpO2, underlying diseases, and laboratory findings in COVID-19 patients. Recent studies on COVID-19 have focused on the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as an independent risk factor for in-hospital death and as a significant prognostic biomarker of outcomes in critically ill patients. In this study, we assessed the predictive potential of this factor concerning one-month mortality.

Patients admitted to Imam Reza Hospital, affiliated with Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran, from March to June 2020, with positive RT-PCR results for SARS-CoV-2, were included. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the Cox proportional hazard model were used to estimate one-month mortality since admission and determine factors associated with one-month mortality.

In this retrospective cohort study, 219 patients were included (137 men and 82 women; mean ages 58.2 ± 16 and 57 ± 17.3 years, respectively). Hypertension, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes were the most common comorbidities. Among these patients, 63 were admitted to the ICU, and 31 deaths occurred during one-month follow-up. Regarding mean peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), 142 patients had SpO2 ≤ 90%. Based on our analysis, older age and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio are associated with higher one-month mortality.

### A persistent neutrophil-associated immune signature characterizes post-COVID-19 pulmonary sequelae [^114fspB6]. Science Translational Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial lung disease and associated fibrosis occur in a proportion of individuals who have recovered from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection through unknown mechanisms. We studied individuals with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) after recovery from acute illness. Individuals with evidence of interstitial lung changes at 3 to 6 months after recovery had an up-regulated neutrophil-associated immune signature, including increased chemokines, proteases, and markers of neutrophil extracellular traps that were detectable in the blood.

Similar pathways were enriched in the upper airway with a concomitant increase in antiviral type I interferon signaling. Interaction analysis of the peripheral phosphoproteome identified enriched kinases critical for neutrophil inflammatory pathways. Evaluation of these individuals at 12 months after recovery indicated that a subset of the individuals had not yet achieved full normalization of radiological and functional changes. These data provide insight into mechanisms driving the development of pulmonary sequelae during and after COVID-19 and provide a rational basis for the development of targeted approaches to prevent long-term complications.

### A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 review, part 2: Host extracellular to systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^111SBsfs]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The betacoronavirus continues to evolve with global health implications as we race to learn more to curb its transmission, evolution, and sequelae. This review, the second of a three-part series, focuses on the biological effects of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on post-acute disease, particularly in the context of tissue and organ adaptations and damage. We highlight the knowledge gained and describe how virological, animal, and clinical studies have illuminated the mechanisms driving the varied clinical diagnoses and observations of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we describe how investigations into SARS-CoV-2 effects have informed the understanding of viral pathogenesis and provide innovative pathways for future research on the mechanisms of viral diseases.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^115kXKmL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

White blood cell count decrease was assessed for the target conditions: mortality and deterioration.

- **Mortality**: For five studies, four used a cut-off value of 4 x 10⁹ cells/L, and one used 5.025 x 10⁹ cells/L as the cut-off. Sensitivity ranged from 0% to 40% and specificity from 39% to 97%. At a fixed specificity of 68% (Q1), 83% (median), and 87% (Q3), the summary estimates of sensitivity were 9% (95% CI 6% to 14%) in each case.

- **Deterioration**: In six studies, cut-off values ranged from 3.5 to 4 x 10⁹ cells/L. Sensitivity ranged from 0% to 43%, with two studies reporting a sensitivity of 0%. Specificity ranged from 37% to 91%. Meta-analysis yielded a sensitivity of 15% (95% CI 6% to 33%), 12% (95% CI 5% to 26%), and 8% (95% CI /) at fixed specificities of 83% (Q1), 85% (median), and 88% (Q3), respectively.

Neutrophil count increase was assessed for deterioration in five studies, with cut-off values ranging between 4.7 and 10 x 10⁹ cells/L. Sensitivity ranged from 17% to 62%, and specificity from 70% to 93%. The median specificity in these studies was 89%, with an interquartile range from 88% to 93%. Summary estimates of sensitivity corresponding to these specificities were: 62% (95% CI 46% to 75%) at a specificity of 88%, 49% (95% CI 37% to 62%) at a specificity of 89%, and 41% (95% CI 28% to 55%) at a specificity of 93%.

### Routine laboratory testing to determine if a patient has COVID-19 [^117Bzj16]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Fifteen studies (1262 cases/5318 non‐cases) reported on white blood cell count increase. The cut-off values for an increase in white blood cell count varied from 9.5 x 10^9 cells/L to 11.2 x 10^9 cells/L, with the exception of one study that used a cut-off value of 6.4 x 10^9 cells/L. The median prevalence of COVID-19 in the 12 single-gate studies that reported on white blood cell count increase was 36% (IQR 25% to 50%).

- **Summary ROC plot of tests**: 1: white blood cell count (WBC) increase; 2: WBC decrease.

Sensitivity in the 15 included studies ranged from 0% to 73%. Fourteen studies had a sensitivity within the range between 0% and 13%, while one study reported a sensitivity of 73%. This outlier was also the only study that used the lower cut-off of 6.4 x 10^9 cells/L. Specificity ranged from 54% to 96%.

The median specificity was 85%, with the interquartile range from 78% (Q1) to 92% (Q3). The summary estimate of sensitivity from the HSROC model, corresponding with a specificity of 78%, was 12% (95% CI 4% to 31%). The summary estimate of sensitivity corresponding with the median specificity of 85% was 6% (95% CI 2% to 17%), and the summary estimate of sensitivity corresponding with a specificity of 92% was 2% (95% CI 0% to 8%).

### Distinct clinical and immunological profiles of patients with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in sub-Saharan Africa [^1145vTCd]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Some of the major features of severe COVID-19 are lymphopenia and neutrophilia in the systemic circulation. As such, the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio has been shown to have prognostic value, predicting those at high risk of severe disease or death. However, the mechanisms behind lymphopenia and neutrophilia during COVID-19 are still not well understood. Interestingly, in our study, concentrations of IL-3 and Flt-3L were distinctively altered in severe COVID-19 participants compared to non-COVID-19 SARI participants. Specifically, in severe COVID-19 participants, IL-3 was detected at very high levels in the nasal lining fluid, while Flt-3L was repressed in serum. IL-3 and Flt-3L are key cytokines involved in haematopoiesis of leucocytes. IL-3 induces expansion and generation of myeloid cells, while Flt-3L binds to Flt-3 and activates common lymphoid progenitor cells to increase the number of lymphocytes. Alterations in these cytokines in mouse models are associated with dysregulated haematopoiesis and altered leucocyte cellularity. Therefore, it is plausible that high levels of IL-3 and repressed levels of Flt-3L could contribute to the high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio and altered leucocyte numbers observed in severe COVID-19 patients.

Due to the high HIV prevalence in our setting, we conducted an exploratory analysis of the impact of HIV co-infection on COVID-19. While data from the United Kingdom and South Africa suggests an increased risk of mortality in HIV-infected COVID-19 patients, a systematic review and data from the United States did not demonstrate this trend.

### Temporal changes of haematological and radiological findings of the COVID-19 infection-a review of literature [^112fWsjK]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

This review included 27 studies, all conducted in China. Among these, only one study focused on critically ill patients, which is a limitation. The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in other countries, including the United States and several European countries, has since exceeded those in China. However, our review findings align with emerging evidence of haematological and radiological changes from other parts of the world.

The majority of the studies (n = 25) were retrospective, thus possessing design-specific limitations such as selection bias, residual confounding, and temporal ambiguity. Some studies could not be included in the evaluation of the infection time course due to the lack of precise symptom onset dates reported. Furthermore, there was a deficiency in the number of studies reporting findings on COVID-19 patients in the later phase (DOO > 7 days). Additionally, few studies monitored the clinical course of a patient from symptom onset to ultimate outcome, which would have allowed for better analysis of clinical progression regarding either peripheral blood or radiological investigations. Different studies reported various normal ranges for peripheral blood investigation results, complicating comparisons, especially when accounting for slight elevations or decreases that may indicate disease progression at an early phase. Moreover, this review did not account for the treatments administered to patients.

### Temporal changes of haematological and radiological findings of the COVID-19 infection-a review of literature [^112C7rRN]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

With time progression, peripheral blood results reflect worsening lymphopenia and more significant elevations in CRP and LDH, as well as increases in neutrophil counts. Temporal changes also show a decrease in the frequency of GGO, opposed to increasing consolidation and crazy paving patterns on chest CT imaging. The lesion distribution in early-phase disease already appears extensive and continues to cause more lung involvement over time. These findings suggest a positive correlation between temporal progression, disease severity, and the reported blood and radiology results. Awareness of these trends in blood results and imaging changes may assist clinicians in making ICU admission decisions when resources are limited.

### Role of eosinophils in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of COVID-19 [^112WRphM]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic, which has severely affected global public health security. However, the diagnosis and treatment of the disease need further exploration. Therefore, this retrospective analysis was conducted on multiple indicators of peripheral blood in patients with COVID-19 to determine the role of leukocytes, lymphocytes, and eosinophils in the diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of COVID-19.

Baseline information and clinical records of 40 patients were collected, including demographic data, disease status, medication, and laboratory routine. The correlation between the inspection indicators and disease classification, as well as prognostic factors, was analyzed. Decreased eosinophils were detected in 33 out of 40 patients with COVID-19 on admission, while lymphocytes and eosinophils were inversely related to the severity of the disease, according to Spearman's correlation coefficient. Thus, it could be deduced that eosinophils have better sensitivity for the diagnosis of COVID-19 and play a major role similar to lymphocytes in assessing the prognosis of patients.

### Early prediction of disease progression in COVID-19 pneumonia patients with chest CT and clinical characteristics [^113WVrCv]. Nature Communications (2020). Low credibility.

Here, we present a nomogram that integrates age, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and CT severity score upon admission, demonstrating good performance in predicting short-term disease progression in hospitalized patients with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. These findings have significant implications for early prediction of progression risk and for guiding individualized treatment plans for COVID-19 pneumonia patients.

### Eosinopenia as an early diagnostic marker of COVID-19 at the time of the epidemic [^114C5c7y]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly worldwide since its outbreak in December 2019. COVID-19 may present with varying degrees of disease severity, ranging from asymptomatic or mild upper respiratory illness to multiple organ failure with fatal outcomes. SARS-CoV-2 is more contagious than SARS-CoV or the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Subsequently, isolation of suspected cases is of utmost importance to prevent the epidemic from spreading.

However, similar to SARS and MERS, fever and respiratory symptoms are not unique clinical manifestations of COVID-19, despite fever occurring in the majority (83% to 98%) of diagnosed COVID-19 patients. While definitive diagnosis of COVID-19 requires a high degree of clinical understanding, including laboratory confirmation tests for SARS-CoV-2 infection and typical pulmonary computed tomography abnormalities, the initial screening for COVID-19 mostly starts at fever clinics. Thus, it is critical for the fever clinic to efficiently triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms, ideally using a method that is both accurate and easily applicable.

In this issue of EClinicalMedicine, Li and colleagues reported that the combination of eosinopenia (defined as a reduction of circulating eosinophils < 0.02 x 10^9/L) and elevated high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP, ≥ 4.0 mg/L) can effectively triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients attending the fever clinic.

### Comparison of blood counts and markers of inflammation and coagulation in patients with and without COVID-19 presenting to the emergency department in Seattle, WA [^113QvZ3S]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Low credibility.

We compared complete blood count (CBC) with differential and markers of inflammation and coagulation in patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presenting to emergency departments in Seattle, WA.

- **Methods**: We reviewed laboratory values for one week following each COVID-19 test for adult patients who received a standard severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test before April 13, 2020. Results were compared by COVID-19 status and clinical course.

- **Results**: A total of 1,027 patients met inclusion criteria. Patients with COVID-19 (n = 155) had lower leukocytes (P < .0001), lymphocytes (P < .0001), platelets (P < .0001), and higher hemoglobin (P = .0140) than those without, but absolute differences were small. Serum albumin was lower in patients with COVID-19 (P < .0001), and serum albumin, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and red cell distribution width (RDW) were each associated with disease severity. NLR did not differ between patients with COVID-19 and those without (P = .8012).

- **Conclusions**: Patients with COVID-19 had modestly lower leukocyte, lymphocyte, and platelet counts and higher hemoglobin values than patients without COVID-19. The NLR, serum albumin, and RDW varied with disease severity, regardless of COVID-19 status.

### Hematological abnormalities in COVID-19: A narrative review [^113FtR3b]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2. Although pulmonary manifestations have been identified as the major symptoms, several hematological abnormalities have also been identified. This review summarizes the reported hematological abnormalities, including changes in platelet, white blood cell, hemoglobin, and coagulation/fibrinolytic alterations. It explores their pathomechanisms and discusses management strategies.

Common hematological abnormalities in COVID-19 are lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated D-dimer levels. These alterations are significantly more common and prominent in patients with severe COVID-19 disease and may serve as possible biomarkers for those needing hospitalization and intensive care unit care. Close attention needs to be paid to coagulation abnormalities, and steps should be taken to prevent these from occurring or to mitigate their harmful effects. The effect of COVID-19 in patients with hematological abnormalities and recognized hematological drug toxicities of therapies for COVID-19 are also outlined.

### Early decrease in blood lymphocyte count is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^111PsPuz]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

The demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline are shown in Table 1. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 5.45% (29/532). Notably, non-survivors were significantly older than survivors (64.72 ± 13.11 vs. 48.18 ± 14.41, P < 0.001). Compared with survivors, the counts of white blood cells (7.60 ± 3.28 vs. 5.43 ± 3.13, P < 0.001) and neutrophils (6.31 ± 3.32 vs. 3.84 ± 2.89, P < 0.001) were higher in non-survivors. Additionally, the counts of baseline lymphocytes (0.76 ± 0.36 vs. 1.08 ± 0.49, P < 0.001) and platelets (176.14 ± 89.00 vs. 186.09 ± 72.35, P < 0.001) were lower in non-survivors than in survivors.

Regarding comorbidities, it was observed that non-survivors were more likely to have a history of hypertension (P < 0.001) and diabetes (P < 0.001). The differences in lymphocyte count between survivors and non-survivors at different time points are detailed further. On the 5th to 6th day, male survivors had a significantly higher lymphocyte count than non-survivors (P < 0.001). Similarly, female survivors had a significantly higher lymphocyte count on the 14th to 15th day compared to non-survivors (P = 0.023).

### Hematological abnormalities in COVID-19: A narrative review [^115b7KoX]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

Lymphocytopenia is significantly more common in patients with severe COVID-19. Non-survivors had a lower lymphocyte count and higher prothrombin time than survivors. Antibody-synthesizing lymphocytes, as a percentage of total lymphocytes, were also shown to be predictive of severe disease. The D-dimer level is the most useful and consistent marker for identifying COVID-19 disease severity. Yao et al. found a D-dimer level of > 2.14 mg/L to predict hospital mortality, with a sensitivity of 88.2% and specificity of 71.3%.

### Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study [^113C4FMc]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is currently a pandemic affecting over 200 countries. Many cities have established designated fever clinics to triage suspected COVID-19 patients from other patients with similar symptoms. However, given the limited availability of nucleic acid tests, as well as the long waiting time for both the test and radiographic examinations, the quarantine or therapeutic decisions for a large number of mixed patients were often not made in time. We aimed to identify simple and quickly available laboratory biomarkers to facilitate effective triage at fever clinics for sorting suspected COVID-19 patients from those with COVID-19-like symptoms.

- **Methods**: We collected clinical, etiological, and laboratory data of 989 patients who visited the Fever Clinic at Wuhan Union Hospital, Wuhan, China, from January 31 to February 21. Based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) nucleic acid testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection, they were divided into two groups: SARS-CoV-2-positive patients as cases and SARS-CoV-2-negative patients as controls. We compared the clinical features and laboratory findings of the two groups and analyzed the diagnostic performance of several laboratory parameters in predicting SARS-CoV-2 infection. Relevant comparisons were made to the China diagnosis guideline of having a normal or decreased number of leukocytes (≤ 9.5 × 10^9/L) or lymphopenia (< 1.1 × 10^9/L).

- **Findings**: Normal or decreased number of leukocytes (≤ 9.5 × 10^9/L), lymphopenia (< 1.1 × 10^9/L), eosinopenia (< 0.02 × 10^9/L).

### Temporal changes of haematological and radiological findings of the COVID-19 infection-a review of literature [^1152mRHF]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

A systematic literature review was conducted using online databases, including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. The search aimed to identify publications reporting radiological or blood changes in patients with COVID-19. This was performed in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Electronic searches covered the period from December 1, 2019, to March 29, 2020, using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and non-MeSH key terms with Boolean operators.

All searches underwent a double-blind screening of the title and abstract by two researchers for inclusion and exclusion criteria. The inclusion criteria were studies that included patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and reported radiological (computed tomography (CT) of thorax/chest radiograph) or blood (full blood count) findings, along with the date since the onset of symptoms when the investigations were done. Excluded materials comprised case reports, studies with fewer than 10 patients, abstracts, letters to editors, editorials, commentaries, features, news, guidelines, opinion pieces, and non-English language papers. Duplicates were removed, and the selected articles underwent a full-text review to verify quality and eligibility. Conflicts were resolved by consensus.

Data was extracted from text, tables, and figures in each selected paper using a standardized method into a preformatted database by a single researcher.

### The value of clinical parameters in predicting the severity of COVID-19 [^117FJBQb]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

To study the relationship between clinical indexes and the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and to explore its role in predicting the severity of COVID-19, clinical data of 443 patients with COVID-19 admitted to our hospital were retrospectively analyzed. These patients were divided into a non-severe group (n = 304) and a severe group (n = 139) according to their condition.

Clinical indicators were compared between different groups. The differences in sex, age, the proportion of patients with combined heart disease, leukocyte, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil, lymphocyte, platelet, D-dimer, C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, and albumin on admission between the two groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05).

Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed NLR and CRP were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19, while platelets were independent protective factors for severe COVID-19. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated the area under the curve for NLR, platelet, CRP, and their combination was 0.737, 0.634, 0.734, and 0.774, respectively.

NLR, CRP, and platelets can effectively assess the severity of COVID-19, among which NLR is the best predictor of severe COVID-19. Furthermore, the combination of the three clinical indicators can further predict severe COVID-19.

### Host response changes and their association with mortality in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia [^1123WG2r]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Lymphopenia in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with increased mortality. This study explores the association between lymphopenia, host response aberrations, and mortality in patients with lymphopenic COVID-19.

Methods involved determining 43 plasma biomarkers that reflect four pathophysiological domains: endothelial cell and coagulation activation, inflammation and organ damage, cytokine release, and chemokine release. It was explored whether decreased concentrations of lymphocyte-derived proteins in patients with lymphopenia were associated with an increase in mortality. The study sought to identify host response phenotypes in patients with lymphopenia by cluster analysis of plasma biomarkers.

Measurements and main results included stratifying 439 general ward patients with COVID-19 by baseline lymphocyte counts: normal (> 1.0×10^9/L; n = 167), mild lymphopenia (> 0.5 to ≤ 1.0×10^9/L; n = 194), and severe lymphopenia (≤ 0.5×10^9/L; n = 78). Lymphopenia was linked to alterations in each host response domain and increased mortality. Among 272 patients with lymphopenia, decreased concentrations of several lymphocyte-derived proteins (e.g. CCL5, IL-4, IL-13, IL-17A) were associated with increased mortality (at P < 0.01 or stronger significance levels).

A cluster analysis revealed three host response phenotypes in patients with lymphopenia: "hyporesponsive" (23.2%), "hypercytokinemic" (36.4%), and "inflammatory-injurious" (40.4%), with substantially differing mortality rates of 9.5%, 5.1%, and 26.4%, respectively.

### Monocyte-driven atypical cytokine storm and aberrant neutrophil activation as key mediators of COVID-19 disease severity [^112Wgq7L]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

Since the first reports of a novel coronavirus outbreak in Hubei, China, at the end of 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly spread across the globe, with more than 100 million people having been infected worldwide, resulting in over 2 million fatal cases. A broad spectrum of disease symptom manifestations and varied severity has complicated patient care and put enormous pressure on healthcare systems worldwide. Our understanding of the pathophysiology underlying distinct COVID-19 clinical phenotypes shows a clear link between the host immune response and disease severity. Early reports of fever, increased acute phase reactants, and coagulopathy in severe COVID-19 cases, combined with hypercytokinemia, have pointed towards a so-called cytokine storm reminiscent of macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). Importantly, this paradigm has formed the basis for many interventional trials. However, it remains unclear how the dysregulated cytokine release observed in COVID-19 compares to other known cytokine storm syndromes.

It has become increasingly clear that the host response to COVID-19 differs substantially from the antiviral response to other respiratory viruses, including influenza. Decreased lymphocyte counts, reduced T-cell functionalities, and an increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio are now well-established hallmarks of COVID-19. Despite a large-scale effort by the global research community over the past year, the exact mechanisms behind these innate and adaptive immune system alterations and their interplay remain to be fully elucidated.

### Eosinopenia and elevated C-reactive protein facilitate triage of COVID-19 patients in fever clinic: A retrospective case-control study [^112mL3xB]. EClinicalMedicine (2020). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) interim guidance for COVID-19 defines suspected cases that should meet two criteria:

- **Clinical features**: Respiratory infection symptoms that cannot be fully explained by other etiology
- **Epidemiological features**: Affected geographic regions travel history or close contact with a confirmed or probable case

In the WHO interim guidance, laboratory evidence was not required to define a suspected case. In addition to WHO guidelines, different countries can have their own guidelines. In China, the Guidelines of the National Health Commission of China for COVID-19 (6th edition) were followed during this study. According to it, suspected COVID-19 cases would have the following features:

- **Recent travel history to Wuhan City or Hubei Province, or close contact with a confirmed or probable case**
- **Fever and/or respiratory symptoms**
- **Laboratory findings of normal or decreased number of leukocytes and/or lymphopenia**
- **Radiographic evidence showing pneumonia**

Suspected cases were defined if they met the following criteria: criterion (1) plus any two of the items (2), (3), or (4), or all three of these conditions at the same time. For simplicity, the two parameters (normal or decreased number of leukocytes and/or lymphopenia) described in "Guideline" were referred to as one term for the following analyses.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for COVID-19 infection, particularly in diagnosing septic shock, the WHO 2023 guidelines recommend diagnosing septic shock in adult patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, who meet the following criteria in the absence of hypovolemia:

- **Vasopressors**: Vasopressors are needed to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg.
- **Lactate**: Lactate levels are ≥ 2 mmol/L.

### Temporal changes of haematological and radiological findings of the COVID-19 infection-a review of literature [^115p6ULJ]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

It should also be recognized that a significant proportion of infected patients are asymptomatic in the early days after documented exposure, with an estimated proportion of about 18%. In fact, higher proportions of asymptomatic cases were reported in some studies, with 87.8% of the patients who tested positive being asymptomatic. The concern lies in the fact that, though asymptomatic, these carriers are still very capable of transmitting COVID-19 via person-to-person contact, thereby propagating the pandemic. Therefore, being able to identify such patients at an early stage via haematological or radiological investigations would be beneficial, especially in regions with limited availability of and accessibility to COVID-19 test kits.

### Temporal changes of haematological and radiological findings of the COVID-19 infection-a review of literature [^112fuswT]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The incubation period for COVID-19 was estimated to be 5.1 days, and 97.5% became symptomatic within 11.5 days. The main clinical symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, and myalgia/arthralgia. Other minor symptoms include headache or dizziness, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Major complications in patients with COVID-19 include acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and some also progress to multi-organ failure. The severity of COVID-19 runs on a spectrum from mild, severe, to critical.

Given the wide spectrum of severity that can be found in a patient with COVID-19, it is important to identify potential clinical characteristics that would help predict the clinical outcome early. This, in turn, could guide management in terms of resource allocation. Thus far, several potential predictors of outcome have been suggested to help monitor patients who may develop severe complications. Lymphopenia has been shown to be a prominent laboratory finding in severe COVID-19 patients and is important in predicting the prognosis. Liu et al. reported that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio is an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality of patients. Other potential hematological predictors of outcome that have been proposed include C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, cardiac troponin-I, and low-density lipoproteins. In a recently published study, Liang et al. proposed a new clinical risk score to predict the occurrence of critical illness in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

### Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte to monocyte ratio and platelet to lymphocyte ratio to predict the severity of COVID-19 [^116vXSE6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In this study, we aimed to investigate and compare the prognostic impacts of C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil (NEU)-to-lymphocyte (LYM) ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and red cell distribution width (RDW) biomarkers in laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, as well as to explore the most useful diagnostic biomarkers and optimal cutoff values in COVID-19 patients.

- **Methods**: A total of 233 patients were admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of Pamukkale University Hospital during March-April 2020 and underwent SARS-CoV-2 PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), complete blood count (CBC), and CRP tests in sequence due to complaints of COVID-19. The laboratory results and demographic findings were collected from the public health management system retrospectively. Patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, along with hospitalization data, were also recorded.

- **Results**: The CRP (p = 0.0001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (p = 0.038), PLR (p = 0.0001), and NLR (p = 0.001) remained significantly higher in patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test result. By contrast, eosinophil (p = 0.0001), lymphocyte (p = 0.0001), and platelet levels (p = 0.0001) were significantly higher in negative SARS-CoV-2 patients.

- **Conclusion**: In light of the obtained results, the CRP, LDH, PLR, and NLR levels remained significantly higher in COVID-19 positive patients, while eosinophil, lymphocyte, and platelet levels were significantly elevated in COVID-19 negative patients.

### Longitudinal hematologic and immunologic variations associated with the progression of COVID-19 patients in China [^114KGrfg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Low credibility.

The crucial roles of hematologic and immunologic responses in the progression of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remain largely unclear.

- **Objective**: We sought to address the dynamic changes in hematologic and immunologic biomarkers and their associations with the severity and outcomes of COVID-19.

- **Methods**: A retrospective study including 548 patients with COVID-19, with clarified outcomes (discharged or deceased), from a national cohort in China was performed. Cross-sectional and longitudinal variations were compared and the associations with different severity and outcomes were analyzed.

- **Results**: On admission, the counts of lymphocytes, T-cell subsets, eosinophils, and platelets decreased markedly, especially in severe/critical and fatal patients. An increased neutrophil count and neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio were predominant in severe/critical cases or nonsurvivors. During hospitalization, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and platelets showed an increasing trend in survivors but maintained lower levels or dropped significantly afterward in nonsurvivors. Nonsurvivors kept a high level or showed an upward trend in neutrophils, IL-6, procalcitonin, D-dimer, amyloid A protein, and C-reactive protein, which were stable or showed a downward trend in survivors. A positive correlation between CD8+ T-cell and lymphocyte count was found in survivors but not in nonsurvivors. A multivariate Cox regression model suggested that restored levels of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and platelets could serve as predictors for recovery, whereas progressive increases in neutrophils and basophils indicated worsening prognosis.

### Hematological abnormalities in COVID-19: A narrative review [^112KVoKz]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is currently a pandemic, and as of December 2, 2020, there have been more than 64 million cases worldwide and fewer than 1.5 million deaths. Moreover, this has significantly impacted healthcare systems, socioeconomic aspects, and the livelihoods of many.

Common symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, dry cough, and tiredness. A subset of patients develops a more severe form of the disease, characterized by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and hematological, neurological, cardiac, and renal complications.

Many hematological findings have been reported in COVID-19 patients, and this review summarizes the reported hematological abnormalities, including changes in platelet, white blood cell, and hemoglobin levels, as well as coagulation and fibrinolytic alterations. It explores their pathomechanisms and discusses their management. The effect of COVID-19 on patients with hematological abnormalities and recognized hematological drug toxicities of therapies for COVID-19 are also outlined.

### Surviving sepsis campaign guidelines on the management of adults with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the ICU: First update [^111WKCPL]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic continues to affect millions worldwide. Given the rapidly growing evidence base, we implemented a living guideline model to provide guidance on the management of patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU.

- **Methods**: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Disease 2019 panel has expanded to include 43 experts from 14 countries; all panel members completed an electronic conflict-of-interest disclosure form. In this update, the panel addressed nine questions relevant to managing severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 in the ICU. We used the World Health Organization's definition of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019. The systematic reviews team searched the literature for relevant evidence, aiming to identify systematic reviews and clinical trials. When appropriate, we performed a random-effects meta-analysis to summarize treatment effects. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, then used the evidence-to-decision framework to generate recommendations based on the balance between benefit and harm, resource and cost implications, equity, and feasibility.

- **Results**: The Surviving Sepsis Campaign Coronavirus Disease 2019 panel issued nine statements (three new and six updated) related to ICU patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019. For severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019, the panel strongly recommends using systemic corticosteroids and venous thromboprophylaxis but strongly recom…

### Analysis of absolute lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19 [^116QEMG2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Symptoms of COVID-19 vary in severity and presentation. When admitting patients to the hospital, it is desirable to isolate patients with COVID-19 from those without the disease. Reliably identifying patients with COVID-19 in the emergency department before hospital admission is often limited by the speed and availability of testing. Previous studies have determined that a low lymphocyte count is commonly found in patients with COVID-19. We sought to explore the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients presenting to the emergency department requiring subsequent hospitalization who were found to have COVID-19.

- **Methods**: A retrospective chart review was performed on 312 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency department. The absolute lymphocyte count for these patients was used to calculate sensitivities at various cut-off values. The relationships between absolute lymphocyte count and variables, including age, sex, need for intubation, and mortality, were also explored.

- **Results**: Cut-off values for absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 1.1 K/uL to 2.0 K/uL, with sensitivities of 72% and 94%, respectively. Additionally, lower mean absolute lymphocyte counts were identified in males, patients who required intubation, and patients who died.

- **Conclusion**: Knowing the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19 may help identify patients who are unlikely to have the disease. Additionally, absolute lymphocyte count can be used as a marker of disease severity in patients with COVID-19.

### Hematological abnormalities in COVID-19: A narrative review [^114omM7H]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Low credibility.

Common hematological abnormalities in COVID-19 are lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated D-dimer and CRP levels. These alterations are significantly more common and prominent in patients with severe COVID-19 disease, thus potentially serving as biomarkers for those needing hospitalization and ICU care. As performing complex tests to identify coagulation abnormalities is not practical in a pandemic setting, the use of serial D-dimer levels may be considered for practical clinical decisions. Close attention needs to be paid to coagulation abnormalities, and steps should be taken to prevent these from occurring or to mitigate their harmful effects.

### Dysregulation of the immune response affects the outcome of critical COVID-19 patients [^113agowb]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

Critical cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are associated with a high risk of mortality. It remains unclear why patients with the same critical condition have different outcomes. We aimed to explore relevant factors that may affect the prognosis of critical COVID-19 patients. Six critical COVID-19 inpatients were included in our study. The six patients were divided into two groups based on whether they had a good or poor prognosis.

We collected peripheral blood samples at admission and the time point of exacerbation to compare differences in the phenotypes and functions of major populations of immune cells between the groups. On admission, compared to patients with poor prognoses, those with good prognoses had significantly higher counts of monocytes (p < 0.05) and macrophages (p < 0.05), a higher frequency of CD3 + CD4 + CD45RO + CXCR3 + subsets (p < 0.05), a higher frequency of CD14 + CD11C + HLA-DR + subset of dendritic cells (p < 0.05), and a lower count of neutrophils (p < 0.05).

At the time point of exacerbation, the proportions of naïve CD4 + T cells (p < 0.05), Tregs, and Th2 cells in the poor prognosis group were relatively higher than those in the good prognosis group, and CD4 + memory T cells were relatively lower (p < 0.05). According to our results, the poor prognosis group showed a worse immune response than the good prognosis group at the time of admission and at exacerbation. Dysregulation of the immune response affects the outcome of critical COVID-19 patients.

### Effects of tuberculosis and/or HIV-1 infection on COVID-19 presentation and immune response in Africa [^116jQ9jy]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

We have provided one of the first accounts of the clinical presentation and laboratory features of COVID-19 in an African setting where there is high non-communicable, but also communicable (HIV-1 and tuberculosis), co-morbidity. An important conclusion is that the triple occurrence of SARS-CoV-2, HIV-1, and tuberculosis is not uncommon. Clinical features may be dominated by either SARS-CoV-2 or tuberculosis, and while overall radiographic severity may be modulated, lymphopenia is exacerbated, and some markers of inflammation are even more elevated in such patients. Forty percent of patients with coincident COVID-19 and tuberculosis died.

Our study benefitted from the inclusion of participants admitted to the same hospital at the same time as the surge in COVID-19 admissions, who were subsequently assigned alternative diagnoses with negative virological and serological tests for SARS-CoV-2. A limitation is that this is not a formal control group (or reported as such), and we cannot exclude, under the circumstances, that such tests were false negative. Additionally, their ordinal score, which is dominated by consideration of the need for, and type of, respiratory support, was lower. It could be argued that differences in biomarkers may relate to severity and may not be specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the existence of this group allowed us to compare blood markers that have been used to characterize and prognosticate SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that neither raised total white count, neutrophilia, nor lymphopenia can be inferred as specific for COVID-19.

### Serum VEGF-A levels on admission in COVID-19 patients correlate with SP-D and neutrophils, reflecting disease severity: A prospective study [^116kM7HF]. Cytokine (2024). Low credibility.

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in significant global morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to investigate the clinical significance of serum vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) in COVID-19 patients and its association with disease severity and pulmonary injury.

- **Methods**: We prospectively collected data from 71 hospitalized COVID-19 patients between June 2020 and January 2021. Patients were classified as either mild or severe based on their oxygen requirements during hospitalization. Serum VEGF-A levels were measured using an ELISA kit.

- **Results**: In comparison to mild cases, significantly elevated serum VEGF-A levels were observed in severe COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, VEGF-A levels exhibited a positive correlation with white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and lymphocyte count. Notably, serum surfactant protein-D (SP-D), an indicator of alveolar epithelial cell damage, was significantly higher in patients with elevated VEGF-A levels.

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest that elevated serum VEGF-A levels could serve as a prognostic biomarker for COVID-19, as it is indicative of alveolar epithelial cell injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Additionally, we observed a correlation between VEGF-A and neutrophil activation, which plays a role in the immune response during endothelial cell injury, indicating a potential involvement of angiogenesis in disease progression. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms.

### Characteristics of inflammatory factors and lymphocyte subsets in patients with severe COVID-19 [^117KHhxf]. Journal of Medical Virology (2020). Low credibility.

It had been reported that COVID-19 mostly affected men because immune genes are more expressed on the X chromosome. Female patients had lower levels of inflammatory factors, while CD4+ T cells were higher, indicating a better immune response than in male patients with COVID-19. However, in our patients, except for TNF-α, most levels of inflammatory factors and lymphocyte subsets were not significantly different between male and female patients. The differences in the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between men and women need further study.

Although studies have provided evidence that cytokine storms and immunopathology can occur during pathogenic human coronavirus infections, we do not yet have a sufficient understanding of the specific factors responsible for exuberant inflammatory responses. Nonetheless, therapeutic interventions targeting these proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines could prove beneficial in ameliorating undesirable inflammatory responses. Corticosteroids are generally used to suppress inflammatory conditions. High-dose corticosteroids were the mainstay of immunomodulatory therapy during the SARS and MERS epidemics. Corticosteroid administration often leads to early improvements in terms of reduced fever, resolution of radiographic lung infiltrates, and better oxygenation. However, some studies have shown no beneficial effect of corticosteroids, while others have demonstrated adverse outcomes following corticosteroid therapy. Some experts believe there is no clinical data to indicate that a net benefit is derived from corticosteroids in treatment.

### Early predictors of mortality for moderate to severely ill patients with Covid-19 [^1149Yio9]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Determining the factors affecting the mortality and clinical conditions of patients with Covid-19 is essential for developing patient treatment algorithms. This study aimed to identify parameters that can predict the mortality of moderate to severely ill patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19.

- **Methods**: Moderate to severely ill Covid-19 patients older than 18 years were included. Mild Covid-19 patients and those with negative polymerase chain reaction test results were excluded. The primary outcome of the study was the 30-day mortality rate, with the intention to determine factors affecting mortality in moderate to severely ill Covid-19 patients.

- **Results**: A total of 168 patient results were analyzed. The median age of the patients was 59.5 years (ranging from 48.3 to 76), and 90 patients (53.6%) were male. According to multivariate regression analysis results, the presence of any comorbid disease (p = 0.027, HR = 26.11, 95% CI: 1.45 to 471.31), elevated C-reactive protein levels (CRP) (p < 0.001, HR = 1.24, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.38), and the presence of dyspnea (p = 0.026, HR = 4.26, 95% CI: 1.19 to 15.28) were found to significantly increase mortality, while high pulse O2 saturation level (p < 0.001, HR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.99) was found to decrease mortality. When a receiver operating characteristic curve was created for laboratory tests, it was determined that white blood cell counts, neutrophil counts, CRP levels, and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio predicted mortality, while lymphocyte levels did not.

- **Conclusion**: Dyspnea, the presence of any comorbid disease, elevated CRP levels, and low pulse O2 saturation are significant predictors of mortality for moderate to severely ill Covid-19 patients.

### Complete blood count in children with COVID-19: A predictor of disease severity [^112n3gT4]. Clinical Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Blood count abnormalities are frequent in patients with severe COVID-19 disease, and there remains a lack of information regarding pediatric complete blood count (CBC) results. This study aims to correlate the CBC findings in the emergency room for children aged 0 to 10 years with COVID-19 to the clinical severity of the disease.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted with children who collected CBC, C-reactive protein (CRP), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), neutrophil to monocyte ratio (NMR), lymphocyte to neutrophil ratio (LNR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), monocyte to neutrophil ratio (MNR), and monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) at the emergency room. Demographic data from 93 children, with a median age of 19 months (range: 0.3–126 months), and 60.2% males, were included.

- **Blood count abnormalities**: The main findings in the CBC were atypical lymphocytes (51.6%) and eosinopenia (49.5%).

- **Hospitalization and severity**: Of the 69 hospitalized children, 21 were considered severe. The presence of an underlying disease was significantly higher (odds ratio [OR] = 5.08) in patients requiring hospitalization. A higher NLR value increased the likelihood by 54% (OR = 1.54). Eosinopenia was three times more frequent in inpatients with disease severity criteria (OR = 3.05).

In conclusion, children younger than 10 years with COVID-19 show changes in the CBC collected in the emergency room, particularly atypical lymphocytes and eosinopenia. The presence of a comorbidity or elevated NLR increases the likelihood of hospitalization.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^114JDbo8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

The incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), spread rapidly globally; as of March 29, 2020, approximately 670,000 cases had been confirmed worldwide. COVID-19 is typically a pulmonary infection that can range from mild illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. However, other symptoms such as myalgias and anorexia have been noted. Although many ongoing studies are investigating the measurement of proinflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers to prognosticate infection severity, we investigated the use of two easily obtained predictors: lymphopenia and leukocytosis.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical Covid-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^114KVi5L]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

An analysis of seven studies (covering 393 cases and 1443 non-cases) assessed both lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) increase and lymphocyte count decrease. The median specificity was found to be 66% (IQR 49% to 69%), with LDH being used as the reference test. The relative diagnostic odds ratio (RDOR) was 2.22 (P < 0.0001, 95% CI 1.5154 to 3.2625), indicating that lymphocyte count decrease had a higher test accuracy compared to LDH increase.

- **CRP increase and NLR increase**:
	- **D-dimer increase and NLR increase**:
	- **LDH increase and NLR increase**:
	- **Lymphocyte count decrease and NLR increase**:

These were not compared in a direct manner, due to fewer than four studies being available for analysis.

For the combined outcome, there were insufficient studies to allow for detailed comparisons.

Due to scarcity at the time of writing, we did not investigate whether prognostic accuracy varied according to specific measurements or tests, reference standards, baseline severity, timing of outcome verification, sample types, study designs, and settings, including the prevalence of the target condition. Moreover, we were unable to assess the difference in test accuracy using likelihood ratio tests for model comparisons with and without covariate terms, as fewer than 10 primary studies were available for direct comparisons. Furthermore, insufficient data existed to explore the sources of heterogeneity, such as measurement technique or test type, reference standard, timing of outcome verification, sample type, study design, and setting, as well as the prevalence of the target condition. Lastly, there was inadequate data to perform sensitivity analyses considering the impact of unpublished studies.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^112e4Zo7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

White blood cell count increase was assessed for the target conditions of mortality and deterioration.

For mortality (10 studies), the cut-off values to define white blood cell count increase varied between 9.31 and 11 x 10^9 cells/L. Sensitivity in the included studies ranged from 16% to 74%, and specificity ranged from 50% to 94%. The median specificity was 82%, with an interquartile range from 61% to 89%. The summary estimate of sensitivity corresponding with a specificity of 61% was 38% (95% CI 35% to 40%); with the median specificity of 82%, it was 37% (95% CI 34% to 40%); and with a specificity of 89%, it was 36% (95% CI 33% to 39%).

For deterioration (13 studies), the cut-off values varied between 5.27 and 11 x 10^9 cells/L. At fixed specificities of 75% (Q1), 89% (median), and 94% (Q3), meta-analysis found sensitivities of 40% (95% CI 35% to 44%), 32% (95% CI 28% to 36%), and 27% (95% CI 22% to 32%), respectively.

### Early-stage predictors of the acute phase duration in uncomplicated COVID-19 pneumonia [^116CTVxC]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) owing to the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, a huge proportion of the general population is expected to require complex medical care, as approximately 14% of patients develop severe disease requiring hospitalization. Therefore, to appropriately allocate medical resources, simple clinical or laboratory predictors identifying disease gravity at the first contact of patients with hospital facilities are required.

Apart from common disease signs and symptoms, organized in multiparametric score systems, optimal laboratory variables should be considered indices for systemic inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, and platelet count, known to be related to the hematologic impact of the disease, with PaO2 accounting for lung function. All these parameters were altered in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia. Furthermore, D-dimer and procalcitonin could be allocated to later-stage thrombotic and septic complications, respectively.

Moreover, owing to the short time of disease outbreak, prediction models for COVID-19 are poorly reported and present a high risk of bias, necessitating urgent collaborative efforts to develop more rigorous models. Predicting disease duration, particularly the acute phase, is crucial for superior clinical resource allocation. At the time of writing, a single, nonpeer-reviewed chest computed tomography-based model has been reported as a predictor of short- and long-term hospital stay (more than 10 days) in patients with pneumonia associated with COVID-19.

### A comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 review, part 2: host extracellular to systemic effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^1158jTxi]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024). Low credibility.

The immune system includes the innate and adaptive immune systems. The innate system involves nonspecific responses to injury and includes cell populations such as monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, and eosinophils. The adaptive immune system involves specific responses to pathogen infection and includes cell populations such as T and B cells. The two arms of the immune system communicate, interact, and support each other in responding to injury.

This interaction is aided by humoral, circulating factors such as cytokines and chemokines, which provide information and context to immune cells as to how, where, and what to respond to, as well as the magnitude of the response. In turn, there are various feedback loops that provide guidance and direction to the immune system, both innate and adaptive, with SARS-CoV-2 activating both the innate and adaptive immune systems.
