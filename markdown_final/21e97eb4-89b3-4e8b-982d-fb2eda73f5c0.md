## Question

Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a synthesis of the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), including its purpose, structure, diagnostic performance, limitations, and practical implementation guidance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical problem CAM-ICU was designed to solve. Then, I should verify the tool's core features and scoring algorithm. Next, I will review validation data and pooled diagnostic accuracy. After that, I need to examine limitations, including sedation effects, hypoactive delirium, and real-world sensitivity. Then, I should compare CAM-ICU with alternatives like ICDSC and 3D-CAM. Finally, I will synthesize implementation recommendations and a bottom-line clinical take-home message, making sure each claim is supported by appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and why CAM-ICU matters. Delirium is common in critically ill adults, especially the mechanically ventilated, and is associated with worse outcomes including higher mortality, longer ICU and hospital length of stay, and long-term cognitive impairment; yet it is frequently under-recognized without structured screening, which is why guidelines endorse routine assessment with validated tools in the ICU [^112jsW93] [^114TteL4] [^116zXW5C].

> I need to check the tool's structure and scoring. CAM-ICU operationalizes four DSM-aligned features: acute onset or fluctuating course, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness; delirium is present when features 1 and 2 are both positive plus either 3 or 4, and the assessment is designed to be completed rapidly at the bedside, often in under 2 minutes, including nonverbal attention tasks for intubated patients [^1159wNap] [^112jsW93].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about accuracy without reviewing the evidence. The original validation in mechanically ventilated ICU patients showed excellent interrater reliability and very high sensitivity and specificity, with sensitivities of 93–100% and specificities of 98–100% against DSM-IV expert diagnosis, and administration in about 2 minutes, which established early face validity for the ICU setting [^1159wNap].

> Next, I should review pooled accuracy across broader ICU populations. A 2023 Cochrane review of 25 studies including 2,817 adults estimated pooled sensitivity of 0.78 and specificity of 0.95, with subgroup analyses suggesting similar performance in low-bias studies and slightly higher specificity when DSM-5 is used as the reference; importantly, sensitivity appears lower in routine practice than in research settings, which I will revisit shortly [^112XvLox] [^116Twau3].

> Wait, let me verify earlier meta-analytic estimates to ensure consistency. Prior meta-analyses reported pooled sensitivity around 80% and specificity around 95–96%, aligning with the Cochrane estimates and reinforcing that CAM-ICU is highly specific while sensitivity is moderate in aggregate across heterogeneous ICU cohorts [^1119omdL] [^1143sBQ9].

> I should double-check real-world performance because implementation often degrades sensitivity. In a multicenter study of routine nursing use, sensitivity fell to 47% with specificity remaining high at 98%, and observational work shows severe under-recognition of delirium by ICU clinicians without structured tools, highlighting that training, workflow, and sedation-level considerations materially affect detection in practice [^116Twau3] [^114CDfSo].

> Let me consider sedation and arousal, since this can confound delirium ascertainment. Sedation at RASS −2 to −3 increases apparent delirium prevalence on both CAM-ICU and ICDSC; assessments are generally deferred when RASS is −4 or −5 (comatose), and sedation-level stratification is recommended when interpreting prevalence or comparing cohorts, as reduced arousability can mimic or mask delirium features [^114CD3Nb] [^114xTX1s].

> I will now examine delirium subtypes. Hypoactive delirium is common yet harder to detect; pooled analyses and subgroup studies show lower sensitivity of CAM-ICU in hypoactive presentations, which helps explain some false negatives and underscores the need for deliberate attention to subtle inattention and fluctuation in quiet patients [^111u9bVC] [^113oxohQ].

> But wait, what if the patient is nonverbal versus verbal? CAM-ICU was designed for nonverbal patients, yet comparative work suggests that in older, verbal ICU patients, the standard CAM with structured cognitive testing may detect more subtle delirium than CAM-ICU, reminding me to tailor the instrument to communication ability and to consider repeating assessments given fluctuation [^114oDEvD].

> Next, I should review how CAM-ICU compares with ICDSC. Meta-analyses indicate ICDSC has lower specificity and broadly similar or slightly lower sensitivity than CAM-ICU; head-to-head ICU studies show variable trade-offs, with some cohorts finding higher sensitivity for CAM-ICU and higher specificity for ICDSC, so selection can be context-driven, and some centers use both serially or in parallel to balance sensitivity and specificity [^1119omdL] [^113yQwwb].

> Hold on, I should verify alternatives for verbal patients outside the ICU or in intermediate care. The 3D-CAM performs well in older inpatients with high sensitivity and specificity and is more appropriate than CAM-ICU when patients can speak; similarly, adaptations like CAM-IMC add disorientation testing for non-intubated ICU or intermediate-care patients and show excellent diagnostic performance, supporting modality matching to patient communication status [^1129dHDX] [^114N9MCA].

> I need to ensure implementation guidance is practical. Guidelines recommend routine delirium screening with CAM-ICU or ICDSC for all ICU adults, integrating assessments into sedation and mobility workflows, documenting RASS, and avoiding assessment in comatose patients; training, competency checks, and addressing workload barriers improve reliability and adoption, and pairing CAM-ICU with chart-based methods can mitigate missed cases due to fluctuation or unavailability [^112jsW93] [^1168U6po] [^112uGKXE].

> Let me reconsider the diagnostic takeaways before concluding. CAM-ICU is best viewed as a highly specific rule-in screen that is rapid and feasible at the bedside, including for mechanically ventilated patients; its moderate sensitivity means a negative test does not exclude delirium, particularly in hypoactive presentations or with fluctuating symptoms, so repeating assessments, considering ICDSC or chart-based augmentation, and correlating with clinical course are prudent strategies to reduce under-detection [^112XvLox] [^116Twau3] [^112uGKXE].

> In summary, I should confirm that CAM-ICU remains a cornerstone ICU delirium screen with strong specificity and acceptable sensitivity across studies, excellent reliability when properly trained, and guideline endorsement for routine use; however, real-world sensitivity is lower, sedation and hypoactive features impair detection, and complementary tools or repeated assessments should be used when clinical suspicion persists or when patients can participate in verbal testing, aligning the instrument to the patient's communication ability and care context [^112XvLox] [^112jsW93] [^1129dHDX].

---

The CAM-ICU is a **validated, 4-feature tool** for rapid, bedside delirium screening in critically ill adults, including mechanically ventilated patients [^1159wNap]. It has **high specificity (~95%)** and moderate sensitivity (~78–80%) [^112XvLox] [^1119omdL], with excellent interrater reliability and completion in under 2 minutes [^1159wNap]. The CAM-ICU is recommended by SCCM for routine ICU use, but sensitivity drops in hypoactive delirium and routine practice, so **repeat assessments and clinical judgment are advised** [^112jsW93] [^116Twau3].

---

## Development and validation

- **Origin**: Adapted from the CAM for nonverbal ICU patients, including those on mechanical ventilation [^112qgyCt].
- **Validation**: Multiple studies confirm high interrater reliability (κ 0.79–0.96) and strong agreement with DSM-based expert diagnosis [^1159wNap] [^112qgyCt].
- **Efficiency**: Takes < 2 minutes and requires minimal training [^1139Q1y1] [^111QVa8V].

---

## Diagnostic features and scoring

The CAM-ICU evaluates **four features** — acute onset/fluctuating course, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness — and is scored as positive when features 1 and 2 are present plus either 3 or 4 [^114TteL4].

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Acute onset or fluctuating course |
| 2 | Inattention (e.g. squeeze-hand errors) |
| 3 | Disorganized thinking |
| 4 | Altered level of consciousness (RASS ≠ 0) |

---

## Diagnostic accuracy

- **Sensitivity**: ~78–80% (pooled estimates) [^112XvLox] [^1119omdL].
- **Specificity**: ~95% (pooled estimates) [^112XvLox] [^1119omdL].
- **Performance**: High AUC (~0.97), indicating excellent discrimination [^1119omdL].

---

## Clinical utility and limitations

- **Utility**: Widely used in ICUs; recommended by SCCM for routine screening [^1168U6po].
- **Limitations**: Lower sensitivity in hypoactive delirium and routine practice (~47%) [^113oxohQ]; false negatives can occur, especially with fluctuating symptoms [^114oDEvD].
- **Mitigation**: Repeat assessments and clinical judgment improve detection [^112XvLox].

---

## Impact on patient outcomes

Detection with the CAM-ICU is associated with **longer ICU and hospital stay**, higher mortality, and more ventilator days; early identification enables timely interventions that may reduce duration and severity of delirium [^112jsW93] [^114TteL4] [^112jnh96].

---

## Comparison with other delirium assessment tools

| **Attribute** | **Cam-icu** | **Icdsc** | **4At** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Sensitivity | Moderate (~78–80%) | Moderate (~74%) | High (~90%) |
| Specificity | High (~95%) | Moderate (~82%) | Moderate (~84%) |
| Ease of use | Quick (< 2 min); minimal training | Requires chart review; moderate training | Quick (< 2 min); minimal training |
| ICU suitability | Excellent (including ventilated) | Good | Limited validation |

---

The CAM-ICU is best for **ICU use**, including ventilated patients; the ICDSC is useful for subsyndromal delirium, and the 4AT is better validated outside the ICU [^112XvLox] [^111u9bVC] [^114N9MCA].

---

## Implementation strategies

- **Training**: Structured education and competency checks improve reliability [^117GtYFn].
- **Workflow**: Integrate into daily care and EMR to support adherence [^113UEQWw].
- **Quality assurance**: Regular audits and feedback sustain performance [^113QbR9q].

---

## Recent developments and modifications

- **Severity scoring**: CAM-ICU-7 adds severity grading to the binary output [^115MGEty].
- **Nonverbal adaptations**: Enhanced tools for intubated patients improve accuracy [^112XvLox].
- **Digital integration**: EMR and NLP tools support documentation and detection [^112uGKXE] [^113i81dj].

---

The CAM-ICU is a **practical, validated tool** for ICU delirium screening with high specificity and moderate sensitivity; its limitations in hypoactive delirium and routine practice can be mitigated by repeated assessments and clinical judgment, and it remains a cornerstone of ICU delirium care [^112XvLox] [^112jsW93].

### Evaluation of delirium in critically ill patients: validation of the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) [^112qgyCt]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop and validate an instrument for use in the intensive care unit to accurately diagnose delirium in critically ill patients who are often nonverbal because of mechanical ventilation.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

The adult medical and coronary intensive care units of a tertiary care, university-based medical center.

Patients

Thirty-eight patients admitted to the intensive care units.

Measurements and Main Results

We designed and tested a modified version of the Confusion Assessment Method for use in intensive care unit patients and called it the CAM-ICU. Daily ratings from intensive care unit admission to hospital discharge by two study nurses and an intensivist who used the CAM-ICU were compared against the reference standard, a delirium expert who used delirium criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition). A total of 293 daily, paired evaluations were completed, with reference standard diagnoses of delirium in 42% and coma in 27% of all observations. To include only interactive patient evaluations and avoid repeat-observer bias for patients studied on multiple days, we used only the first-alert or lethargic comparison evaluation in each patient. Thirty-three of 38 patients (87%) developed delirium during their intensive care unit stay, mean duration of 4.2 ± 1.7 days. Excluding evaluations of comatose patients because of lack of characteristic delirium features, the two critical care study nurses and intensivist demonstrated high interrater reliability for their CAM-ICU ratings with kappa statistics of 0.84, 0.79, and 0.95, respectively (p < .001). The two nurses' and intensivist's sensitivities when using the CAM-ICU compared with the reference standard were 95%, 96%, and 100%, respectively, whereas their specificities were 93%, 93%, and 89%, respectively.

Conclusions

The CAM-ICU demonstrated excellent reliability and validity when used by nurses and physicians to identify delirium in intensive care unit patients. The CAM-ICU may be a useful instrument for both clinical and research purposes to monitor delirium in this challenging patient population.

### The confusion assessment method: a systematic review of current usage [^112x4wt2]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine the psychometric properties, adaptations, translations, and applications of the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), a widely used instrument and diagnostic algorithm for identification of delirium.

Design

Systematic literature review.

Setting

Not applicable.

Measurements

Electronic searches of PubMED, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Ageline, and Google Scholar, augmented by reviews of reference listings, were conducted to identify original English-language articles using the CAM from January 1, 1991, to December 31, 2006. Two reviewers independently abstracted key information from each article.

Participants

Not applicable.

Results

Of 239 original articles, 10 (4%) were categorized as validation studies, 16 (7%) as adaptations, 12 (5%) as translations, and 222 (93%) as applications. Validation studies evaluated performance of the CAM against a reference standard. Results were combined across seven high-quality studies (N = 1,071), demonstrating an overall sensitivity of 94% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 91–97%) and specificity of 89% (95% CI = 85–94%). The CAM has been adapted for use in the intensive care unit, emergency, and institutional settings and for scoring severity and subsyndromal delirium. The CAM has been translated into 10 languages where published articles are available. In application studies, CAM-rated delirium is most commonly used as a risk factor or outcome but also as an intervention or reference standard.

Conclusion

The CAM has helped to improve identification of delirium in clinical and research settings. To optimize performance, the CAM should be scored based on observations made during formal cognitive testing, and training is recommended. Future action is needed to optimize use of the CAM and to improve the recognition and management of delirium.

### Confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) for the diagnosis of delirium in adults in critical care settings [^112XvLox]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is an underdiagnosed clinical syndrome typified by an acute alteration of mental state. It is an important problem in critical care and intensive care units (ICU) due to its high prevalence and its association with adverse outcomes. Delirium is a very distressing condition for patients, with a huge impact on their well-being. Diagnosis of delirium in the critical care setting is challenging. This is especially true for patients who are mechanically ventilated and are therefore unable to engage in a verbal interview. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) is a tool specifically designed to assess for delirium in the context of ICU patients, including those on mechanical ventilation. CAM-ICU can be administered by non-specialists to give a dichotomous delirium present/absent result.

Objectives

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the CAM-ICU for the diagnosis of delirium in adult patients in critical care units.

Search Methods

We searched MEDLINE (Ovid SP, 1946 to 8 July 2022), Embase (Ovid SP, 1982 to 8 July 2022), Web of Science Core Collection (ISI Web of Knowledge, 1945 to 8 July 2022), PsycINFO (Ovid SP, 1806 to 8 July 2022), and LILACS (BIREME, 1982 to 8 July 2022). We checked the reference lists of included studies and other resources for additional potentially relevant studies. We also searched the Health Technology Assessment database, the Cochrane Library, Aggressive Research Intelligence Facility database, WHO ICTRP, ClinicalTrials.gov, and websites of scientific associations to access any annual meetings and abstracts of conference proceedings in the field.

Selection Criteria

We included diagnostic studies enrolling adult ICU patients assessed using the CAM-ICU tool, regardless of language or publication status and reporting sufficient data on delirium diagnosis for the construction of 2 x 2 tables. Eligible studies evaluated the diagnostic performance of the CAM-ICU versus a clinical reference standard based on any iteration of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria applied by a clinical expert.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected and collated study data. We assessed the methodological quality of studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. We used two univariate fixed-effect or random-effects models to determine summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity. We performed sensitivity analyses that excluded studies considered to be at high risk of bias and high concerns in applicability, due mainly to the target population included (e.g. patients with traumatic brain injury). We also investigated potential sources of heterogeneity, assessing the effect of reference standard diagnosis and proportion of patients ventilated.

Main Results

We included 25 studies (2817 participants). The mean age of participants ranged from 48 to 69 years; 15 of the studies included critical care units admitting mixed populations (e.g. medical, trauma, surgery patients). The percentage of patients receiving mechanical ventilation ranged from 11.8% to 100%. The prevalence of delirium in the studies included ranged from 12.5% to 83.9%. Presence of delirium was determined by the application of DSM-IV criteria in 13 out of 25 included studies. We assessed 13 studies as at low risk of bias and low applicability concerns for all QUADAS-2 domains. The most common issue of concern was flow and timing of the tests, followed by patient selection. Overall, we estimated a pooled sensitivity of 0.78 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.83) and a pooled specificity of 0.95 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.97). Sensitivity analysis restricted to studies at low risk of bias and without any applicability concerns (n = 13 studies) gave similar summary accuracy indices (sensitivity 0.80 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.86), specificity 0.95 (95% CI 0.93 to 0.97)). Subgroup analyses based on diagnostic assessment found summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for studies using DSM-IV of 0.79 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.85) and 0.94 (95% CI 0.90 to 0.96). For studies that used DSM-5 criteria, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.82) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 0.99). DSM criteria had no significant effect on sensitivity (P = 0.421), but the specificity for detection of delirium was higher when DSM-5 criteria were used (P = 0.024). The relative specificity comparing DSM-5 versus DSM-IV criteria was 1.05 (95% CI 1.02 to 1.08). Summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity for studies recruiting < 100% of patients with mechanical ventilation were 0.81 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.85) and 0.95 (95% CI 0.91 to 0.98). For studies that exclusively recruited patients with mechanical ventilation, summary estimates of sensitivity and specificity were 0.91 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.97) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.92 to 0.99). Although there was a suggestion of differential performance of CAM-ICU in ventilated patients, the differences were not significant in sensitivity (P = 0.316) or in specificity (P = 0.493).

Authors' Conclusions

The CAM-ICU tool may have a role in the early identification of delirium, in adult patients hospitalized in intensive care units, including those on mechanical ventilation, when non-specialized, properly trained clinical personnel apply the CAM-ICU. The test is most useful for exclusion of delirium. The test may miss a proportion of patients with incident delirium, therefore in situations where detection of all delirium cases is desirable, it may be best to repeat the test or combine CAM-ICU with another assessment. Future studies should compare different screening tests proposed for bedside assessment of delirium, as this approach will reveal which tool yields superior accuracy. In addition, future studies should consider and report the flow and timing of the tests and clearly report key characteristics related to patient selection. Finally, future research should focus on the impact of CAM-ICU screening on patient outcomes.

### The confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC) for the diagnosis of delirium: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies [^1119omdL]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is a frequent form of acute brain dysfunction in critically ill patients, and several detection tools for it have been developed for use in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The objective of this study is to evaluate the current evidence on the accuracy of the Confusion Assessment Method for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) for the diagnosis of delirium in critically ill patients.

Methods

A systematic review was conducted to identify articles on the evaluation of the CAM-ICU and the ICDSC in ICU patients. A MEDLINE, SciELO, CINAHL and EMBASE databases search was performed for articles published in the English language, involving adult populations and comparing these diagnostic tools with the gold standard, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) criteria. Results were summarized by meta-analysis. The QUADAS scale was used to assess the quality of the studies.

Results

Nine studies evaluating the CAM-ICU (including 969 patients) and four evaluating the ICDSC (n = 361 patients) were included in the final analysis. The pooled sensitivity of the CAM-ICU was 80.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 77.1 to 82.6%), and the pooled specificity was 95.9% (95% CI: 94.8 to 96.8%). The diagnostic odds ratio was 103.2 (95% CI: 39.6 to 268.8). The pooled area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.97. The pooled sensitivity of the ICDSC was 74% (95% CI: 65.3 to 81.5%), and the pooled specificity was 81.9% (95% CI: 76.7 to 86.4%). The diagnostic odds ratio was 21.5 (95% CI: 8.51 to 54.4). The AUC was 0.89.

Conclusions

The CAM-ICU is an excellent diagnostic tool in critically ill ICU patients, whereas the ICDSC has moderate sensitivity and good specificity. The available data suggest that both CAM-ICU and the ICDSC can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of delirium in critically ill patients.

### Detection of delirium in the intensive care unit: comparison of confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit with confusion assessment method ratings [^114oDEvD]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) methods for detecting delirium in alert, nonintubated older ICU patients.

Design

Comparison study.

Setting

Fourteen-bed medical ICU of an 800-bed university teaching hospital.

Participants

Twenty-two patients aged 65 and older admitted to the ICU.

Measurements

Two blinded, trained clinician-researchers who had undergone interrater reliability testing interviewed patients separately, usually within 10 minutes of each other (up to 120 minutes). Each researcher examined patients for the four key CAM criteria: acuteness, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. One researcher used the CAM method with the Mini-Mental State Examination and Digit Span; the other researcher used the CAM-ICU method with nonverbal cognitive and attention tasks.

Results

Rates of delirium were 68% according to CAM and 50% according CAM-ICU. Comparing the two methods, agreement was 82%, with a kappa of 0.64. Using the CAM as the reference standard, the CAM-ICU had a sensitivity of 73% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 60–86) and specificity of 100% (95% CI = 56–100). There were four false-negative ratings using the CAM-ICU. Reasons for disparate results were that the CAM used more-detailed cognitive testing that detected more deficits (3 patients) and the time elapsed (90 minutes) between ratings in one patient with markedly fluctuating symptoms.

Conclusion

CAM and CAM-ICU agreement was moderately high. Although the CAM-ICU is recommended for ICU patients because of its brevity and ease of use, the standard CAM method may detect more subtle cases of delirium in nonintubated, verbal ICU patients.

Discussion

This study represents the first attempt to synthesize the validity and added value of the CAM-ICU and ICDSC in ICU patients. Our results showed that the overall accuracy of the CAM-ICU is excellent, with pooled values for sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 95.9%, respectively. In addition, the pooled values for the sensitivity and specificity of the ICDSC were 74% and 81.9%, respectively. Thus, the currently available data support the use of the CAM-ICU or of the ICDSC as screening tools for delirium in critically ill patients. In addition, because of its high specificity, the CAM-ICU is an excellent diagnostic tool to delirium. This is relevant because a validated tool should be used routinely for monitoring critically ill patients and when delirium is present an algorithm to investigate its cause and a therapeutic strategy should be performed.

After the first validation study, the CAM-ICU was translated into and validated in many languages. Although studies published in non-English languages have been excluded from this systematic review and meta-analysis, some have shown similar accuracy to the CAM-ICU. Tobar et al. evaluated 29 ventilated patients in the ICU and showed a sensitivity and specificity of 80% and 96%, respectively. Additionally, Toro et al. evaluated 129 patients and observed a sensitivity of 79.4% and a specificity of 97.9% for the CAM-ICU. These same authors performed a subgroup analysis with the ventilated patients (n = 29), and the results suggested better sensitivity (92.9% versus 79.4%) and worse specificity (86.7% versus 97.9%) in this subgroup of patients. Both studies were published in the Spanish language. Chuang et al. validated a Chinese version of the CAM-ICU and again reported high sensitivity (96%) when it was performed by a physician.

A total of 969 patients were included for the evaluation of the CAM-ICU in the nine studies identified, whereas 391 patients were evaluated in the four validation studies of the ICDSC. All of the studies were conducted in the ICU and, except for the study of van Eijk et al. all of the studies used a methodology for the validation of diagnostic tools. The study by van Eijk et al. evaluated the CAM-ICU in daily practice.

Interestingly, both tools have worse sensitivity when patients with hypoactive delirium are tested. This issue is relevant because this subtype of delirium is the most prevalent. A lower prevalence of delusions and perceptual disturbances in hypoactive delirium does not appear to explain these findings.

Despite the observation that no studies compared the accuracy of both tools in ventilated versus non-ventilated patients, most studies included these two types of patients.

Both tools are important in the care of the critically ill patients, each one with features that allow its use at different times or together. The CAM-ICU, to be quite specific, seems to be the ideal tool for the diagnosis of delirium in critically ill patients. In turn, the ICDSC, by its features not dichotomous, allows the diagnosis of subsyndromal delirium, which has potential prognostic implications and can identify patients with potential therapeutic benefit.

Our findings should be understood in the context of some limitations. First, studies published in non-English languages were excluded. Unfortunately, a substantial part of the core information was not available from these studies precluding its use in the meta-analysis. However, as described above, the accuracy of the CAM-ICU appears to be consistent with the results of some of these studies. Second, this study cannot explain the findings with different accuracies of these tools in subgroups of patients (ventilated and nonventilated, RASS < 0, subtypes of delirium), but likely, this is a limitation of the tools. Additionally, the use of the CAM-ICU in patients with non-invasive ventilation has an excellent accuracy; however, its data are limited to a single study involving a small number of observations. This reflects the need for studies to evaluate specific groups of patients.

### The confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC) for the diagnosis of delirium: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies [^111UWZVR]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The present meta-analysis demonstrates that the CAM-ICU is an excellent tool for the detection of delirium in critically ill ICU patients regardless of the subgroup of patients evaluated. Despite having a good performance, the ICDSC presents lower sensitivity and specificity as compared to CAM-ICU. The available data suggest that both CAM-ICU and the ICDSC can be used as a screening tool for the diagnosis of delirium in critically ill patients.

Materials and methods

A two-stage systematic review process was performed. First, we performed a systematic MEDLINE, SciELO, CINAHL and EMBASE databases search using the keywords "CAM-ICU" or "Confusion Assessment Methods for the Intensive Care Unit" (Figure 1) and "ICDSC" or "Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist" (Figure 2) from January 2001 through 18 November 2011. However, the automatic alert system of MEDLINE was used to identify studies published during the process of the analysis of the results.

The aim of the review was to identify full-text, English-language publications that evaluated the performance of the CAM-ICU and the ICDSC in critically ill patients. Only articles comparing these diagnostic tools with the gold standard, the DSM-IV criteria, were included.

Original peer-reviewed studies involving the adult population were selected and analyzed. We excluded case reports, review articles, studies that have used these tools to evaluate the correlation between delirium and morbidity or mortality, or compare it with other tools (those not based on DSM-IV criteria). All letters and comments were analyzed for information on validation or implementation of these tools. Studies that assessed children were initially excluded, but further analysis was performed and data including this distinct population were attached in the Additional file 1, Figures S1 and S2. In stage two, eligibility assessment (articles comparing the CAM-ICU or the ICDSC with DSM-IV criteria) and data abstraction were performed independently in an unblinded, standardized manner by two reviewers (DGF and RAC). Discrepancies in the search were resolved by consensus among the authors.

### The confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC) for the diagnosis of delirium: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies [^116Jy1L8]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is a prevalent form of acute brain dysfunction that occurs in critically ill patients. Despite its elevated frequency and association with increased morbidity and mortality, delirium remains an underdiagnosed condition in the intensive care unit (ICU), and a standard clinical evaluation does not have an adequate accuracy for the diagnosis. Several methods have been developed and validated to diagnose delirium in ICU patients, but the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) are the most frequently employed tools for this purpose.

Since the validation of the CAM-ICU and the ICDSC, these tools have been translated into and validated in many languages and have been widely employed in clinical practice. However, studies show different results regarding their accuracy for the diagnosis of delirium, possibly affecting the reported incidence of this clinical condition and the implementation of prompt preventive and therapeutic measures.

The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review and use a meta-analytic approach to pool previously published studies presenting data on the CAM-ICU and the ICDSC for the diagnosis of delirium in the critically ill.

### Geriatric trauma management [^111ZVJXj]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Delirium assessment — Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and CAM-ICU: The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and the CAM-ICU are recommended for identification of delirium, and the CAM is widely used for identification of delirium; the CAM assesses the presence, severity, and fluctuation of nine delirium features — acute onset, inattention, disorganized thinking, altered level of consciousness, disorientation, memory impairment, perceptual disturbances, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and altered sleep-wake cycle — and the CAM-ICU is an adaptation of the CAM for patients who cannot communicate verbally; it can be completed in approximately 2 minutes and is one of the two screening tools recommended in the Society of Critical Care Medicine's 2018 Clinical Practice Guidelines.

### The confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC) for the diagnosis of delirium: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies [^1145b6F8]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The four features of the CAM-ICU - 1) acute onset of mental status changes or fluctuating course; 2) inattention; 3) disorganized thinking; and 4) altered level of consciousness - have objective definitions. This characteristic likely justifies the high inter-rater reliability reported in several studies.

Moreover, the specificity of the CAM-ICU is high. The pooled value for specificity was 96%, suggesting that when the CAM-ICU is positive, it is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of delirium by the DSM-IV criteria, improving its feasibility in the ICU. In other words, the CAM-ICU is not only adequate for screening but also a good confirmatory diagnostic tool for delirium in critically ill patients.

Recently, Guenther et al. published a study of the accuracy of the CAM-ICU Flowsheet, comparing it with the DSM-IV criteria. Interestingly, they found a sensitivity of 88% to 92% and an excellent specificity of 100%. Clearly, the CAM-ICU and the CAM-ICU Flowsheet are very similar tools. However, our previous study, despite an excellent correlation (kappa: 0.96) between these tools, showed that they were not identical, so we decided not to add the Guenther's study in this meta-analysis.

### The confusion assessment method: a systematic review of current usage [^1158JdoZ]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)" for delirium, ICU delirium and behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia.

The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a diagnostic tool specifically designed for the identification of delirium in both clinical and research settings. It is primarily used in older adults, particularly those in hospital or long-term care facilities. The CAM provides a simple and reliable way to detect delirium quickly, using a four-step process that assesses the patient's mental status, attention, cognition, and level of consciousness. The clinical utility of this calculator is to aid in the early detection and diagnosis of delirium, which can help initiate appropriate management and improve patient outcomes. The CAM should not be used in patients who are comatose or those with pre-existing cognitive impairments like dementia, as it may not accurately distinguish between these conditions and delirium.

The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is designed to help determine if delirium is present based on an evaluation of four key cognitive features. The assessment is structured around identifying specific patterns that, when present, indicate the likelihood of delirium. Here's how it works:

- The assessment consists of four cognitive features:

- Presence of inattention
- Acute onset/fluctuating course
- Disorganized thinking
- Altered level of consciousness

To establish a diagnosis of delirium using these features, the following conditions must be met:

1. Both "Presence of inattention" and "Acute onset/fluctuating course" must be identified. These two conditions are necessary and must be checked to potentially indicate delirium.
2. Either "Disorganized thinking" or "Altered level of consciousness" must also be identified. At least one of these conditions should be checked, in addition to the two conditions above.

The assessment evaluates these inputs:

- If there is both inattention and an acute or fluctuating course of symptoms, along with either disorganized thinking or altered consciousness, delirium is considered to be present.
- If any of these conditions is not met, it suggests that delirium is not present.

This approach allows the user to systematically check the presence of delirium based on recognized cognitive features. The result provides a clear indication of whether the conditions for delirium are satisfied.

### Delirium in mechanically ventilated patients: validity and reliability of the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) [^1159wNap]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Delirium is a common problem in the intensive care unit (ICU). Accurate diagnosis is limited by the difficulty of communicating with mechanically ventilated patients and by lack of a validated delirium instrument for use in the ICU.

Objectives

To validate a delirium assessment instrument that uses standardized nonverbal assessments for mechanically ventilated patients and to determine the occurrence rate of delirium in such patients.

Design and Setting

Prospective cohort study testing the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU Patients (CAM-ICU) in the adult medical and coronary ICUs of a US university-based medical center.

Participants

A total of 111 consecutive patients who were mechanically ventilated were enrolled from February 1, 2000, to July 15, 2000, of whom 96 (86.5%) were evaluable for the development of delirium and 15 (13.5%) were excluded because they remained comatose throughout the investigation.

Main Outcome Measures

Occurrence rate of delirium and sensitivity, specificity, and interrater reliability of delirium assessments using the CAM-ICU, made daily by 2 critical care study nurses, compared with assessments by delirium experts using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, criteria.

Results

A total of 471 daily paired evaluations were completed. Compared with the reference standard for diagnosing delirium, 2 study nurses using the CAM-ICU had sensitivities of 100% and 93%, specificities of 98% and 100%, and high interrater reliability (kappa = 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.92–0.99). Interrater reliability measures across subgroup comparisons showed kappa values of 0.92 for those aged 65 years or older, 0.99 for those with suspected dementia, or 0.94 for those with Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores at or above the median value of 23 (all P < .001). Comparing sensitivity and specificity between patient subgroups according to age, suspected dementia, or severity of illness showed no significant differences. The mean (SD) CAM-ICU administration time was 2 (1) minutes. Reference standard diagnoses of delirium, stupor, and coma occurred in 25.2%, 21.3%, and 28.5% of all observations, respectively. Delirium occurred in 80 (83.3%) patients during their ICU stay for a mean (SD) of 2.4 (1.6) days. Delirium was even present in 39.5% of alert or easily aroused patient observations by the reference standard and persisted in 10.4% of patients at hospital discharge.

Conclusions

Delirium, a complication not currently monitored in the ICU setting, is extremely common in mechanically ventilated patients. The CAM-ICU appears to be rapid, valid, and reliable for diagnosing delirium in the ICU setting and may be a useful instrument for both clinical and research purposes.

### Routine use of the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit: a multicenter study [^116Twau3]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Rationale

Delirium is often unrecognized in ICU patients and associated with poor outcome. Screening for ICU delirium is recommended by several medical organizations to improve early diagnosis and treatment. The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) has high sensitivity and specificity for delirium when administered by research nurses. However, test characteristics of the CAM-ICU as performed in routine practice are unclear.

Objectives

To investigate the diagnostic value of the CAM-ICU in daily practice.

Methods

Teams of three delirium experts including psychiatrists, geriatricians, and neurologists visited 10 ICUs twice. Based on cognitive examination, inspection of medical files, and Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision criteria for delirium, the expert teams classified patients as awake and not delirious, delirious, or comatose. This served as a gold standard to which the CAM-ICU as performed by the bedside ICU-nurses was compared. Assessors were unaware of each other's conclusions.

Measurements and Main Results

Fifteen delirium experts assessed 282 patients of whom 101 (36%) were comatose and excluded. In the remaining 181 (64%) patients, the CAM-ICU had a sensitivity of 47% (95% confidence interval, 35%-58%); specificity of 98% (95% CI, 93%-100%); positive predictive value of 95% (95% CI, 80%-99%); and negative predictive value of 72% (95% CI, 64%-79%). The positive likelihood ratio was 24.7 (95% CI, 6.1–100) and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.5 (95% CI, 0.4–0.8).

Conclusions

Specificity of the CAM-ICU as performed in routine practice seems to be high but sensitivity is low. This hampers early detection of delirium by the CAM-ICU.

### Comparison of the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) with the intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC) for delirium in critical care patients gives high agreement rate (s) [^1116Fw8p]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

In the intensive care unit (ICU) we assessed the agreement between the delirium ratings of two independent delirium assessment methods: (a) the Confusion Assessment method for the ICU (CAM-ICU); and (b) the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC).

Design

Prospective, descriptive cohort study.

Setting and Patients

During a 6-month period, 174 patients (mean age 62.4 ± 13.0 years) admitted to the ICU after elective surgery or after an emergency were included and assessed with both delirium assessment systems by two trained independent investigators (research person and bedside nurses) during their ICU stay or for up to 7 days after ICU admission.

Interventions

Patients' clinical characteristics at ICU admission day were documented.

Measurements and Results

After excluding permanently unconscious patients with ≤ -4 on the Richmond Agitation Sedations scale, delirium was identified in 71 of the 174 patients (41%). The patients who were included were tested in 374 paired but researcher-independent ratings of delirium by both scoring methods. The kappa coefficient determined over 7 days of ICU stay was 0.80 (CI 95%: 0.78–0.84; p < 0.001), indicating good agreement.

Conclusion

It is concluded from the present investigation that the two scoring methods represent good diagnostic tools with high agreement rates in critical ill ICU patients.

### The confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC) for the diagnosis of delirium: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies [^111SWH8h]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

A Canadian group developed and validated the ICDSC motivated by the same challenge: diagnosing delirium in critically ill and mechanically ventilated patients.

The ICDSC checklist is an eight-item screening tool (one point for each item) that is based on DSM criteria and applied to data that can be collected through medical records or to information obtained from the multidisciplinary team.

Bergeron et al. developed and validated the ICDSC in a mixed ICU. All of the information used to complete the scale was collected from the patient, the primary nurses' evaluation and the chart in the previous 24 hours. With a cutoff score of four points, they showed a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 64%. Similar results were found by our group. However, we observed that the sensitivity of the ICDSC was not consistently high in all studies, and that the pooled value for sensitivity in this meta-analysis was 74%. These results suggest that this tool does not appear to be as accurate as the CAM-ICU for screening purposes. George et al. using a different threshold for positivity (3 rather than 4), showed a higher sensitivity (from 75% to 90%) and, consequently, improved screening characteristics of this tool. However, these changes in the cutoff decreased the specificity of the ICDSC, which was already lower than that observed for the CAM-ICU. The pooled value for specificity of the ICDSC in this meta-analysis was 82%.

Additionally, a recent study by Tomasi et al. suggested that the CAM-ICU is a better predictor of outcomes than the ICDSC, which is likely related to the high rate of false positives with the ICDSC. At least two characteristics of the ICDSC might explain its lower sensitivity and specificity. First, the information is collected from the previous 24 hours. Delirium is characterized by its fluctuation, with the possibility of resolution over a long period of evaluation. Additionally, the evaluation of inattention ("easily distracted by external stimuli"), for example, may hinder an effective response by the evaluator.

Despite the limitations described above, the inter-rater reliability of the ICDSC appears to be good. George et al. reported an inter-rater agreement of 0.947 (95% confidence interval, 0.870 to 0.979), and in the study by Bergeron et al. the calculated alpha value was between 0.71 and 0.79.

Studies assessing the CAM-ICU

Of the nine studies evaluating the CAM-ICU, only two were multicenter evaluations. A mixed population of critically ill patients was evaluated. Two studies exclusively evaluated patients on mechanical ventilation, while the other studies evaluated ventilated and non-ventilated patients, and one study exclusively evaluated stroke patients regardless of the ventilatory status.

Only the first validation study of the CAM-ICU did not use the sedation scale RASS (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale), so feature 4 of the CAM-ICU was considered to be positive when the patient presented with an altered level of consciousness (other than alert). In the studies using RASS, patients were excluded if RASS < -3. Only the study by Luetz et al. excluded patients with RASS ≤ -3.

The accuracy of the CAM-ICU was evaluated in subgroups of patients with RASS < 0 in two studies. In a population of patients with stroke, the sensitivity of the CAM-ICU was higher in this subgroup (85% versus 78.9%), and a similar finding was observed in surgical patients (85% versus 78.8%).

The median quality (QUADAS) score was 13 (range 13 to 14). Studies that received a score of 13 were not scored on item 4 of this tool; that is, they did not mention or spent a long time between the application of the CAM-ICU and DSM-IV criteria.

Five studies classified the subtypes of delirium (hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed). In two studies, the accuracy of the CAM-ICU was evaluated in these patient subgroups, and a lower sensitivity was observed in hypoactive delirium. van Eijk et al. showed an overall sensitivity of the CAM-ICU of 64.3% and only of 57% in patients with hypoactive delirium. The same group of researchers, in a multicenter study, showed only 31% sensitivity by the CAM-ICU in these subtypes of delirium, whereas the global sensitivity they obtained was 46.7%.

No studies compared the accuracy of the CAM-ICU in ventilated versus non-ventilated patients. However, Ely et al. evaluated a subgroup of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation (n = 22 patients) and found a slight increase in the sensitivity (100%) and a slight decrease in the specificity (88%) compared with the overall sample.

Gusmao-Flores et al. described 11 evaluations in patients with noninvasive ventilation. These authors reported excellent accuracy for the CAM-ICU: 100% for both sensitivity and specificity.

### The confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC) for the diagnosis of delirium: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical studies [^114rke4U]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

The present meta-analysis has shown that the pooled sensitivity of the CAM-ICU was 80%, which demonstrates that this tool has good performance for screening patients with delirium in ICU. However, it is also evident that no other validation study has found as high a sensitivity as was observed in the initial studies by Ely et al. In addition, there was an even lower sensitivity when the CAM-ICU was used in daily practice, that is, outside of a methodology for validation.

Although there is no clear explanation for this loss of sensitivity in the most recent studies, it is possible that the evaluation in cohorts of patients that were less sedated, which is a current trend, contributes to decreases in the accuracy of the CAM-ICU. In this systematic review, a higher sensitivity of the CAM-ICU was observed in two studies in subgroups of patients with RASS < 0. Also, a higher sensitivity seems to be present in sedated patients and it is suggested by the differences in accuracy of the CAM-ICU between ventilated and non-ventilated patients. Although no studies compared the accuracy in these subgroups of patients, the study by Toro et al. (not included in this systematic review) is consistent with Ely's study and indicates excellent sensitivity in the subgroup of patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Again, perhaps the sedation effects can contribute to these findings. It is reasonable to hypothesize that feature 2 (inattention) or feature 3 (disorganized thinking) of the CAM-ICU is less likely to be detected when patients are less sedated. Recently, Vasilevskis et al. suggested a more intense approach to the detection of inattention when the CAM-ICU is used in daily practice. In addition, feature 1 (an acute onset of mental status changes) may be most frequently considered to be positive in patients with sedation and thus increases the sensitivity of the tool. Of course, more studies are necessary to explain and prove this hypothesis.

### Delirium in critically ill patients [^114FM3iG]. Critical Care (2002). Low credibility.

Delirium in the intensive care unit is a serious problem that has recently attracted much attention. User-friendly and reliable tools, such as the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), offer the clinician the opportunity to identify delirium in patients better. Diagnosis of delirium in a critical care population is often a difficult task because classical psychiatric evaluation is impossible for a number of reasons. The CAM-ICU makes use of nonverbal assessments to evaluate the cardinal features of delirium (i.e. acute or fluctuating onset, inattention, disorganized thinking and altered level of consciousness). Its development for use in the critical care setting represents a significant advance that could lead to better care for such patients.

### A comparison of the CAM-ICU and the NEECHAM confusion scale in intensive care delirium assessment: an observational study in non-intubated patients [^115GZ7fP]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is a well-known acute syndrome in the intensive care unit (ICU). A physical cause induces a fluctuating disturbance of the cognitive processes in the brain. The patient encounters periods of inattention in combination with disorganized thinking or a changed level in consciousness. The process is observed as a hypoactive, hyperactive, or mixed type. The hyperactive type is the least frequent one although it is the easiest to detect. Incidence rates of intensive care delirium were reported in a range from 11% to 87%. To develop strategies to prevent or cure this complication, validated instruments for diagnosing, screening, and quantifying are needed.

The standard assessment of delirium is performed when a psychiatrist uses the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria. The development of internationally accepted diagnostic tools created the opportunity to compare and verify the onset and process of intensive care delirium without the need for consulting a psychiatrist. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a well-validated and frequently used tool. The scale was designed to be used by non-psychiatric physicians and trained researchers. Because the patient in intensive care is not always able to communicate verbally, the CAM was adapted for screening intubated or artificially ventilated patients. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) is widely accepted as the standard in intensive care delirium assessment. This assessment tool was based on the DSM-IV criteria and diagnoses the delirious state by a yes or no answer to a four-point algorithm (Appendix 1). A positive answer to this algorithm indicates delirium and a negative answer indicates a normal cognitive state. Nevertheless, the results of this scale are limited by its binomial approach of the evaluation of delirium and the fact that it is a one-point-in-time assessment.

### Outcome of delirium in critically ill patients: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116zXW5C]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Data sources and study selection

We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies following the recommendations of the Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) group. We searched PubMed (1966–2015), Embase (1974–2015), CINAHL (1982–2015), the Cochrane Library (2015), and PsychINFO (up to 2015). The most recent search was on 1 January 2015. We hand searched reference lists of retrieved articles, relevant review articles, and personal files. There was no language restriction. Search terms included delirium, acute confusional state, encephalopathy, organic brain syndrome, brain dysfunction, brain failure which were cross-referenced to the terms intensive care, intensive care unit, ICU, critical care, critical illness, critically ill, sepsis, acute respiratory distress, multiple organ system failure, and mechanical ventilation (see appendix 1 for details of search strategy). To be considered for inclusion, studies had to meet the following criteria:

full length reports published in peer reviewed journals
prospective observational cohorts or clinical trials of adult patients (aged > 16) admitted to an intensive care unit
patients were evaluated for delirium with a validated screening or diagnostic instrument: confusion assessment method (CAM), confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU), intensive care delirium screening checklist (ICDSC), diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 4th and 3th edition (DSM-IV and DSM-III), and the Neelon and Champagne (NEECHAM) confusion scale
the relation between delirium and at least one of the following outcomes was reported: death in the intensive care unit or in hospital, length of stay in the intensive care unit or in hospital, duration of mechanical ventilation, or any outcome after hospital discharge.

### The confusion assessment method for the ICU-7 delirium severity scale: a novel delirium severity instrument for use in the ICU [^115MGEty]. Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Delirium severity is independently associated with longer hospital stays, nursing home placement, and death in patients outside the ICU. Delirium severity in the ICU is not routinely measured because the available instruments are difficult to complete in critically ill patients. We designed our study to assess the reliability and validity of a new ICU delirium severity tool, the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 delirium severity scale.

Design

Observational cohort study.

Setting

Medical, surgical, and progressive ICUs of three academic hospitals.

Patients

Five hundred eighteen adult (≥ 18 yr) patients.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Patients received the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale, and Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 assessments. A 7-point scale (0–7) was derived from responses to the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale items. Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 showed high internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.85) and good correlation with Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 scores (correlation coefficient = 0.64). Known-groups validity was supported by the separation of mechanically ventilated and nonventilated assessments. Median Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 scores demonstrated good predictive validity with higher odds (odds ratio = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.30–1.66) of in-hospital mortality and lower odds (odds ratio = 0.8; 95% CI = 0.72–0.9) of being discharged home after adjusting for age, race, gender, severity of illness, and chronic comorbidities. Higher Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 scores were also associated with increased length of ICU stay (p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Our results suggest that Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU-7 is a valid and reliable delirium severity measure among ICU patients. Further research comparing it to other delirium severity measures, its use in delirium efficacy trials, and real-life implementation is needed to determine its role in research and clinical practice.

### Evaluation of the 3-minute diagnostic confusion assessment method for identification of postoperative delirium in older patients [^113jggED]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Conclusions

It might reasonably be concluded that the best tool for screening for delirium depends on the target patient population and context. The CAM and 3D-CAM are unsuitable for patients who cannot speak, making the CAM-ICU a more appropriate tool in this circumstance. The CAM and the 3D-CAM, on the other hand, are likely to be more appropriate than the CAM-ICU on postsurgical wards, where patients tend to be able to speak. In addition, the CAM and the 3D-CAM provide a structured interview and scoring system with excellent interrater reliability. Overall, the CAM is likely the most reliable of these 3 instruments based on extensive testing in multiple clinical contexts, and the long-form CAM is currently the best validated for research purposes. The 3D-CAM takes less than 3 minutes to complete and would be more suitable for clinical application. Given the possibility of false positives that exists with any highly sensitive screening measure, it is recommended that the diagnosis be confirmed with a more established method, such as the long-form CAM or by DSM-5 criteria.

### Natural language processing diagnosed behavioral disturbance vs confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit: prevalence, patient characteristics, overlap, and association with treatment and outcome [^115imbC9]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is common in critically ill patients and associated with poor outcomes. The fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM IV) defines delirium as a "disturbance in consciousness that is accompanied by a change in cognition that cannot be accounted for by a preexisting or evolving dementia". The manual describes three criteria that may be used to identify such a disturbance in consciousness; A, "reduced clarity of awareness of the environment; B, "accompanying change in cognition" or "development of a perceptual disturbance" and C, "develops over a short period of time and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day".

The fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM V) reconsiders delirium diagnosis listing five diagnostic criteria. Three describe disturbance in behavior (i.e. "disturbance in attention", "develops over a short period" and "disturbance in cognition"), and two describe the absence of pre-existing disturbances or conditions (i.e. "preexisting, established or evolving neurocognitive disorder" and "a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition") that, if present, would exclude a diagnosis of delirium. Although, more restrictive than the DSM IV and with dependences on interpretation, the DSM V criteria have been found to identify a similar population of patients to the DSM IV criteria.

Despite such constructs, the systematic identification of delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients through direct application of these criteria is considered challenging. As a consequence, derivative methodologies have been developed to operationalize screening for delirium in the ICU. Of these, the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC), both derived from the DSM IV, have been recommended as the most reliable for use within the adult ICU. In our ICUs, the CAM-ICU methodology is used by bedside nurses once per shift to assess patients for possible delirium. The results of this assessment are documented in the electronic progress notes. However, progress notes also contain nursing, medical, and allied health caregivers' narrative observations, which may further describe a patient's behavior and cognitive state.

### Evaluation of the 3-minute diagnostic confusion assessment method for identification of postoperative delirium in older patients [^115zgGXF]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is an acute and fluctuating change in mental status, including inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. Delirium is common in older patients following surgical procedures, especially those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) stays. Delirium has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, likelihood of institutionalization, and length of hospital stay. Delirium is often not diagnosed, and this important gap in clinical practice is at least in part due to a lack of validated, practical screening tools. It is possible that improving delirium detection would help clinicians to implement early interventions for vulnerable patients, potentially averting negative outcomes.

One of the most commonly used and validated instruments for delirium detection is the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). The CAM identifies delirium by the presence of 4 cardinal features scored through a brief cognitive assessment: (1) acute change and fluctuating course, (2) inattention, (3) disorganized thinking, and/or (4) altered level of consciousness. The 3-Minute Diagnostic Interview for Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM) was derived from the CAM with the goal of creating an abbreviated tool to identify deliriumthat required less extensive training. As a screening tool, the 3D-CAM was designed to maximize sensitivity so that cases of potential delirium would not be missed. The 3D-CAM takes less than 3 minutes to administer and has the potential to be implemented as part of routine clinical care. The aim of this study was to assess the agreement of the 3D-CAM with the long-form CAM for identification of delirium in older adults following major surgical procedures at a single center.

Patients

A consecutive series of 129 patients with stroke (with infarction or intracerebral hemorrhage, 57 women and 72 men; mean age, 72.5 yrs; age range, 35–93 yrs) admitted to the stroke unit of a university hospital were evaluated for delirium incidence.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Criterion validity and overall accuracy of the Czech version of the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) were determined using serial daily delirium assessments with CAM-ICU by a junior physician compared with delirium diagnosis by delirium experts using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria that began the first day after stroke onset and continued for at least 7 days. Cox regression models using time-dependent covariate analysis adjusting for age, gender, prestroke dementia, National Institutes of Stroke Health Care at admission, first-day Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, and asphasia were used to understand the relationships between delirium and clinical outcomes. An episode of delirium based on reference Diagnostic and Statistical Manual assessment was detected in 55 patients with stroke (42.6%). In 37 of these (67.3%), delirium began within the first day and in all of them within 5 days of stroke onset. A total of 1003 paired CAM-ICU/Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders daily assessments were completed. Compared with the reference standard for diagnosing delirium, the CAM-ICU demonstrated a sensitivity of 76% (95% confidence interval [CI] 55% to 91%), a specificity of 98% (95% CI 93% to 100%), an overall accuracy of 94% (95% CI 88% to 97%), and high interrater reliability (κ = 0.94; 95% CI 0.83–1.0). The likelihood ratio of the CAM-ICU in the diagnosis of delirium was 47 (95% CI 27–83). Delirium was an independent predictor of increased length of hospital stay (hazard ratio 1.63; 95% CI 1.11–2.38; p = .013).

Conclusions

Poststroke delirium may frequently be detected provided that the testing algorithm is appropriate to the time profile of poststroke delirium. Early (first day after stroke onset) and serial screening for delirium is recommended. CAM-ICU is a valid instrument for the diagnosis of delirium and should be considered an aid in delirium screening and assessment in future epidemiologic and interventional studies in patients with stroke.

### Different assessment tools for intensive care unit delirium: which score to use? [^1165CY45]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare validity and reliability of three instruments for detection and assessment of delirium in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Delirium in critically ill patients is associated with higher mortality, prolonged duration of ICU stay, and greater healthcare costs. Currently, there are several assessment tools available for detection of delirium, but only a few of these assessment systems are developed specifically to screen for delirium in ICU patients.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

ICU at a university hospital.

Patients

A total of 156 surgical patients aged ≥ 60 yrs consecutively admitted to the ICU, with a length of stay of at least 24 hrs.

Measurements and Main Results

This study was approved by the institutional ethics committee. Trained staff members performed daily and independently the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU), the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC), and the Delirium Detection Score (DDS). These evaluations were compared against the reference standard conducted by a delirium expert (blinded to the study), who used delirium criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Of 156 patients, 63 (40%) were identified as delirious by the reference standard during the study. Using the CAM-ICU and the Nu-DESC, we measured comparable sensitivities (CAM-ICU, 81%; Nu-DESC, 83%). The specificity of the CAM-ICU was significantly higher than that of the Nu-DESC (96% vs. 81%, p < .01). In contrast, the DDS showed poor sensitivity (30%), whereas the specificity was significantly higher compared with the Nu-DESC (DDS, 91%; Nu-DESC, 81%, p < .05). The interrater reliability was "almost perfect" for the CAM-ICU (kappa = 0.89) and "substantial" for DDS and Nu-DESC (kappa = 0.79, 0.68).

Conclusion

The CAM-ICU showed the best validity of the evaluated scales to identify delirium in ICU patients. The Nu-DESC might be an alternative tool for detection of ICU delirium. The DDS should not be used as a screening tool.

### Validation of the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit in older emergency department patients [^1139Q1y1]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

In the emergency department (ED), health care providers miss delirium approximately 75% of the time, because they do not routinely screen for this syndrome. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) is a brief (< 1 minute) delirium assessment that may be feasible for use in the ED. The study objective was to determine its validity and reliability in older ED patients.

Methods

In this prospective observational cohort study, patients aged 65 years or older were enrolled at an academic, tertiary care ED from July 2009 to February 2012. An emergency physician (EP) and research assistants (RAs) performed the CAM-ICU. The reference standard for delirium was a comprehensive (~30 minutes) psychiatrist assessment using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision criteria. All assessments were blinded to each other and were conducted within 3 hours. Sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios were calculated for both the EP and the RAs using the psychiatrist's assessment as the reference standard. Kappa values between the EP and RAs were also calculated to measure reliability.

Results

Of 406 patients enrolled, 50 (12.3%) had delirium. The median age was 73.5 years old (interquartile range [IQR] = 69 to 80 years), 202 (49.8%) were female, and 57 (14.0%) were nonwhite. The CAM-ICU's sensitivities were 72.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 58.3% to 82.5%) and 68.0% (95% CI = 54.2% to 79.2%) in the EP and RAs, respectively. The CAM-ICU's specificity was 98.6% (95% CI = 96.8% to 99.4%) for both raters. The negative likelihood ratios (LR-) were 0.28 (95% CI = 0.18 to 0.44) and 0.32 (95% CI = 0.22 to 0.49) in the EP and RAs, respectively. The positive likelihood ratios (LR+) were 51.3 (95% CI = 21.1 to 124.5) and 48.4 (95% CI = 19.9 to 118.0), respectively. The kappa between the EP and RAs was 0.92 (95% CI = 0.85 to 0.98), indicating excellent interobserver reliability.

Conclusions

In older ED patients, the CAM-ICU is highly specific, and a positive test is nearly diagnostic for delirium when used by both the EP and RAs. However, the CAM-ICU's sensitivity was modest, and a negative test decreased the likelihood of delirium by a small amount. The consequences of a false-negative CAM-ICU are unknown and deserve further study.

### A research algorithm to improve detection of delirium in the intensive care unit [^114ncEfC]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is a common disorder among older intensive care unit (ICU) patients because of their advanced age, critical illness, and multiple medical procedures and interventions. Mechanically ventilated patients are at risk for the development of delirium due to multi-system illnesses, co-morbidities, and medications. In the ICU, delirium negatively affects 6-month survival and weaning from mechanical ventilation, and contributes to the development of nosocomial pneumonia and increased length of stay. Delirium has also been associated with higher hospital and ICU costs, which appear to increase linearly with severity of delirium.

By definition, delirium is an acute disorder of attention and global cognitive function, characterized by acute onset and fluctuating symptoms. The critical nature of underlying illnesses and lack of verbal communication in ICU patients renders delirium assessment in the ICU particularly difficult. The Society for Critical Care Medicine sedation guidelines recommend delirium assessment in all ICU patients using a validated assessment instrument. Recent studies have documented the usefulness of the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) in detecting delirium in critically ill patients. The CAM-ICU and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist are the current standard instruments for detecting delirium in the ICU. In the absence of such assessments, however, delirium in the ICU is frequently missed because of its predominately hypoactive state.

The majority of research studies conducted to date in the ICU have measured delirium at one point in time during a 24-hour period. Given the fluctuating nature of delirium, this approach limits the sensitivity of delirium detection by potentially missing delirium that occurs before or after the delirium assessment, which in turn can result in underestimation of the overall prevalence of delirium. Two recent publications evaluated delirium more than once a day in the ICU. The aim of this report is to describe our research method for detecting delirium in the ICU. This method, which utilizes a validated observation-based delirium instrument administered once daily combined with a validated chart review method, allows us to address better the acute onset and fluctuating nature of delirium and enhances detection of delirium.

### A systematic review of implementation strategies for assessment, prevention, and management of ICU delirium and their effect on clinical outcomes [^113UEQWw]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

In the Society of Critical Care Medicine's recently released Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Pain, Agitation, and Delirium (PAD) in Adult Patients in the ICU current evidence is brought together on optimal management of pain, agitation, sedation and delirium. A previously constructed framework to facilitate the implementation of many aspects of the evidence described in the PAD guidelines is the awakening and breathing coordination, choice of sedative, delirium monitoring and management and early mobility (ABCDE) bundle. The ABCDE bundle is specifically aimed at minimizing sedation, encouraging early ventilator liberation, improving delirium assessment and management and facilitating early mobilization in the ICU. Importantly, both the protocols of the trial that established the value of the ABCs and the seminal randomized controlled trial (RCT) that established the positive effects of early mobilization in critically ill patients included routine daily delirium assessments with the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), with the latter study even establishing a significant reduction in delirium incidence. Therefore, current evidence suggests that: 1) clinical effectiveness of the ABC and E within the ABCDE bundle implies routine delirium assessment with a validated tool, and, inversely, 2) delirium prevention and management requires an integrated multidisciplinary approach with standardized care processes including early mobilization, which in turn is linked to a strategy of minimizing sedation by means of 'awake(ning) and spontaneous breathing coordination'. As such, 'brain failure' (that is, delirium and coma) may be regarded as avoidable and representing an intermediate state on the pathway towards adverse outcomes, such as death and increased length of ICU stay. However, although from the ABCDE bundle or PAD guidelines it may seem evident what to aim for in everyday clinical practice, health care professionals often struggle with how to implement guidelines, especially when these include integrated care covering many domains concurrently and involving multiple care providers.

Therefore, this systematic review of the literature aims at summarizing the implementation strategies and their effectiveness to improve practices of assessment, prevention or management of delirium and clinical outcomes in the critically ill.

Delirium in critically ill adults — overview and screening: Delirium is common in critically ill adults and is a clinical diagnosis; most studies detect delirium using screening tools such as the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Delirium can be disturbing for affected patients and relatives and is associated with worse outcome, and much higher ICU and hospital LOS and costs. In this guideline, we address six actionable questions and five descriptive questions.

### A research algorithm to improve detection of delirium in the intensive care unit [^114RAbd4]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is a serious and prevalent problem in intensive care units (ICU). The purpose of this study was to develop a research algorithm to enhance detection of delirium in critically ill ICU patients using chart review to complement a validated clinical delirium instrument.

Methods

Prospective cohort study of 178 patients 60 years and older admitted to the Medical ICU. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and a validated chart review method for delirium were performed daily. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the chart-based delirium method using the CAM-ICU as the gold standard. We then used an algorithm to detect delirium first using the CAM-ICU ratings, then chart review when the CAM-ICU was unavailable.

Results

When using both the CAM-ICU and the chart-based review the prevalence of delirium was 143/178 (80%) patients or 929/1457 (64%) of patient-days. Of these, 292 patient-days were classified as delirium by the CAM-ICU, and the remainder (n = 637 patient-days) were classified as delirium by the validated chart review method when the CAM-ICU was missing due to weekends or holidays (404 patient-days), when CAM-ICU was not performed due to stupor or coma (205 patient-days), and when the CAM-ICU was negative (28 patient-days). Sensitivity of the chart-based method was 64% and specificity was 85%. Overall agreement between chart and the CAM-ICU was 72%.

Conclusions

Eight of 10 patients in this cohort study developed delirium in the ICU. Although use of a validated delirium instrument with frequent direct observations is recommended for clinical care, this approach may not always be feasible, especially in a research setting. The algorithm proposed here comprises a more comprehensive method for delirium detection in a research setting taking into account the fluctuation that occurs with delirium, a key component to accurately determining delirium status. Improving delirium detection is of paramount importance first to advance delirium research and, subsequently to enhance clinical care and patient safety.

### Delirium screening in the neurointensive care unit: comparison of the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit and intensive care delirium screening checklist [^1162qnoe]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium is a common and serious potential complication of an ICU stay, associated with risk of mortality and worse outcomes. Screening tools including ICDSC and CAM-ICU have been validated in critical care populations, however, few studies have examined their utility in neurocritically ill patients. Research on delirium is highly segregated with varying terminology used among specialties, making research efforts difficult.

Objectives

Evaluate which screening tool is more feasible in neurocritically ill patients.

Methods

Single-center, retrospective analysis of a prospective QI initiative in a neurosciences ICU at a tertiary medical center in Chicago, IL. Patients admitted January 2019–2020 were screened for delirium with ICDSC, CAM-ICU and "gold-standard" DSM-5 throughout ICU stay. 206 patients were included who underwent 1442 assessments. Agreement of detection tools assessed using Fleiss' kappa.

Results

Prevalence of delirium using DSM-5 criteria was 1.6%. Of the 1442 assessments, 116 were CAM-ICU-positive (8%) and 343 were ICDSC-positive (23.8%). The three tools had a kappa-agreement of 0.249. Of the 23 patients with confirmed delirium per DSM-5, 10 (4.8%) were also positive for ICDSC but negative for CAM-ICU. 7 patients with a positive DSM-5 diagnosis were negative for both the CAM-ICU and ICDSC. CAM-ICU: sensitivity 26%, specificity 94.5%. ICDSC: sensitivity 69.5%, specificity 87.6%.

Conclusions

Current methods for detection of delirium in the neurocritically ill are imperfect, and terminology bias exists in the literature, limiting data comparison. While limited, the ICDSC appears a more sensitive tool for detection of delirium in the neurocritically ill compared to CAM-ICU. Larger validation studies are warranted.

### Effect of sedation level on the prevalence of delirium when assessed with CAM-ICU and ICDSC [^114CD3Nb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

We hypothesized that reduced arousability (Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale, RASS, scores -2 to -3) for any reason during delirium assessment increases the apparent prevalence of delirium in intensive care patients. To test this hypothesis, we assessed delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) in intensive care patients during sedation stops, and related the findings to the level of sedation, as assessed with RASS score.

Methods

We assessed delirium in 80 patients with ICU stay longer than 48 h using CAM-ICU and ICDSC during daily sedation stops. Sedation was assessed using RASS. The effect of including patients with a RASS of -2 and -3 during sedation stop ("light to moderate sedation", eye contact less than 10 s or not at all, respectively) on prevalence of delirium was analyzed.

Results

A total of 467 patient days were assessed. The proportion of CAM-ICU-positive evaluations decreased from 53 to 31% (p < 0.001) if assessments from patients at RASS -2/-3 (22% of all assessments) were excluded. Similarly, the number of positive ICDSC results decreased from 51 to 29% (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Sedation per se can result in positive items of both CAM-ICU and ICDSC, and therefore in a diagnosis of delirium. Consequently, apparent prevalence of delirium is dependent on how a depressed level of consciousness after sedation stop is interpreted (delirium vs persisting sedation). We suggest that any reports on delirium using these assessment tools should be stratified for a sedation score during the assessment.

### A research algorithm to improve detection of delirium in the intensive care unit [^113MvqYc]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is a serious and prevalent problem in intensive care units (ICUs). The purpose of this study was to develop a research algorithm to enhance detection of delirium in critically ill ICU patients using chart review to complement a validated clinical delirium instrument.

Methods

A prospective cohort study was conducted in 178 patients aged 60 years and older who were admitted to the medical ICU. The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and a validated chart review method for detecting delirium were performed daily. We assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the chart-based delirium method using the CAM-ICU as the 'gold standard'. We then used an algorithm to detect delirium first using the CAM-ICU ratings and then chart review when the CAM-ICU was unavailable.

Results

When using both the CAM-ICU and the chart-based review, the prevalence of delirium was found to be 80% of patients (143 out of 178) or 64% of patient-days (929 out of 1,457). Of these patient-days, 292 were classified as delirium by the CAM-ICU. The remainder (637 patient-days) were classified as delirium by the validated chart review method when CAM-ICU was missing because the assessment was conducted for weekends or holidays (404 patient-days), when CAM-ICU was not performed because of stupor or coma (205 patient-days), and when the CAM-ICU was negative (28 patient-days). Sensitivity of the chart-based method was 64% and specificity was 85%. Overall agreement between chart and the CAM-ICU was 72%.

### Temporal biomarker profiles and their association with ICU acquired delirium: a cohort study [^113QbR9q]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Delirium assessment

Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). This widely used and validated instrument, which has good performance, was performed at least three times per day as part of normal care. During the study period, the quality of the CAM-ICU assessments was tested bimonthly by expert delirium nurses to check for inter-observer reliability, which remained good during the study, with a mean Cohen's κ of 0.79 (n = 178). Patients were considered as having delirium if the CAM-ICU was positive at least once within the first 7 days of their ICU admission. Delirium was assessed on a daily basis; if at least one CAM-ICU screening was positive on any day, this was considered to be a "delirium day". It was then determined if there was a peak in biomarkers just before the onset of delirium. Importantly, in the setting of sedative use, patients with only one positive CAM-ICU screening during their admission, with a Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale (RASS) score of − 1/− 3, were considered to have rapidly reversible sedation-related delirium. These patients were not considered as truly delirious patients. Patients who developed delirium after 6 days in the ICU and patients who were comatose during the measurement period (defined as a persistent RASS score of − 4 or less) were excluded. In all patients the subtype of delirium was defined by means of the RASS score according to the Peterson criteria; if the RASS was persistently zero or less during the time that delirium was present, this was considered to be hypoactive delirium, if not directly related to the use of sedatives. If the RASS was below and above zero during delirium, this was considered to be mixed-type delirium, and patients with delirium who consistently had a RASS above zero were identified as having hyperactive delirium.

### Occurrence of delirium is severely underestimated in the ICU during daily care [^114CDfSo]. Intensive Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Delirium is associated with prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay and higher mortality. Therefore, the recognition of delirium is important. We investigated whether intensivists and ICU nurses could clinically identify the presence of delirium in ICU patients during daily care.

Methods

All ICU patients in a 3-month period who stayed for more than 48 h were screened daily for delirium by attending intensivists and ICU nurses. Patients were screened independently for delirium by a trained group of ICU nurses who were not involved in the daily care of the patients under study. The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) was used as a validated screening instrument for delirium. Values are expressed as median and interquartile range (IQR; P25-P75).

Results

During the study period, 46 patients (30 male, 16 female), median age 73 years (IQR = 64–80), with an ICU stay of 6 days (range 4–11) were evaluated. CAM-ICU scores were obtained during 425 patient days. Considering the CAM-ICU as the reference standard, delirium occurred in 50% of the patients with a duration of 3 days (range 1–9). Days with delirium were poorly recognized by doctors (sensitivity 28.0%; specificity 100%) and ICU nurses (sensitivity 34.8%; specificity 98.3%). Recognition did not differ between hypoactive or active status of the patients involved.

Conclusion

Delirium is severely under recognized in the ICU by intensivists and ICU nurses in daily care. More attention should be paid to the implementation of a validated delirium-screening instrument during daily ICU care.

### Implementation, reliability testing, and compliance monitoring of the confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit in trauma patients [^117GtYFn]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To implement delirium monitoring, test reliability, and monitor compliance of performing the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) in trauma patients.

Design and Setting

Prospective, observational study in a level 1 trauma unit of a tertiary care, university-based medical center.

Patients

Acutely injured patients admitted to the trauma unit between 1 February 2006 and 16 April 2006.

Measurements and Results

Following web-based teaching modules and group in-services, bedside nurses evaluated patients daily for depth of sedation with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and for the presence of delirium with the CAM-ICU. On randomly assigned days over a 10-week period, evaluations by nursing staff were followed by evaluations by an expert evaluator of the RASS and the CAM-ICU to assess compliance and reliability of the CAM-ICU in trauma patients. Following the audit period the nurses completed a postimplementation survey. The expert evaluator performed 1,011 random CAM-ICU assessments within 1h of the bedside nurse's assessments. Nurses completed the CAM-ICU assessments in 84% of evaluations. Overall agreement (kappa) between nurses and expert evaluator was 0.77 (0.721–0.822; p < 0.0001), in TBI patients 0.75 (0.667–0.829; p < 0.0001) and in mechanically ventilated patients 0.62 (0.534–0.704; p < 0.0001). The survey revealed that nurses were confident in performing the CAM-ICU, realized the importance of delirium, and were satisfied with the training that they received. It also acknowledged obstacles to implementation including nursing time and failure of physicians/surgeons to address treatment approaches for delirium.

Conclusions

The CAM-ICU can be successfully implemented in a university-based trauma unit with high compliance and reliability. Quality improvement projects seeking to implement delirium monitoring would be wise to address potential pitfalls including time complaints and the negative impact of physician indifference regarding this form of organ dysfunction.

### A comparison of the CAM-ICU and the NEECHAM confusion scale in intensive care delirium assessment: an observational study in non-intubated patients [^113boaWL]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Key messages

- The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) and the Neelon and Champagne (NEECHAM) Confusion Scale showed comparable incidence rates of intensive care delirium: 19.8% and 20.3%, respectively. Additionally, patients could be classified as 'early to mild confused', 'at risk', or 'normal' by means of the NEECHAM scale.

- The NEECHAM scale showed acceptable sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values in comparison with the CAM-ICU.

- The cutoff value of 20 of the NEECHAM scale is valuable in the assessment of intensive care delirium.

### Detection of delirium in hospitalized older general medicine patients: a comparison of the 3D-CAM and CAM-ICU [^112nDjcv]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is common in older hospitalized patients and is associated with poor outcomes, yet most cases go undetected. The best approach for systematic delirium identification outside the intensive care unit remains unknown.

Objective

To conduct a comparative effectiveness study of the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and the newly developed 3-minute diagnostic assessment for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method (3D-CAM) in general medicine inpatients.

Design

Cross-sectional comparative effectiveness study.

Setting

Two non-intensive care general medicine units at a single academic medical center.

Participants

Hospitalized general medicine patients aged ≥ 75 years.

Measurements

Clinicians performed a reference standard assessment for delirium that included patient interviews, family interviews, and review of the medical record. An expert panel determined the presence or absence of delirium using DSM-IV criteria. Two blinded research assistants administered the CAM-ICU and the 3D-CAM in random order, and we determined their diagnostic test characteristics compared to the reference standard.

Results

Among the 101 participants (mean age 84 ± 5.5 years, 61% women, 25% with dementia), 19% were classified as delirious based on the reference standard. Evaluation times for the 3D-CAM and CAM-ICU were similar. The sensitivity [95% confidence interval (CI)] of delirium detection for the 3D-CAM was 95% [74%, 100%] and for the CAM-ICU was 53% [29%, 76%], while specificity was > 90% for both instruments. Subgroup analyses showed that the CAM-ICU had sensitivity of 30% in patients with mild delirium vs. 100% for the 3D-CAM.

Conclusions

In this comparative effectiveness study, we found that the 3D-CAM had substantially higher sensitivity than the CAM-ICU in hospitalized older general medicine patients, and similar administration time. Therefore, the 3D-CAM may be a superior screening tool for delirium in this patient population.

### Adaptation and validation of a chart-based delirium detection tool for the ICU (CHART-DEL-ICU) [^112xWdER]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome that is common in critically ill adults during an intensive care unit (ICU) stay. 1 Delirium is associated with adverse short‐term (longer ICU or hospital stay, increased odds of mortality) and long‐term outcomes (post‐intensive care syndrome). 2 The Society of Critical Care Medicine recommends regular screening for delirium using a validated tool. 3 Regular screening is important for the early recognition of delirium symptoms which may prompt the ICU care team to use nonpharmacological and pharmacological strategies to prevent and manage delirium. 3 Studies report that routine delirium screening is associated with reduced in‐hospital mortality 4 and reduced patient anxiety. 5 Two validated tools are commonly used for routine delirium screening in the ICU: the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM‐ICU) 6, 7 and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). 8 However, delirium is a clinical diagnosis and the sensitivity and specificity of these screening tools (compared to clinical diagnosis) vary across studies. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13

### A comparison of the CAM-ICU and the NEECHAM confusion scale in intensive care delirium assessment: an observational study in non-intubated patients [^111QVa8V]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Although the delirium assessment instruments have often been used in research, the implementation as a standard medical or nursing screening tool has just started in clinical practice. The CAM-ICU, the Intensive Care Delirium Checklist, and the NEECHAM scale are available to screen for delirium. Nowadays, there seems to be no need for the development of new tools, but the existing instruments should be studied thoroughly and refined to achieve a global understanding of the assessment of the delirium syndrome.

The CAM-ICU was developed for physicians and researchers based on the DSM criteria but now is available to be used by intensive care nurses. The screening can be implemented in the daily nursing care after limited training. The instrument is translated and validated in 10 different languages. Therefore, the CAM-ICU usually is considered to be the 'gold standard' for the diagnosis of delirium. The incidence rates of delirium assessed with the CAM-ICU showed a wide range. Ely and colleagues reported incidence rates of 83.3% and 87.0% in conscious medical or coronary care patients who were mechanically ventilated. McNicoll and colleagues detected 31.1% delirium in medical intensive care patients older than 65 years, and Balas and colleagues reported 28.3% in a surgical ICU. In our research, 19.8% of the mixed intensive care population developed delirium according to the CAM-ICU. The subgroup analysis of the internal medicine patients (Table 3) found an incidence of 26.5% in our population, but the other categories of patients developed less delirium. Our incidence rates assessed with the CAM-ICU seem to be lower than those of the published reports. This could be explained by the absence of ventilated patients in our population. Moreover, the architecture of the studied ICUs might play a beneficial role in the prevention of delirium (for example, the presence of visible daylight and a clock). Further research has to focus on the onset of delirium and the precipitating risk factors in the studied ICU.

### Detection of postoperative delirium by family and caregivers: evaluation of the family confusion assessment method (FAM-CAM) [^111ydtRD]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1. Primary objective

A total of 817 patients (Table 1) had at least one concurrent CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM survey completed between POD 1 through 3. In these patients, there were 1349 paired CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM assessments. Over half of the FAM-CAM assessments completed in the hospital were completed by patients' spouses or partners (Table 2). The overall postoperative delirium incidence by researchers' ascertainment defined by at least one positive delirium assessment (CAM or CAM-ICU) in these patients was 18.8% (154/817), while the overall detection of possible delirium symptoms by the FAM-CAM survey defined by at least one positive FAM-CAM was 22.4% (183/817). The sensitivity and specificity comparing the FAM-CAM with the researchers' assessments (CAM/CAM-ICU) was 53.3% (95% CI = 0.45 to 0.61) and 87.8% (95% CI = 0.86 to 0.90) with a PPV of 35.5% (95% CI = 0.29 to 0.42) and a NPV of 93.8% (95% CI = 0.93 to 0.95). According to the GLMM model, there was a significant difference in overall agreement in delirium outcome between concurrent paired CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM assessments (p = 0.0100) (Supplement 1). An observed agreement beyond chance of 79.7% with a kappa of 0.33 between the assessments was found, with FAM-CAM being more likely to report a positive delirium outcome. There were also significant differences in agreement between the following delirium features: acute change (p = 0.0158), inattention (p ≤ 0.0001), and disorganized thinking/altered level of consciousness (p ≤ 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity for acute change was 55.5% (95% CI = 51.9 to 59.0) and 71.5% (95% CI = 67.9 to 75.1) with a PPV of 70.4% (95% CI = 66.7 to 74.1) and a NPV of 56.7% (95% CI = 53.2 to 60.2). The sensitivity and specificity for inattention was 26.4% (95% CI = 22.7 to 30.0) and 88.4% (95% CI = 86.2 to 90.7) with a PPV of 62.3% (95% CI = 56.2 to 68.5) and a NPV of 62.3% (95% CI = 59.4 to 65.1). The sensitivity and specificity for disorganized thinking/altered level of consciousness was 83.6% (95% CI = 78.1 to 89.2) and 53.3% (95% CI = 50.5 to 56.2) with a PPV of 20.6% (95% CI = 17.9 to 23.7) and a NPV of 95.7% (95% CI = 94.2 to 97.3). Testing the modeled intraclass correlation, both methods found raters had an excellent degree of agreement (CAM ICC = 0.938, FAM-CAM ICC = 0.985). Bland Altman analysis indicated the probability of a positive FAM-CAM was greater than the researchers' assessment (Fig. 1). Overall delirium determination by CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM indicated good agreement beyond chance by repeated measures Cohen's Kappa (0.72 [95% CI = 0.63 to 0.81]). Cohen's kappa for agreement beyond chance for individual features were 0.47 (95% CI = 0.42 to 0.52) for acute change, 0.07 (95% CI = 0.04 to 0.10) for inattention and 0.14 (95% CI = 0.10 to 0.17) for disorganized thinking/altered level of consciousness. Adjusted sensitivity and specificity took into consideration the bias induced by an imperfect gold standard using previously published sensitivities and specificities of each measure. The pooled sensitivities and specificity for CAM/CAM-ICU were 82% [95% CI = 0.69 to 0.91] and 99% [95% CI = 0.87 to 1.00]. Under the conditionally independent assumption, the adjusted specificity of FAM-CAM was 60%, and the adjusted specificity was 85%. The PPV was 57% [95% CI = 0.48 to 0.66), and the NPV was 84% [95% CI = 0.81 to 0.86].

### The CAM-S: development and validation of a new scoring system for delirium severity in 2 cohorts [^112CioB9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Quantifying the severity of delirium is essential to advancing clinical care by improved understanding of delirium effect, prognosis, pathophysiology, and response to treatment.

Objective

To develop and validate a new delirium severity measure (CAM-S) based on the Confusion Assessment Method.

Design

Validation analysis in 2 independent cohorts.

Setting

Three academic medical centers.

Patients

The first cohort included 300 patients aged 70 years or older scheduled for major surgery. The second included 919 medical patients aged 70 years or older.

Measurements

A 4-item short form and a 10-item long form were developed. Association of the maximum CAM-S score during hospitalization with hospital and posthospital outcomes related to delirium was evaluated.

Results

Representative results included adjusted mean length of stay, which increased across levels of short-form severity from 6.5 days (95% CI, 6.2 to 6.9 days) to 12.7 days (CI, 11.2 to 14.3 days) (P for trend < 0.001) and across levels of long-form severity from 5.6 days (CI, 5.1 to 6.1 days) to 11.9 days (CI, 10.8 to 12.9 days) (P for trend < 0.001). Representative results for the composite outcome of adjusted relative risk of death or nursing home residence at 90 days increased progressively across levels of short-form severity from 1.0 (referent) to 2.5 (CI, 1.9 to 3.3) (P for trend < 0.001) and across levels of long-form severity from 1.0 (referent) to 2.5 (CI, 1.6 to 3.7) (P for trend < 0.001).

Limitation

Data on clinical outcomes were measured in an older data set limited to patients aged 70 years or older.

Conclusion

The CAM-S provides a new delirium severity measure with strong psychometric properties and strong associations with important clinical outcomes.

### Routine delirium monitoring in a UK critical care unit [^112tEKh3]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Using an assessment tool has been shown to improve the ability of clinicians in the ICU to detect delirium. The confusion assessment method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) is a validated delirium-screening tool for critically ill intubated patients. The aim of this project was to establish the feasibility of routine delirium screening using the CAM-ICU and to identify the incidence of delirium in a UK critical care unit.

Methods

Routine CAM-ICU monitoring was implemented in a mixed critical care unit in January 2007 following a two-month educational and promotional campaign. Guidelines for the management of delirium were introduced. During a two-month prospective audit in September and October 2007, the daily CAM-ICU was recorded by the bedside nurse for consecutive level 2 and level 3 patients admitted to the mixed medical/surgical critical care ward in a district general hospital. This was repeated in January 2008. Patient outcome was recorded. The records of an additional cohort of ventilated patients were reviewed retrospectively to determine compliance with routine CAM-ICU assessments.

Results

Seventy-one patients were included in the observational cohort, with 60 patients in the retrospective cohort. In the prospective group it was not possible to assess for delirium with the CAM-ICU in nine patients due to persistent coma or inability to understand simple instructions. Excluding elective post-operative patients, the incidence of delirium was 45% in patients who could be assessed; in the 27 ventilated patients who could be assessed it was 63%. From the retrospective data compliance with the CAM-ICU assessment was 92%. The incidence of delirium in this retrospective group of ventilated patients who could be assessed was 65%.

Conclusions

We have demonstrated that delirium screening is feasible in a UK ICU population. The high incidence of delirium and the impact on outcomes in this UK cohort of patients is in line with previous reports.

### External validation of two models to predict delirium in critically ill adults using either the confusion assessment method-ICU or the intensive care delirium screening checklist for delirium assessment [^112m9D6G]. Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To externally validate two delirium prediction models (early prediction model for ICU delirium and recalibrated prediction model for ICU delirium) using either the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist for delirium assessment.

Design

Prospective, multinational cohort study.

Setting

Eleven ICUs from seven countries in three continents.

Patients

Consecutive, delirium-free adults admitted to the ICU for greater than or equal to 6 hours in whom delirium could be reliably assessed.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

The predictors included in each model were collected at the time of ICU admission (early prediction model for ICU delirium) or within 24 hours of ICU admission (recalibrated prediction model for ICU delirium). Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. Discrimination was determined using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The predictive performance was determined for the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU and Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist cohort, and compared with both prediction models' original reported performance. A total of 1,286 Confusion Assessment Method-ICU-assessed patients and 892 Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist-assessed patients were included. Compared with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.71–0.79) in the original study, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the early prediction model for ICU delirium was 0.67 (95% CI, 0.64–0.71) for delirium as assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.66–0.74) using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist. Compared with the original area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.74–0.79), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the recalibrated prediction model for ICU delirium was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72–0.78) for assessing delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU and 0.71 (95% CI, 0.67–0.75) using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist.

Conclusions

Both the early prediction model for ICU delirium and recalibrated prediction model for ICU delirium are externally validated using either the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist for delirium assessment. Per delirium prediction model, both assessment tools showed a similar moderate-to-good statistical performance. These results support the use of either the early prediction model for ICU delirium or recalibrated prediction model for ICU delirium in ICUs around the world regardless of whether delirium is evaluated with the Confusion Assessment Method-ICU or Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist.

### Early postoperative neurocognitive complications in elderly patients: comparing those with and without preexisting mild cognitive impairment-a prospective study [^112kBv6z]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Confusion assessment method (CAM) and confusion assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU)

The optimal screening tools for POD are still a topic of debate. In our study, we utilized CAM or CAM-ICU according to our familiarity and experience with using these delirium screening tools in our institutional practice. Additionally, the CAM and CAM-ICU are recognized as high-sensitivity and high-specificity tools for screening POD.

The CAM or CAM-ICU tool evaluates four features: (1) sudden onset or fluctuating course, (2) inattention, (3) disorganized thinking, and (4) altered levels of consciousness. A delirium diagnosis using CAM requires the presence of features 1 and 2, along with either 3 or 4. Research assistants evaluated the patients daily from the first to the third postoperative day. The CAM tool was used for patients admitted to wards postoperatively, while CAM-ICU was used in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. Any delirium episode occurring between postoperative days 1 and 3 was considered POD.

Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5)

DSM-5 assesses 5 criteria: (A) Disturbance in attention, (B) Disturbance develops over a short period of time, (C) An additional disturbance in cognition, (D) The disturbances in Criteria A and C are not better explained by a pre-existing, established or evolving neurocognitive disorder and do not occur in a context of a severely reduced level of arousal such as coma. and (E) There is evidence from history, physical examination or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, or exposure to a toxin, or is due to multiple etiologies. The delirium diagnosis requires meeting all 5 criteria outlined in DSM-5.

DSM-5 is recognized as the gold standard for delirium diagnosis. A board-certified geriatrician confirmed POD diagnoses from postoperative patient chart reviews, physical examination, interviews with patients and their caregivers, and direct patient observation. POD was diagnosed when all DSM-5 criteria were met. Any delirium episode occurring between postoperative days 1 and 3 was considered POD, as 97% of delirium cases arise within 3 days postsurgery.

Table 2
Distribution of the total population in a NEECHAM Confusion Scale versus CAM-ICU matrix

'Mild' is defined as early to mild confusion. CAM-ICU, Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit; NEECHAM, Neelon and Champagne.

Positive delirium observations were obtained for 39 patients on 183 delirious days. Consequently, this resulted in a mean of 4.7 delirium days for each delirious patient, ranging from 1 to 18 days. Most of these patients suffered one (23%), two (18%), or three (13%) delirious days. Most of the delirious patients (31%) were positive for the first time within 3 days after admission to the ICU, and 57% were positive for the first time after 4 days. Within 7 days, 77% of the delirious patients were positive for the first time.

Subgroup analysis based on the most severe patient data (n = 172) showed similar results for the CAM-ICU and the NEECHAM scale. Both instruments agreed that there was no difference in the onset of delirium concerning age or gender (Table 3). Both showed a trend toward a higher incidence for the internal medicine patients. The length of stay in the ICU was higher for the delirious patients (Table 4). These results were significant regarding the CAM-ICU and the categories of the NEECHAM scale. Additionally, the NEECHAM scale scores showed a positive correlation with the length of stay in days (r = 0.61, P < 0.01).

### Tools to detect delirium superimposed on dementia: a systematic review [^1127bLP5]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

To identify valid tools to diagnose delirium superimposed on dementia.

Design

Systematic review of studies of delirium tools that explicitly included individuals with dementia.

Setting

Hospital.

Participants

Studies were included if delirium assessment tools were validated against standard criteria, and the presence of dementia was assessed according to standard criteria that used validated instruments.

Measurements

PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched for articles in English published between January 1960 and January 2012.

Results

Nine studies fulfilled the selection criteria. Of 1,569 participants, 401 had dementia, and 50 had delirium superimposed on dementia. Six delirium tools were evaluated. One study using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) with 85% of participants with dementia had high specificity (96–100%) and moderate sensitivity (77%). Two intensive care unit studies that used the CAM for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) reported 100% sensitivity and specificity for delirium in 23 individuals with dementia. One study using electroencephalography reported sensitivity of 67% and specificity of 91% in a population with a 100% prevalence of dementia. No studies examined potential effects of dementia severity or subtype on diagnostic accuracy.

Conclusions

The evidence base on tools for detection of delirium superimposed on dementia is limited, although some existing tools show promise. Further studies of existing or refined tools with larger samples and more-detailed characterization of dementia are required to address the identification of delirium superimposed on dementia.

### Comparison of delirium assessment tools in a mixed intensive care unit [^113yQwwb]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Delirium is a frequent problem in the intensive care unit (ICU) associated with poor prognosis. Delirium in the ICU is underdiagnosed by nursing and medical staff. Several detection methods have been developed for use in ICU patients. The aim of this study was to compare the value of three detection methods (the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU [CAM-ICU], the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist [ICDSC] and the impression of the ICU physician with the diagnosis of a psychiatrist, neurologist, or geriatrician).

Design

Prospective study.

Setting and Patients

During an 8-month period, 126 patients (mean age 62.4 years, sd 15.0; mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score 20.9, sd 7.5) admitted to a 32-bed mixed medical and surgical ICU were studied.

Measurements

The included patients were assessed independently by trained ICU nurses using either the CAM-ICU or the ICDSC. Furthermore, the ICU physician was asked whether a patient was delirious or not. A psychiatrist, geriatrician, or neurologist serving as reference rater diagnosed delirium using established criteria.

Main Results

The CAM-ICU showed superior sensitivity and negative predictive value (64% and 83%) compared with the ICDSC (43% and 75%). The ICDSC showed higher specificity and positive predictive value (95% and 82% vs. 88% and 72%). The sensitivity of the physicians view was only 29%.

Conclusions

ICU physicians underdiagnose delirium in the ICU, which underlines the necessity of standard evaluation in all critically ill patients. In our mixed ICU population, the CAM-ICU had a higher sensitivity than the ICDSC.

### Delirium as detected by the CAM-ICU predicts restraint use among mechanically ventilated medical patients [^117N6ink]. Critical Care Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

The first goal of this investigation was to identify individuals with delirium defined by the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) among medical patients with respiratory failure. Our second goal was to compare clinical interventions including use of continuous sedation infusions, the number of ventilator-free days, ICU length of stay, hospital mortality, and use of physical restraints in mechanically ventilated patients with and without delirium.

Design

A prospective, single-center, observational cohort study.

Setting

The medical intensive care unit (19 beds) of an urban teaching hospital.

Patients

Adult, intubated, and mechanically ventilated patients.

Interventions

Daily evaluation with the CAM-ICU, outcomes assessment, and prospective data collection.

Measurements and Main Results

Among 93 patients evaluated using the CAM-ICU, 44 patients (47%) developed delirium (CAM-ICU+) for ≥ 1 day while in the intensive care unit. Twenty-two patients (24%) had no episodes of delirium recorded (CAM-ICU-), and 27 (29%) remained comatose until extubation or death. A statistically greater number of patients with delirium (CAM-ICU+) received continuous infusions of midazolam (59% vs. 32%, p < .05) or fentanyl (57% vs. 32%, p < .05) and physical soft-limb restraints (77% vs. 50%, p < .05) compared with patients without delirium (CAM-ICU-).

Conclusions

The identification of delirium using the CAM-ICU was associated with greater use of continuous sedation infusions and physical restraints. Additional studies are required to determine how the use of these specific interventions influences the occurrence and the natural history of delirium among critically ill patients.

### A research algorithm to improve detection of delirium in the intensive care unit [^114xTX1s]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Patient interviews

Delirium was assessed by trained research nurses from Monday to Friday using the CAM-ICU. The CAM-ICU, an adapted version of the Confusion Assessment Method, consists of a brief interview with the patient and incorporates the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual III-R operationalized criteria to define delirium. It is currently the most widely used method for assessing delirium in critically ill patients. Delirium assessment using the CAM-ICU incorporates four key features that constitute the definition of delirium, as taken from the original Confusion Assessment Method algorithm presented by Inouye and coworkers. The instrument includes a series of nonverbal tasks to rate the four key criteria: acute change from baseline or fluctuating course, inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness. All tasks and questions were designed to be completed by nonverbal, mechanically ventilated, or restrained patients in ICU settings. The CAM-ICU was validated in three large cohort studies of ICU patients against delirium expert assessments, and was found to have a sensitivity of 95–100%, a specificity of 89–93%, and high interobserver reliability.

The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) was used to assess sedation status. The RASS is a ten-point rating scale with four levels for agitation, five levels for sedation, and one level for calm, awake patients. This scale was designed with the anchor centered at level 0, positive ratings for agitation, and negative ratings for sedation. It completely separates ratings according to a patient's responses to verbal and then to physical stimulation. This sedation scale has excellent inter-rater reliability and has been validated for criterion and construct validity. The CAM-ICU is not performed in patients who are not arousable (stupor: RASS of -4; coma: RASS of -5); when patients had a RASS of -4 or -5 or were unavailable for interview, two more attempts were made during the day to interview the patient.

Inter-rater agreement for the CAM-ICU was 100% between the two research nurse interviewers for this study. All questionnaires were pilot tested before the beginning of the study, and all research nurse interviewers were trained and standardized in the interview process.

### Development and validation of PRE-DELIRIC (PREdiction of DELIRium in ICu patients) delirium prediction model for intensive care patients: observational multicentre study [^115KZm5J]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Delirium, characterised by an acute onset of fluctuating changes in mental status and changed levels of consciousness and inattentiveness, has a high incidence rate in critically ill patients. It is a serious disorder associated with prolonged stays in intensive care units and hospitals, higher costs, and increased morbidity and mortality.

Several tools are available for assessing delirium in intensive care patients, of which the confusion assessment method — intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) has the highest sensitivity and specificity. Screening intensive care patients is important, so that timely treatment can be provided. However, preventive measures for delirium may also reduce its incidence, severity, and duration, as determined in other groups of patients. General preventive measures in all intensive care patients are time consuming and may expose a substantial number of patients to unnecessary risks such as the adverse effects of drug prophylaxis. Although several predictive models for non-intensive care patients exist, as well as one for older medical intensive care patients, no evidence based prediction model for general intensive care patients is available. The aim of our study was to develop and validate a delirium prediction model for intensive care patients and to determine its value compared with prediction by the attending nurses and physicians.

### Heterogeneity in the definition of delirium in ICUs and association with the intervention effect in randomized controlled trials: a meta-epidemiological study [^117TdX2B]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Delirium is a neuropsychiatric syndrome reflecting an acute brain dysfunction that occurs frequently in intensive care units (ICUs). It may be induced by a physiological stress related to a systemic pathology or to the critical care interventions and other specific factors (e.g. sleep disturbances, light pollution at night). Characteristics such as age, sex, disease severity, mechanical ventilation are risk factors. The incidence is about 30%, with significant variations (from 10 to 80%) depending on the admission cause and the definition used to characterize it. This disorder is challenging to assess reliably because of varied symptomatology, including fluctuating mental status, disturbance in consciousness, attention and judgment disorders, disorientation, circadian disturbances, and psychomotor slowing and/or agitation, which could lead to under-recognition. The reference diagnosis is based on the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM) criteria after a psychiatric evaluation. To facilitate the diagnosis and recognition of this trouble by ICU physicians in their everyday practice, scales were developed in the 2000s and included the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Both scales were validated after comparison with the DSM criteria.

Delirium is associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospital stay, prolonged mechanical ventilation, and increased risk of long-term cognitive impairment; therefore, it is a major therapeutic issue. Current research on delirium in ICUs focuses on the evaluation of prevention and treatment strategies including various pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions that have been evaluated in many randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, few studies have raised the issue of the definition of delirium, which seems to be heterogeneous in the published literature despite the existing tools. The definition of an outcome such as delirium may be an important source of heterogeneity and variation in the intervention effect making comparison between trials on this topic difficult.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the heterogeneity in the definition of delirium used in RCTs included in meta-analyses evaluating the prevention or treatment of delirium in ICUs and to explore whether the intervention effect varies depending on the definition used.

### A research algorithm to improve detection of delirium in the intensive care unit [^115UTMax]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Delirium has a high prevalence in the older critically ill population, where increasing age and cognitive impairment represent important risk factors. Delirium has been shown to have impacts on both short-term and long-term outcomes from both ICU and hospital care. As studies move forward to improve our understanding of modifiable risk factors for delirium and ultimately to assist in its prevention and treatment, it will be of critical importance to rate correctly a patient's delirium status during the ICU stay. Augmenting delirium instruments with multiple sources, such as the medical chart, is a method that has previously been applied in non-ICU studies and is probably even more important in the ICU setting. Thus, the algorithm presented here using a combination of CAM-ICU and chart review will aid researchers undertaking studies of delirium to better identify this high-risk condition and intervene.

### A comparison of the CAM-ICU and the NEECHAM confusion scale in intensive care delirium assessment: an observational study in non-intubated patients [^1169WD8k]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Several reports indicate a high incidence of intensive care delirium. To develop strategies to prevent this complication, validated instruments are needed. The Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU) is widely used. A binary result diagnoses delirium. The Neelon and Champagne (NEECHAM) Confusion Scale recently has been validated for use in the ICU and has a numeric assessment. This scale allows the patients to be classified in four categories: non-delirious, at risk, confused, and delirious. In this study, we investigated the results of the NEECHAM scale in comparison with the CAM-ICU.

Methods

A consecutive sample of 172 non-intubated patients in a mixed ICU was assessed after a stay in the ICU for at least 24 hours. All adult patients with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of greater than 9 were included. A nurse researcher simultaneously assessed both scales once daily in the morning. A total of 599 paired observations were made.

Results

The CAM-ICU showed a 19.8% incidence of delirium. The NEECHAM scale detected incidence rates of 20.3% for delirious, 24.4% for confused, 29.7% for at risk, and 25.6% for normal patients. The majority of the positive CAM-ICU patients were detected by the NEECHAM scale. The sensitivity of the NEECHAM scale was 87% and the specificity was 95%. The positive predictive value and the negative predictive value were 79% and 97%, respectively. The diagnostic capability in cardiac surgery patients proved to be lower than in other patients.

Conclusion

In non-intubated patients, the NEECHAM scale identified most cases of delirium which were detected by the CAM-ICU. Additional confused patients were identified in the categorical approach of the scale. The NEECHAM scale proved to be a valuable screening tool compared with the CAM-ICU in the early detection of intensive care delirium by nurses.

### Adaptation and validation of a chart-based delirium detection tool for the ICU (CHART-DEL-ICU) [^115KgZJU]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To adapt and validate a chart-based delirium detection tool for use in critically ill adults.

Design

Validation study.

Setting

Medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in an academic hospital.

Measurements

A chart-based delirium detection tool (CHART-DEL) was adapted for use in critically ill adults (CHART-DEL-ICU) and compared with prospective delirium assessments (i.e., clinical assessments (reference standard) by a research nurse trained by a neuropsychiatrist and routine delirium screening tools Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU)) and (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC)). The original CHART-DEL tool was adapted to include physician-reported ICDSC score (for probable delirium) and Richmond-Agitation Sedation Scale score (for altered level of consciousness and agitation). Two trained chart abstractors blinded to all delirium assessments manually abstracted delirium-related information from medical charts and electronic medical records and rated if delirium was present (four levels: uncertain, possible, probable, definite) or absent (no evidence).

Results

Charts were manually abstracted for delirium-related information for 213 patients who were included in a prospective cohort study that included prospective delirium assessments. The CHART-DEL-ICU tool had excellent interrater reliability (kappa = 0.90). Compared to the reference standard, the sensitivity was 66.0% (95% CI = 59.3–72.3%) and specificity was 82.1% (95% CI = 78.0–85.7%), with a cut-point that included definite, probable, possible, and uncertain delirium. The AUC of the CHART-DEL-ICU alone is 74.1% (95% CI = 70.4–77.8%) compared with the addition of the CAM-ICU and ICDSC (CAM-ICU/CHART-DEL-ICU: 80.9% (95% CI = 77.8–83.9%), P = .01; ICDSC/CHART-DEL-ICU: 79.2% (95% CI = 75.9–82.6%), P = .03).

Conclusion

A chart-based delirium detection tool has improved diagnostic accuracy when combined with routine delirium screening tools (CAM-ICU and ICDSC), compared to a chart-based method on its own. This presents a potential for retrospective detection of delirium from medical charts for research or to augment routine delirium screening methods to find missed cases of delirium.

Individuals aged 70 and older enrolled in the Successful Aging after Elective Surgery Study undergoing major elective noncardiac surgery (N = 566).

Measurements

The sample was randomly divided into a derivation dataset (n = 377) and an independent validation dataset (n = 189). These datasets were used to develop a severity scoring method using the 3D-CAM based on the four-item CAM-S SF (3D-CAM-S) and evaluate agreement between the 3D-CAM-S and the traditional CAM-S SF using weighted kappa statistics.

Results

A method for scoring severity using 3D-CAM items was developed that achieved good agreement with the CAM-S SF in the derivation dataset (κ = 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.93–0.95). The 3D-CAM-S achieved nearly identical agreement in the independent validation dataset (κ = 0.93, 95% CI = 0.92–0.95), and 100% of 3D-CAM-S scores were within 1 point of the CAM-S SF score in both datasets. The 3D-CAM-S also strongly predicts clinical outcomes.

Conclusion

A newly developed method for scoring delirium severity using the 3D-CAM (the 3D-CAM-S) has excellent agreement with the CAM-S SF. This new methodology enables clinicians and researchers using the 3D-CAM for surveillance to measure delirium severity and monitor its course simultaneously by tracking changes over time. The 3D-CAM-S expands the utility of the 3D-CAM as an important tool for delirium recognition and management.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and management of pain, agitation / sedation, delirium, immobility, and sleep disruption in adult patients in the ICU [^1168U6po]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Delirium screening in critically ill adults — an ungraded Good Practice Statement supports widespread assessment despite limited direct outcome evidence. The guideline states, "instead of a graded recommendation, we issue an ungraded Good Practice Statement given that the potential benefits of delirium monitoring far outweigh any potential downsides", and acknowledges that "this evidence cannot establish whether delirium screening alone is beneficial". Screening with the CAM-ICU or the ICDSC "is quick (2–5 min)", while potential drawbacks include that "a false-positive screening, although rare with either the CAM-ICU or the ICDSC, may result in unnecessary pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic treatment", that "ICU antipsychotic use is often associated with its continuation and prolonged administration after ICU and hospital discharge", and that "delirium screening may be burdensome for nursing staff", yet "we feel that the benefits of widespread delirium assessment with the CAM-ICU or the ICDSC far outweigh any potential disadvantages".

### A comparison of the CAM-ICU and the NEECHAM confusion scale in intensive care delirium assessment: an observational study in non-intubated patients [^115XdaK6]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

The NEECHAM scale was developed as a nursing screening instrument for the early detection of delirium and was validated against DSM criteria for use in an ICU. In this validation research, 19.4% delirium and 15.8% mild confusion rates were found in a medium-sized ICU of a general hospital. The population in our study had a similar incidence for delirium but a higher incidence for 'mild confusion'. A report of Csokasy and Pugh, also using the NEECHAM scale, showed a total score of 47% for both categories taken together. The patients in their population (n = 19) were all older than 65 years and were admitted to an ICU of a smaller hospital. As already stated by Immers and colleagues, the evaluation of the physiological condition may not be relevant to the delirium assessment of the patient in the ICU. Since there has been no research or validation study to verify this suggestion, the assessment of the physiological condition will be retained as a basic element of this tool. Additionally, further study is needed to adapt and validate the NEECHAM scale for the delirium assessment of the intubated or the ventilated patient. Also, a longitudinal study needs to inquire whether the numbered approach and the different categories of the NEECHAM scale have a predictive value against a binary approach. Consequently, the categories 'at risk' and 'mild confusion' could have an additional value. Preventive actions eventually could protect patients from becoming delirious. As Devlin and colleagues in their excellent review of delirium instruments for the ICU already remarked, all evaluations are dichotomous and therefore do not measure delirium severity.

Besides the NEECHAM scale and the CAM-ICU, the Intensive Care Delirium Checklist is a commonly used screening tool for the detection of delirium in the ICU. Incidence rates of 19.2% and 31.8% were reported in an adult population in a mixed ICU. Many items in this scale can also be scored by a nurse during daily practice. This eight-item scale also provides a numeric approach to the delirium assessment. Each item scoring positive gets one point. A score of four points was considered to detect 99% of the delirious patients. A definition of a population 'at risk' or with 'mild confusion' is not provided. A binary approach of the score was suggested. Given the four categories of the NEECHAM scale, the last one creates more opportunities to classify the patient.

### Delirium and cognitive dysfunction in the intensive care unit [^111zCd8P]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2007). Low credibility.

Delirium is an under-recognized, highly prevalent form of organ dysfunction in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is imperative to be aware of risk factors for delirium in the ICU, some of which are modifiable. In the last 5 years, a new tool for detecting delirium among critically ill patients has been validated and found reliable for use at the bedside by psychiatrists and nonpsychiatrically trained personnel as well. The tool, the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit, has enabled determination of the serious sequelae of delirium, including increased mortality, higher cost, longer length of hospital stay, failure of extubation, and burdensome, long-term cognitive impairment. This article reviews prevention and treatment options, and current pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches to delirium, acknowledging limited but improving quality of evidence to date.

2.5. Statistical analysis

2.5.1. Agreement between researchers' and family members' delirium assessments (Primary objective)

Characteristics are presented as descriptive statistics for those patients who had concurrent CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM assessments. To be considered positive for delirium, acute change, inattention, and either disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness are required. The features of delirium including acute change, inattention, either disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness, and overall delirium outcomes were compared between CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM assessments. Disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness were combined based on the scoring algorithm for the FAM-CAM. Agreement between the CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM was analyzed using the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) with repeated measures, treating patients and raters as random effects. Bland-Altman analysis was also conducted to assess agreement between CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM. Inter-rater reliability for each instrument was modeled using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Agreement of each delirium feature (acute onset or fluctuation, inattention, disorganized thinking/altered level of consciousness) was compared between researcher's CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM assessment using the GLMM. Overall agreement beyond chance between the two instruments was evaluated using repeated measure Cohen's Kappa and sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predicted values. Using the research-rated CAM/CAM-ICU as the reference standard, the adjusted sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) was calculated. A total of 7 FAM-CAM surveys were missing an answer to the question about inattention. There was no imputation of missing data for any item in the FAM-CAM. Data analysis was completed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) and R statistical software (3.4.2) using the 'psych' package.

2.5.2. FAM-CAM after hospital discharge (Secondary objective)

Patient characteristics are presented as descriptive statistics for participants with concurrent CAM/CAM-ICU and FAM-CAM surveys and patients whose family members were given a FAM-CAM booklet. Data are segregated according to whether a booklet was returned. Descriptive characteristics for patients who were positive for delirium according to FAM-CAM booklets are presented.

### Disorientation as a delirium feature in non-intubated patients: development and evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of the 'confusion assessment method for intermediate care unit' (CAM-IMC)-a prospective cohort study [^1122Rico]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The Confusion-Assessment-Method for Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), which originally derived from the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), was developed for monitoring of POD in intubated ICU-patients. It omits the feature 'disorientation', as this requires a more differentiated verbal response than 'yes' and 'no', or nodding 'yes' and shaking your head 'no'. Disorientation should not be missed as a frequent symptom and early indicator of POD as stated above. Screening for disorientation has been shown to provide high sensitivity (96.6%) in the diagnosis of POD.

A substantial proportion of critically ill patients are nowadays not orally intubated and thus amenable to verbal assessments. We therefore sought to combine the highly operationalized CAM-ICU features with 'disorientation' to develop the 'Confusion Assessment Method for Intermediate Care Unit' (CAM-IMC). An Intermediate-Care-Unit (IMC) is a unit for patients without need for invasive ventilation but in need for non-invasive organ-support or close monitoring. In alignment with the nomenclature of the CAM-ICU for intubated patients we named the assessment-tool CAM-IMC. A retrospective analysis for disorientation in assessment of POD indicated that the CAM-IMC could provide a sensitive bedside diagnostic test to detect POD in non-intubated patients.

This prospective cohort study was conducted to develop and evaluate the test performance of both 'disorientation' and the CAM-IMC in diagnosing POD in non-intubated cardiac-surgery patients compared to experienced reference-raters.

### Natural language processing diagnosed behavioral disturbance vs confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit: prevalence, patient characteristics, overlap, and association with treatment and outcome [^111Ua4d3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Our study has several strengths. It studied a novel approach to the assessment of the epidemiology of behavioral disturbance in critically ill patients. It compared such assessment with delirium assessment performed by the CAM-ICU methodology. It also conducted such comparisons in a large and heterogeneous group of ICU patients, thus increasing the external validity of the observations. The incidence of CAM-ICU positive assessment was consistent with the literature and our study applied a primary outcome based on therapy, which is likely to be relevant to clinicians as well as patients. Finally, by showing that NLP-Dx-BD positivity captured almost all of patients with CAM-ICU positive status, it provided additional indirect evidence of the validity of its construct.

We acknowledge several limitations. Our study was undertaken in a large tertiary intensive care unit system in a university affiliated hospital of a resource-rich country. Therefore, its findings may not apply to other intensive care units in low or middle-income countries. Multiple progress notes were missing a positive or negative CAM-ICU assessment. However, this may reflect the well-described operational challenges in applying CAM-ICU and had minimal material impact on our findings. We did not provide data on non-pharmacological interventions including family visits and environmental management. However, many were applied by unit policy and the efficacy of such interventions remains uncertain as demonstrated in a recent stepped wedge cluster controlled trial. Patients were not assessed for the presence of delirium by an independent, psychiatrically trained clinician. However, we were studying the relationship between patient populations identified through the use of alternative screening methodologies. Thus, we were not attempting to confirm that the patients identified by such screening would then be diagnosed with delirium by such clinicians. Therefore, the changes in behavior may have reflected drug withdrawal, exacerbation of dementia or of pre-existing psychiatric disorders. Care givers generating the progress notes may have been aware of CAM-ICU results at the time of writing their notes; however, it is impossible to determine if an NLP-Dx-BD positive note preceded or followed a CAM-ICU assessment. Further, significantly more patients were NLP-Dx-BD positive than CAM-ICU positive, thus demonstrating that NLP-Dx-BD positivity was often logically determined independently of CAM-ICU assessment. Clinical progress notes may include errors in annotation that incorrectly characterize a patient's behavior. However, our study analyzed multiple progress notes (nursing, medical, allied health) that documented the same shift making systematic errors unlikely. There may also have been errors in the records of administration of anti-psychotic medication. However, our ICU uses an audited medication management system that accounts for the prescription, retrieval and administration of medications, which would minimize such errors. Finally, we did not assess long term cognitive outcomes. Thus we cannot make any statement about the long term sequelae of NLP-Dx-BD.

### Disorientation as a delirium feature in non-intubated patients: development and evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of the 'confusion assessment method for intermediate care unit' (CAM-IMC)-a prospective cohort study [^114N9MCA]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Disorientation is an early indicator of developing postoperative delirium (POD), which is associated with increased mortality and cognitive decline. The well-established "Confusion-Assessment-Method-for-Intensive-Care-Unit" (CAM-ICU) for diagnosing POD in intubated patients cannot make use of the feature 'disorientation', as this requires verbal communication. Other tools such as the 4AT test for disorientation but are not established in ICU settings. We therefore combined test-variables of the CAM-ICU (level of consciousness, fluctuating mental status and inattention) with verbal testing for disorientation to develop and enhance diagnostic accuracy of the "Confusion Assessment Method for Intermediate Care Unit" (CAM-IMC). In the present study we describe the development and the evaluation of the diagnostic accuracy of the CAM-IMC.

Methods

We conducted a prospective cohort-study to develop and evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the CAM-IMC and disorientation for diagnosing POD in non-intubated patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery. All patients were eligible during data collection period. Exclusion criteria were preexisting brain-organic disease, age < 50 years, preoperative intubation, and insufficient language skills. Patients were assessed for POD using the CAM-IMC as the index-test by two independent examiners over three postoperative days. Reference-testing was conducted by experienced reference-raters. The primary outcome was the diagnostic test-performance.

Results

Among 178 eligible patients, 624 paired observations were completed with 155 patients. Of these, 9% experienced POD. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.96 (CI-95%: 0.87–1.00) and 0.94 (CI-95%: 0.92–0.96), respectively. Area-Under-the-Receiver-Operating-Characteristic-Curve (AUROC; equivalent to c-statistic) for CAM-IMC with a cut-off at three points was 0.95 (CI-95%: 0.93–0.98). The interrater reliability was 0.80 (CI-95%: 0.69–0.91).

Conclusion

The CAM-IMC demonstrates excellent test performance for diagnosing POD in non-intubated patients by combining features of the CAM-ICU with 'disorientation'. Given an aging community with an increasing delirium risk, the CAM-IMC provides a highly structured assessment tool for POD. It enables early and accurate detection of delirium, which is critical for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. The CAM-IMC appears to be a useful tool to be implemented in units for not-intubated patients and seems to be the perfect match where the CAM-ICU is already in use for monitoring POD.

### Recalibration of the delirium prediction model for ICU patients (PRE-DELIRIC): a multinational observational study [^112nJujP]. Intensive Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Recalibration and determining discriminative power, internationally, of the existing delirium prediction model (PRE-DELIRIC) for intensive care patients.

Methods

A prospective multicenter cohort study was performed in eight intensive care units (ICUs) in six countries. The ten predictors (age, APACHE-II, urgent and admission category, infection, coma, sedation, morphine use, urea level, metabolic acidosis) were collected within 24 h after ICU admission. The confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) was used to identify ICU delirium. CAM-ICU screening compliance and inter-rater reliability measurements were used to secure the quality of the data.

Results

A total of 2,852 adult ICU patients were screened of which 1,824 (64%) were eligible for the study. Main reasons for exclusion were length of stay < 1 day (19.1%) and sustained coma (4.1%). CAM-ICU compliance was mean (SD) 82 ± 16% and inter-rater reliability 0.87 ± 0.17. The median delirium incidence was 22.5% (IQR 12.8–36.6%). Although the incidence of all ten predictors differed significantly between centers, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the eight participating centers remained good: 0.77 (95% CI 0.74–0.79). The linear predictor and intercept of the prediction rule were adjusted and resulted in improved re-calibration of the PRE-DELIRIC model.

Conclusions

In this multinational study, we recalibrated the PRE-DELIRIC model. Despite differences in the incidence of predictors between the centers in the different countries, the performance of the PRE-DELIRIC-model remained good. Following validation of the PRE-DELIRIC model, it may facilitate implementation of strategies to prevent delirium and aid improvements in delirium management of ICU patients.

### Association between incident delirium and 28-and 90-day mortality in critically ill adults: a secondary analysis [^115MuAau]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

While delirium prevalence and duration are each associated with increased 30-day, 6-month, and 1-year mortality, the association between incident ICU delirium and mortality remains unclear. We evaluated the association between both incident ICU delirium and days spent with delirium in the 28days after ICU admission and mortality within 28 and 90days.

Methods

Secondary cohort analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted among 1495 delirium-free, critically ill adults in 14 Dutch ICUs with an expected ICU stay ≥ 2days where all delirium assessments were completed. In the 28days after ICU admission, patients were evaluated for delirium and coma 3x daily; each day was coded as a delirium day [≥ 1 positive Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU)], a coma day [no delirium and ≥ 1 Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score ≤ -4], or neither. Four Cox-regression models were constructed for 28-day mortality and 90-day mortality; each accounted for potential confounders (i.e., age, APACHE-II score, sepsis, use of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, and haloperidol dose) and: 1) delirium occurrence, 2) days spent with delirium, 3) days spent in coma, and 4) days spent with delirium and/or coma.

Results

Among the 1495 patients, 28day mortality was 17% and 90day mortality was 21%. Neither incident delirium (28day mortality hazard ratio [HR] = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.75–1.39; 90day mortality HR = 1.05, 95%CI = 0.79–1.38) nor days spent with delirium (28day mortality HR = 1.00, 95%CI = 0.95–1.05; 90day mortality HR = 1.02, 95%CI = 0.98–1.07) were significantly associated with mortality. However, both days spent with coma (28day mortality HR = 1.05, 95%CI = 1.02–1.08; 90day mortality HR = 1.05, 95%CI = 1.02–1.08) and days spent with delirium or coma (28day mortality HR = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.00–1.05; 90day mortality HR = 1.03, 95%CI = 1.01–1.06) were significantly associated with mortality.

Conclusions

This analysis suggests neither incident delirium nor days spent with delirium are associated with short-term mortality after ICU admission.

### Quality improvement of delirium status communication and documentation for intensive care unit patients during daily multidisciplinary rounds [^115fgh54]. BMJ Open Quality (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Delirium, an acute state of confusion that includes symptoms of alternating mental status, inattention, disorganised thinking and/or altered consciousness, can occur in up to 80% of mechanically ventilated critically ill adult patients and up to 50% of critically ill adult patients not requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU. Classified based on the patient's psychomotor behaviour, symptoms of delirium can be hyperactive characterised by restlessness, agitation and delusions or hypoactive characterised by lethargy and slow response time. A combination of hyperactive and hypoactive symptoms is described as mixed delirium. Identification of hypoactive delirium, which comprises around 44% of delirium cases, can be difficult because patients may appear calm and relaxed.

Delirium is associated with increased hospital and ICU stay. Ely et al, reported that ICU patients with delirium spend an average 10 days longer in the hospital than ICU patients without delirium. Delirium is also associated with a higher incidence of cognitive impairment at hospital discharge and higher hospital and ICU mortality. The cost of care for an ICU patient with delirium is significantly higher than an ICU patient without an episode of delirium. It is estimated that total healthcare costs for delirium range up to $152 billion per year in the United States.

The duration of delirium is independently associated with long-term cognitive impairment, one aspect of post intensive care syndrome commonly experienced by critical illness survivors. However, management of delirium risk factors can reduce the frequency and duration of delirium. The Society of Critical Care Medicine's ABCDEF bundle was developed to reduce delirium, improve pain management and encourage early mobility, and for use of appropriate medication and family involvement to reduce long-term consequences for adult ICU patients. Component D of the ABCDEF bundle focuses on assessing, preventing and managing delirium and promotes use of the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) tool to monitor delirium through evaluation of mental status, inattention, altered consciousness and disorganised thinking. The CAM-ICU tool was developed and validated in non-verbal mechanically ventilated ICU patients but does not determine type or severity of delirium.

### Optimizing agreement between bedside nurse-documented and trained researcher delirium assessments in the ICU [^1121xLQ3]. Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Delirium is common and harmful in the ICU. The Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) and Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) are validated tools recommended for delirium identification. However, the accuracy of bedside nurse-documented delirium assessments in the ICU is inconsistent, limiting utility in clinical research. We sought to evaluate and optimize agreement between bedside nurse-documented and trained researcher delirium assessments.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Critically ill adults with acute respiratory failure or sepsis in ICUs in large academic hospitals in a southwestern Pennsylvania health system were assessed daily for delirium by bedside nurses (using the ICDSC) and trained researchers (using the CAM-ICU). Using matched nurse-to-researcher delirium assessments, we categorized delirium status using validated cutoffs and evaluated agreement using Cohen's kappa. We derived and compared logistic regression models that used ICDSC documentation, mechanical ventilation status, and admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment to predict delirium in noncomatose patients, using researcher CAM-ICU assessments as the reference standard. We internally validated models using ten-fold cross-validation.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

From a sample of 1535 matched assessments of 279 patients, there was moderate agreement between bedside nurse assessments using the established ICDSC delirium/normal cutoff (ICDSC ≥ 4) and trained researcher assessments using the CAM-ICU (Cohen's kappa = 0.42). A logistic regression model informed by individual ICDSC components and clinical data predicted a positive research CAM-ICU with good discrimination (area under the curve = 0.87) and performed well in cross-validation (F1 score = 0.72). In sensitivity analyses, models with more limited ICDSC information demonstrated fair to good discriminatory ability (F1 = 0.60–0.70), with the validated cutoff model having the lowest performance.

Conclusions

A delirium model informed by bedside nurse ICDSC findings and clinical variables improves accuracy of delirium detected in the ICU and can be used in future pragmatic research that leverages large clinical datasets to advance understanding of delirium mechanisms, trajectories, and outcomes.

### Adaptation and validation of a chart-based delirium detection tool for the ICU (CHART-DEL-ICU) [^112uGKXE]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2021). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To adapt and validate a chart‐based delirium detection tool for use in critically ill adults.

DESIGN

Validation study.

SETTING

Medical‐surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in an academic hospital.

MEASUREMENTS

A chart‐based delirium detection tool (CHART‐DEL) was adapted for use in critically ill adults (CHART‐DEL‐ICU) and compared with prospective delirium assessments (i.e. clinical assessments (reference standard) by a research nurse trained by a neuropsychiatrist and routine delirium screening tools Confusion Assessment Method (CAM‐ICU)) and (Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC)). The original CHART‐DEL tool was adapted to include physician‐reported ICDSC score (for probable delirium) and Richmond‐Agitation Sedation Scale score (for altered level of consciousness and agitation). Two trained chart abstractors blinded to all delirium assessments manually abstracted delirium‐related information from medical charts and electronic medical records and rated if delirium was present (four levels: uncertain, possible, probable, definite) or absent (no evidence).

RESULTS

Charts were manually abstracted for delirium‐related information for 213 patients who were included in a prospective cohort study that included prospective delirium assessments. The CHART‐DEL‐ICU tool had excellent interrater reliability (kappa = 0.90). Compared to the reference standard, the sensitivity was 66.0% (95% CI = 59.3–72.3%) and specificity was 82.1% (95% CI = 78.0–85.7%), with a cut‐point that included definite, probable, possible, and uncertain delirium. The AUC of the CHART‐DEL‐ICU alone is 74.1% (95% CI = 70.4–77.8%) compared with the addition of the CAM‐ICU and ICDSC (CAM‐ICU/CHART‐DEL‐ICU: 80.9% (95% CI = 77.8–83.9%), P = .01; ICDSC/CHART‐DEL‐ICU: 79.2% (95% CI = 75.9–82.6%), P = .03).

CONCLUSION

A chart‐based delirium detection tool has improved diagnostic accuracy when combined with routine delirium screening tools (CAM‐ICU and ICDSC), compared to a chart‐based method on its own. This presents a potential for retrospective detection of delirium from medical charts for research or to augment routine delirium screening methods to find missed cases of delirium.

### A comparison of the CAM-ICU and the NEECHAM confusion scale in intensive care delirium assessment: an observational study in non-intubated patients [^113Zae4j]. Critical Care (2008). Low credibility.

Four positive CAM-ICU patients scored 'mild confusion'. Five patients scoring negative on the CAM-ICU scored delirious on the NEECHAM scale. Four of them had a borderline score on the NEECHAM scale. One patient had a score of 14 on the NEECHAM scale and was assessed as negative for delirium on the CAM-ICU. This patient received propofol (through a continuous intravenous infusion pump), which possibly influenced the results. The NEECHAM scale proved to be a good delirium screening instrument with a strong denial power. The specificity proved to be good in all categories. The diagnostic descriptives for the NEECHAM scale in the cardiac surgery group, in contrast to the results of the other categories of admittance, were low.

Nurses are the first caregivers to observe the patient and to detect an altering cognitive function. The NEECHAM scale uses the daily observation skills of nurses and their standard 24-hour monitoring of a patient in the ICU. The CAM-ICU needs a short visual or auditive test. Both scales, showing the same result in the diagnosis of delirium, could be considered for implementation in the standard nursing observation or monitoring in the ICU. The focus in research on intensive care delirium should shift from possible treatments to early prevention of the syndrome. The detection of patients in an early stage of confusion and the classification in categories could become an important advantage of the NEECHAM Confusion Scale. Therefore, a longitudinal study is needed.

Our study is limited by the size of the population in the different categories of admittance. Each category could be the subject of a further study. Both studied scales were validated and verified for the intensive care setting. For the purpose of this study, a confirmation of the delirious state by a psychiatrist seemed unnecessary. The patient was assessed once in the morning. The simultaneous assessment of both scales could have created an interscale bias. The result of the NEECHAM scale, however, was calculated only after the paired assessment of the patient. Assessment of the patient at least three times a day could be recommended. A standardized screening for delirium should contain one observation during each nursing shift and an additional score on suspected events due to the fluctuating nature of the syndrome. The incidence in this study could have been higher when more daily assessments were completed. In addition, no ventilated or intubated patients were included. These categories of patients often develop delirium. There is a need to test the NEECHAM scale in this population.

### Optimal perioperative management of the geriatric patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons NSQIP and the American Geriatrics Society [^114R2m6z]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Medium credibility.

Postoperative delirium — screening and diagnosis: Current evidence regarding routine delirium screening in all patients is conflicting, and the benefits of routine postoperative screening for delirium in all older adult patients include early detection and treatment; however, routine screening could also result in misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment, and increased costs. That said, in appropriate settings, such as in a high risk population or a specialized unit, the health care team may choose to institute screening using a validated instrument. Evaluation of a patient who is suspected to have delirium requires an accurate clinical history, objective testing and behavioral observation. There are three distinct motor subtypes of delirium: hypoactive delirium, which presents with lack of awareness and decreased motor activity; hyperactive delirium, which occurs when a patient is combative or agitated; and a mixed subtype. In order for delirium to be diagnosed, at risk patients or patients with suspected cognitive impairment should undergo an assessment confirming the following: disturbance of consciousness, a change in cognition, acute onset, and evidence from the history that this is due to physiologic derangement (for example, hypoxia, hypoglycemia, electrolyte abnormality, acid base abnormality), an intoxicant, medications, or more than one cause. Several validated tools are currently available to evaluate for and diagnose delirium, including one of the most widely used instruments, known as the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and a related tool (the CAM-ICU), specifically designed to be used in nonverbal, mechanically ventilated patients.

### Natural language processing diagnosed behavioral disturbance vs confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit: prevalence, patient characteristics, overlap, and association with treatment and outcome [^113i81dj]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the prevalence, characteristics, drug treatment for delirium, and outcomes of patients with Natural Language Processing (NLP) diagnosed behavioral disturbance (NLP-Dx-BD) vs Confusion Assessment Method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) positivity.

Methods

In three combined medical-surgical ICUs, we obtained data on demographics, treatment with antipsychotic medications, and outcomes. We applied NLP to caregiver progress notes to diagnose behavioral disturbance and analyzed simultaneous CAM-ICU.

Results

We assessed 2313 patients with a median lowest Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) score of - 2 (- 4.0 to - 1.0) and median highest RASS score of 1 (0 to 1). Overall, 1246 (53.9%) patients were NLP-Dx-BD positive (NLP-Dx-BD pos) and 578 (25%) were CAM-ICU positive (CAM-ICU pos). Among NLP-Dx-BD pos patients, 539 (43.3%) were also CAM-ICU pos. In contrast, among CAM-ICU pos patients, 539 (93.3%) were also NLP-Dx-BD pos. The use of antipsychotic medications was highest in patients in the CAM-ICU pos and NLP-Dx-BD pos group (24.3%) followed by the CAM-ICU neg and NLP-Dx-BD pos group (10.5%). In NLP-Dx-BD neg patients, antipsychotic medication use was lower at 5.1% for CAM-ICU pos and NLP-Dx-BD neg patients and 2.3% for CAM-ICU neg and NLP-Dx-BD neg patients (overall P < 0.001). Regardless of CAM-ICU status, after adjustment and on time-dependent Cox modelling, NLP-Dx-BD was associated with greater antipsychotic medication use. Finally, regardless of CAM-ICU status, NLP-Dx-BD pos patients had longer duration of ICU and hospital stay and greater hospital mortality (all P < 0.001).

Conclusion

More patients were NLP-Dx-BD positive than CAM-ICU positive. NLP-Dx-BD and CAM-ICU assessment describe partly overlapping populations. However, NLP-Dx-BD identifies more patients likely to receive antipsychotic medications. In the absence of NLP-Dx-BD, treatment with antipsychotic medications is rare.

### 3D-CAM: derivation and validation of a 3-minute diagnostic interview for CAM-defined delirium: a cross-sectional diagnostic test study [^1129dHDX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Delirium is common, leads to other adverse outcomes, and is costly. However, it often remains unrecognized in most clinical settings. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is the most widely used diagnostic algorithm, and operationalizing its features would be a substantial advance for clinical care.

Objective

To derive the 3D-CAM, a new 3-minute diagnostic assessment for CAM-defined delirium, and validate it against a clinical reference standard.

Design

Derivation and validation study.

Setting

4 general medicine units in an academic medical center.

Participants

201 inpatients aged 75 years or older.

Measurements

20 items that best operationalized the 4 CAM diagnostic features were identified to create the 3D-CAM. For prospective validation, 3D-CAM assessments were administered by trained research assistants. Clinicians independently did an extensive assessment, including patient and family interviews and medical record reviews. These data were considered by an expert panel to determine the presence or absence of delirium and dementia (reference standard). The 3D-CAM delirium diagnosis was compared with the reference standard in all patients and subgroups with and without dementia.

Results

The 201 participants in the prospective validation study had a mean age of 84 years, and 28% had dementia. The expert panel identified 21% with delirium, 88% of whom had hypoactive or normal psychomotor features. Median administration time for the 3D-CAM was 3 minutes (interquartile range, 2 to 5 minutes), sensitivity was 95% (95% CI, 84% to 99%), and specificity was 94% (CI, 90% to 97%). The 3D-CAM did well in patients with dementia (sensitivity, 96% [CI, 82% to 100%]; specificity, 86% [CI, 67% to 96%]) and without dementia (sensitivity, 93% [CI, 66% to 100%]; specificity, 96% [CI, 91% to 99%]).

Limitation

Limited to single-center, cross-sectional, and medical patients only.

Conclusion

The 3D-CAM operationalizes the CAM algorithm using a 3-minute structured assessment with high sensitivity and specificity relative to a reference standard and could be an important tool for improving recognition of delirium.

### Intensive care unit delirium is an independent predictor of longer hospital stay: a prospective analysis of 261 non-ventilated patients [^117AG1BL]. Critical Care (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Delirium occurs in most ventilated patients and is independently associated with more deaths, longer stay, and higher cost. Guidelines recommend monitoring of delirium in all intensive care unit (ICU) patients, though few data exist in non-ventilated patients. The study objective was to determine the relationship between delirium and outcomes among non-ventilated ICU patients.

Method

A prospective cohort investigation of 261 consecutively admitted medical ICU patients not requiring invasive mechanical ventilation during hospitalization at a tertiary-care, university-based hospital between February 2002 and January 2003. ICU nursing staff assessed delirium and level of consciousness at least twice per day using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS). Cox regression with time-varying covariates was used to determine the independent relationship between delirium and clinical outcomes.

Results

Of 261 patients, 125 (48%) experienced at least one episode of delirium. Patients who experienced delirium were older (mean ± SD: 56 ± 18 versus 49 ± 17 years; p = 0.002) and more severely ill as measured by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores (median 15, interquartile range (IQR) 10–21 versus 11, IQR 6–16; p < 0.001) compared to their non-delirious counterparts. Patients who experienced delirium had a 29% greater risk of remaining in the ICU on any given day (compared to patients who never developed delirium) even after adjusting for age, gender, race, Charlson co-morbidity score, APACHE II score, and coma (hazard ratio (HR) 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98–1.69, p = 0.07). Similarly, patients who experienced delirium had a 41% greater risk of remaining in the hospital after adjusting for the same covariates (HR 1.41; 95% CI 1.05–1.89, p = 0.023). Hospital mortality was higher among patients who developed delirium (24/125, 19%) versus patients who never developed delirium (8/135, 6%), p = 0.002; however, time to in-hospital death was not significant the adjusted (HR 1.27; 95% CI 0.55–2.98, p = 0.58).

Conclusion

Delirium occurred in nearly half of the non-ventilated ICU patients in this cohort. Even after adjustment for relevant covariates, delirium was found to be an independent predictor of longer hospital stay.

### Study protocol: the improving care of acute lung injury patients (ICAP) study [^112PVUAv]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Exposure assessment

Exposures assessed in the ICAP study fall into three major categories: patient-based, clinical management, and ICU organizational exposures (Table 1). Patient-based exposures assessed at the time of study enrollment include demographics, comorbidities, admission diagnosis, severity of illness, and medications taken before hospitalization. Pilot testing indicates that medical chart abstraction for one-time measurement of these exposures takes about 30 minutes.

Patient-based and clinical management exposures measured while the participant is in the ICU vary over time, so the exposure measurements must account for this time-dependent course of critical care after ALI/ARDS diagnosis. Of particular importance, given the study objectives, are the participants' mechanical ventilator settings (for example. tidal volume and pressures) and associated arterial blood gas values. These important time-varying exposures are measured with the greatest frequency (twice daily). Other patient-based and clinical management exposures are measured once daily. On the basis of pilot testing, the time required for daily collection of these exposures is about 45 minutes per patient-day (Table 1).

ICU organizational exposures measured in the ICAP study include staff:patient ratios, ICU occupancy, and use of protocols for specific ICU therapies (for example. LTVV and intensive insulin therapy). Although infrequently considered in previous studies, recent research has demonstrated that ICU organizational exposures have an important impact on short-term patient outcomes. Thus, prospective measurement of these variables and their association with long-term patient outcomes has the potential to inform clinical practice. Because some of these ICU organizational exposures vary less frequently than other exposures, they are measured twice weekly.

When available, existing validated measurement instruments are used for exposure assessment. The Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II system, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and Charlson comorbidity index are validated predictors of short-term mortality and other outcomes in ICU patients. Similarly, validity and reliability have been demonstrated for the Richmond Agitation–Sedation Scale (RASS) and the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) as measures of sedation and delirium, respectively, among ICU patients. Delirium, measured with the CAM-ICU, is an important independent predictor of mortality in mechanically ventilated patients.

### Disorientation as a delirium feature in non-intubated patients: development and evaluation of diagnostic accuracy of the 'confusion assessment method for intermediate care unit' (CAM-IMC)-a prospective cohort study [^111Tp5Rj]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This cohort study evaluates the test performance of the newly developed CAM-IMC and its disorientation component in a prospective cohort study. The CAM-IMC shows a sensitivity of 0.96 and specificity of 0.94 in diagnosis of POD in non-intubated postoperative cardiac surgery patients. Its test performance is comparable to the widely used CAM-ICU demonstrating a high level of accuracy. While testing for disorientation alone shows good test performance values, it does not surpass the CAM-IMC. The study indicates that using the CAM-IMC by combing the features of the CAM-ICU with assessing of disorientation as a verbal testing variable, improves effectiveness and provides excellent sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing POD. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating verbal testing for disorientation whenever patients are accessible to oral evaluation to improve POD diagnostics. The CAM-IMC outperforms each individual feature of the CAM-IMC.

By creating the CAM-IMC flowchart design as a point-based scoring system, the importance of disorientation as a central feature of POD has been reinforced. The features disorientation and inattention can each trigger a positive test result. The system assigns up to five points for disorientation and three points for inattention, thereby increasing the weight of these single features in the overall diagnosis. The categories of acute or fluctuating change and RASS≠0 have been reduced in significance and each contribute one point to the total score but are not mandatory for a positive test outcome. This is reflected in their limited ability to discriminate POD, as shown by a distinct lower AUROC compared to disorientation, inattention and overall CAM-IMC. As a result, disorientation and inattention exert the greatest influence on CAM-IMC test-results. In comparison, the CAM-ICU does not diagnose POD if "Acute change or fluctuating course of the mental status" is assessed as negative, even when inattention or disorganized thinking" is present. By employing a point-based scoring system, the CAM-IMC avoids this limitation.

### Delirium assessment in the critically ill [^112HiWHx]. Intensive Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare available instruments for assessing delirium in critically ill adults that have undergone validity testing and provide clinicians with strategies to incorporate these instruments into clinical practice.

Design

Medline (1966-September 2006) was searched using the key words: delirium, cognitive dysfunction, assessment, intensive care unit, and critical illness to identify assessment tools that have been used to evaluate delirium in critically ill adults. A special emphasis was placed on delirium assessment tools that have been properly validated. Data on how these tools have been adopted into clinical practice as well as strategies for clinicians to improve delirium assessment in the ICU are highlighted.

Measurements and Results

Six delirium assessment instruments including the Cognitive Test for Delirium (CTD), abbreviated CTD, Confusion Assessment Method-ICU, Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist, NEECHAM scale, and the Delirium Detection Score were identified. While each of these scales have undergone validation in critically ill adults, substantial differences exist among the scales in terms of the quality and extent of the validation effort, the specific components of the delirium syndrome each address, their ability to identify hypoactive delirium, their use in patients with a compromised level of consciousness, and their ease of use.

Conclusions

Incorporation of delirium assessment into clinical practice in the intensive care unit using a validated tool may improve patient care. Clinicians can adopt a number of different strategies to overcome the many barriers associated with routine delirium assessment in the ICU.

Methods

This systematic review was reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting of Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement.

Protocol and registration

The study protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO, the international prospective register of systematic reviews (registration number CRD42018093935).

Selection criteria

Study inclusion criteria were: (1) hospitalised patients aged 18 and over; (2) patients in whom an assessment of delirium was made using standardised diagnostic criteria or validated tools (e.g. Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and its derivatives including the CAM for the Intensive Care Unit, Delirium Rating Scale-Revised 98 (DRS-R98), Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale, Delirium Index, Delirium Observation Screening Scale, Delirium Symptom Overview, or 4AT); (3) collected data on at least one of our pre-specified outcomes (defined below); and (4) studies which reported the outcome stratified by presence or absence of individual symptom domains typically considered to be part of the delirium syndrome, including disturbance in attention, level of arousal, memory, orientation, language, visuospatial ability, affect and thought process (disorganised thinking), and psychotic features (including misinterpretations, hallucinations and illusions).

Exclusion criteria were studies in: (1) patients with delirium tremens; (2) the intensive care unit or high dependency unit or a setting focused on providing specialist end of life care (e.g. hospice); and (3) mixed settings unless data from patients admitted to hospital could be separated.

The primary outcome was mortality at 30 days. Secondary outcomes were mortality at other timepoints including in-hospital mortality, as well as length of hospital stay (days), readmission, new admission to care home, duration of delirium, incident dementia and quality of life (after a delirium episode) as measured by a validated questionnaire.

All study designs were considered.

Primary outcome: use of antipsychotic medications

The use of antipsychotic medications was highest in patients in Group 4 (24.3%) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). The group with the second greatest use of these medications was Group 3 (10.5%). For all antipsychotic medications, the rate of use in Group 2 patients was 5.1%, similar to that of Group 1 at 2.3%. (Table 2). The impact of NLP-Dx-BD on the use of antipsychotic medications was confirmed by univariate and multivariate Cox models that treated groups as time-dependent variables (eTable 4 and eTable 5).

### Development and validation of PRE-DELIRIC (PREdiction of DELIRium in ICu patients) delirium prediction model for intensive care patients: observational multicentre study [^1119nqhd]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was an observational multicentre study in which we firstly developed the PREdiction of DELIRium for Intensive Care patients (PRE-DELIRIC) model and then temporally validated it in a second prospective cohort in the same hospital. We then validated the model externally in four other Dutch hospitals.

Development and temporal validation of the model

To develop the prediction model, we did a prospective cohort study in the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre in the Netherlands. This study took place between 1 February 2008 and 1 February 2009. We did a second prospective cohort study in the same hospital for temporal validation of the model between 1 May and 1 September 2009.

External validation

After development and temporal validation, we externally validated the delirium prediction model with data from intensive care patients admitted to four other Dutch hospitals between 1 January and 1 September 2009. One of these hospitals was a university hospital, and three were university affiliated teaching hospitals; all had mixed intensive care populations (table 1). In these hospitals, trained intensive care nurses used the CAM-ICU at least twice daily.

Delirium prediction by caregivers

To compare the predictive value of the model with that of the caregivers, we asked intensive care nurses and physicians caring for the patient to predict independently, within 24 hours after admission to intensive care, if patients would develop a delirious period during their complete stay in intensive care.

### A comparison of monotherapy and combination therapy with antipsychotic medications for intensive care unit delirium: a retrospective cohort study [^117GeY6j]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Antipsychotic medications continue to be frequently prescribed by clinicians in the intensive care unit (ICU) for delirium, despite inconclusive data.

Objective

To determine if using a combination of antipsychotics reduces the time patients spend in delirium compared with monotherapy.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective, cohort medical record review of patients who scored positive on Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and received antipsychotic therapy. Patients were excluded if they received any antipsychotics prior to hospital admission or had a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores of -4 or -5 at the time of CAM-ICU assessment. The primary outcome was duration of delirium. The secondary outcomes included ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, overall mortality, occurrence of adverse events (AEs), and whether antipsychotics were continued at hospital discharge.

Results

A total of 84 patients were included, of these 45 and 39 received monotherapy and combination therapy, respectively. Median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores were significantly higher in the monotherapy group (18 vs 13, P = 0.006). Median duration of delirium was not significantly different between the monotherapy and combination therapy groups (8 vs 8 days, P = 0.932). Median ICU and hospital LOS, and occurrence of AEs were not significantly different. A significant difference in mortality was found between monotherapy and combination therapy (31% vs 10%, P = 0.02). Antipsychotics were continued at hospital discharge in 64% of the monotherapy and in 44% of the combination therapy group.

Conclusion and Relevance

In patients with ICU delirium, there was no difference in duration of delirium among patients receiving monotherapy compared with combination therapy with antipsychotics, though they may be sicker and have a higher mortality. Patients commonly remain on antipsychotics at hospital discharge, the implications of which warrant further study.

### A research algorithm to improve detection of delirium in the intensive care unit [^113mPfc1]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Discussion

We present a useful research algorithm for detecting delirium in an ICU setting. This method utilizing both the CAM-ICU and a validated chart review demonstrates a more comprehensive approach to detection of delirium for research purposes.

Compared with research nurse ratings using the CAM-ICU, the chart-based method has a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 85%. The positive predictive accuracy of the chart-based method was 87%, which is much higher than the 39% reported in a non-ICU population and is probably related to the greater prevalence of delirium in the ICU.

Numerous studies have verified the under-recognition and under-documentation of delirium by both physician and nursing staff. Under-documentation of delirium in the medical record is supported by our findings, in that there was no chart documentation for 36% (105/292) of delirium cases identified by the CAM-ICU.

### The impact of delirium on the survival of mechanically ventilated patients [^113YnyGm]. Critical Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

To revalidate a means of assessing delirium in intensive care unit patients and to investigate the independent effect of delirium on the mortality of mechanically ventilated patients.

Design

A prospective cohort study.

Setting

A 37-bed medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital.

Patients

Subjects were 102 of 131 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients.

Measurements

All the enrolled patients were assessed for delirium using the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU). Mortality rate were compared between patients with or without delirium, and the predictors of death were investigated.

Results

The two CAM-ICU assessors' sensitivities in diagnosing delirium compared with reference standard were 91% and 95%, whereas their specificities were both 98%. They also demonstrated high interrater reliability with kappa statistics of 0.91. Delirium was present in 22 of 102 (22%) patients in the first 5 days. The delirious patients had higher intensive care unit mortality rate than nondelirious patients (63.6% vs. 32.5%, respectively), with a hazard ratio of 2.57 (95% confidence interval, 1.56–8.15). In multivariate analysis, delirium (odds ratio, 13.0; 95% confidence interval, 2.69–62.91), shock (odds ratio, 12.91; 95% confidence interval, 2.93–56.92), and illness severity (odds ratio, 9.61; 95% confidence interval, 2.24–41.18) were independent predictors of mortality.

Conclusions

This study confirms previous work showing that delirium is an independent predictor for increased mortality among mechanically ventilated patients.

Participants A total of 111 consecutive patients who were mechanically ventilated. is extremely common in mechanically ventilated patients. The CAM-ICU appears to be rapid, valid, and reliable for diagnosing delirium in the ICU setting and may be a useful instrument for both clinical and research purposes. Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness characterized by an acute onset and fluctuating course of impaired cognitive functioning so that a patient's. The Confusion Assessment Method 31 is the most widely used instrument for diagnosing delirium by internists and other nonpsychiatrists10, 17, 18 and has been found to have the best combination of ease, speed, reliability, and validity.

33 CAM provides a standardized rating of delirium, which was validated against expert opinion and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edition definitions of the American Psychiatric. a 5-point scale whether they believed the patient was demented). Because baseline dementia could serve as a confounder in rating the CAM-ICU, we chose to increase our sensitivity for detecting dementia by defining patients as having suspected dementia if they met any of the following 3 criteria: delirium expert. had been given between the CAM-ICU rating and the reference standard rating, and a lapse of more than 3 hours between ratings. In the 84-paired assessments of the first alert or lethargic evaluation for each patient, the CAM-ICU was completed with excellent interrater reliability.

In this investigation, we have validated the CAM-ICU, a 2-minute assessment instrument, which demonstrated a sensitivity of 93% to 100%, a specificity of 98% to 100%, and high interrater reliability in the detection of delirium. In 96 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients, delirium. CAM-ICU, we sought to develop a tool for detecting delirium, not dementia. 49 However, it is commonplace for mildly demented patients to be cared for in the ICU setting. Because such patients could pose a challenge for the CAM-ICU, we used liberal inclusion of patients with suspected dementia.

### Delirium as a predictor of mortality in mechanically ventilated patients in the intensive care unit… [^114TteL4]. JAMA Network (2004). Excellent credibility.

Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective cohort study enrolling 275 consecutive mechanically ventilated patients admitted to adult medical and coronary ICUs of a US university-based medical center between February 2000 and May 2001. Patients were followed up for development of delirium over 2158 ICU days using the Confusion Assessment. Method for the ICU and the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Main Outcome Measures Primary outcomes included 6-month mortality, overall hospital length of stay, and length of stay in the post-ICU period. Secondary outcomes were ventilator-free days and cognitive impairment at hospital discharge. Results Of 275 patients, 51 had persistent coma and died in the hospital. care professionals surveyed in 2001–2002 reported objectively monitoring for this condition. 19 Indeed, delirium, especially the hypoactive subtype, 20, 21 goes unrecognized in more than two thirds of the patients in clinical practice.
