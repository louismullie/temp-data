## Question

What are the most effective antibiotics for treating methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections in pilonidal cysts?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which antibiotics are most effective for treating MRSA infections in pilonidal cysts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical entity and whether we are dealing with a simple abscess versus chronic pilonidal disease with tracts. Then, I should verify the universal principle that incision and drainage is the cornerstone of therapy. Next, I will examine when antibiotics are actually indicated and when they do not help. After that, I need to check which MRSA-active agents are recommended and how to choose among them based on severity, local resistance, and patient factors. Finally, I will consider duration, the role of cultures, and any special pilonidal-specific nuances that might modify practice, before synthesizing a practical recommendation.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context. Pilonidal disease spans acute abscesses and chronic sinuses with tracts; MRSA is a common pathogen in purulent skin and soft tissue infections, but the management principles still hinge on source control and the presence of systemic features rather than the pathogen alone, so I need to ensure I'm not conflating these categories when recommending antibiotics [^1949fbf9] [^6afaf082].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about antibiotics. I should confirm the universal principle: incision and drainage is the primary therapy for pilonidal abscesses, and antibiotics alone are insufficient for cure; multiple high-quality guidelines emphasize I&D as first-line, with antibiotics reserved for selected scenarios, so I need to anchor on that before discussing drug choices [^b41e25fb] [^1949fbf9] [^9de8b8a0].

> Next, I should review when antibiotics are actually indicated. I need to check for systemic inflammatory response or impaired host defenses, multiple or large abscesses, extremes of age, failure of I&D alone, or concern for deep infection; these are the situations where adding MRSA-active therapy is recommended, whereas uncomplicated, small abscesses in immunocompetent hosts generally do not benefit from antibiotics after adequate drainage [^1949fbf9] [^5af69e03] [^dbdf1c2e].

> Wait, let me verify the MRSA-active options and how to choose among them. For oral therapy, TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin, and linezolid are all reasonable choices depending on local resistance, severity, and comorbidities; for IV therapy, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, and tedizolid are supported, with vancomycin remaining a common first-line IV agent for severe disease; I should also remember that clindamycin inducible resistance varies by locale, so I need to ensure local susceptibility before selecting it [^168387e9] [^4ea7e4b4] [^6afaf082].

> I should double-check duration and the role of cultures. Typical durations for SSTI with MRSA are 7 to 14 days, individualized to clinical response; obtaining cultures is reasonable in recurrent disease, severe infection, immunocompromise, or treatment failure, and in pilonidal disease specifically, recurrent abscesses should prompt a search for local causes and culture-directed therapy when indicated, even though routine culture of every simple abscess is not mandated [^168387e9] [^cb34eea6] [^1949fbf9].

> But wait, what if the patient has chronic pilonidal disease with tracts rather than a simple abscess. I need to ensure I don't overstate antibiotics as curative here; pilonidal guidelines emphasize that antibiotics may be used for infection control but not for curative intent in chronic disease, where definitive management is surgical, so antibiotics are adjuncts at best in that setting and should not replace source control or definitive procedures [^6e4e275b] [^b41e25fb].

> Let me consider special pilonidal nuances. Recurrent pilonidal abscesses are common, and risk factors include obesity, hair burden, and inadequate drainage or debridement; decolonization strategies and hair removal can reduce recurrence, but these are preventive rather than treatment of an acute MRSA infection, so I should separate acute therapy from recurrence prevention when advising on antibiotics [^ed1c2aa6] [^dda30f64] [^cb34eea6].

> I should confirm there is no single "most effective" antibiotic across all scenarios. Effectiveness depends on severity, oral versus IV route, local resistance patterns, and patient-specific factors; thus, a tiered approach is prudent: oral TMP-SMX or doxycycline for mild to moderate disease without systemic features, clindamycin if local susceptibility is favorable, linezolid when oral therapy is needed and alternatives are unsuitable, and IV vancomycin or daptomycin for severe disease or when oral therapy is not feasible; I need to ensure I tailor to the clinical context rather than name a single agent as universally "best" [^168387e9] [^4ea7e4b4] [^6afaf082].

> Putting this together, my practical approach is as follows: drain the abscess first; if there are systemic features, markedly impaired host defenses, multiple or large abscesses, extremes of age, or failure after appropriate I&D, add MRSA-active antibiotics for about 7 to 14 days, choosing among TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin, or linezolid orally based on severity and local susceptibility, or vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, or tedizolid intravenously for severe disease; obtain cultures in recurrent or severe cases to guide therapy and address local risk factors to prevent recurrence, recognizing that antibiotics are not curative for chronic pilonidal disease and that surgical management remains definitive in that scenario [^1949fbf9] [^168387e9] [^6e4e275b] [^cb34eea6].

---

For MRSA-infected pilonidal cysts, **incision and drainage is essential** [^b41e25fb]; antibiotics are adjuncts for systemic illness, immunocompromise, or failure of I&D [^1949fbf9]. Oral options include **TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin, or linezolid** [^168387e9]; IV options include vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or ceftaroline [^168387e9]. Treat for 7–14 days, guided by culture and clinical response [^168387e9] [^4ea7e4b4]. Routine prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for pilonidal surgery [^5e89c70e] [^24a71976].

## Clinical significance of MRSA in pilonidal cysts

MRSA is a common pathogen in pilonidal abscesses, particularly in community settings [^notfound]. It causes **purulent infections with abscess formation**, cellulitis, and systemic symptoms if untreated [^6afaf082]. MRSA colonization and infection increase recurrence risk, making eradication and decolonization important in recurrent cases [^cb34eea6] [^78f897b2].

---

## Indications for antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not routinely required** for uncomplicated pilonidal abscesses after adequate incision and drainage [^1949fbf9] [^9de8b8a0]. Indications for antibiotic therapy include:

- Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) or sepsis [^1949fbf9] [^00342009].
- Immunocompromised patients or significant comorbidities [^1949fbf9] [^60f646c9].
- Failure of incision and drainage alone [^1949fbf9] [^5af69e03].
- Rapidly progressive infection or necrotizing features [^notfound].

---

## Recommended antibiotic regimens

The choice of antibiotic depends on severity, patient factors, and local resistance patterns. The following regimens are **recommended**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended antibiotics** | **Route** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Mild infection (oral therapy) | - Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - Clindamycin <br/> - Linezolid | Oral | 7–14 days [^168387e9] [^4ea7e4b4] |
| Severe infection (IV therapy) | - Vancomycin <br/> - Daptomycin <br/> - Linezolid <br/> - Ceftaroline | IV | 7–14 days [^168387e9] [^4ea7e4b4] |
| Penicillin allergy | - TMP-SMX <br/> - Doxycycline <br/> - Clindamycin <br/> - Linezolid | Oral/IV | 7–14 days [^168387e9] [^4ea7e4b4] |

---

## Role of incision and drainage

Incision and drainage (I&D) is the **cornerstone of treatment** for pilonidal abscesses, including MRSA infections [^b41e25fb]. Adequate drainage of purulent material significantly reduces bacterial load and enhances antibiotic penetration, improving clinical outcomes [^notfound]. Antibiotics alone without drainage are ineffective and may lead to chronic infection and recurrence [^notfound].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

The **typical duration** of antibiotic therapy for MRSA-infected pilonidal cysts is 7–14 days, individualized based on clinical response, severity of infection, and presence of comorbidities [^168387e9] [^4ea7e4b4]. Clinical improvement should be evident within 48–72 hours; if there is no improvement, reassess the need for further drainage, alternative antibiotics, or additional diagnostic evaluation [^notfound].

---

## Adjunctive measures

Adjunctive measures are important to reduce recurrence and promote healing:

- **Hair removal**: Regular shaving or laser epilation of the gluteal cleft reduces recurrence [^dda30f64] [^2cd6cd8f].
- **Wound care**: Proper wound hygiene, dressings, and patient education are essential [^60f646c9].
- **Decolonization**: Nasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine washes may be considered in recurrent cases [^cb34eea6] [^78f897b2].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

MRSA-infected pilonidal cysts have **higher recurrence rates** than non-MRSA infections, particularly if inadequately drained or treated [^notfound]. Recurrence rates after incision and drainage alone range from 15% to 40%, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive management and patient education [^b41e25fb]. Adjunctive antibiotic therapy and hair removal significantly reduce recurrence [^b75b6ca2] [^dda30f64].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize the following:

- **Incision and drainage is essential** for pilonidal abscesses, including MRSA infections [^b41e25fb] [^1949fbf9].
- **Antibiotics are adjunctive**, reserved for specific indications such as systemic illness, immunocompromise, or failure of I&D [^1949fbf9] [^5af69e03].
- **Routine prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended** for pilonidal surgery [^5e89c70e] [^24a71976].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

MRSA-infected pilonidal cysts require a **combination of surgical drainage and targeted antibiotic therapy**. Incision and drainage is the primary treatment, with antibiotics reserved for specific indications. Oral agents such as TMP-SMX, doxycycline, clindamycin, or linezolid are effective for mild infections, while IV vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or ceftaroline are appropriate for severe cases. Adjunctive measures, including hair removal and wound care, are essential to reduce recurrence.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — cutaneous abscess and inflamed epidermoid cyst management emphasizes that aspiration was successful in only 25% of cases overall and < 10% with MRSA infections, and accordingly, this form of treatment is not recommended. Simply covering the surgical site with a dry dressing is usually the easiest and most effective treatment of the wound, and one small study found that packing caused more pain and did not improve healing when compared to just covering the incision site with sterile gauze. The addition of systemic antibiotics to incision and drainage of cutaneous abscesses does not improve cure rates, even in those due to MRSA, but systemic antibiotics should be given to patients with severely impaired host defenses or signs or symptoms of systemic infection; multiple abscesses, extremes of age, and lack of response to incision and drainage alone are additional settings in which systemic antimicrobial therapy should be considered.

RECURRENT ABSCESSES AND PURULENT INFECTIONS

Recurrent abscesses are quite common, with a rate of 7–14% within 2 months of completed therapy.

This condition can relate to local risk factors such as pilonidal cyst or foreign material. A diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa, an inflammatory chronic condition, should be considered in case of painful recurrent abscesses, distributed around the groin, buttocks, breasts and armpits, leaving deep scars and skin tunnels. Other risk factors are intravenous drug administration, incomplete surgical debridement during the first episode, as well as colonization with S. aureus and specific immune disorders (i.e. CGD) as aforementioned.

Antibiotic use in pilonidal disease — perioperative, postoperative, and topical findings are mixed: In a randomized prophylactic trial for excision with primary closure, antibiotics showed no benefit for wound infection (32% vs 36%) or 4‑week healing (69% vs 64%). In a small randomized perioperative study, wound infections at 4 weeks were lower with antibiotics (12% vs 44%), but a comparison of short versus longer perioperative courses showed no difference in healing after excision and primary closure (77% vs 73%). For topical therapy, packing with an absorbable, gentamicin‑impregnated, collagen‑based sponge plus primary closure reported higher wound‑healing rates (86% vs 35%; p < 0.001), yet a systematic review found a nonsignificant trend toward fewer wound infections and no significant influence on wound healing or disease recurrence. Adjunctive use should be considered in the setting of severe cellulitis, underlying immunosuppression, or concomitant systemic illness despite limited evidence in this specific venue.

Simple abscess

Cutaneous abscesses are collections of pus within the dermis and deeper tissues.

To be considered a simple abscess, induration and erythema should be limited only to a defined area of the abscess and should not extend beyond its the borders of the abscess. Additionally, simple abscesses should not have extension into deeper tissues or multiloculated extension.

Epidermoid cysts, often named "sebaceous cysts", are usually due to infection of pilosebaceous gland and are present anywhere in the body lined by squamous epithelium.

Furuncles also named "boils" are superficial infections with suppuration of the hair follicle, usually caused by S. aureus. They extend through the dermis into the subcutaneous tissue, where form a small abscess. Furuncles can occur anywhere on hairy skin. A group of infected hair follicles with pus is named carbuncle. Carbuncles are larger and deeper than furuncles. Furuncles often rupture and drain spontaneously or following treatment with moist heat. Most large furuncles and all carbuncles should be treated with incision and drainage. Excision of carbuncle with primary split-thickness skin grafting is an alternative treatment modality.

A recurrent abscess at a site of previous infection may be caused by local causes such as a pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa, or foreign material. Therefore, it always requires research of a local cause.

Treatment
Incision and drainage
Antibiotic therapy only in selected patients for 5 days. You may extend therapy up to 7–10 days if lack of symptom resolution at 5 days

Incision, evacuation of pus and debris, and probing of the cavity to break up loculations provide effective treatment of cutaneous abscesses. The resultant wound should be left open and lightly packed with roll gage soaked with antiseptic solution.

Antibiotic therapy should be prescribed for abscesses greater than 5 cm, in an area difficult to drain (e.g. face, hand, and genitalia), if there is lack of response to incision and drainage alone, if there are multiple localizations and in patients with immunosuppression.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — purulent skin and soft tissue infections (abscesses, furuncles, carbuncles, inflamed epidermoid cysts) recommendations are as follows: Gram stain and culture of pus from carbuncles and abscesses are recommended, but treatment without these studies is reasonable in typical cases (strong, moderate). Gram stain and culture of pus from inflamed epidermoid cysts are not recommended (strong, moderate). Incision and drainage is the recommended treatment for inflamed epidermoid cysts, carbuncles, abscesses, and large furuncles (strong, high). The decision to administer antibiotics directed against S. aureus as an adjunct to incision and drainage should be based on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) criteria such as temperature ≥ 38°C or < 36°C, tachypnea > 24 breaths per minute, tachycardia > 90 beats per minute, or white blood cell count > 12 000 or < 4000 cells/µL (moderate; Figure 1) (strong, low), and an antibiotic active against MRSA is recommended for patients with carbuncles or abscesses who have markedly impaired host defenses and in patients with SIRS (Figure 1, Table 2) (strong, low).

PREVENTION AND TREATMENT

Management of recurrent SSTIs includes individuation of predisposing conditions and treatment whenever possible. Nonpharmacological interventions include weight and diabetes control, and patient education regarding skin care.

Antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated only for recurring nonpurulent SSTIs (i.e. cellulitis and erysipelas), for patients with more than two episodes of recurrence per year. Prophylaxis targets beta-haemolytic Streptococci and drugs of choice are low dose oral phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V), intramuscular benzathine penicillin every 2–4 weeks, or erythromycin in case of penicillin allergy.

Recently, a Cochrane analysis reviewed the five clinical trials designed to set utility of antibiotic prophylaxis and found a reduction in recurrence by 69% (risk ratio 0.31, 95% CI 0.13–0.72), with an estimated number needed to treat (NNT) of six patients with nonpurulent SSTI to prevent a recurrence.

Duration of prophylaxis is not clearly defined, ranging from 4 to 52 weeks, but usually continued for at least 6 months. Since the protective effect is lost after discontinuation, a personalized approach is suggested, based on frequency of recurrence and persistence of risk factors.

The counterpart of antibiotic prophylaxis is development of antimicrobial resistance, pharmacological side effects and risk of Clostridioides difficile infection. In particular, high rates of macrolide resistance are already described in Europe for Streptococcus spp. and cross resistance between macrolide and clindamycin is largely documented.

With these premises, the suggested approach is to target prophylaxis only for high-risk patients, selected by clinical scores, reducing antibiotics misuse.

In case of recurrent purulent infections and abscesses associated with pilonidal cyst, hidradenitis suppurativa and foreign bodies, surgical debridement and cultures should be performed. After incision and drainage, 7 days of antibiotic course showed higher curative rate and less recurrences than surgery alone, even for noncomplicated abscesses.

Pilonidal disease — nonoperative hair removal states that elimination of hair from the gluteal cleft and surrounding skin, by shaving or laser epilation, may be used for both acute and chronic pilonidal disease in the absence of abscess as a primary or adjunct treatment measure, with the stated Grade of Recommendation: Weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 1C. Shaving or laser epilation can serve as an adjunct treatment in active disease, as the sole agent of therapy, or as a preventative tool in the setting of chronic disease to avoid recurrent flares and abscess formation. In acute pilonidal disease, limited lateral incision and drainage (I&D) or cyst excision combined with surgeon-performed shaving along the intergluteal fold and surrounding region promotes healing and prevents disease recurrence, and shaving should be repeated every 1 to 2 weeks until healing occurs and used in combination with hygiene enforcement.

### IDSA guidelines on the treatment of MRSA infections in… [^4ea7e4b4]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Oral antibiotic options for treating skin and soft-tissue infections in patients with community-associated MRSA include clindamycin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, a tetracycline, and linezolid. Options for treating both β-hemolytic streptococci and community-associated MRSA include clindamycin alone, TMP/SMX or a tetracycline in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, or linezolid alone. Rifampin is not recommended for use as a single agent or adjunctive therapy. Empiric therapy options include intravenous vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, telavancin, or clindamycin. A beta-lactam antibiotic may be considered in hospitalized patients with nonpurulent cellulitis.

MRSA-active therapy may be modified if there is no clinical response. Treatment for seven to 14 days is recommended, but should be individualized to the patient's clinical response. Cultures from abscesses and other purulent infections are recommended in patients who have received antibiotic therapy, those with severe local infection or signs of systemic illness, and those who have not responded adequately to initial treatment. Cultures are also recommended if there is concern of a cluster or outbreak. If the patient has not responded to vancomycin therapy despite adequate debridement and removal of other foci of infection, an alternative agent is recommended. For isolates with a vancomycin minimal inhibitory concentration greater than 2 mcg per mL, an alternative agent should be prescribed.

If reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and daptomycin is present, alternative treatment options include dalfopristin/quinupristin, TMP/SMX, linezolid, or telavancin. These may be given as a single agent or in combination with other antibiotics.

Operative management — acute pilonidal abscess: Patients with an abscess should be treated with incision and drainage (I&D) regardless of whether it is primary or recurrent, with a Grade of Recommendation: Strong recommendation based on moderate‑quality evidence, 1B. For first‑episode abscesses, overall successful healing reaches 60%, but simple I&D carries an estimated 15% to 40% recurrence rate; I&D also appears to have a protective effect on recurrence after surgical excision at 20‑year follow‑up. An unroofing (lay open) and curettage procedure is a 1‑step option that potentially avoids the need for a second procedure, and in a randomized trial curettage achieved greater complete healing at 10 weeks (96% versus 79%).

Population-based data

A major strength of this study is the large number of hospitals participating, generating what the authors refer to as 'real-world data'. Although the data presented in this study are certainly more diverse than those in the average PSD study, it is unclear whether these data are indeed population-based, as some patients in the catchment area of a participating hospital may be treated elsewhere. As outlined, most PSD studies are retrospective and from a single centre, representing an 'in my hands' experience. Randomized trials exist, but population selection bias may be significant.

### Pilonidal disease [^6f6e0bdc]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Pilonidal disease is a disease of young people, usually men, which can result in an abscess, draining sinus tracts, and moderate debility for some. It probably results from hair penetration beneath the skin, for reasons that are not totally clear. Therapy should be simple, inflict minimal pain, have a short hospitalization, have a low recurrence rate, require minimal wound care, and allow rapid return to normal activity. No treatment meets all these ideal goals. Therefore, starting with a simple treatment and progressing to other treatments if failure occurs despite meticulous wound care and hair shaving is the logical approach. Table 1 depicts treatments from simple to more complex.

### Incision and drainage of subcutaneous abscesses without the use of packing [^26148ff0]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

The classic intervention for subcutaneous abscesses is incision and drainage followed by wound packing. This is thought to aid hemostasis, and prevent reorganization of the abscess. Removal of packing material may be painful and anxiety provoking. We sought to determine whether packing could be omitted with equal efficacy.

Methods

One hundred pediatric patients with subcutaneous abscesses were enrolled between May, 2008 and December, 2010. All underwent incision and drainage, then seven days of oral antibiotics and warm soaks. Patients were randomized to the packing group (PG) or non-packing group (NPG). Packing was removed 24h after the procedure. Patients were excluded if: 1) diabetic/immunosuppressed, 2) the abscess was perianal or pilonidal, or 3) the abscess was secondary to a previous operation. Patients were evaluated in clinic if recurrence was suspected during follow-up calls on postoperative days seven and 30.

Results

Eighty-five patients completed the study (43 PG/42 NPG). The two groups were not statistically different with respect to initial parameters, recurrent abscesses (one in each group), or MRSA incidence (81.4% PG/85.7% NPG).

Conclusion

Incision and drainage of subcutaneous abscesses without the use of packing is a safe and effective technique. This approach omits a traditional, but painful and anxiety provoking, component of therapy.

Pilonidal disease — management of acute abscess during definitive excision shows that local excision of the abscess and midline pits allowing secondary-intention healing has not been shown to alter recurrence, hospital stay, or overall healing time, though there was a trend toward increased days off work (14 vs 7 d; p = 0.06). When comparing total excision with secondary intention versus I&D followed by delayed excision and primary closure at 3 weeks, there was no difference in recurrence at 6 months, but at 12 months the primary closure group had significantly higher recurrence (14% vs 0%; p < 0.05), with no difference in wound infection or wound healing rates.

Pilonidal disease — rhomboid or Limberg flap outcomes indicate low recurrence and infection rates but concern for wound dehiscence. Overall results are favorable with respect to disease recurrence (0%–6%) and patient tolerance. Data from several randomized trials found low (0%–6%) overall rates of surgical site infections, but a recent randomized controlled trial shows a very high rate of wound dehiscence associated with this type of flap, and although many of these dehiscences were minor and the majority healed without recurrence, they required ongoing wound care.

### Minimal excision and primary suture is a cost-efficient definitive treatment for pilonidal disease with low morbidity: a population-based interventional and a cross-sectional cohort study [^a70ca6d6]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that the consistent use of the mLM operation for treating pilonidal disease is cost-efficient with low post-operative morbidity and long-term results comparable with more extensive methods, both compared with historical controls and in comparison of the treatment of pilonidal disease between three hospitals. The method also consumes less resources for the health care system and the society. The operation is performed as an outpatient procedure at the office under local anaesthesia with no need for hospital admission or sick leave. Most patients can return to work or school the same day.

In the original method the wounds after the excisions were left open for healing by secondary intention, in accordance with traditional surgical principles not to close an infected cavity. The disadvantage is prolonged time to healing. It also leaves an entrance for contagious material and hairs with risk for recurrent sinus. Bascom, in his similar pit-picking procedure, closed the wounds after the excision of the sinuses in the midline but added a lateral incision for excision of inflamed tissue and drainage, which was left open. This wound may take up to several months to heal.

Our modification consists of suturing the wounds. This will shorten the healing time, stop further contamination and prevent the formation of new sinuses. Although we did not prescribe any antibiotics we did not observe any adverse effects. There was no early abscess formation. Most wounds were healed when the sutures were removed after 10 days, as shown by the few number of post-operative visits.

Our estimated recurrence rate of 32% may seem high but is similar to many others using more extensive methods, although the reported recurrence rate after surgical treatment for pilonidal cyst varies considerably between studies. Possible explanations are differences in definitions and method and length of follow as recurrences may come after many years. We have made an effort to reach all our patients for follow-up, and all patients having symptoms suggesting recurrence were clinically assessed.

### Intrafamilial transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^cce9b90a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

To the Editor: Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infection was first described in our region over 15 years ago. More recently, CA-MRSA has become a global concern and is now a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections in the United States. An association between severe CA-MRSA infection (e.g. necrotizing fasciitis and pneumonia) and the synergohymenotrophic exotoxin Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) has been made. Reports have documented CA-MRSA transmission among household members; however, most cases have been mild or moderate infections or asymptomatic colonization. We describe intrafamilial transmission of a PVL-containing CA-MRSA clone common in Australia (ST30-MRSA-IV) between a nurse who suffered recurrent abscesses and her husband, who died of severe pneumonia.

In July 2006, a 61-year-old previously healthy nurse (Mrs A) sought treatment for an infected seborrheic cyst of the scalp. Culture of pus yielded MRSA that was susceptible to clindamycin. She was treated with oral clindamycin. After resolution of the infection, topical MRSA decolonization therapy with 3% hexachlorophane body wash (daily), 20% cetrimide shampoo (3×/wk), and 2% mupirocin nasal ointment (3×/d) was administered for 10 days, as per our institutional protocol for MRSA-colonized healthcare workers. Subsequently, MRSA surveillance swabs from the nose, throat, and scalp obtained weekly for 10 weeks and cultured on selective MRSA chromogenic agar and in selective broth enrichment media were negative. Household members were not screened for MRSA colonization.

The most important recommendations, supported by both evidence‐ and expertise‐based data, were used to design a decision‐making algorithm (Figure 1).
(i) Hurley stage I or II – use of amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or pristinamycin for 7 days; for preventive treatment or postacute care, co‐trimoxazole or cyclines; for follicular HS ('punched‐out' scars, ice‐pick scars, follicular epidermal cysts, comedones and pilonidal sinus), oral retinoid.
(ii) Hurley stage II or III – ceftriaxone/metronidazole or levofloxacin/clindamycin for 15–21 days. Anti‐tumour necrosis factor (TNF)‐α can be proposed, but should be re‐evaluated within 3–6 months. Specialized, multidisciplinary care (involving a dermatologist and a surgeon, at least) is recommended for severe cases.

A medicosurgical approach is strongly recommended for all patients, either after or in combination with medical steps. Surgery (assisted by ultrasounds, probes, etc.) is considered a curative treatment for specific lesions, but surgeons must fully understand the need to maintain adequate margins, as in skin carcinoma surgery, to achieve remission.

After final proofreading by the Centre of Evidence (O.C. M.B.‐B). the algorithm was published on a dedicated open‐access website to provide a user‐friendly and practical tool featuring fast, step‐by‐step navigation according to clinical situations.

### Experience with pilonidal disease in children [^e4e840d7]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Controversy exists regarding the optimum treatment for pediatric pilonidal disease. It is a complex disease process with a high rate of recurrence. A spectrum of surgical strategies exists, including drainage, cyst marsupialization, complete cyst and sinus tract excision with primary versus secondary closure, and excision utilizing flap closure. There is little published in the pediatric literature; therefore, we reviewed our experience in an attempt to document how various interventions affect the natural history.

Methods

A retrospective review was conducted in which all patients who underwent surgical intervention for pilonidal disease at our institution from January 2000 to June 2010 were identified. Data collection included demographics, surgical procedure performed, presence of wound breakdown, presence of infection, recurrence, total procedures performed, number of follow-up visits, and total hospital days.

Results

In the study period, 120 patients were identified, and 58% were female. Mean age was 14.9 y old (1–19 y). These patients were then subdivided into closed versus open groups based on the status of their operative wound. In the closed group, 74 patients underwent excision with midline closure and 18 underwent excision with flap closure. There were 28 patients left open after excision. In the closed group, wound breakdown occurred in a total of 41 patients (45%). There was no difference in breakdown between midline and flap closure. Postoperative wound infection occurred in 15% of all patients. The midline closure group had a higher infection rate (20%) compared with those with flap closures (11%), which was not significant (P = 0.30). There was no difference in recurrence rate between patients who were primarily closed and patients who were left open (20.6% versus 25%, P = 0.51). There was also no difference in their hospital length of stay (0.44 ± 2.53 d versus 1.18 ± 2.9 d, P = 0.18). Conversely, the patients who were left open had more follow-up visits (6.48 ± 7.6 versus 4.18 ± 3.3, P = 0.02) and subsequently required more operative procedures (1.71 ± 1.12 versus 1.25 ± 0.49, P = 0.002).

Conclusion

Management of pilonidal disease remains a complex problem, and operative intervention is fraught with complications, including wound breakdown, infection, and cyst recurrence. Primary closure appears to have better outcomes compared with healing by secondary intention. There does not appear to be a clear advantage of primary closure utilizing flaps over primary closure based on our early experience with flap closures.

### Management of pilonidal disease and hidradenitis suppurativa [^a04c137d]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Pilonidal disease and hidradenitis suppurativa affect healthy young adults, causing discomfort and pain that leads to loss of work productivity and should be approached in a personalized manner. Patients with pilonidal disease should engage in hair removal to the sacrococcygeal region and surgical options considered. Hidradenitis suppurativa can be a morbid and challenging disease process. Medical management with topical agents, antibiotics, and biologics should be used initially but wide local excision should be considered in severe or refractory cases of the disease.

### Healing by primary versus secondary intention after surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus [^dc9eb8a7]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Pilonidal sinus arises in the hair follicles in the buttock cleft at the bottom of the backbone. The estimated incidence is 26 per 100,000, people, affecting men twice as often as women. The mean age of presentation is 21 years (men) and 19 years (women) respectively. Pilonidal sinus results in chronic discharging wounds that cause pain and impact upon quality of life and social function. These sinuses may become infected and present as acute abscesses. Management of these abscesses is uncontroversial and revolves around incision and drainage, however, the mode of surgical management of the chronic discharging sinus is debatable. Surgical strategies traditionally centre on excision of the sinus tracts followed by primary closure and healing by primary intention or leaving the wound open to heal by secondary intention. There is uncertainty as to whether open or closed surgical management is more effective.

Objectives

To determine the relative effects of open compared with closed surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus on the outcomes of time to healing, infection and recurrence rate.

Search Strategy

We sought relevant trials from the Wounds Group Specialised Register (Searched 13/6/07); The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2007, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE (1950 - May Week 5 200&); Ovid EMBASE (1980–2007 Week 23); Ovid CINAHL (1982 - June Week 2 2007). We checked the bibliographies of review and primary articles for relevant studies and contacted authors of all included studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating open with closed surgical treatment for pilonidal sinus. Exclusion criteria were: non-RCTs; children aged younger than 14 years and studies of pilonidal abscess.

Data Collection and Analysis

Screening of eligible studies, data extraction and methodological quality assessment of trials were conducted independently by two review authors. Data from eligible studies were recorded using data extraction forms and any disagreements were referred to a third review author. Results were presented using mean differences for continuous outcomes and relative risk with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes.

Main Results

Eighteen studies were included (1573 patients). Twelve RCTs compared open healing with primary closure, 10 of which used midline closure and 2 trials used off-midline closure. Six studies compared midline and off-midline closure. Open compared with closed techniques: Evidence suggested more rapid healing after primary closure although there was no difference in the infection rate after wound closure. Recurrence was less likely to occur after open healing (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.26 to 0.66) suggesting a 58% lower risk of recurrence after open wound healing compared with primary closure. Patients returned to work earlier after primary closure (WMD 10.48 days 95% CI 5.75 to 15.21 days). There was no difference between the two groups for other complications and length of stay. There were few useable data on cost, patient satisfaction and pain. Closed midline compared with closed off-midline: there was good evidence of slower healing, higher rates of infection (RR 4.70; 95% CI 1.93 to 11.45), higher rates of recurrence (Peto OR 4.95; 95% CI 2.18 to 11.24) and other complications (RR 8.94; 95% CI 2.10 to 38.02) after midline primary closure compared with off-midline closure techniques.

Authors' Conclusions

No clear benefit was shown for surgical management by primary closure or open healing by secondary intention. A clear benefit was shown for off-midline closure rather than midline closure after pilonidal sinus surgery. Off-midline closure should be the standard management when primary closure is the desired surgical option.

### Conjunctivitis preferred practice pattern [^4a71e34c]. Ophthalmology (2024). High credibility.

Giant fornix syndrome — microbiology, associated lacrimal disease, and treatment strategies are described. Cultures are nearly always positive for Staphylococcus aureus, although other organisms are possible, and many patients have concomitant nasolacrimal duct obstruction and chronic dacryocystitis, which may need to be addressed surgically. Treatment with antibiotic regimens used for routine cases of bacterial conjunctivitis generally result only in temporary improvement, so recommended treatment strategies include the prolonged use of systemic anti-staphylococcal antibiotics and intensive topical antibiotics and corticosteroids. More recently, supratarsal injections of antibiotics and corticosteroids, along with irrigation and sweeping of the superior fornix with povidone-iodine solution, have been advocated. Given the increasing frequency of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in the general population, conjunctival cultures before starting treatment can help guide the appropriate choice of antibiotic, and surgical correction of ptosis may be helpful.

### Recurrence of pilonidal disease: our best is not good enough [^ed1c2aa6]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrence rates of pilonidal disease have been reported to be high as 30%. Patients with recurrent pilonidal disease often develop chronic wounds and draining sinuses that incur long-term morbidity, disability, and decreased quality of life. The aim of this study was to characterize rates of recurrence in patients with pilonidal disease treated by pediatric surgeons.

Methods

A single center retrospective review of patients with pilonidal disease evaluated by pediatric surgeons from 2010 to 2015 was performed. Recurrence of pilonidal disease was defined as an episode of active pilonidal disease that required medical or surgical intervention > 30 days from the preceding treatment. Repeated events proportional hazards regression modeling was performed to identify factors associated with time to recurrence.

Results

Among 307 patients treated for pilonidal disease, nearly 50% were male, and the median age at initial evaluation was 16 years (IQR 15–17). Approximately 45% were obese (BMI ≥ 95th percentile). The initial treatment during the study period was surgical excision in two-thirds and incision and drainage and/or antibiotics in one-third. The overall recurrence rate was 33%, with the majority of recurrences (80%) occurring within the first year. On multivariable analysis, obese BMI was the only factor independently associated with time to disease recurrence.

Conclusions

Pilonidal disease has a substantial recurrence rate even after surgical excision. Future studies investigating treatments that can prevent disease recurrence are needed.

### Efficacy and tolerance of a new gentamicin collagen fleece (septocoll) after surgical treatment of a pilonidal sinus [^a164fdca]. Colorectal Disease (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Pilonidal sinus is common. It causes substantial loss of working hours. The major disadvantage of open wound treatment is the long time required for healing. Primary wound closure is on the other hand often followed by infection. A controlled, multicentre trial was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a new gentamicin collagen fleece (Septocoll) combined with primary closure.

Patients and Methods

One hundred and three patients (88 men, 15 women, median age 30 years) were included. Fifty-one were randomised to gentamicin fleece plus primary closure (Genta Group), and 52 patients to open treatment alone (Open Group).

Results

The median interval to wound healing was 17 days in the Genta group and 68 days in the Open group (P = 0.0001, log-rank test). Two patients in Group 1 developed infection within the first two weeks, requiring reopening of the wound, with primary wound healing occurring in 73%. Failure of primary healing (27%) was usually due to seroma or spontaneous dehiscence which subsequently healed.

Conclusion

The combination of gentamicin collagen fleece (Septocoll) with primary closure resulted in a shorter period to healing than the open technique without unwanted effects.

### Pilonidal cyst involving the clitoris: a case report [^f35c9c20]. Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease (2008). Low credibility.

Background

A periclitoral pilonidal cyst or sinus is an exceedingly infrequent occurrence. Diagnostic criteria consist of a sinus tract or cyst containing hair follicles and inflammatory reaction in one or more partially or completely epithelialized sinus tracts. Follow-up of patients reported in the literature has been too short to provide a consensus in regard to the extent of surgery required to provide permanent cure.

Case

A 30-year-old patient was seen in consultation for evaluation of a chronic, draining periclitoral abscess that had been treated for approximately 2 years with multiple rounds of antibiotics and local incisions. Treatment consisted of a wide local excision of the cyst and multiple sinuses extending into the periclitoral area and labia minora. The shaft and glans of the clitoris were preserved. Primary closure and healing were accomplished.

Conclusion

Diagnosis and curative therapy of a pilonidal cyst of the clitoris require a thorough resection which can be accomplished with preservation of the clitoris.

Strains of community-acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) have emerged as an important group of pathogens. Most infections present as cutaneous abscess and most of these may respond to drainage alone. Sulfonamide and tetracycline antibiotics remain valuable agents for most CA-MRSA infections, but inducible resistance to clindamycin is problematic in some areas. Linezolid, and the newer parenteral antibiotics should be reserved for serious infections.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^adb7b43b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2014 SSTI guideline — impetigo and ecthyma therapy notes that cultures of the vesicle fluid, pus, erosions, or ulcers establish the cause and, unless cultures yield streptococci alone, antimicrobial therapy should be active against both S. aureus and streptococci. Oral penicillinase–resistant penicillin or first-generation cephalosporins are usually effective as most staphylococcal isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are methicillin susceptible, with alternatives for penicillin-allergic patients or infections with MRSA including doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP. When streptococci alone are the cause, penicillin is the drug of choice, with a macrolide or clindamycin as an alternative for penicillin-allergic patients. Topical treatment with mupirocin or retapamulin is as effective as oral antimicrobials for impetigo, and systemic therapy is preferred for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission.

### An international survey exploring the management of pilonidal disease [^14c018d2]. Colorectal Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

Pilonidal disease (PD) is a common debilitating condition frequently seen in surgical practice. Several available treatments carry different benefit/risk balances. The aim of this study was to snapshot the current management of PD across European countries.

Method

Members affiliated to the European Society of Coloproctology were invited to join the survey. An invitation was extended to others via social media. The predictive power of respondents' and hospitals' demographics on the change of therapeutic approach was explored.

Results

Respondents (n = 452) were mostly men (77%), aged 26-60years, practising in both academic and public hospitals and with fair distribution between colorectal (51%) and general (48%) surgeons. A total of 331 (73%) respondents recommended surgery at first presentation of the disease. Up to 80% of them recommended antibiotic therapy and 95% did not use any classification of PD. A primary closure technique was the preferred procedure (29%), followed by open technique (22%), flap creation (7%), sinusectomy (7%) and marsupialization (7%). Approximately 27% of subjects would choose the same surgical technique even after a failure. Almost half (46%) perform surgery as office based. A conservative approach was negatively associated with acutely presenting PD (p < 0.001). Respondents who were not considering tailored surgery based on patient presentation tended to change their approach in the case of a failed procedure.

Conclusion

With the caveat of a heterogeneous number of respondents across countries, the results of our snapshot survey may inform the development of future guidelines.

### Decision regret following surgical management of pilonidal disease [^cb51d3ad]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Despite significant rates of postoperative complications, treatment failure and protracted recovery after pilonidal sinus surgery, shared decision‐making appears to be carried out very well in the UK and decision regret among patients undergoing surgery for PSD is low. Nevertheless, it is likely that patients are not always offered the full remit of available treatment options.

### A retrospective chart review of inflamed epidermal inclusion cysts [^aeb690a0]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Epidermal inclusion cysts (EIC) are one of the most common forms of cysts found on and/or underneath the skin. Inflamed EICs typically show signs and symptoms such as pain and erythema, mimicking cutaneous abscess. However, prior studies have demonstrated at least 20% of lesions are culture negative.

Objective

To determine the rate of culture positivity in mild inflamed epidermal inclusion cysts, in particular to identify whether empiric antibiotics are warranted.

Methods

In a retrospective chart review 76 cases of inflamed EIC that were mild (lacking systemic symptoms) were analyzed who presented to the department of dermatology at Mount Sinai between 2016&ndash;2019.

Results

Of cultures taken from inflamed cysts, 47% resulted in no bacterial growth or growth of normal flora, 38.4% resulted in growth of aerobic bacteria with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (8%), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (5%), and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (13%) predominating, and 9.3% resulting in growth of anaerobic bacteria with Finegoldia magna, Peptostreptococcus, and Cutibacterium acnes presenting. Review of prescribed treatment regimens often involved antibiotic medication, despite a high prevalence of negative culture.

Conclusions

Almost half of cases of mild inflamed EIC (lacking systemic symptoms) cultured will not grow pathogenic bacteria, therefore incision and drainage with culture and appropriate therapy is a viable therapeutic option in uncomplicated inflamed EIC lesions. In this way, over prescription of antibiotics can be minimized. J Drugs Dermatol. 2021;20(2):199–202. doi:10.36849/JDD.5014.

This study aimed to report patient and risk-adjusted outcomes. For the evaluation of treatment strategies, follow-up at 6 months after surgery must be considered short, representing an early outcome. The 45% complication rate aside, 20% of treatments resulted in failure within the first 6 months. Furthermore, with 25% of patients presenting with prolonged healing, more are certainly to come with a longer observation period. The authors have done readers the rare favour of defining what constitutes a failure in this study, and, although this definition may be broader than the traditionally reported 'PSD recurrence after full healing', the failure rate is still much higher than in existing literature. A meta-analysis conducted by Stauffer et al. encompassing nearly 90 000 patients with PSD from the global literature (including both RCTs and non-RCTs), revealed a 2% recurrence rate per year of follow-up, for comparison.

### Excision and primary closure using the karydakis flap for the treatment of pilonidal disease: outcomes from a single institution [^c4e186ce]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic pilonidal disease is a debilitating condition that typically affects young adults. There is a wide variety of available therapeutic strategies reflecting the inconsistent outcomes attributed to the various operative approaches. The majority involve excision of the sinus tract followed by either primary closure or healing by secondary intention. A variety of closure approaches exist. There remains uncertainty as to which is more effective. The aim of the current study was to determine subjective and objective outcomes following excision and Karydakis flap closure in a unit where this technique is the standard of care in the management of chronic pilonidal disease.

Methods

This study involving consecutive patients with chronic pilonidal disease was conducted over a 4-year period. A tailored patient satisfaction questionnaire was given to each patient. Postoperative primary and secondary outcomes were evaluated. The mean follow-up time was 30 months.

Results

One hundred six consecutive patients (33 female, 73 male) underwent excision and primary closure using the Karydakis flap. Ninety-two completed questionnaires were returned (87% response rate). Patients consulted their general practitioner 2.8 times (mean) and 46% received empirical oral antimicrobial therapy prior to referral for a surgical opinion. The mean time lost to work/school following the Karydakis flap repair was 13 days (range 3–33). Successful treatment was achieved in 96.3% of cases and 92% of patients were satisfied with their operative result.

Conclusion

Excision and primary closure with Karydakis flap is an effective treatment for chronic pilonidal disease. It is associated with low morbidity, early return to premorbid functioning, and a high degree of patient satisfaction (92%).

Pilonidal disease and hidradenitis suppurativa are common problems that affect young adults. The surgical management of pilonidal disease should be tailored to the individual clinical presentation and its goal is the resolution of pilonidal disease with low recurrence and low morbidity. The clinical course of hidradenitis suppurativa is characterized by chronicity with frequent flare-ups followed by quiescent periods. Treatment for both conditions needs to be individualized to the clinical presentation.

Case volume

It is striking that, across the 31 inclusion sites, 1213 patients with PSD had the patient information sheet issued over a 3-year interval. This means that each site on average saw 13 potentially eligible patients with PSD annually. Even during the COVID pandemic, this must be considered a very low annual caseload. Furthermore, most departments may have several surgeons treating PSD or even no specific surgeon at all, leaving very few cases per year per surgeon.

Pilonidal disease — hair removal and laser epilation — shaving can be used around wound healing with timing and frequency qualified, and laser epilation shows low recurrence but lacks sufficient evidence for a general recommendation. Surgeon-performed hair shaving every 1 to 2 weeks until healing and subsequent patient-performed shaving after healing have been reported as beneficial, but patient-performed shaving in the immediate postoperative period has been associated with increased pilonidal recurrence; given uncertainty in optimal frequency, we suggest at least weekly. As an adjunct to surgical treatment, laser epilation has resulted in minimal (≤ 13%) recurrence, and as a primary treatment has achieved durable healing in 44% to 100% of patients, yet current evidence is insufficient to provide a general recommendation for this technique.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^168387e9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient's clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### Minimal excision and primary suture is a cost-efficient definitive treatment for pilonidal disease with low morbidity: a population-based interventional and a cross-sectional cohort study [^49a0b3f3]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

Jönköping county, population 336,866 inhabitants in 2010, has three health care districts [Jönköping (A), Höglandet (B) and Värnamo (C) health districts]. Each district is served by one hospital, some healthcare centres and a few private health care providers. All patient contacts for these providers, including contact with nurses, are registered in the county's electronic administrative database with an ICD10 code for the diagnosis and an eventual intervention. From this database we identified all health care contacts with an ICD10 code L05* from January 2003 till December 2014. Patients treated surgically were identified by the intervention code QBG20 or QBE10. Surgical treatment for pilonidal disease is only performed at the three hospitals.

Pre-intervention cohort using conventional wide excision

Information about patients with a primary operation for pilonidal disease at hospital A from January 2003 till February 2008 was obtained from the administrative database and a review of the patients' files. Information on surgical method, choice of anaesthetics, number of visits pre- and post-operatively, length of stay, sick leave after the primary intervention, date of eventual recurrence and of surgical treatment for recurrence was collected. The patient files has high quality as most of them are included in a previously published prospective randomised trial of placing a gentamicin–collagen sponge in the wound to reduce the rate of wound infection and recurrences.

The traditional treatment at hospital A was wide excision of the sinus, the cavity and all tracts through a wide symmetric excision with diathermy under general anaesthesia. Methylene blue was used to search for tracts. The wound was closed in one layer in the midline. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment was not given. Some surgeons used a more limited excision of the cavity and lateral tract sparing as much skin as possible. Two patients were operated with the Karydakis method. Most patients were admitted for one night stay in hospital. Recurrences after the wide excisions were treated with repeat wide excision and healing by secondary intention or flap techniques.

We made a long-term follow-up of all patients from this period by a postal questionnaire in August 2011. Those not responding to the questionnaire were contacted by telephone. Patients with symptoms suggesting recurrence were invited for re-examination and reoperation if needed. Patients were considered to have recurrent disease if they had required reoperation or reported symptoms of local pain, intermittent swelling or purulent discharge at the follow-up.

### Real-world practice and outcomes in pilonidal surgery: pilonidal sinus treatment studying the options (PITSTOP) cohort [^d0325caa]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

A significant proportion of patients took a long time to heal. One-quarter of patients had not healed or had persistent disease at 6 months. Furthermore, around 10% of patients in this study had not resumed normal activities by 6 months, and around 20% reported treatment failure. This is in contrast to many other, mainly single-centre, studies, which reported extremely low treatment failure rates.

Confusion arises around the definition of recurrence. Although this could be considered as wound healing with disease then re-arising, studies often include disease that never heals after surgery. True recurrence is probably uncommon and requires a protracted length of time to detect precisely. It was not possible to evaluate this outcome within the limitations of the present study design and funding envelope. The definition used here included a composite of patient-reported recurrence and/or evidence of further intervention at least 6 months after surgery.

This work has limitations. Data were available for analysis for just 71.5% of patients at 6 months despite dedicated central research follow-up support. Recruitment and follow-up intervals crossed multiple COVID-19 waves, which doubtless had an impact, enhancing difficulties in retaining the demographic of the study as discussed above. Other limitations include heterogeneity related to the range of treatments: 12 in total. The small numbers of some procedures made analysis of individual interventions statistically unsound. To address this issue, interventions were categorized into two groups with similar underlying surgical principles; minimally invasive procedures focus on destruction/removal of the pit/underlying cavity, whereas major excisional procedures remove the disease and surrounding skin with or without closure of the remaining wound. This broad categorization may be criticized, particularly for the major excisional group, where excision and leave open or closure in the midline techniques may result in inferior outcomes compared with asymmetric closure techniques. However, meaningful statistical analysis was possible for the asymmetric group, and similar differences were observed.

### The management of pilonidal disease: a systematic review [^c8f91e4f]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The goal of this systematic review by the American Pediatric Surgical Association Outcomes and Evidence-Based Practice Committee was to derive recommendations from the medical literature regarding the management of pilonidal disease.

Methods

The PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus databases from 1965 through June 2017 were queried for any papers addressing operative or non-operative management of pilonidal disease. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Consensus recommendations were derived for three questions based on the best available evidence, and a clinical practice guideline was constructed.

Results

A total of 193 articles were fully analyzed. Some non-operative and minimally invasive techniques have outcomes at least equivalent to operative management. Minimal surgical procedures (Gips procedure, sinusectomy) may be more appropriate as first-line treatment than radical excision due to faster recovery and patient preference, with acceptable recurrence rates. Excision with midline closure should be avoided. For recurrent or persistent disease, any type of flap repair is acceptable and preferred by patients over healing by secondary intention. There is a lack of literature dedicated to the pediatric patient.

Conclusions

There is a definitive trend towards less invasive procedures for the treatment of pilonidal disease, with equivalent or better outcomes compared with classic excision. Midline closure should no longer be the standard surgical approach.

Type Of Study

Systematic review of level 1–4 studies.

Level Of Evidence

Level 1–4 (mainly level 3–4).

### Decision regret following surgical management of pilonidal disease [^e0824a39]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Pilonidal disease (PD) is a common clinical condition affecting around 26 per 100,000 people; the highest incidence is reported in young men patients of working age, in whom up to 8.8% are affected. In clinical practice, the presentation of PD can vary greatly. It most commonly affects the sacrococcygeal area and is characterized by ingrowing or implanted hairs in the natal cleft. The extent of the disease varies between individuals; consequently, disease patterns range from simple sinuses with minimal pain and discharge to complex abscess cavities and acute infection. The disease can have a significant impact on the personal, social and economic activities of affected individuals.

There is currently no clear evidence for the optimal surgical management of chronic PD, and this is reflected in the wide variety of practice reported among UK surgeons. In the elective setting, procedures often involve excision of the sinus with or without primary closure. This approach leaves patient with large wounds, resulting in prolonged healing times and significant disruption to work and social life. Minimally invasive procedures, such as phenol injection or fistuloscopy/diathermy, are increasingly being used for minimally symptomatic PD. However, uptake of minimally invasive procedures has not been universal and there are some concerns surrounding higher recurrence rates with these techniques. As PD is most commonly a disease of young, healthy and economically active individuals, it is important that treatment options are associated with fast healing times and minimal complications to reduce the personal and economic burden of this disease.

Surgical decision making is a complex process involving both patient and surgeon; it requires careful discussion of the risk and benefits of potential procedures and treatment options, which in the context of PD can be particularly challenging. The optimum treatment for PD, namely one that is both easy to perform and results in rapid healing with minimal complications, is not clear. Current evidence for the management of PD is inadequate as it is largely based on case series or nonrandomized comparative trials; moreover, where randomized control trials have been carried out, over 90% are single‐centre studies, limiting the generalizability of the results. Consequently, clinicians may advocate for procedures that have a limited evidence basis and patients may not be informed of the range of treatment options available for PD. Several studies have demonstrated that shared decision making improves patient satisfaction and reduces decision regret; however, little work has been carried out on shared decision making in the context of PD.

Liver cyst infection in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease — management is as follows: Start antibiotic treatment, then within < 48 hours after initiation of antibiotics percutaneous drainage of infected liver cysts may be reasonable when there is isolation of pathogens that are unresponsive to antibiotic therapy from a cyst aspirate, immunocompromise, large infected hepatic cysts (> 8 cm), or hemodynamic instability and/or signs of sepsis; in the case of deep cysts for which percutaneous drainage is not feasible, surgical drainage may be necessary. If initial risk factors are absent, perform evaluation of response to antibiotics at 48–72 hours; a clinical response to antibiotics is expected within 48–72 hours and can be monitored with clinical parameters in combination with laboratory evaluations (i.e. CRP and leukocyte count). If Temperature < 38.0°C or 100.4°F /decrease in CRP, continue antibiotics for ≥ 4 weeks. If Persistent temperature ≥ 38.0°C or 100.4°F /stabilization or increase in CRP, assess Percutaneous cyst drainage possible?; if yes, Percutaneous drainage, and if no, Surgical drainage. Infected liver cysts that do not respond to 48–72 hours of antibiotic treatment should be evaluated further, and placement of a percutaneous drain should be considered for failure to improve, worsening symptoms, or presence of the risk factors listed, and the drain should be kept in place until drainage stops.

### Recommended treatments for community-acquired MRSA infections… [^552f8e4e]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

S. aureus treatments such as antistaphylococcal penicillins and cephalosporins, U. S. physicians have prescribed a variety of other antibiotics to treat these infections *. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is the agent most commonly used to treat adults with community-acquired MRSA infections in the United States. In vitro evidence suggests TMP/SMX has greater bactericidal activity against community-acquired MRSA than linezolid, rifampin, clindamycin, or minocycline. Rifampin has excellent in vitro activity against community-acquired MRSA, but it cannot be used by itself because of rapid development of resistance, which can occur during active treatment. Combining rifampin with TMP/SMX, or fusidic acid where available, may be more effective than using either agent alone.

Linezolid is the only oral agent with demonstrated effectiveness against MRSA in controlled trials, but its use has been restricted because it is expensive. Parenteral therapy is available for serious community-acquired MRSA infections. Vancomycin remains the first choice for MRSA therapy. There have been reports of resistance to vancomycin through a heteroresistance mechanism, but this is not easily identified with clinical microbiology testing and requires special detection techniques. Although daptomycin has not been widely studied for treatment of community-acquired MRSA, it has recently been approved for treating bacteremia and right-sided endocarditis caused by. Linezolid has been demonstrated to be effective in MRSA infections in clinical controlled trials. It may be especially useful in serious skin and soft-tissue infections, such as necrotizing fasciitis, because of its ability to inhibit toxin production.

However, a reasonable alternative would be to use vancomycin with clindamycin for this purpose. Although linezolid may prove useful for community-acquired MRSA-associated pneumonia, there are no studies examining this to date. Tigecycline has been shown to be noninferior to vancomycin for serious MRSA infections, but the number of patients studied to date has been relatively small.

Surgical technique

Carbocaine (2%) with 1 mL of bicarbonate is injected for local anaesthesia (mean volume 8, range 5–15 ml). Mild sedation (Hypnovel ® intravenous [i.v.] 5 mg, Roche) or deep sedation (Propofol i.v. 20 mg, B. Braun) or no sedation at all is given by the anaesthetist, according to the individual PD and to the patient's compliance and personal wishes. Occasionally, i.v. pain relief is also given intra‐operatively (Fentanest ® 100 μg, Pfizer). All subjects are operated in the prone position and, after complete shaving, the buttocks are thoroughly examined with the help of a surgical probe and palpated, to look for further cyst(s) and sinus track(s), sometimes only detected under stretching (what we call the 'violin string' effect). Biopsy punches (Kai Medical, Japan) are used with a calibre of 3.0, 3.5, 4, 5, 6 or 8 mm, according to the size of the pit(s) and the extent of the disease. Often, two different sizes are used in the same patient, employing the larger calibres for lateral disease and approach and the smaller calibres for PD in the natal cleft. Coring out is first performed by the biopsy punch, possibly under guidance of the surgical probe (Figures 1 and 2). Following this, a small blade scalpel (size < 15), small scissors, Kocher's forceps, a Volkmann spoon and a disposable dermal curette (Kai Medical) are used to thoroughly remove any remaining debris, residual fibrosclerotic tissue and abscess walls, possibly staying 'out of the ditch' and therefore as lateral as possible [3]. At the end, after generous washing out with normal saline, the small central wounds are sutured with loosely applied Vicryl ® Rapide 3/0 or 2/0 (Ethicon) stitches, while the lateral wounds are left open for drainage. The cyst(s) and debris are sent to the pathologist for microscopic evaluation (Figure 3). Openings larger than 8 mm (maximum calibre of disposable biopsy punches) are handled by enlarging the wound by means of a size 15 mm scalpel, removing only the necessary diseased tissue. If the PD does not present any lateral involvement but only midline pits, these are first treated and removed by means of biopsy punches of the smallest size to achieve removal, and the resulting small central wounds are sutured, again with loosely applied Vicryl ® Rapide 3/0 or 2/0 (Ethicon). Large calibre (e.g. 8 or 6 mm) biopsy punches are employed, hence creating lateral wound(s) on one or both sides, to perform optimal debridement of diseased tissue from the lateral aspect towards the midline ('stay out of the ditch') and to favour postoperative wound irrigation and drainage of fluid collections towards the outside.

Staphylococcal shunt infections (including MRSA) — agent selection, alternatives by MIC, and penetration data are as follows: Vancomycin should be used if infection is caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). If MRSA strains have a vancomycin MIC of ≥ 1 μg/mL, linezolid, daptomycin, or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole should be considered; if the organism is methicillin susceptible, therapy should be changed to either nafcillin or oxacillin, and addition of rifampin to an antistaphylococcal agent may augment treatment. Daptomycin has been used with rifampin, and in one study a single dose of daptomycin (10 mg/kg) led to an overall CSF penetration of 0.8%, which when corrected for protein binding was 11.5%; linezolid has been successfully used but is not considered first-line therapy for this infection.

### Current treatment options for community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection [^4bc14f4f]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

During the past decade, there has been a marked increase in the prevalence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection in the United States and elsewhere. The most common such infections are those involving the skin and skin structures. Although a number of these lesions (including small furuncles and abscesses) respond well to surgical incision and drainage, oral antimicrobial agents are commonly used to treat these infections in outpatients. Unfortunately, with the exception of linezolid, none of the agents presently being used in this fashion has been subjected to rigorous clinical trial. Thus, current therapy is based largely on anecdotal evidence. For more-serious infections requiring hospitalization, parenteral antimicrobials such as vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline are presently available and have demonstrated effectiveness in randomized, prospective, double-blind trials.

Treatment of Skin Infections

Bacterial Infections

Effective management of recurrent skin infections involves identifying and treating the underlying microbiologic agent, and implementing infection prevention measures. If left untreated, skin infections can become systemic and lead to life-threatening complications.

Topical and systemic antibiotics may be necessary to treat bacterial infections. However, antibiotics should only be used in clinically affected AD, as indiscriminate use increases the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant strains, which poses a therapeutic challenge. Choice of treatment depends on local patterns of antibacterial resistance, particularly the prevalence of MRSA. Culture of the causative pathogen is recommended to guide therapy, but empiric therapy is reasonable in uncomplicated cases or before culture results become available.

Table 2 summarises the guideline-recommended antibacterial options for empiric treatment of skin infections and when they are indicated. Topical antibacterial agents can be used for the treatment of localised skin infections and decolonisation. For uncomplicated, non-purulent skin infections, preferred empiric antibacterial treatments are usually oral β-lactam antibiotics, such as a penicillin or cephalosporin. In patients with AD and a skin abscess, oral antibiotics such as clindamycin, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or linezolid can be considered. Infections occurring in countries/regions with a high prevalence of MRSA require treatment with agents that are active against MRSA (e.g. trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, clindamycin, tetracyclines [doxycycline or minocycline], vancomycin or linezolid) and complicated infections may require agents active against Gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens (e.g. piperacillin-tazobactam). MRSA-associated AD flares are difficult to treat with TCS because of corticosteroid resistance induced by staphylococcal superantigens. In such a situation, prolonged use of corticosteroids may lead to skin atrophy and adrenal insufficiency, so alternative AD therapy should be considered.

ADPKD liver cyst infection — empiric targets and urgency: Empirical antibiotic treatment of liver cyst infections should target gram-negative bacteria in the Enterobacteriaceae family, because liver cyst infections are caused most frequently by gram-negative bacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae family originating from the gastrointestinal system, with Escherichia coli the most frequent isolate; given the risk of sepsis and death, antibiotics should be administered as soon as possible after diagnosis.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin sulfate cream USP, 0.1%) [^a8c60ae3]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Primary skin infections: Impetigo contagiosa, superficial folliculitis, ecthyma, furunculosis, sycosis barbae, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Secondary skin infections: Infectious eczematoid dermatitis, pustular acne, pustular psoriasis, infected seborrheic dermatitis, infected contact dermatitis (including poison ivy), infected excoriations, and bacterial super-infections of fungal or viral infections. Please Note: Gentamicin Sulfate is a bactericidal agent that is not effective against viruses or fungi in skin infections. Gentamicin Sulfate is useful in the treatment of infected skin cysts and certain other skin abscesses when preceded by incision and drainage to permit adequate contact between the antibiotic and the infecting bacteria. Good results have been obtained in the treatment of infected stasis and other skin ulcers, infected superficial burns, paronychia, infected insect bites and stings, infected lacerations and abrasions, and wounds from minor surgery. Patients sensitive to neomycin can be treated with Gentamicin Sulfate, although regular observation of patients sensitive to topical antibiotics is advisable when such patients are treated with any topical antibiotic. Gentamicin Sulfate Cream is recommended for wet, oozing primary infections, and greasy, secondary infections, such as pustular acne or infected seborrheic dermatitis. If a water-washable preparation is desired, the cream is preferable. Gentamicin Sulfate Cream has been used successfully in infants over one year of age, as well as in adults and children.

### Interventions for the eradication of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in people with cystic fibrosis [^db496eee]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cystic fibrosis is an inherited recessive disorder of chloride transport that is characterised by recurrent and persistent pulmonary infections from resistant organisms that result in lung function deterioration and early mortality in sufferers. Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged not only as an important infection in people who are hospitalised, but also as a potentially harmful pathogen in cystic fibrosis. Chronic pulmonary infection with MRSA is thought to confer on people with cystic fibrosis a worse clinical outcome and result in an increased rate of lung function decline. Clear guidance for MRSA eradication in cystic fibrosis, supported by robust evidence, is urgently needed. This is an update of a previous review.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of treatment regimens designed to eradicate MRSA and to determine whether the eradication of MRSA confers better clinical and microbiological outcomes for people with cystic fibrosis. To ascertain whether attempts at eradicating MRSA can lead to increased acquisition of other resistant organisms (including Pseudomonas aeruginosa), increased adverse effects from drugs, or both.

Search Methods

We identified randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials by searching the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders (CFGD) Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register, PubMed, MEDLINE and three clinical trials registries; by handsearching article reference lists; and through contact with experts in the field. We last searched the CFGD Group's Cystic Fibrosis Trials Register on 4 October 2021, and the ongoing trials registries on 31 January 2022.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of any combinations of topical, inhaled, oral or intravenous antimicrobials primarily aimed at eradicating MRSA compared with placebo, standard treatment or no treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane and used the GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence.

Main Results

The review includes three RCTs with 135 participants with MRSA infection. Two trials compared active treatment versus observation only and one trial compared active treatment with placebo. Active treatment versus observation In both trials (106 participants), active treatment consisted of oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin. One trial administered this combination for two weeks alongside nasal, skin and oral decontamination and a three-week environmental decontamination, while the second trial administered this drug combination for 21 days with five days intranasal mupirocin. Both trials reported successful eradication of MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis, but they used different definitions of eradication. One trial (45 participants) defined MRSA eradication as negative MRSA respiratory cultures at day 28, and reported that oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin may lead to a higher proportion of negative cultures compared to control (odds ratio (OR) 12.6 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.84 to 55.84; low-certainty evidence). However, by day 168 of follow-up, there was no difference between groups in the proportion of participants who remained MRSA-negative (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.31 to 4.42; low-certainty evidence). The second trial defined successful eradication as the absence of MRSA following treatment in at least three cultures over a period of six months. We are uncertain if the intervention led to results favouring the treatment group as the certainty of the evidence was very low (OR 2.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 11.75). There were no differences between groups in the remaining outcomes for this comparison: quality of life, frequency of exacerbations or adverse effects (all low-certainty evidence) or the change from baseline in lung function or weight (both very low-certainty evidence). The time until next positive MRSA isolate was not reported. The included trials found no differences between groups in terms of nasal colonisation with MRSA. While not a specific outcome of this review, investigators from one study reported that the rate of hospitalisation from screening through day 168 was lower with oral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined with rifampicin compared to control (rate ratio 0.22, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.72; P = 0.01). Nebulised vancomycin with oral antibiotics versus nebulised placebo with oral antibiotics The third trial (29 participants) defined eradication as a negative respiratory sample for MRSA at one month following completion of treatment. No differences were reported in MRSA eradication between treatment arms (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.39; low-certainty evidence). No differences between groups were seen in lung function or adverse effects (low-certainty evidence), in quality of life (very low-certainty evidence) or nasal colonisation with MRSA. The trial did not report on the change in weight or frequency of exacerbations. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Early eradication of MRSA is possible in people with cystic fibrosis, with one trial demonstrating superiority of active MRSA treatment compared with observation only in terms of the proportion of MRSA-negative respiratory cultures at day 28. However, follow-up at three or six months showed no difference between treatment and control in the proportion of participants remaining MRSA-negative. Moreover, the longer-term clinical consequences - in terms of lung function, mortality and cost of care - remain unclear. Using GRADE methodology, we judged the certainty of the evidence provided by this review to be very low to low, due to potential biases from the open-label design, high rates of attrition and small sample sizes. Based on the available evidence, we believe that whilst early eradication of respiratory MRSA in people with cystic fibrosis is possible, there is not currently enough evidence regarding the clinical outcomes of eradication to support the use of the interventions studied.

### Antibiotics after incision and drainage for uncomplicated skin abscesses: a clinical practice guideline [^9de8b8a0]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Identifying the infecting pathogen may not be necessary for treating uncomplicated skin abscesses, but cultures can provide helpful information in patients with recurrent abscesses or systemic illness. The most common pathogens are Staphylococcus aureus, most often methicillin-resistant (MRSA), and several other bacteria, most originating from the skin flora.MRSA accounts for a substantial number of visits by patients with skin and soft tissue infections.

Table 1 summarises current management guidelines, which do not recommend antibiotics for uncomplicated skin abscesses.

Table 1
Current recommendations for antibiotics in patients with skin abscesses*

IDSA = Infectious Diseases Society of America; EBM = Evidence-Based Medicine; NHG = Nederlands Huisartsen Genootschap; ESCMID = European Society for Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

How the recommendation was created

The scope of the recommendation and the outcomes important to patients were defined by an international guideline panel consisting of two adults with lived experience of skin abscesses, one adult with lived experience as a carer for a child with skin abscess, five general practitioners, three paediatric or adult infectious disease physicians, four general internists, a general paediatrician, a dermatologist, and several health research methodologists. They requested a systematic review on the benefits and harms of different antibiotics to inform the recommendation. The panel then met online to discuss the evidence and to formulate specific recommendations. As with all BMJ Rapid Recommendations, no panel member had financial conflicts of interest; intellectual and professional conflicts were minimised and managed (see appendix 1 on bmj.com).

The panel followed the BMJ Rapid Recommendations procedures for creating a trustworthy recommendation, including using the GRADE approach to critically appraise the evidence and to move from evidence to recommendations (appendix 2 on bmj.com). The panel initially identified patient-important outcomes and subgroup hypotheses needed to inform the recommendation. When creating the recommendation, the panel considered the balance of benefits, harms, costs, burdens of the treatments, the quality of evidence for each outcome, typical patient values and preferences and their expected variations, as well as acceptability. Recommendations can be strong or weak, for or against a course of action. The recommendations take a patient-centred perspective which de-emphasises public health, societal, and health payer point of view.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^fdbaa7d4]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) — management of infected liver cysts: Empirical antibiotic treatment of liver cyst infections should target gram-negative bacteria in the Enterobacteriaceae family and should be initiated with a third-generation intravenous (i.v.) cephalosporin with or without a fluoroquinolone; after clinical stabilization, i.v. therapy can be switched to an oral fluoroquinolone, with adjustment according to culture results when available. Duration of antibiotic therapy should be ≥ 4 weeks for liver cyst infection. Percutaneous drainage of infected liver cysts < 48 hours after initiation of antibiotics may be reasonable when there is isolation of pathogens that are unresponsive to antibiotic therapy from a cyst aspirate, immunocompromise in the patient, large infected hepatic cysts (> 8 cm), or hemodynamic instability and/or signs of sepsis. Infected liver cysts that do not respond to 48–72 hours of antibiotic treatment should be evaluated further, placement of a percutaneous drain should be considered for failure to improve, worsening symptoms, or presence of the risk factors listed, the drain should be kept in place until drainage stops, and in the case of deep cysts for which percutaneous drainage is not feasible, surgical drainage may be necessary.

### Surgical treatment of complicated pilonidal disease: limited separate elliptical excision with primary closure [^a81609a8]. Colorectal Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

We aimed at treating complicated pilonidal sinus (PS) patients by a simple and effective surgical procedure.

Method

Between 2000 and 2004, 24 selected complicated PS patients were treated with 'limited separate elliptical excision and primary closure'. Patients with extensive or bilateral gluteal involvement, having more lateral, caudal or cephalic sinuses, multiple recurrences and unhealed chronic wounds after pilonidal surgery were included. Asymmetric excision and primary closure was performed to main diseased tissue in the midline. Additionally, small separate elliptical excisions with primary closure were performed in other involved tissues. The fistula tract or granulation tissue were excised subcutaneously if present. All patients were operated under local anaesthesia. The fascial attachments between the skin and coccyx were released at the deep point in the midline and at one side of wound. Suction drains and prophylactic antibiotics were used; subcutaneous tissues were closed with running polyglactin sutures and skin with polypropylene subcutaneously.

Results

The mean age of patients was 28.4 years (range 18–38). The mean follow-up time was 2.8 years. One recurrence, one seroma, one wound infection and one wound breakdown were recorded. Healing was always by first intention except in patients with wound infection and breakdown.

Conclusion

Most of the complicated PS patients can be operated with acceptable rates of recurrences and complications by using 'limited separate elliptical excisions with primary closure'.

### Decision regret following surgical management of pilonidal disease [^f2e3b4ea]. Colorectal Disease (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

From the 31 UK sites, 729 patients consented to be part of the cohort study. Participants were excluded from the analyses if they did not undergo a relevant procedure during the study (n = 45), if they were ineligible because of an incorrect diagnosis (n = 7) or if there was not enough information provided to categorize their procedure (n = 10). Six hundred and sixty‐seven participants were included in the cohort analysed, with follow‐up data at 6 months being available for 476 (71%). Seventy‐three per cent of participants were male, with an average age of 29 years.

Operative outcomes

The breakdown of procedures performed have been published previously and are detailed in Table 1. In short, 60% of patients received a major skin excisional procedure, most commonly asymmetric closure (40.8%), 15.1% had recurrent disease (IPS type 4). Participants with recurrent disease (defined as reporting any previous procedure excluding acute drainage) were more likely to undergo asymmetric closure than participants who did not have recurrent disease; by contrast, participants who did not have recurrent disease were more likely to recieve a minimally invasive procedure than participants with recurrent disease. Over half (56.0%) of participants with IPS type 1 underwent a minimally invasive procedure, whereas over half (53.4%) of participants with IPS type 4 underwent asymmetric closure.

Nearly half of participants experienced a complication during follow‐up (n = 301, 45.1%). Infection (26.2%, 175/667) and discharge (17.8%, 119/667) were the complications most commonly reported across all treatment approaches. Minimally invasive surgery resulted in a lower risk of complications [34.8% (94/270) vs. 52.1% (207/397)] and more rapid return to normal activities [87.6% (211/241) vs. 72.3% (270/373)] compared with patients who underwent a major procedure. This group also had the highest rates of wound healing at 6 months (74.6%). However, patients who underwent minimally invasive surgery were more likely to experience treatment failure at 6 months (27%) compared to patients who underwent a major procedure.

### Successful treatment of daptomycin-nonsusceptible methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with the addition of rifampin to daptomycin [^76ac4691]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case in which daptomycin-nonsusceptible methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia was successfully treated with the addition of rifampin to daptomycin.

Case Summary

An 84-year-old male presented with fever and chills following cystoscopy. After culturing was conducted, the patient received single doses of vancomycin and gentamicin and then continued on vancomycin plus ceftazidime. Blood cultures grew MRSA, with vancomycin and daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ≤ 1 microg/mL and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Vancomycin was continued, with trough concentrations maintained > 15 microg/mL, but results of blood cultures remained positive. On day 10, therapy was switched to daptomycin 6 mg/kg/day, but culture results remained positive. On day 13, testing for vancomycin heteroresistance was negative, with the MIC unchanged. The vancomycin MIC remained unchanged on day 19, but the daptomycin MIC had increased to 2 microg/mL. Rifampin 300 mg orally twice daily was added on day 20; blood cultures obtained 2 days later were sterile. The patient was discharged to complete a 6-week course of antibiotics and was doing well 4 months following therapy.

Discussion

Analysis of MRSA isolates obtained on days 1 and 19 showed an increase in the daptomycin MIC from 0.25 to 2 microg/mL. Because intervening isolates were not available for susceptibility testing, it is not possible to associate this increase with exposure to either vancomycin or daptomycin. Although in vitro synergy was not seen in this case, addition of rifampin to daptomycin therapy resolved the bacteremia.

Conclusions

In patients with persistent MRSA bacteremia, isolates should be retested for susceptibility to both daptomycin and vancomycin, including assessment for vancomycin heteroresistance. Addition of rifampin to daptomycin may be effective for persistent MRSA bacteremia, even if daptomycin MICs are elevated. Prospective studies are needed to define the role of combination therapy.

### Pilonidal reality calls for action [^69f1ebf5]. The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Follow-up

Another strength of this study is the prospective data collection and the meticulous attempt to follow up, with 71% of patients available for a very short follow-up at 6 months after surgery. This may reflect selection bias or perhaps the challenges of multicentre trials, as many of the existing specialized single-centre studies on PSD present surprisingly adherent follow-up even after 5 and more years. However, a meta-analysishas highlighted the bias that long-term recurrence rates in PSD are much higher in RCTs than in non-RCTs. With more rigorous follow-up as part of the RCT design, this suggests that the abundance of retrospective trials may have contributed to a falsely deflated risk of recurrence, as these follow-ups may, in reality, be inadequate or flawed. On the other hand, RCTs may have downsides of their own.
