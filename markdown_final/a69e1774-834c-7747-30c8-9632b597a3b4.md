## Question

What is the mechanism of action for benlysta.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the mechanism of action for Benlysta (belimumab). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's identity and its molecular target. Then, I should verify the precise binding characteristics and whether it affects membrane-bound versus soluble forms. Next, I will examine the downstream signaling consequences in B cells, followed by the functional effects on B-cell subsets and immunoglobulins. After that, I should review clinical pharmacodynamics and reconcile any apparent paradoxes, such as memory B-cell behavior. Finally, I will integrate how this mechanistic profile translates into therapeutic effects in SLE and lupus nephritis, and note any nuances or exceptions I need to check carefully.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and target. Belimumab is a fully human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody that specifically targets B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), also called B-cell activating factor (BAFF), which is a TNF superfamily cytokine critical for B-cell survival and differentiation. This is consistently described in regulatory and mechanistic sources, so I should anchor on that before proceeding [^086c71b3] [^11cecc5a].

> Wait, let me verify the binding specificity because this is easy to misstate. Belimumab binds soluble BLyS/BAFF and does not bind B cells directly, nor does it bind membrane-bound BAFF; this distinction matters for both pharmacodynamics and safety, and it is explicitly stated in the FDA label and supported by structural studies showing that belimumab's epitope and binding mode are incompatible with membrane-bound BAFF assemblies, explaining the selective targeting of soluble forms [^086c71b3] [^0bc7dc4e].

> I will now examine the molecular consequences of binding. By neutralizing soluble BLyS, belimumab blocks its engagement with BAFF receptors (BAFF-R, TACI, BCMA), thereby inhibiting pro-survival signaling pathways in B cells. Structurally, belimumab's HCDR3 loop mimics the DxL motif of BAFF receptors, enabling high-affinity binding to soluble BAFF and disruption of BAFF oligomerization, including interference with the highly active BAFF 60-mer, which further impairs receptor clustering and signaling [^11cecc5a] [^e72ec1dc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which B-cell subsets are affected. I should confirm the functional effects. Neutralization of soluble BLyS reduces the survival of transitional and naïve B cells, including autoreactive clones, and decreases differentiation into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells; memory B cells are relatively spared, consistent with their greater independence from BAFF for survival, which helps preserve secondary immune responses [^086c71b3] [^3b8d5715].

> Next, I should review the clinical pharmacodynamics to ensure this translates in vivo. In adults with SLE, belimumab significantly reduces circulating CD19+ B cells, with early and sustained decreases in naïve and activated B cells, while memory B cells initially rise and then slowly decline toward baseline; immunoglobulin G and anti-dsDNA antibodies fall, and complement C3/C4 rise in those with low baseline complement, reflecting reduced autoantibody production and improved immune complex clearance [^086c71b3] [^b81cb992].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought belimumab might directly deplete B cells like rituximab, but that would be incorrect. Let me reconsider and correct that. Belimumab does not cause direct B-cell depletion; rather, it induces functional depletion by depriving B cells of BLyS-mediated survival signals, which explains why memory B cells persist and why vaccination responses are often preserved despite reductions in naïve and plasma cell compartments [^086c71b3] [^3b8d5715].

> I should double-check the memory B-cell paradox. Several studies show that circulating memory B cells can increase after belimumab, particularly in serologically active disease, likely reflecting disrupted trafficking out of tissues and impaired germinal center interactions rather than true expansion; this redistribution may actually facilitate targeting of autoreactive memory B cells and could explain some of the clinical benefits seen in active SLE [^6e479095] [^47554317].

> Let me integrate how this mechanism maps to therapeutic effects. By reducing autoreactive B-cell survival and autoantibody production, belimumab lowers disease activity, decreases severe flares, and enables steroid sparing in SLE; in lupus nephritis, BLISS-LN demonstrated improved renal outcomes when added to standard-of-care, consistent with diminished B-cell–mediated pathogenesis, and long-term extension data show sustained benefits in those who continue therapy [^5486a9bc] [^5e76e1da] [^1d93de0f].

> But wait, what if there are nuances in different clinical contexts or combinations. I need to ensure I note those. Belimumab's effects are most pronounced in serologically active patients and in those with musculoskeletal or mucocutaneous disease, whereas its sparing of memory B cells may limit efficacy in some refractory phenotypes; combining belimumab with rituximab can prolong B-cell depletion and reduce autoantibodies, though randomized data have not consistently shown added clinical benefit, underscoring the need for careful patient selection and sequencing strategies [^247b27bf] [^c114b981] [^2fbeffdf].

> In summary, I should confirm the final synthesis. Belimumab is a BLyS/BAFF-specific inhibitor that binds soluble BLyS, blocks receptor engagement, disrupts BAFF oligomerization, and thereby impairs B-cell survival and plasma cell differentiation; clinically, this yields reductions in autoreactive B cells and autoantibodies, improved complement profiles, and meaningful disease control in SLE and lupus nephritis, with a favorable safety profile that reflects selective immunomodulation rather than broad immunosuppression [^086c71b3] [^11cecc5a] [^5486a9bc].

Benlysta (belimumab) is a **fully human monoclonal antibody** that binds soluble B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS/BAFF), a cytokine essential for B-cell survival, maturation, and differentiation [^086c71b3]. By neutralizing BLyS, Benlysta **reduces B-cell survival and differentiation into plasma cells**, lowering autoantibody production and immune complex formation, which are central to SLE pathogenesis [^086c71b3]. This targeted mechanism distinguishes it from broad immunosuppressants, sparing memory B cells and T cells, and preserving secondary immune responses [^3b8d5715].

---

## Molecular target: B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS/BAFF)

- **BLyS/BAFF**: A TNF superfamily cytokine produced by monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and T cells; it binds BAFF-R, TACI, and BCMA on B cells to promote survival, maturation, and differentiation [^695e9814].

- **Role in SLE**: BLyS is elevated in SLE and correlates with disease activity; it enhances survival of autoreactive B cells and drives autoantibody production [^6869b3a2].

- **Forms of BLyS**: Soluble trimeric and 60-mer forms exist; Benlysta binds soluble BLyS but not membrane-bound BLyS, which is key to its selectivity [^0bc7dc4e].

---

## Mechanism of action of Benlysta

### Binding and neutralization of soluble BLyS

Benlysta binds soluble BLyS with high affinity, **blocking its interaction with BAFF-R, TACI, and BCMA**, thereby preventing pro-survival signaling in B cells [^11cecc5a].

---

### Reduction of B-cell survival and differentiation

By neutralizing BLyS, Benlysta **reduces survival of transitional and mature B cells**, especially autoreactive clones, and decreases differentiation into plasma cells, lowering autoantibody production [^086c71b3].

---

### Impact on B-cell subsets

- **Naive and activated B cells**: Significantly reduced, with early and sustained decreases observed from week 8 to week 52 [^086c71b3].

- **Memory B cells**: Relatively spared, consistent with their BAFF-independent survival, preserving secondary immune responses [^3b8d5715].

- **Plasma cells**: Reduced, leading to decreased immunoglobulin production, including anti-dsDNA antibodies [^086c71b3].

---

### Disruption of BAFF oligomerization

Benlysta disrupts formation of the highly active BAFF 60-mer, favoring less active trimeric forms and **further attenuating B-cell activation** [^11cecc5a].

---

## Clinical pharmacodynamics

- **Reduction in B-cell counts**: Decreases in CD19+, CD20+, naïve, and activated B cells by week 8, sustained to week 52 [^086c71b3].

- **Reduction in immunoglobulins**: Decreases in IgG and anti-dsDNA antibodies by week 8, sustained through week 52 [^086c71b3].

- **Complement normalization**: Increases in C3 and C4 in patients with low baseline complement, reflecting reduced immune complex activity [^086c71b3].

---

## Clinical implications

- **Efficacy**: Reduces disease activity, flares, and steroid use in SLE, including lupus nephritis, as shown in BLISS and BLISS-LN trials [^5486a9bc] [^5e76e1da].

- **Safety**: Generally well tolerated; common adverse effects include infusion reactions, infections, and gastrointestinal symptoms [^aa12b606].

- **Selectivity**: Preserves memory B cells and T cells, maintaining protective immunity compared to broad immunosuppressants [^3b8d5715].

---

Benlysta's mechanism is **targeted neutralization of soluble BLyS**, which reduces autoreactive B-cell survival and autoantibody production, thereby controlling SLE activity while preserving key immune defenses.

### Lupus clinical development: will belimumab's approval catalyse a new paradigm for SLE drug development? [^a93b6b05]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a diverse autoimmune disease affecting many different organ systems. Although disease manifestations are varied across the lupus population, the widespread presence of autoantibodies indicates that SLE immunopathology involves B-cell dysregulation. Belimumab, a human anti-B-cell activating factor (BLyS) monoclonal antibody, was invented by Human Genome Sciences and co-developed with GlaxoSmithKline and became, in 2011, the first new therapy approved for SLE patients in over 50 years.

Areas Covered

Belimumab approval represents a milestone as a new treatment for a subset of SLE patients and also a window onto the continued unmet need for many patients suffering from this diverse disease. This paper analyses the drugs and clinical trials of industry-sponsored development programs to profile the current SLE landscape and to consider how belimumab is shaping the future of SLE drug development.

Expert Opinion

Our analysis demonstrates that the belimumab clinical program created a model for improvements in study designs that is reflected in ongoing clinical trials sponsored by a broad range of companies. Additional BLyS inhibitors, with distinctive targeting characteristics, are now in late stage development. A broad range of drugs with other mechanisms of action are also under investigation in Phase II - III trials, some of which are focused on the underserved lupus nephritis population.

### Belimumab: a step forward in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^ecb8bdf0]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic B cell-mediated autoimmune disease which can potentially involve several organs and systems. The development of SLE is associated with a complexity of genetic, hormonal and environmental factors leading to immune deregulation and production of autoantibodies. Therefore, novel therapies have focused on B cells as key effectors of SLE pathogenesis. Belimumab is a fully humanized monoclonal antibody that antagonizes B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS); it is the first and the only biological drug approved for SLE in over 50 years. Areas covered: In this review we discuss the pharmacological properties of belimumab, new recommendations for its use in clinical practice and its evidence of efficacy and safety based on clinical trial and real-life data. Expert opinion: Efficacy and safety of belimumab in clinical practice have been well established. To date, it is known that early introduction of belimumab in SLE can maximize the efficacy of the drug. A number of questions are still open, such as the timing of belimumab discontinuation and its possible association with other biological drugs, which need to be assessed in future studies.

Given that the epitope and mechanism of action are critical determinants for the development of therapeutic antibodies, our description of the binding modes revealed by the BAFF–belimumab complex structure in this study provides useful information for the discovery of improved BAFF antagonists and rational design of drug combinations with therapeutic synergy for the treatment of SLE and other autoimmune diseases in which BAFF has a central function in pathogenesis.

### Belimumab: a BLyS-specific inhibitor for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus [^46d9e957]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Belimumab (Benlysta), which recently received marketing approval, is the first of a new class of immunomodulators with a novel mechanism of action. It is a specific inhibitor of the soluble B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) cytokine, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Two large phase III randomized controlled clinical trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of belimumab combined with standard therapy and showed that the efficacy of this treatment was significantly superior to placebo plus standard therapy. Belimumab is an evidence-based therapeutic option for patients with general lupus disease activity and may signal a shift in the existing treatment paradigm from therapeutic selection targeting specific organ involvement to an approach directed at tackling multisystem disease activity and preventing the disease from worsening.

### Advances in drug therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus [^0279b168]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that afflicts 500,000 people in the United States. There has not been a new SLE drug approved in the United States since 1958. However, a guidance document issued by the Food and Drug Administration in 2005 provided a roadmap for investigators which spawned numerous ongoing clinical trials. Among these, Belimumab, a monoclonal antibody to soluble B lymphocyte stimulator, met its primary endpoints in two large trials and will probably obtain FDA approval soon. Other promising agents targeting a variety of mechanisms of action are currently in development. This minireview highlights the latest therapies under investigation in SLE and gives an overview of the pathways that are specifically being targeted.

Concluding remarks

Belimumab is an approved biological drug for the treatment of patients with persistently active SLE with skin and/or joint disease that do not respond to standard therapies. Although many questions related to this drug remain unanswered, data from clinical trials are somewhat encouraging. Belimumab has shown modest efficacy in SLE treatment without significant side effects. It would be very helpful to determine whether some subgroups of patients in particular will benefit from its use and whether it might work better in combination with another therapy. The relative success of belimumab should encourage studies of other molecules that act on the BAFF/APRIL axis.

3D elucidation of the mechanism of action of belimumab

The antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of belimumab was produced by digestion with papain, while BAFF 3-mer was expressed in prokaryotic cells. To prevent association of BAFF 3-mer into 60-mer, mutation H218A was introduced into the flap region, which did not grossly affect the affinity of belimumab for BAFF (Supplementary Fig. 6). BAFF 3-mer or the Fab taken alone had roughly equal native sizes (Fig. 7a–c), but formed a larger, well-defined complex when BAFF was mixed with an excess of belimumab Fab (Fig. 7d). Some free Fab was detected when the complex was re-analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 7e), suggesting that the Fab was not very tightly bound to BAFF.

### BAFF and selection of autoreactive B cells [^be58396c]. Trends in Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

B cell activating factor (BAFF) is a crucial survival factor for transitional and mature B cells, and is a promising therapeutic target for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). A BAFF inhibitor, belimumab, is the first new drug in 50 years to be approved for the treatment of SLE. However, the mechanism of action of this drug is not entirely clear. In this review we will focus on the role of the BAFF-APRIL signaling pathway in the selection of autoreactive B cells, and discuss whether altered selection is the mechanism for the therapeutic efficacy of BAFF inhibition in SLE.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

BENLYSTA is a BLyS-specific inhibitor that blocks the binding of soluble BLyS, a B-cell survival factor, to its receptors on B cells. BENLYSTA does not bind B cells directly, but by binding BLyS, BENLYSTA inhibits the survival of B cells, including autoreactive B cells, and reduces the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Treatment with BENLYSTA in adult subjects significantly reduced circulating CD19+, CD20+, naïve, and activated B cells, and the SLE B‑cell subset at Week 52. Reductions in naïve and the SLE B‑cell subset were observed as early as Week 8 and sustained to Week 52. Memory cells increased initially and slowly declined toward baseline levels by Week 52.

Treatment with BENLYSTA in adult subjects led to reductions in IgG and anti‑double‑stranded DNA antibodies (anti‑dsDNA) which were observed as early as Week 8 and sustained through Week 52. In subjects with low complement levels at baseline, treatment led to increases in complement C3 and C4 as early as Week 12 and were sustained through Week 52.

The pharmacodynamic response observed in Black subjects (Trial 4) was consistent with the previous studies.

In subjects with active lupus nephritis (Trial 5), following treatment with BENLYSTA, there was a decrease in serum IgG as early as Week 4, and subsequently there was an increase in serum IgG levels which was associated with decreased proteinuria. Reductions in autoantibodies, increases in complement, and reductions in circulating total B cells and B‑cell subsets observed were consistent with the SLE studies.

In Trial 6 (pediatric dosing), the pharmacodynamic response was consistent with the adult data.

The clinical relevance of above mentioned pharmacodynamic biomarkers has not been established.

### Future prospects in biologic therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus [^159d2fb5]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

With the approval by the FDA in 2011 of a biologic agent (namely belimumab) for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), optimism abounds that additional biologic (and nonbiologic) agents will be similarly endorsed. Given the numerous immune-based abnormalities associated with SLE, the potential therapeutic targets for biologic agents and the candidate biologic approaches are also numerous. These approaches include: biologic agents that promote B-cell depletion, B-cell inactivation, or the generation of regulatory B cells; biologic agents that induce T-cell tolerance, block T-cell activation and differentiation, or alter T-cell trafficking; biologic agents that target the B-cell activating factor (BAFF) axis, type I interferons, IL-6 and its receptor, or TNF; and the adoptive transfer of ex vivo-generated regulatory T cells. Owing to the great heterogeneity inherent to SLE, no single approach should be expected to be effective in all patients. As our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of SLE continues to expand, additional therapeutic targets and approaches will undoubtedly be identified and should be fully exploited.

### Navigating the landscape of SLE treatment: an expert viewpoint on the rationality and limitations of early biologic intervention [^520d38a2]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

The approval of biologics, namely belimumab and anifrolumab, is being a game-changer in the approach to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Currently we are indeed facing a revolution in the treatment paradigm of SLE, encompassing early combination of biologics with standard treatment in severe manifestations. In this regard, a lively discussion is taking place regarding the better positioning of biologics in the treatment of not necessarily severe, yet refractory and/or disfiguring manifestations which expose patients to worsened quality of life, reduced workability and enhanced risk of organ damage especially related to the misuse of glucocorticoids in the long run. Growing evidence supports the early use of targeted treatments in those patients, including the use of biologics before traditional immunosuppression, to achieve control of disease activity while minimizing treatment-related damage, privileging the timely use of therapeutics selectively impacting on key disease mechanisms in spite of a widespread immunosuppression. Patient profiling on a clinical and endotypical basis is helping in identifying better candidates to targeted drugs. More inflammatory organ involvement including persistent arthritis and infiltrating skin lesions seem likely to respond to anifrolumab, while B-mediated manifestations, a lively serology and a relapsing-remitting SLE course hint at a suitable role for belimumab. This seems at least partially connected to the inner effect of either drug, dampening inflammation through down-regulation of interferon signalling in the case of anifrolumab, while plastically modulating the B cell pool composition and function when coming to belimumab. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of both drugs are immunologically entangled at some extent, thereby requiring careful management especially in patients with longer disease history burdened with mixed manifestations. In this viewpoint we go over pros and cons of anticipatory biologic use in SLE, exploring features linked with better efficacy of either drug and the pathogenic and practical rationale for their positioning before traditional immunosuppression in moderate refractory SLE to be optimally managed in the 21st Century.

### Identification of biomarkers to stratify response to B-cell-targeted therapies in systemic lupus erythematosus: an exploratory analysis of a randomised controlled trial [^abb3c4b8]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

Stratification of patients is likely to aid treatment selection and improve outcomes, given the immunopathological and clinical complexity of SLE combined with the variable response to targeted therapy. Using samples from patients recruited to the BEAT-LUPUS trial, we aimed to identify biomarkers of response to belimumab after rituximab to aid a personalised approach to therapy and provide insights into mechanisms of action that could lead to development of further novel therapeutic strategies.

### Disruption of memory B-cell trafficking by belimumab in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^6e479095]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

MBCs can contribute to autoimmune diseases through various mechanisms, including presentation of autoantigens, production of autoantibodies or cytokines, or formation of germinal centres. Here, a substantial increase in circulating MBCs, particularly in patients with severe, serologically active SLE/LN, was firmly established upon BEL initiation. The increase suggests reduced MBC levels in the tissue leading to MBCs no longer interacting effectively with other immune cells, such as T cells, in lymphoid structures, possibly compromising the immune responses. The surge of circulating MBCs associated with disrupted lymphocyte trafficking of MBCs, thus, expands the existing understanding of the therapeutic mechanism of BEL's impact on MBCs in SLE that might allow for more efficient targeting of the B-cell compartment.

Key messages

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogenous disease largely dependent on the generation of auto-reactive antibodies by B cells.
Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody against B-cell activating factor (BAFF) and the first biological drug to be approved for the treatment of SLE in more than 50 years.
The BLISS-52 and 76 are phase III randomised trials that were conducted to evaluate belimumab efficacy and safety throughout 52 and 76 weeks of treatment respectively.
BLISS-52 and 76 demonstrated that belimumab has a role as add-on therapy in adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive SLE with a high degree of disease activity, in those patients who principally have mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal involvement.
Several on going trials attempt to understand the role of belimumab in specific settings (lupus nephritis, patients with African ancestry, paediatric patients and the impact on vaccine responses), as well as its long-term efficacy and tolerability.
Many questions remain to be addressed such as the ideal combined therapy, its effectiveness compared to other drugs or its cost-effectiveness out of the clinical trials setting.

### BAFF-neutralizing interaction of belimumab related to its therapeutic efficacy for treating systemic lupus erythematosus [^11cecc5a]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

BAFF, a member of the TNF superfamily, has been recognized as a good target for autoimmune diseases. Belimumab, an anti-BAFF monoclonal antibody, was approved by the FDA for use in treating systemic lupus erythematosus. However, the molecular basis of BAFF neutralization by belimumab remains unclear. Here our crystal structure of the BAFF–belimumab Fab complex shows the precise epitope and the BAFF-neutralizing mechanism of belimumab, and demonstrates that the therapeutic activity of belimumab involves not only antagonizing the BAFF–receptor interaction, but also disrupting the formation of the more active BAFF 60-mer to favor the induction of the less active BAFF trimer through interaction with the flap region of BAFF. In addition, the belimumab HCDR3 loop mimics the DxL(V/L) motif of BAFF receptors, thereby binding to BAFF in a similar manner as endogenous BAFF receptors. Our data thus provides insights for the design of new drugs targeting BAFF for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

### Belimumab in systemic lupus erythematosus [^7a6821e0]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is one of the most challenging autoimmune disorders with a complex pathophysiology and diverse clinical presentation. Many drugs have been used to treat SLE with suboptimal results, especially in patients with moderate-to-severe disease. Belimumab is the first biological drug to be approved for the treatment of SLE in more than 50years. This monoclonal antibody blocks B-cell activating factor, a cytokine important for B-cell differentiation and survival. In this review we focus on the activity of belimumab in patients with SLE and discuss the controversies of its use.

Discussion

BAFF exists in three forms: a membrane-bound form and two soluble forms that include a trimer and a 60-mer. Belimumab has been characterized as targeting soluble BAFF only, whereas other BAFF antagonists, including tabalumab, blisibimod, and atacicept, can block both membrane-bound and soluble BAFF. Contrary to expectations, the biologics targeting both soluble and membrane-bound BAFF have failed to meet their primary endpoints in clinical trials of SLE. Although it is unclear whether the clinical consequences of BAFF antagonists correlate with the different mechanism of action against the various forms of BAFF, understanding the molecular basis of their distinct mechanisms might provide important information for achieving clinical efficacy beyond that of belimumab, possibly through rational design of new biologics or combination therapies. In the crystal structures of TNF in complex with the Fab fragments of adalimumab, infliximab, and certolizumab, the orientations of these Fab fragments from the cell membrane were roughly similar to that of belimumab – (Supplementary Fig. 3). The binding angle and distance of belimumab Fab from the cell membrane was very close to those of adalimumab, and the structure of the TNF-certolizumab Fab complex showed an even more cramped space between the Fab fragment and the cell membrane. However, these anti-TNF antibodies are capable of blocking both soluble and membrane-bound TNF, whereas belimumab binds soluble BAFF only. Therefore, the inability of belimumab to bind membrane-bound BAFF appears to originate from an intrinsic property of BAFF, and not from its binding orientation or position. Accordingly, it is possible that the unique BAFF trimer–trimer interaction by the exceptionally long DE loop, which is involved in interactions with belimumab, might contribute to the inability of belimumab to bind membrane-bound BAFF, given that belimumab breaks the BAFF trimer–trimer interactions and disrupts the 60-mer, whereas tabalumab can bind both the 60-mer and the trimer, probably by maintaining the BAFF trimer–trimer interaction (Fig. 2). Although several studies have revealed that the major oligomeric states of soluble BAFF are the trimer and 60-mer, the oligomeric state of membrane-bound BAFF remains unknown. A previous study showed that cells expressing noncleavable membrane-bound BAFF were at least 50-fold more active than soluble BAFF trimers, although less active than the soluble 60-mer, implying that membrane-bound BAFF might exist as a higher-order oligomer other than a trimer. On the basis of the crystal structure of the soluble BAFF 60-mer, it can be suggested that the BAFF trimer–trimer interaction in the 60-mer can also be formed between membrane-bound BAFF trimers using their flap regions. Therefore, the functional unit of membrane-bound BAFF could be a dimer, tetramer, pentamer, or higher oligomers of BAFF trimers through the trimer–trimer interactions, although the formation of the capsid-like 60-mer would not be feasible in the case of membrane-bound BAFF. Size-exclusion chromatography showed only trimers and 60-mers of soluble BAFF, but no other intermediate oligomers, suggesting that the trimer–trimer interaction is intrinsically weak and probably effective only in a cooperative way for the formation of the 60-mer. This might be because freed soluble trimers can occupy nearly any position and orientation, yielding an increase in entropy. However, the putative trimer–trimer interaction between membrane-bound BAFF trimers would be stronger than that between soluble BAFF trimers, given that membrane-bound BAFF trimers are constrained to move on the cell membrane in close proximity to one another, and that their orientation on the membrane is also favorable for the BAFF trimer–trimer interaction via their flap regions. Therefore, the binding of belimumab to membrane-bound BAFF might be hindered by enhanced interactions between membrane-bound BAFF trimers, because belimumab binding would need to break the trimer–trimer interactions. The inhibitory capacities of belimumab and tabalumab against BAFF trimer and 60-mer were compared through NFκB luciferase report assays in CHO cells expressing either BR3 or TACI, and through B cell proliferation assays, showing unexpected differences in potency between belimumab and tabalumab against BAFF 60-mer. Although both antibodies were nearly identical in their inhibitory capacity against BAFF trimer, tabalumab blocked the signaling effects of BAFF 60-mer at a strikingly lower concentration than belimumab. Considering that BAFF 60-mer is a stable assembly, belimumab could not block BAFF 60-mer until it reaches its critical concentration for disrupting the 60-mer, whereas occupation of only several epitopes exposed on the surface of the 60-mer by tabalumab may lead to the effective blocking of BAFF 60-mer without disrupting it. It remains unclear whether the successful approval for belimumab in contrast to tabalumab relates to the potential differences in the pharmacology between them, or whether it is based on the clinical study design including patient selection and end points.

### Phase II randomized trial of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide followed by belimumab for the treatment of lupus nephritis [^e01a3124]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the safety, mechanism of action, and preliminary efficacy of rituximab followed by belimumab in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis (LN).

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, open‐label clinical trial, 43 patients with recurrent or refractory LN were treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide (CYC), and glucocorticoids followed by weekly belimumab infusions until week 48 (RCB group), or treated with rituximab and CYC but no belimumab infusions (RC group). Patients were followed up until week 96. Percentages of total and autoreactive B cell subsets in the patients' peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry.

Results

Treatment with belimumab did not increase the incidence of adverse events in patients with refractory LN. At week 48, a complete or partial renal response occurred in 11 (52%) of 21 patients receiving belimumab, compared to 9 (41%) of 22 patients in the RC group who did not receive belimumab (P = 0.452). Lack of improvement in or worsening of LN was the major reason for treatment failure. B cell depletion occurred in both groups, but the percentage of B cells remained lower in those receiving belimumab (geometric mean number of B cells at week 60, 53 cells/μl in the RCB group versus 11 cells/μl in the RC group; P = 0.0012). Percentages of total and autoreactive transitional B cells increased from baseline to week 48 in both groups. However, percentages of total and autoreactive naive B cells decreased from baseline to week 48 in the belimumab group compared to the no belimumab RC group (P = 0.0349), a finding that is consistent with the observed impaired maturation of naive B cells and enhanced censoring of autoreactive B cells.

Conclusion

The addition of belimumab to a treatment regimen with rituximab and CYC was safe in patients with refractory LN. This regimen diminished maturation of transitional to naive B cells during B cell reconstitution, and enhanced the negative selection of autoreactive B cells. Clinical efficacy was not improved with rituximab and CYC in combination with belimumab when compared to a therapeutic strategy of B cell depletion alone in patients with LN.

### Belimumab for systemic lupus erythematosus [^5486a9bc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Belimumab, the first biologic approved for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), has been shown to reduce autoantibody levels in people with SLE and help control disease activity.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of belimumab (alone or in combination) in systematic lupus erythematosus.

Search Methods

An Information Specialist carried out the searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and clinicaltrials.gov from inception to 25 September 2019. There were no language or date restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) of belimumab (alone or in combination) compared to placebo/control treatment (immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil or another biologic), in adults with SLE.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Six RCTs (2917 participants) qualified for quantitative analyses. All included studies were multicenter, international or US-based. The age range of the included participants was 22 to 80 years; most were women; and study duration ranged from 84 days to 76 weeks. The risk of bias was generally low except for attrition bias, which was high in 67% of studies. Compared to placebo, more participants on belimumab 10 mg/kg (Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dose) showed at least a 4-point improvement (reduction) in Safety of Estrogen in Lupus National Assessment (SELENA) - Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score, a validated SLE disease activity index: (risk ratio (RR) 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.22 to 1.45; 829/1589 in belimumab group and 424/1077 in placebo; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs; high-certainty evidence). Change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL), assessed by Short Form-36 Physical Component Summary score improvement (range 0 to 100), showed there was probably little or no difference between groups (mean difference 1.6 points, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.90; 401 in belimumab group and 400 in placebo; I² = 0%; 2 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). The belimumab 10 mg/kg group showed greater improvement in glucocorticoid dose, with a higher proportion of participants reducing their dose by at least 50% compared to placebo (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.15; 81/269 in belimumab group and 52/268 in placebo; I² = 0%; 2 RCTs; high-certainty evidence). The proportion of participants experiencing harm may not differ meaningfully between the belimumab 10 mg/kg and placebo groups: one or more serious adverse event (RR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.11; 238/1700 in belimumab group and 199/1190 in placebo; I² = 48%; 5 RCTs; low-certainty evidence) one or more serious infection (RR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.66 to 1.54; 44/1230 in belimumab group and 40/955 in placebo; I² = 0%; 4 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence); and withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.82, 95% CI: 0.63 to 1.07; 113/1700 in belimumab group and 94/1190 in placebo; I² = 0%; 5 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). Mortality was rare, and may not differ between belimumab 10 mg/kg and placebo (Peto odds ratio 1.15, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.25; 9/1714 in belimumab group and 6/1203 in placebo; I² = 4%; 6 RCTs; low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

The six studies that provided evidence for benefits and harms of belimumab were well-designed, high-quality RCTs. At the FDA-approved dose of 10 mg/kg, based on moderate to high-certainty data, belimumab was probably associated with a clinically meaningful efficacy benefit compared to placebo in participants with SLE at 52 weeks. Evidence related to harms is inconclusive and mostly of moderate to low-certainty evidence. More data are needed for the longer-term efficacy of belimumab.

### Phase II randomized trial of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide followed by belimumab for the treatment of lupus nephritis [^f1a1c47a]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the safety, mechanism of action, and preliminary efficacy of rituximab followed by belimumab in the treatment of refractory lupus nephritis (LN).

Methods

In a multicenter, randomized, open-label clinical trial, 43 patients with recurrent or refractory LN were treated with rituximab, cyclophosphamide (CYC), and glucocorticoids followed by weekly belimumab infusions until week 48 (RCB group), or treated with rituximab and CYC but no belimumab infusions (RC group). Patients were followed up until week 96. Percentages of total and autoreactive B cell subsets in the patients' peripheral blood were analyzed by flow cytometry.

Results

Treatment with belimumab did not increase the incidence of adverse events in patients with refractory LN. At week 48, a complete or partial renal response occurred in 11 (52%) of 21 patients receiving belimumab, compared to 9 (41%) of 22 patients in the RC group who did not receive belimumab (P = 0.452). Lack of improvement in or worsening of LN was the major reason for treatment failure. B cell depletion occurred in both groups, but the percentage of B cells remained lower in those receiving belimumab (geometric mean number of B cells at week 60, 53 cells/μl in the RCB group versus 11 cells/μl in the RC group; P = 0.0012). Percentages of total and autoreactive transitional B cells increased from baseline to week 48 in both groups. However, percentages of total and autoreactive naive B cells decreased from baseline to week 48 in the belimumab group compared to the no belimumab RC group (P = 0.0349), a finding that is consistent with the observed impaired maturation of naive B cells and enhanced censoring of autoreactive B cells.

Conclusion

The addition of belimumab to a treatment regimen with rituximab and CYC was safe in patients with refractory LN. This regimen diminished maturation of transitional to naive B cells during B cell reconstitution, and enhanced the negative selection of autoreactive B cells. Clinical efficacy was not improved with rituximab and CYC in combination with belimumab when compared to a therapeutic strategy of B cell depletion alone in patients with LN.

### Biologic therapy for autoimmune diseases: an update [^27d954d9]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Belimumab

Mechanism

The BLyS protein is a member of the superfamily of TNFs. It inhibits B cell apoptosis and stimulates the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells. Belimumab (trade name (Benlysta) is a human monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG1γ), which binds to and inhibits the soluble form of the BLyS protein (Table 1).

Indications and dosage

Belimumab is approved by the FDA for the treatment of mild to moderate SLE, and is presently not indicated for active LE nephritis or neuropsychiatric involvement (Table 1). It is given by slow IV infusion over 1 hour at a recommended dose of 10 mg/kg at 2-week intervals for three cycles, then once every 4 weeks.

Efficacy

In a phase II trial, there was a significant effect of belimumab after 52 weeks of treatment and a steroid-sparing effect. However, no improvement in the SLE responder index (SRI), which incorporates disease activity scores to compile a single score, disease activity score was significant in SLE patients with severe active disease. In the phase III clinical trials assessed using the SRI, a significant improvement was seen in both the 1 mg/kg and the 10 mg/kg groups compared with the placebo group. Significant changes were also reported in the SELENA-SLEDAI (Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment–Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index) trial, with non-inferiority of belimumab compared with placebo, as measured by the Physician's Global Assessment (PGA).

Adverse effects and safety

AEs associated with belimumab treatment include nausea, diarrhea, headaches, and URT infections. Less common side effects are fever, cystitis, leucopenia, infusion reaction, and severe infections. Studies have shown that the number of AEs associated with belimumab were similar to that in the placebo group, and that the severity and number of AEs did not increase in the high-dose (10 mg/kg) group compared with the low-dose (1 mg/kg) group.

### Reductions in circulating B cell subsets and immunoglobulin G levels with long-term belimumab treatment in patients with SLE [^b81cb992]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Belimumab treatment up to 284 (~5.5 years) and 312 weeks (6 years) resulted in substantial decreases in most of the assessed circulating B cell subset counts and in serum IgG levels. The observed decreases in B cell subsets and IgG levels with long-term belimumab treatment are in line with its mechanism of action and with observations from previous analyses of patients with SLE. Elevated baseline naïve B cells were associated with improvements in SRI-4, while elevated baseline SLE subset plasma and short-lived plasma B cells, and early increases in IgG levels, were associated with poorer SRI-4 response. Elevated baseline IgG titre was associated with significantly increased infection rates. Assessment of these biomarkers before initiating long-term belimumab treatment may have value in predicting response and infection risk and may also assist in counselling and management of patients with SLE.

### BAFF-neutralizing interaction of belimumab related to its therapeutic efficacy for treating systemic lupus erythematosus [^3b8d5715]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), also known simply as lupus, is a relapsing and idiopathic autoimmune inflammatory disease. Although the cause of this disease is unclear, it has long been accepted that autoantibodies produced by autoreactive B cells have a central function in SLE pathogenesis. Mice overexpressing BAFF induce B-cell hyperplasia and display symptoms of autoimmune disorders, whereas BAFF-knockout mice lack mature B cells –. In addition, autoreactive B cells have a greater dependency on BAFF for their survival as compared with protective B cells. Elevated BAFF levels are detected in human patients with SLE; therefore, targeting the BAFF/receptor axis has emerged as a logical therapeutic candidate for control of SLE through the modulation of aberrant autoantibody production by autoreactive B cells –.

In 2011, the FDA approved belimumab (Benlysta), a fully human monoclonal IgG 1 λ antibody neutralizing soluble BAFF, as the first targeted therapy for SLE in the past 50 years since the introduction of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy. Belimumab has provided clinical benefits to SLE patients by reducing the number of circulating naive B cells, activated B cells, and plasma cells, but not memory B cells or T cells. Furthermore, belimumab treatment does not affect antibody responses to previous pneumococcal, tetanus, or influenza immunizations, which is consistent with preservation of the memory B-cell compartment. In addition to belimumab, other BAFF antagonists, including tabalumab (anti-BAFF antibody), blisibimod (anti-BAFF peptibody), and atacicept (TACI-IgG Fc fusion), are being or have been investigated in clinical trials for SLE. These three biologics differ from belimumab in that they bind both membrane-bound and soluble BAFF, whereas belimumab binds only soluble BAFF.

Crystal structures of BAFF alone or in complex with its cognate receptors have established the structural foundation for the oligomeric state of BAFF and its interaction with receptors –. However, no structure of BAFF in complex with any therapeutic antibody is available, even though the precise mechanism and epitope are crucial elements of antibody drugs. Here we report the 2.05 Å resolution structure of the BAFF–belimumab Fab complex and 1.90 Å resolution structure of belimumab Fab alone for elucidating the molecular mechanism of this antibody drug against BAFF. The nature of the antigenic epitope of belimumab is further analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis, and the distinct BAFF-binding mechanisms between belimumab and tabalumab are also investigated by analytical gel-filtration chromatography.

WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC

Belimumab and anifrolumab are both approved treatments for SLE; the efficacy of each treatment has been demonstrated versus placebo in clinical trials.
The only results to date on the efficacy of belimumab versus anifrolumab are from a single study that indirectly compared the two treatments, and the study had several limitations.

### Current and future therapies for SLE: obstacles and recommendations for the development of novel treatments [^26aea2f7]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

SLE is a serious, debilitating autoimmune disease that affects various organs and body systems. Of all the heterogeneous autoimmune diseases, SLE is perhaps the most heterogeneous. Patients with SLE, who are primarily female, have diverse disease manifestations and severity. SLE is characterised by substantial concentrations of autoantibodies against nuclear antigens, which are thought to be caused by immune cell dysregulation. Until recently, several immunosuppressant agents were used to treat this disease. Efforts to develop drugs against targets potentially involved in disease mechanisms have resulted in the identification and use of BAFF (B-cell activating factor)/APRIL (a proliferation-inducing ligand) inhibitors to treat SLE. Drugs in late-stage development that focus on pathways that are dysregulated in SLE include those that target the interferon pathway, T-cell signalling and B-cell signalling. New therapeutic agents are still necessary because of the unmet medical needs associated with this disease, including insufficient disease control, poor health-related quality of life, comorbidities, toxicity of the majority of therapies and diminished survival. Despite the substantial long-term investment of research, clinical activity and resources for identifying new treatments for this disease, only one new therapy, the biological belimumab, has been approved in the past 50 years. Efforts to develop drugs to address these needs are challenged by problems associated with disease heterogeneity, variable disease mechanisms and trial design. This review provides an overview of current and future treatments, discusses challenges in the SLE drug development process and offers recommendations for overcoming these challenges.

### Belimumab in systemic lupus erythematosus [^95c0a0da]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

The cost of belimumab is also a significant worry. One year of treatment with belimumab is estimated to cost more than 20 times the treatment with a conventional non-biological drug. The clinical outcome of this investment can take several months to be seen (6–12 months are necessary to establish a non-responder), so long-term cost-effective studies will be helpful to clarify the usefulness of this drug.

One final consideration concerns long-term treatment with belimumab and its potential adverse effects. Although it has been well tolerated to date, it is not known whether it will have additional unexpected side effects over very lengthy periods of use or if patients will develop antibelimumab antibodies that might reduce the efficacy of the drug.

Current drug pipeline

Approximately 30 novel agents are currently being evaluated in phase II/III clinical trials for the treatment of SLE, lupus nephritis and cutaneous lupus (tables 1 and 2). In phase III trials, agents include those targeting the interferon (IFN) pathway, BAFF-APRIL pathway, T-cell signalling and B-cell signalling. Furthermore, combinations of novel agents that target different mechanisms of action are being explored in phase II trials, as exemplified by the CALIBRATE and BEAT-LUPUS trials with belimumab and rituximab for lupus nephritis and SLE, respectively.

### Belimumab: a BLyS-specific inhibitor for systemic lupus erythematosus [^7820d564]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the efficacy, safety, dosing, drug interactions, as well as economic and therapeutic considerations of belimumab, an investigational B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) inhibitor.

Data Sources

A systematic, English-language MEDLINE search (1966-August 2010) was conducted using the search terms belimumab, Benlysta, B-lymphocyte stimulators, BLyS-specific inhibitors, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Press releases and bibliographies were reviewed for additional information and citations.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Belimumab was first identified and studied as a human protein target in 1999. Therefore, all published clinical trials and abstracts evaluating the safety and efficacy of belimumab for treatment of SLE as well as review articles from 1999 to present were evaluated for inclusion. Additional data were extracted from the manufacturer's Web site and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) documents.

Data Synthesis

Current therapies for SLE target nonspecific sites for inflammatory reduction and immune system suppression. Belimumab is a target-specific, human IgG1λ monoclonal B-lymphocyte stimulator inhibitor currently in late stage investigation for the treatment of SLE. Unpublished Phase 3 trials have reported statistically significant results for primary endpoints when belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard of care was compared to placebo plus standard of care in seropositive patients with SLE. Overall, belimumab has been relatively well tolerated with discontinuation rates and adverse events similar to those of placebo. If belimumab is approved by the FDA, its US market launch would be expected in 2011.

Conclusions

Belimumab has shown significant benefits for patients with SLE in the few Phase 3 trials that have been published. However, questions remain regarding optimal patient population, duration of treatment, place in therapy, and long-term adverse effects.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune rheumatic diseases: challenges to treatment [^84e2c23c]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenenesis of autoimmune rheumatic diseases has led to targeted biological treatments that modulate various aspects of the immune response. These new treatments, together with more judicious use of other immunosuppressive drugs, have resulted in marked improvements in morbidity and mortality. Although belimumab, an agent that inhibits B-cell survival, is the first drug to be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus in 50 years, many other immunological targets are under investigation. We discuss the recent advances in the biological treatment of autoimmune rheumatic diseases, with a particular focus on systemic lupus erythematosus.

### A loop region of BAFF controls B cell survival and regulates recognition by different inhibitors [^99e3ef86]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Potential impact of distinct anti-BAFF drugs specificities

In the present study, the structural basis for the distinct inhibitory mechanisms of BAFF 60-mer by belimumab and atacicept was characterized. This is not the only difference between belimumab and atacicept regarding their substrate specificity: atacicept, but not belimumab, also inhibits APRIL, and heteromers of BAFF and APRIL. Whether these differences positively or negatively impact the therapeutic action of these drugs is unknown. This will depend on whether drug targets are expressed or not in the pathological context, and also on how detrimental pathogenic cells (e.g. autoreactive or pro-inflammatory cells) and useful protective cells (e.g. normal plasma cells or regulatory cells) overlap with their requirements for potentially distinct sets of survival factors and for the set of receptors (BAFFR, TACI, and BCMA) used to respond to them. For example, if a subset of autoreactive plasma cells are pathogenic in human SLE, and these cells require either BAFF or APRIL, like normal mouse plasma cells, atacicept could be superior to belimumab. But if this same pathogenic cell subset would turn out to require BAFF only, atacicept could induce an unnecessary immunodeficiency. With regard to BAFF 60-mer, about which almost nothing is known in humans, much work is still needed to understand whether and where this complex occurs, and for which physiological or pathological functions. Also, the different mechanisms of BAFF 60-mer inhibition characterized in this study could be irrelevant in vivo if BAFF 60-mer dissociates into 3-mers before it can act on target cells, or crucial if newly synthetized BAFF 60-mer can reach its target before dissociation.

### Dual B-cell targeting in systemic lupus erythematosus: the role of combined and sequential therapy with rituximab and belimumab [^2fbeffdf]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by immune dysregulation and autoantibody production. Despite advances in treatment, achieving sustained disease control remains challenging. Rituximab (RTX) and belimumab (BELI) are two B-cell-targeting biologics with complementary mechanisms of action, leading to increasing interest in their combination as a therapeutic strategy for refractory SLE. RTX depletes CD20+ B cells, whereas BELI inhibits B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS), reducing the survival of autoreactive B cells. Sequential therapy with these agents may mitigate B-cell repopulation and improve disease control. Recent studies, including SynBioSe and BEAT-LUPUS, suggest that RTX-BELI therapy can reduce autoantibody levels, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and disease activity, with many patients achieving a lupus low disease activity state (LLDAS). However, the BLISS-BELIEVE and CALIBRATE trials did not demonstrate superiority over monotherapy, highlighting the need to refine patient selection. Combination therapy may be particularly beneficial in lupus nephritis, where BELI delays autoreactive B-cell reconstitution following RTX, potentially prolonging remission. While RTX-BELI therapy is generally well-tolerated, some studies report increased infections, necessitating careful patient monitoring. Lessons from other immune-mediated diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis, underscore the potential benefits and risks of dual biologic therapy. Further research, including the ongoing SynBioSe-2 trial, is needed to clarify the optimal use, sequencing, and safety profile of RTX-BELI in SLE. Identifying biomarkers predictive of response may enable personalized treatment approaches, ultimately improving long-term outcomes for patients with refractory SLE.

### Belimumab patient profile in Spain: evolution during the last decade and future directions [^f7f64984]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Belimumab (BEL), an anti B-lymphocyte stimulator monoclonal antibody, is the only approved biological therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and lupus nephritis (LN).

Areas Covered

This review discusses BEL's real-world use and its positioning in clinical practice guidelines, focusing on the evolution of its application and patient profile over the last decade in Spain.

Expert Opinion

Initially used for refractory and non-major SLE manifestations, BEL's application has expanded. International guidelines now recommend earlier use of BEL in treatment algorithms. With its 2021 approval for LN, BEL is increasingly used for renal manifestations and as a first-line therapy. Safety data confirm its tolerability without a significant increase in severe infections. However, real-world evidence in Spain reveals discrepancies with these recommendations for both SLE and LN. The optimal patient for BEL treatment is one with mild, moderate, or severe SLE that cannot be controlled with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), with or without glucocorticoids (GC) and immunosuppressants (IS), in patients with a disease duration of ≤ 2years, no initial organ damage, GC doses ≥ 5mg/day, and a high risk of severe flares. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal timing for BEL initiation to improve patient outcomes and modify the disease course.

### Administration of belimumab prior to standard immunosuppression in patients with early active lupus hinders accrual of new EULAR / ACR criteria within the first 12 months of treatment [^9c23ba56]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we show that administration of BEL in patients with early active lupus not receiving standard immunosuppression can significantly delay SLE progression and severity. Besides, the early administration of BEL heralded a greater likelihood of stopping GC at 12 months as compared with HCQ and GC alone.

Historically, biologic use was reserved for refractory SLE; however, it has been shown that features such as established organ damage and a longer disease history negatively impact response to biologics, claiming that targeted therapies could be put forward in the treatment algorithm due to good response rates and a better safety profile when employed before traditional immunosuppressants. Notably, our real-world data shed some light on the upcoming changed perspective of the treating physicians, who are envisioning the use of a biologic drug in early active patients on failure or inefficacy of a first line of HCQ with or without corticosteroids based on their own clinical judgement, in line with current EULAR recommendations.

Nevertheless, the adoption of such an approach in clinical practice is still uncommon due to several reasons, including regulations for access to biologics and socioeconomic status. On the other hand, direct and indirect health costs are fuelled by uncontrolled disease activity and drug-related side effects, including GC-driven damage. In this regard, biologics are notoriously capable of controlling disease activity while allowing treatment de-escalation, thereby hampering damage progression. This combined effect is unlikely with standard immunosuppression, making biologics surge as candidate disease modifiers for SLE relative to traditional drugs.

The concept of disease modification in SLE encompasses a joint control of disease activity and minimisation of treatment burden, regardless of any biological effect. BEL was shown to induce changes in the B cell compartment early during the treatment course which would anticipate either disease response or susceptibility to flaresand to affect disease mechanisms at a molecular level, with responders displaying a significant downregulation of B cells, type I/II interferon, interleukin-6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 and neutrophil activation signatures, thereby providing a molecular basis for a disease-modifier potential. Hence, it can be hypothesised that an earlier administration of such a biologic drug could play a pivotal role in shaping the disease phenotype over time. Consistently, our findings provide the first clinical evidence that early initiation of BEL significantly influences disease progression, steering it towards a milder phenotype.

### Belimumab in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematous: an evidence based review of its place in therapy [^d536762e]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematous is an autoimmune disease with diverse clinical features and has its development associated with a complexity of genetic, hormonal and environmental factors and the development of autoantibodies. Identification of new treatments is currently an area of intense investigation. Belimumab is the first biologic approved for the treatment of the disease inhibiting the excessive B cell activity observed in these patients and consequently reduction of autoantibodies.

Aim

To review the current transition of the evidence available of its use in real life patients with persistent active disease while on conventional therapies.

Evidence

The results observed on the large series of patients (over 50 patients) followed for at least six months confirm the observations from phase 3 trials. In clinical practice close to two third of the patients remained on belimumab and one third discontinued mostly due to evaluation by the doctor or the patient or both of no detectable positive response. The presence of adverse events was considerably low and the subgroups with skin and joint manifestations appear to benefit the most. Daily steroid use is usually reduced to a significantly low when compared with the intake before introduction of the biologic Although not seen on trials in real life the addition of belimumab to the conventional therapy in lupus nephritis is being reported in several patients. Cost of the medication is still an issue that hampers its use. Further evidence of its use in certain specific groups is under investigation and its results should shed light on additional indications.

Place In Therapy

Considering what is currently published on the evidence here reviewed in the use of belimumab in clinical practice it is our understanding that belimumab it will be gradually incorporated in the armamentarium of treatment not necessarily on refractory patients. We believe that with the upcoming of the subcutaneous route in the near future should also help in widen the use of the belimumab to be considered in first line combination set ups.

### Analysis of belimumab prescription and outcomes in a 10-year monocentric cohort: is there an advantage with early use? [^fed053d4]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The therapeutic armamentarium for the disease consists of glucocorticoids (GC), antimalarials, conventional immunosuppressants (IS) and more recently biological drugs.

Belimumab (BEL) is a recombinant, human, monoclonal antibody that binds to and antagonises soluble B-lymphocyte stimulator protein. In 2011, BEL was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adult patients with active, autoantibody-positive SLE who are receiving standard therapy, becoming the first biological agent to be approved for SLE. In Italy, BEL has been available since 2013.

More than 10 years have passed since the approval of BEL, and data accumulating show that BEL treatment is associated with improvements in disease activity, reduction in daily GC dose, reduction in flare incidenceand prevention of damage progression.

In the 2023 update of the EULAR recommendations, in patients with SLE with non-renal disease not responding to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) or unable to reduce GCs below doses acceptable for chronic use (≤ 5 mg/day), the addition of conventional IS drugs or biological drugs (BEL and anifrolumab) is recommended and prior use of conventional IS drugs is not mandatory before initiating a biological agent. However, few data are available on the early use of biological drugs in extrarenal manifestations, especially in IS-naïve patients and the cost-effectiveness of this approach with respect to the traditional step-up has to be fully demonstrated. Starting from these promises, the objectives of this study were to evaluate the therapeutic trajectories of BEL, how these have changed over the years and what impact these changes have had on the achievement of the targets of remission and low disease activity as well as on other clinical outcomes.

### Systemic lupus erythematosus: an update on current pharmacotherapy and future directions [^c5ea0363]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

In the last decade, the development of a number of potential drugs for lupus that target the pathogenesis of the disease at different levels has been witnessed. Despite a number of negative trials during this period, belimumab was recently approved for the treatment of adult seropositive lupus patients with mild-to-moderate disease activity.

Areas Covered

This review summarizes the results of the most recent drug trials in lupus and highlights the aspects that require further refinement and modification in order to facilitate positive results in new drug trials for lupus.

Expert Opinion

The success of a clinical trial depends on the efficacy of the study drug and its appropriate dosing. Several other factors play a major role in the success of trials, including the patient inclusion criteria, the choice of evidence-based study outcomes and endpoints and other aspects of study design that are described in this review.

### Low-dose belimumab for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus at low disease activity: protocol for a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial [^f212e2cd]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease with the features of recurrent disease flares. B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) is a key molecule which is associated with active SLE. Belimumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting BLyS, was the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved biological agent for patients with active SLE. The BLISS-52, BLISS-76 and BLISS-North East Asia (NEA) phase III trials demonstrated that treatment with 10 mg/kg belimumab intravenously on the background of standard of care was effective in reducing disease activity compared with placebo. Post hoc analysis of the BLISS trials also suggested that belimumab was effective in attaining Lupus Low Disease Activity State (LLDAS). Besides, the NEA trial identified that patients in the belimumab group had a significant lower risk of severe flare than that in the placebo group (22% vs 12%, p = 0.0004). Taking a deeper look at the data, the efficacy of 1 mg/kg belimumab was similar with that of 10 mg/kg in terms of both Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Responder Index-4 (SRI-4) and LLDAS, especially in BLISS-76 with longer follow-up.

However, in the real world, besides from reducing disease activity for active patients, prevention of recurrent disease flares is another important clinical problem to be solved in relative stable patients. Keeping lupus in quiescence is of importance for long-term organ protection. Nevertheless, the mechanism of relapse is still unknown, and the contribution of BLyS to lupus flares is yet to explored. As the first FDA-approved biological in SLE, the efficacy of belimumab in patients with low disease activity in prevention of disease flares has not been thoroughly studied.

Here, we try to carry out this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose belimumab in Chinese patients with low-grade SLE.

### Use of biologics in SLE: a review of the evidence from a clinical perspective [^f4ed711e]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

With the explosion in biologics use in rheumatology, newer and smarter ways of using these drugs in different diseases have been advocated. SLE has to date been at the back of the biologics algorithms. Recently, the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Evaluation Agency licensed belimumab for use in SLE, the first drug in > 30 years. A clinical review of the evidence that underlies the use of belimumab and other biologics in SLE reveals possible reasons why the results are not as spectacular as they are in other diseases.

### High-dimensional analysis of T-cell profiling variations following belimumab treatment in systemic lupus erythematosus [^af9d9232]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prognosis of patients with SLE has not fully improved, and long-term prognosis is influenced by organ damage due to disease flares and side effects of therapeutic agents. Against this backdrop, belimumab (BEL), a B-lymphocyte-stimulating factor (BLyS)-specific inhibitor, emerges as a promising therapeutic strategy. Typically integrated into standard therapy, BEL acts to reduce disease activity by inhibiting excessive B-cell activation and proliferation in patients with SLE.BLyS overexpression in SLE has been associated with increased B-cell autoreactivity, suggesting that BEL can modify the autoreactive repertoire of peripheral blood B cells. Accordingly, BEL treatment improves inflammatory conditions caused by autoantibodies and immune complexes. Through this mechanism, BEL has been reported to successfully decrease disease activity, relapse rates and glucocorticoid use.

### Belimumab for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus [^898e33a1]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

In 2011, Belimumab, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against B lymphocyte stimulator, became the first biological agent to be licensed by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) for the use in auto-antibody positive adult Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).

Areas Covered

An overview of the clinical trial data, review of the medical and scientific literature following a MEDLINE search forms the basis of this expert opinion on biological therapy review. The Belimumab International SLE Study Phase III randomized placebo-controlled trials, BLISS-52 and BLISS-76, met the primary endpoint based on the SLE responder index (SRI) at week 52. The trials reported that belimumab 10 mg/kg infusions with standard therapy significantly reduced SLE disease activity compared with placebo with standard therapy.

Expert Opinion

The clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of belimumab indicates a potential role for this drug in achieving disease control, reducing severity of recurrent flares, reducing morbidity and in the long-term achieving a positive long-term impact on quality of life. Belimumab is now being introduced in clinical practice and over the next 5 years data on its use outside the clinical trials will determine its place in SLE management.

### Post-marketing experiences with belimumab in the treatment of SLE patients [^5eb192f9]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Belimumab (Benlysta) is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody that targets and inhibits soluble B-lymphocyte stimulator, also known as B-cell activating factor, a proliferation and survival factor for B cells. The published clinical trials data showed that in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), belimumab effectively reduced peripheral B-cell levels and improved disease activity. This article reviews the belimumab clinical trials and the post-marketing experience with belimumab in the treatment of those lupus patients with persistent active disease despite current standard of care (SOC) therapy.

### Disruption of memory B-cell trafficking by belimumab in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^47554317]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is an autoimmune disease characterized by autoreactive memory B cells (MBCs) production. Belimumab (BEL), an approved biologic agent for active SLE and LN, reduces circulating B cells through neutralization of B-cell-activating factor (BAFF). BAFF inhibition by BEL prevents the inhibition of B-cell apoptosis and the promotion of B-cell differentiation into Ig-producing plasma cells, resulting in decreases in immature and naïve B cells, while sparing MBCs. Autoreactive MBCs, which have a decreased threshold for activation, are likely to be the major contributors to the observed chronic and progressive course in autoimmune diseases like SLE. Indeed, murine studies have reported that MBC survival is independent of BAFF, suggesting secondary humoral immune responses remain intact despite the absence of BAFF. This is further corroborated by the persistence of adequate vaccination responses in BEL-treated patients with SLE. Previous BEL studies indicated that MBCs might not only be spared but increase in circulation, suggesting reduced MBCs in the tissue. This potentially means that MBCs can no longer effectively interact with other immune cells, such as T cells, in well-organized lymphoid structures in the tissues, likely compromising the immune responses. Altogether, little is currently known about the effect of BAFF inhibition on MBCs.

Furthermore, high numbers of MBCs were previously shown to be associated with poor clinical responses to rituximab (RTX) treatment in several autoimmune diseases. Importantly, in patients with SLE and LN, RTX failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo (PBO) in two randomized controlled trials.

Data on BEL's effect on MBC populations are important as circulating autoantibodies persist despite conventional immunosuppressive treatment, even when BEL is employed as an add-on therapy in SLE. This persistence can be explained by either the presence of long-lived autoreactive plasma cells resistant to immunosuppression and BEL, or by residual MBCs capable of mounting an autoimmune response. BAFF mediates sites of survival niches for these long-lived cells, and BEL could potentially interfere with this notorious mechanism of therapy resistance, making MBCs susceptible to therapeutic targeting.

8.1 Pregnancy

Pregnancy Exposure Registry

There is a pregnancy exposure registry that evaluates pregnancy outcomes in women with lupus exposed to BENLYSTA during pregnancy. Healthcare professionals are encouraged to refer patients and pregnant women are encouraged to enroll themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972 or visiting https://mothertobaby.org/ongoing-study/benlysta-belimumab/.

Risk Summary

Available data on use of BENLYSTA in pregnant women, from observational studies, published case reports, and postmarketing surveillance, are insufficient to determine whether there is a drug-associated risk for major birth defects or miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with SLE (see Clinical Considerations). Monoclonal antibodies, such as belimumab, are actively transported across the placenta during the third trimester of pregnancy and may affect immune response in the in utero-exposed infant (see Clinical Considerations). In an animal combined embryo-fetal and pre- and post-natal development study with monkeys that received belimumab by intravenous administration, there was no evidence of fetal harm with exposures approximately 9 times (based on intravenous administration) and 20 times (based on subcutaneous administration) the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). Belimumab-related findings in monkey fetuses and/or infants included reductions of B-cell counts, reductions in the density of lymphoid tissue B-lymphocytes in the spleen and lymph nodes, and altered IgG and IgM titers. The no-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was not identified for these findings; however, they were reversible within 3 to 12 months after the drug was discontinued (see Data). Based on animal data and the mechanism of action of belimumab, the immune system in infants of treated mothers may be adversely affected. It is unknown, based on available data, whether immune effects, if identified, are reversible [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1)].

### Belimumab for the treatment of early diffuse systemic sclerosis: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial [^6a42798f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with belimumab in patients with early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) treated with background mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).

Methods

In this 52-week, investigator-initiated, single-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study, 20 patients with dcSSc recently started on MMF were randomized 1:1 to additionally receive belimumab at 10 mg/kg intravenously or placebo. We assessed safety, efficacy, and differential gene expression.

Results

In the belimumab group, the median modified Rodnan skin thickness score (MRSS) decreased from 27 (interquartile range [IQR] 26.5, 31) to 18 (IQR 11, 23) (P = 0.039). In the placebo group, the median MRSS decreased from 28 (IQR 22, 28) to 21 (IQR 14, 25) (P = 0.023). The median change in MRSS was -10 (IQR -13, -9) in the belimumab group and -3.0 (IQR -15, -1) in the placebo group (P = 0.411). There were no significant differences between the groups in the number of adverse events (AEs). A significant decrease in expression of B cell signaling and profibrotic genes and pathways was observed in patients with improved MRSS in the belimumab group but not in the placebo group.

Conclusion

Patients in both treatment groups experienced significant improvements in MRSS. The median difference was greater in the belimumab group but did not achieve statistical significance in this small pilot study. AEs were similar between the groups. Changes in gene expression were consistent with mechanism of action and showed that clinical response to treatment with belimumab is associated with a significant decrease in profibrotic genes and pathways. Additional studies are needed to determine the role of belimumab in the treatment of dcSSc.

Direct inhibitors of BAFF

Recent progress in the field of rheumatology, sparked by the observation that BAFF serum levels are elevated in multiple auto-immune diseases such as SLE, has led to the development of several direct inhibitors of BAFF. In a phase III randomized controlled trial, belimumab, a fully human mAb against BAFF, has been shown to have a modest effect in patients with active SLE. This has led to the regulatory approval of belimumab for the treatment of SLE by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Another direct inhibitor of BAFF is blisibimod, a fusion protein of four BAFF-binding peptides and the Fc locus of IgG, termed a 'peptibody'. Blisibimod, contrary to BAFF, inhibits the action of both soluble and membrane-bound BAFF. Blisibimod is currently under evaluation in a phase III clinical trial for the treatment of SLE (ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: NCT01395745). Both belimumab and blisibimod have not yet been tested in myeloma models or patients.

Recently, Ely Lilly and Company created a selective fully human IgG4 mAb, tabalumab (LY2127399), with neutralizing activity against both membrane-bound and soluble BAFF. In murine xenograft models, tabalumab showed an anti-MM effect and inhibits osteoclastogenesis. In a phase I study, tabalumab was evaluated combined with bortezomib in relapsed or refractory MM patients. It was well tolerated and capable of inducing a partial response or better in 22/48 patients. Tabalumab is currently undergoing two additional phase I studies (ClinicalTrial.gov identifiers: NCT00689507 and NCT01556438) and a phase II/III trial (ClinicalTrial.gov: NCT01602224) in patients with MM.

For an illustration of the mechanism of action of aforementioned drugs, see Figure 4.

### High-dimensional analysis of T-cell profiling variations following belimumab treatment in systemic lupus erythematosus [^6087c550]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

In order to effectively and rigorously manage SLE immunopathology and promote immunological remission, the overall imbalanced immune response should be rectified towards autoimmune tolerance. Consequently, it becomes imperative to investigate how current therapeutics might be associated with changes in their primary targets and in other pathological immune cells, and identify potential beneficial and detrimental shifts associated with treatments. Considering the undeniable role of T cells in SLE pathogenesis, the expression of the BAFF receptor on these cells, which is targeted by BEL, stands out as particularly significant. BAFF plays a pivotal role in T cell activation and profoundly influences the differentiation of T cell subsets. These insights further underscore the potential therapeutic implications of BEL beyond its primary targets.

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the potential associations between BEL administration and alterations in T cell subpopulation distribution, using mass cytometry to analyse peripheral blood T cells from patients with SLE. Recent studies underscore the significance of T cell roles in SLE pathogenesis. Our findings aim to provide valuable insights into the effects of BEL treatment on T cell dynamics, which could potentially influence future therapeutic strategies.

### Update on belimumab for the management of systemic lupus erythematosus [^901a29d4]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Belimumab is a fully humanised mAb against B lymphocyte stimulator (B-LyS). It is the first biological drug to be licensed and approved by the US FDA and the European Medicines Evaluation Agency for use in combination with standard immunosuppressants in autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The clinical effectiveness and impact of this drug on lupus morbidity and mortality is evaluated in this review.

Areas Covered

An overview of the efficacy and safety of belimumab based on 7-year longitudinal continuation study data from SLE patients enrolled in the Phase II double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 52-week study of belimumab 1, 4 and 10 mg/kg doses and an overview of the open-label 24-week extension of belimumab plus standard immunosuppressant therapy. A review of the current belimumab clinical trials, the experience of belimumab in real-world settings and a description of the impact that belimumab has had on the healthcare quality of life of SLE patients.

Expert Opinion

The emerging clinical data have shed light on the areas in which belimumab is of greatest benefit and areas for further evaluation in clinical trials. It is anticipated that regular updates from ongoing trials of belimumab in SLE, practising physicians, data from the continuation arms of clinical trials and data from international biologics registries will have an influence on the role of belimumab in the management of SLE.

### Safety and efficacy of belimumab plus standard therapy for up to thirteen years in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^1d93de0f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Patients who remained in the study were likely to be those who responded better or tolerated belimumab better than patients who withdrew; hence, the findings may not be representative of all patients with SLE. However, the population who entered the continuation study had similar baseline demographics as that in the double‐blind study population 4, 9. For the large percentage of patients who remained in the study (70.1% at 5 years, 60.1% at 7 years, and 44.3% at 10 years), the results suggest that patients who initially respond to belimumab and continue to receive treatment are likely to experience long‐term benefits with continued or improved disease control.

In conclusion, this study describes the long‐term safety and efficacy of belimumab in patients with SLE. It is the longest study of belimumab to date, with a high percentage of patients receiving treatment for > 10 years. This study provides further safety and efficacy data that are consistent with the data from the phase III long‐term extension studies. It will be important to investigate the effects of stopping belimumab in patients who have achieved stable, long‐term low‐level disease activity; a study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02119156) is under way to investigate this question.

### Belimumab – an anti-BLyS human monoclonal antibody for rheumatoid arthritis [^1bd00c8d]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) is a major regulatory factor that controls the development and survival of B cells. Elevated serum levels of BLyS have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Belimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits BLyS and it is being developed for the treatment of RA. This review aims to summarize up-to-date pharmacological and clinical data of belimumab in the treatment of RA.

Areas Covered

A literature search was performed on PubMed using keywords, including belimumab, LymphoStat-B, benlysta, BLyS inhibitor, rheumatoid arthritis and autoimmune disease. References of relevant studies were searched by hand. Abstracts of international conferences up to October 2012 were also included. Belimumab was well tolerated in the treatment of RA over 24 weeks. It significantly increased American College of Rheumatology (ACR)20 responses at week 24, especially in patients with high disease activity, positive rheumatoid factor, no anti-TNF treatment experience and those who had failed methotrexate therapy. However, belimumab failed to demonstrate significantly improved ACR50 and ACR70 responses in the single Phase II clinical trial of RA.

Expert Opinion

These results suggest that the clinical efficacy of belimumab for RA needs to be further investigated in future clinical trials. Careful patient selection may be necessary for belimumab to achieve optimal clinical outcomes in RA.

### Thorough assessment of the effectiveness of belimumab in a large Spanish multicenter cohort of systemic lupus erythematosus patients [^8192b34d]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Belimumab (BLM) is a monoclonal antibody that works by inhibiting the production of BAFF (B-cell activating factor), previously known as BlyS (B-lymphocyte stimulator), a cytokine that drives the survival and maturation of B cells. Since its approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and more recently in 2019 for the treatment of lupus nephritis (LN) in combination with standard of care, BLM has been extensively studied in clinical trials and observational studies and has shown positive results in reducing disease activity, improving quality of life in SLE patients, and preventing organ damage and flares.

Our study aim is to provide an overview of its current use to treat SLE patients in clinical practice based on a large Spanish multicenter cohort. Specifically, we examine its efficacy in terms of standardized outcomes and drug survival, as well as patient and safety profiles.

### Administration of belimumab prior to standard immunosuppression in patients with early active lupus hinders accrual of new EULAR / ACR criteria within the first 12 months of treatment [^63da9b54]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multitarget therapy and timely use of biologics were shown to improve the outcome of patients with SLE. In fact, earlier and intensified treatment regimens may signify more durable responses and a lower medication burden, thereby improving long-term prognosis. Consistently, recent recommendations for SLE endorse early employment of biologics with or without former traditional immunosuppression in patients refractory to first-line therapy with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and glucocorticoids (GC).

Among biologics licensed for SLE, belimumab (BEL) is a human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody targeting soluble B-lymphocyte stimulator, providing control of disease activity, abating the risk of flares and halting overall damage progression. Growing real-world evidence shows favourable response rates in immunosuppressant-naive patients receiving BEL; however, no firm data regarding the impact of early BEL on disease course are available.

In this study, we aim to explore the effect of early administration of BEL on disease progression in patients with mild early SLE, assessing the accumulation of disease manifestations over time.

### Effect of belimumab on proteinuria and anti-phospholipase A2 receptor autoantibody in primary membranous nephropathy [^1a439ff0]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

Changes in B-cell subsets reflected findings with belimumab treatment in SLE, with significant reductions in naïve B cells and trends towards increases in memory B cells. The decrease in the proportion of activated memory B cells suggests that the memory compartment is less activated following belimumab treatment. Longer-term follow-up is required to ascertain whether this translates into a low relapse rate. Although additional subsets have been analysed (data not shown), the only relationship of note was a strong inverse correlation between a decrease in the number of naïve B cells and PLA2R-Ab remaining at Week 28.

However, the safety profile observed is consistent with the patient population and was in line with the expected safety profile of belimumab. Infections were the most common AEs, but no opportunistic infections occurred and only one serious infection (cellulitis). Patients with NS are at a higher infection risk due to oedema and low serum IgG levels.

In conclusion, this is the first demonstration that belimumab monotherapy in PMN can potentially reduce PLA2R-Ab and proteinuria, together with clinical improvements in serum albumin, cholesterol and IgG. As with SLE, its mechanism of action is likely to be through a reduction in B-cell production of autoantibody and, as such, it avoids the side effects of more general immunosuppression. The data are supportive of further study with belimumab in PMN, either alone or in combination with other therapies.

### Belimumab in the management of systemic lupus erythematosus-an update [^7d6dc58a]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Belimumab is a fully humanised mAb against B lymphocyte stimulator (B-LyS). It is the first biological drug licensed and approved by the US FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in combination with standard immunosuppressants in autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Areas covered: This manuscript evalues the recent data concerning belimumab's safety and clinical effectiveness and its current place in the treatment of SLE. This includes an overview of the recent data coming from the post-hoc analyses of the BLISS trials, real-life experience with belimumab and the accumulating data on its safety. Attention is also paid to the progress made in the identification of predictors of response to belimumab, recent phase I/II/III studies with subcutaneous belimumab, and experience with B cell modulation coming from recent trials with other B cell modulating drugs. Expert opinion: Belimumab currently has its established role in the treatment of patients with SLE with serologic activity and clinical activity namely in mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal domains despite standard of care treatment. Better identification of patients who can benefit from treatment with belimumab is warranted. Data from ongoing studies in lupus nephritis and other data from observational studies are eagerly awaited.

### Phase II randomized trial of rituximab plus cyclophosphamide followed by belimumab for the treatment of lupus nephritis [^0b6b11f9]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

This trial adds to the growing body of literature examining B cell combination therapy in SLE. The recently published single‐arm, proof‐of‐concept SynBiOse trial of rituximab and belimumab in 16 patients with active SLE demonstrated clinical efficacy at week 24 (32). Thirteen participants had LN. The median SLE Disease Activity Index score decreased from 18 at baseline to 2 at week 24, and median proteinuria levels decreased from 2.3 gm/24 hours to 0.7 gm/24 hours. These clinical benefits were noted despite the fact that background treatment with MMF and glucocorticoids was tapered to low levels during the study. The rate of complete renal response was slightly higher in the SynBiOse trial participants compared to that in the CALIBRATE trial. The reasons for this difference are not entirely clear, but are likely multifactorial. Notably, the trial designs and study populations were quite different: 1) SynBiOse participants received higher initial doses of steroids and did not receive concomitant CYC; 2) the definition for complete renal response was more stringent in the CALIBRATE trial; and 3) the racial/ethnic composition of the participants differed. In this regard, the CALIBRATE trial included a racially diverse sample, including 40% of patients being African American, a group underrepresented in the first trials of belimumab (33).

The CALIBRATE trial is an important step in understanding the mechanisms of action of combination therapy with rituximab and belimumab for the treatment of LN in SLE. These findings may lay the foundation for larger trials designed to assess efficacy.

### Belimumab in systemic lupus erythematosus [^695e9814]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

The BAFF/APRIL axis

Improving our understanding of the pathogenesis of SLE is crucial to develop new drugs targeted at particular pathological mechanisms. It is hoped that this may increase efficacy and decrease side effects. The recognition of B cells as central in the pathogenesis of SLE led to the development of several drugs that block their activity, including antibodies to B-cell surface antigens, B-cell toleragens, blockers of co-stimulatory molecules and inhibitors of cytokines with direct effect on B cells.

The BAFF/APRIL axis has been extensively studied as these cytokines are vital to B-cell maturation and survival.BAFF and APRIL act mainly through their soluble form (although BAFF also has a transmembrane form of unknown physiological relevance). They are produced by a number of different cells, most importantly monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells and T cells, and bind to three different receptors on B cells. Both BAFF and APRIL bind to TACI (transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor) and BCMA (B-cell maturation antigen), and BAFF additionally binds to BAFF-receptor (BAFF-R). BAFF binds strongly to BAFF-R and TACI, and APRIL binds strongly to BCMA and weakly to TACI (reviewed in ref.). According to the receptor expression patterns, BAFF may be more important for immature B-cell survival and APRIL for plasmablasts and plasma cells.BAFF-R expression is diminished, but still detectable, on germinal centre B cells whereas it is greatly reduced or absent on plasma cells.

Although the exact role of BAFF/APRIL in autoimmune disorders is not completely understood, several lines of evidence suggest they may make an important contribution. Data from animal studies demonstrated a link between BAFF overexpression and development of SLE. They showed an amelioration of clinical disease in SLE mice following either treatment with a BAFF antagonist or the genetic elimination of BAFF.

Furthermore, in human studies, serum concentration of these cytokines was elevated in a proportion of patients with SLE, and a correlation between BAFF levels and disease activity has been reported.

These data suggest that some patients at least might benefit from BAFF/APRIL blocking therapies.

### Belimumab: review of use in systemic lupus erythematosus [^a3730f05]. Clinical Therapeutics (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Belimumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits B-lymphocyte stimulating protein, was the first biologic agent approved for, and the first drug approved in 55 years for, the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Objective

This article reviews the current research on belimumab and provides recommendations on its use in the treatment of SLE.

Methods

The Cochrane Library, EBSCO, IPA, MEDLINE, and SCOPUS were searched for research published from January 2000 to November 2011, using the search terms belimumab, Benlysta, and Lympho-Stat B. Selection criteria included peer-reviewed original research articles on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetic properties, drug interactions, and clinical efficacy and tolerability of belimumab in the treatment of SLE. Abstracts from the annual meetings of major rheumatology medical organizations and societies were searched and reviewed for new content. Additional information on belimumab was obtained from the manufacturer, from the FDA, and from other sources. MEDLINE was also used to select clinical studies and therapeutic guidelines on SLE therapy.

Results

The literature search identified 1 Phase II and 2 Phase III studies that compared belimumab (1, 4, and 10 mg/kg/dose IV on days 0, 14, and 28; then every 28 days) to placebo in patients with active SLE on concurrent therapies. Patients with active lupus nephritis or neuropsychiatric lupus were excluded. In a Phase II, 52-week study, 24-week mean Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment-Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI) scores were decreased by 19.5% with belimumab versus 17.2% with placebo (P = NS). Median time to first flare was 67 days with belimumab versus 83 days with placebo (P = NS). In seropositive patients, 52-week mean SELENA-SLEDAI scores were decreased by 28.8% with belimumab versus 14.2% with placebo (P < 0.05), and physician's global assessment scores were improved by 32.7% with belimumab versus 10.7% with placebo (P < 0.05). Two Phase III studies were performed in seropositive SLE patients. In a Phase III, 52-week study, the rates of response (a reduction of ≥ 4 points on the SLE Response Index [SRI]) at week 52 were 51% and 58% with belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg/dose, respectively, versus 44% with placebo (both, P < 0.05). In a Phase III, 76-week study, the rates of response, as measured using SRI, at week 52 were 42.8% and 46.5% with belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg/dose versus 35.3% with placebo (P = NS and P < 0.001); at 76 weeks, response rates were 42.1% and 41.4% with belimumab 1 and 10 mg/kg/dose versus 33.8% with placebo (P < 0.05 and P = NS). The tolerability data from these studies did not suggest any overall differences between belimumab and placebo.

Conclusions

Based on the findings from the present review, belimumab appears to be efficacious and generally well-tolerated and in the treatment of SLE other than lupus nephritis or neuropsychiatric lupus. Additional clinical and economics studies are needed to determine the most appropriate place for belimumab in the treatment of SLE.

### New developments in systemic lupus erythematosus [^f0910608]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

In this review, the results of recent and ongoing clinical trials in patients with SLE are discussed. After many unsuccessful trials in the past decade, belimumab was the first biologic specifically designed for SLE that met its primary end point. At the same time, studies on the pathophysiology of SLE have further elucidated the pathways involved in the disease, which has led to the identification of new possible therapeutics and has encouraged the initiation of new trials. These new drugs include biologics that target B cells, T cells and type 1 interferons, and small molecules that inhibit kinases. Other therapeutics aim to restore immunological balance by restoring tolerance. Results from phase II and even phase III trials are promising and it is likely that some of the therapeutics discussed will receive approval in the following years. Hopefully, this will allow for more tailor-made medicine for SLE patients in the future.

### The BAFF / April system in SLE pathogenesis [^8ce9dac4]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by multisystem immune-mediated injury in the setting of autoimmunity to nuclear antigens. The clinical heterogeneity of SLE, the absence of universally agreed clinical trial end points, and the paucity of validated therapeutic targets have, historically, contributed to a lack of novel treatments for SLE. However, in 2011, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody that neutralizes the cytokine TNF ligand superfamily member 13B (also known as B-cell-activating factor of the TNF family [BAFF]), belimumab, became the first targeted therapy for SLE to have efficacy in a randomized clinical trial. Because of its specificity, the efficacy of belimumab provides an opportunity to increase understanding of SLE pathophysiology. Although belimumab depletes B cells, this effect is not as powerful as that of other B-cell-directed therapies that have not been proven efficacious in randomized clinical trials. In this article, therefore, we review results suggesting that neutralizing BAFF can have effects on the immune system other than depletion of B cells. We also identify aspects of the BAFF system for which data in relation to SLE are still missing, and we suggest studies to investigate the pathogenesis of SLE and ways to refine anti-BAFF therapies. The role of a related cytokine, TNF ligand superfamily member 13 (also known as a proliferation-inducing ligand [APRIL]) in SLE is much less well understood, and hence this review focuses on BAFF.

### Function, occurrence and inhibition of different forms of BAFF [^e3886921]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

B cell activating factor (BAFF or BLyS), an important cytokine for B cell survival and humoral immune responses, is targeted in the clinic for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. This review focuses on the structure, function and inhibition profiles of membrane-bound BAFF, soluble BAFF 3-mer and soluble BAFF 60-mer, all of which have distinct properties. BAFF contains a loop region not required for receptor binding but essential for receptor activation via promotion of BAFF-to-BAFF contacts. This loop region additionally allows formation of BAFF 60-mer, in which epitopes of the BAFF inhibitor belimumab are inaccessible. If 60-mer forms in humans, it is predicted to be short-lived and to act locally because adult serum contains a BAFF 60-mer dissociating activity. Cord blood contains elevated levels of BAFF, part of which displays attributes of 60-mer, suggesting a role for this form of BAFF in the development of foetal or neonate B cells.

### Efficacy and safety of subcutaneous belimumab in systemic lupus erythematosus: a fifty-two-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^4cbb9d3f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

A post hoc analysis of the present (BLISS‐SC) study and the pooled BLISS‐52 and BLISS‐76 studies was undertaken to compare only patients with SELENA–SLEDAI scores of ≥ 8 at baseline. In this analysis, the SRI4 responses at week 52 were 63.2% for belimumab 200 mg SC versus 50.0% for placebo and 57.4% for belimumab 10 mg/kg IV versus 41.7% for placebo (data on file; GlaxoSmithKline). While no head‐to‐head comparison between SC and IV belimumab was done, the results of the present study and of this post hoc analysis suggest consistency across the IV and SC studies.

Belimumab SC demonstrated further efficacy benefits, such as reduction of severe flare by 49% over 52 weeks, onset of action as early as week 16, and a shorter time to first SRI4 response that was maintained through week 52 compared with placebo. Significant reductions in severe flare were observed with belimumab 10 mg/kg IV over 52 weeks in the BLISS‐52 study 18 and with belimumab 1 mg/kg IV over 76 weeks in the BLISS‐76 study 17. Onset of action was also comparable to that in the BLISS‐52 and BLISS‐76 studies 17, 18. In addition, more patients in the belimumab SC group were able to reduce their corticosteroid dosage as compared with those in the placebo group, although this reduction did not achieve statistical significance. The decrease in corticosteroid dosage occurred in parallel with the reduction in risk of flare among those who received belimumab treatment compared with placebo. Since only patients receiving a baseline corticosteroid dosage > 7.5 mg/day were eligible for analysis, the absence of statistical significance may reflect insufficient power to detect such a difference in a subgroup of this size. It should be noted that the study design did not mandate or encourage corticosteroid taper, and treatment blinding may have limited the proactive reduction of corticosteroids due to concerns that a patient may have been receiving placebo. The observed reduction in corticosteroid use may therefore not faithfully reflect clinical practice, where a more aggressive approach to corticosteroid tapering might be taken.

Rheumatology key messages
In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), belimumab substantially increased circulating memory B cells (MBCs).
Most prominent increase was in patients with high SLE activity, serologically active or ≤ 18 years old.
Increases in circulating MBCs potentially allow for a more efficient targeting of the B-cell compartment.

### Belimumab in systemic lupus erythematosus [^13c4bf7f]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Belimumab

Belimumab is a monoclonal antibody against BAFF, and is currently the only approved biological for the treatment of SLE.

An initial human study with belimumab (a phase I randomised trial in patients with SLE with mild-to-moderate disease) revealed promising results. The drug was well tolerated and reduced the levels of peripheral B lymphocytes (CD20+ B cells).

Subsequently, Wallace et al conducted a 52-week, phase II trial, in which 449 patients with SLE were randomised to receive placebo or 1, 4 or 10 mg/kg of belimumab. Results showed that the drug was well tolerated and biologically active, as 63–71% of patients experienced a depletion of naïve, activated and plasmacytoid CD20+ B cells, and a decrease in anti-dsDNA titres (p ≤ 0.0017). However, no difference was seen in SELENA–SLEDAI score at week 24 or in the median time to the first flare over 52 weeks, thus this study did not meet primary end points perhaps because approximately 30% of the patients involved in the trial were ANA negative. However, subgroup analyses revealed that patients who were serologically active at baseline had a significant improvement in SELENA-SLEDAI and SF-36 scores at week 52 of belimumab treatment.

### Lessons learned from the failure of several recent trials with biologic treatment in systemic lupus erythematosus [^54dfbb35]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) represents a challenge due to variable disease manifestations, clinical course, and outcome. Long-term outcome in SLE remain unsatisfactory and a search for new therapeutic options is definitely warranted. Despite expectations, most clinical trials performed in SLE and lupus nephritis in the last decade did not reach primary outcome, and the only drug that has been licensed is belimumab.

Areas Covered

Results of negative trials testing monoclonal antibodies and other biologic agents in SLE are briefly summarized. Reasons for the failure of the trials are listed and discussed.

Expert Opinion

Future studies should recruit patients with similar organ involvement, better defined disease manifestations, higher activity, and similar severity. In addition to testing higher efficacy if given as add-on treatment to standard-of-care, the trials should be aimed at reducing dosing, or completely eliminating some parts of the current standard treatment, especially corticosteroids. Median follow-up of the patients should be longer. Moreover, specific biomarkers are needed to help to identify eligible patients and to better define response to treatment. An urgent unmet need is testing these new drugs in patients with severe SLE (including those refractory to current treatment).

5.3 Depression and Suicidality

In controlled clinical trials, depression and suicidality were reported in subjects receiving BENLYSTA [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Assess the risk of depression and suicide considering the patient's medical history and current psychiatric status before treatment with BENLYSTA and continue to monitor patients during treatment. Instruct patients receiving BENLYSTA (and caregivers, if applicable) to contact their healthcare provider if they experience new or worsening depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, or other mood changes. Consider the risk and benefit of continued treatment with BENLYSTA for patients who develop such symptoms.

5.4 Malignancy

There is an increased risk of malignancies with the use of immunosuppressants. The impact of treatment with BENLYSTA on the development of malignancies is not known [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Consider the individual benefit-risk in patients with known risk factors for the development or reoccurrence of malignancy prior to prescribing BENLYSTA. In patients who develop malignancies, consider the risk and benefit of continued treatment with BENLYSTA.

5.5 Immunization

Because of its mechanism of action, BENLYSTA may interfere with the response to immunizations. Live vaccines should not be given for 30 days before or concurrently with BENLYSTA as clinical safety has not been established. No data are available on the secondary transmission of infection from persons receiving live vaccines to patients receiving BENLYSTA or the effect of BENLYSTA on new immunizations.

5.6 Concomitant Use with Other Biologic Therapies

Available data do not support the safety and efficacy of concomitant use of BENLYSTA with rituximab in patients with SLE. An increased incidence of serious infections and post-injection systemic reactions in subjects receiving BENLYSTA concomitantly with rituximab compared to subjects receiving BENLYSTA alone has been observed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The safety and efficacy of BENLYSTA concomitantly with other biologic therapies, including B-cell-targeted therapies, have not been established. Caution should be exercised if BENLYSTA is administered in combination with other biologic therapies [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

### A loop region of BAFF controls B cell survival and regulates recognition by different inhibitors [^e72ec9dc]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

The B cell survival factor (TNFSF13B/BAFF) is often elevated in autoimmune diseases and is targeted in the clinic for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus. BAFF contains a loop region designated the flap, which is dispensable for receptor binding. Here we show that the flap of BAFF has two functions. In addition to facilitating the formation of a highly active BAFF 60-mer as shown previously, it also converts binding of BAFF to TNFRSF13C (BAFFR) into a signaling event via oligomerization of individual BAFF-BAFFR complexes. Binding and activation of BAFFR can therefore be targeted independently to inhibit or activate the function of BAFF. Moreover, structural analyses suggest that the flap of BAFF 60-mer temporarily prevents binding of an anti-BAFF antibody (belimumab) but not of a decoy receptor (atacicept). The observed differences in profiles of BAFF inhibition may confer distinct biological and clinical efficacies to these therapeutically relevant inhibitors.

### New developments in systemic lupus erythematosus [^31375e66]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE is a chronic systemic auto-immune disease that is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. The disease typically affects women of childbearing age and follows a relapsing–remitting course. The prevalence varies from 12 to 150 cases per 100 000 people.

SLE is characterized by the production of autoantibodies against a range of autoantigens including nuclear components, formation of immune complexes and deposition of immune complexes in a variety of organs, leading to inflammation and organ damage. Environmental and hormonal factors are supposed to influence the development of SLE in genetically susceptible individuals by inducing defects in the innate and adaptive immune system. Immune dysregulation in patients with SLE can occur at the level of cytokines, T cells, B cells and macrophages.

The disease often affects the skin, joints, kidneys and blood, but can virtually affect any organ system resulting in a striking clinical heterogeneity. The 5-year survival of patients with SLE has improved from 50% in the 1950s to > 90% since the 1990s, but minimal additional improvement has occurred over the past decades and numerous clinical trials for SLE using biologics targeting a specific pathway failed to reach their primary end points. Only one new drug, belimumab, has been approved for the treatment of SLE in > 60 years. Hydroxychloroquine, glucocorticoids, and the immunomodulatory agents azathioprine, methotrexate and mycophenolate mofetil are currently the most frequently used drugs. In persistently active or flaring extra-renal disease, additional treatment with belimumab is recommended, while rituximab or cyclophosphamide may be considered in severe, organ-threatening or refractory disease.

The array of clinical phenotypes of SLE reflects the complex cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis. Several pathways are involved in each patient but the relative contribution of each pathway varies between individuals. The improved insight into the complex pathogenesis of SLE has inspired the development of multiple clinical trials using new agents directed against recognized targets (Fig. 1). The aim of this review is to discuss the results of recent articles on clinical trials and to summarize ongoing novel clinical trials in patients with SLE (Table 1). 1

### Current and future therapies for SLE: obstacles and recommendations for the development of novel treatments [^dd4038dd]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Belimumab (Benlysta, GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA) is a human monoclonal antibody specific for B-cell activating factor (BAFF) that is approved in the USA, Canada and Europe to treat adult patients with autoantibody-positive SLE whose disease is active despite receiving standard therapy.BAFF was originally identified as a target for SLE because of its required role in mature B-lymphocyte survival. Along with another family member named a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), BAFF promotes plasma cell survival, and it also regulates naïve B-lymphocyte repertoire selection. Overexpression of BAFF leads to SLE-like symptoms in transgenic mouse models, including anti-DNA autoantibody production.BAFF concentrations are elevated for patients with SLE and correlated with lupus disease activity.

The approval of belimumab for the treatment of SLE was based on two phase III studies, BLISS-52 and BLISS-76, which demonstrated safety and efficacy in treating patients with active SLE without lupus nephritis or central nervous system lupus. In the two trials, a greater SLE Responder Index (SRI) response was achieved with belimumab treatment compared with placebo at 52 weeks (BLISS-52: 58% for belimumab 10 mg/kg vs 44% for placebo, P = 0.0006; BLISS-76: 43% for belimumab 10 mg/kg vs 34% for placebo, P = 0.017). Observational cohort studies from the USA, Canada and Europe involving patients with SLE receiving belimumab plus standard of care demonstrated improvements in disease activity and laboratory values with a reduction in GCS use and healthcare resource utilisation through 24 months. More recently, the efficacy of subcutaneous belimumab for moderate-to-severe SLE has been demonstrated.

### Efficacy and safety of epratuzumab in moderately to severely active systemic lupus erythematosus: results from two phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials [^53012014]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

The kinetics of response to epratuzumab are likely to be complex, and its mechanism of action is not fully understood, but based on the phase IIb EMBLEM trial data, the doses chosen were expected to be efficacious 5, 6. It is possible that the doses or dosing regimens adopted in these trials were not optimal. In the phase IIb EMBLEM trial, it was noted that the dose‐response followed a bell‐shaped curve, with the highest dose of medication eliciting a smaller clinical response than more moderate doses 5. The data presented herein do not formally exclude the possibility of a subgroup of responders, but none of the analyses conducted were able to identify this subset, although mean B cell numbers and IgM levels were reduced in epratuzumab‐treated patients.

Clinical trials of biologic agents in SLE have generally been met with failure. To date, only one agent, belimumab, which inhibits the activity of soluble B lymphocyte stimulator, is licensed for use in active and autoantibody‐positive SLE in the US and Europe 21, having met its primary end points in 2 phase III trials 22, 23. Even in these trials, there was a higher than expected placebo response, and one of the trials only just marginally showed a significant difference in favor of belimumab 22, 23. The failure of the EMBODY studies, as well as studies of other agents that have suffered similar fates 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, highlights the tremendous challenges of drug development research in SLE.

Belimumab and atacicept differentially inhibit BAFF 60-mer

The anti-BAFF antibody, belimumab, is reported to inhibit soluble BAFF only. We wondered whether belimumab could target the flap of BAFF to prevent its signaling function. However, both belimumab and atacicept (TACI-Fc) efficiently inhibited Fc-BAFF, an intrinsically cross-linked (and therefore flap-independent) BAFF, indicating that belimumab is unlikely to target only the flap of BAFF (Fig. 6a, b). However, belimumab did not inhibit naturally cleaved human BAFF, even when belimumab was used at concentrations higher than those of atacicept (Fig. 6c, d).

Fig. 6
Belimumab differs from atacicept in that it does not inhibit BAFF 60-mer promptly. BAFF-responsive BAFFR:Fas reporter cells were treated overnight with titrated amounts of the indicated forms of BAFF, in the presence or absence of the inhibitors atacicept or belimumab at fixed concentrations. Cell viability was then monitored. a, b Inhibition of Fc-BAFF by atacicept (a) or belimumab (b).

Panels a, b, e, and f show the mean ± SEM of 5 replicates, panels c and d of duplicate, and panels g, h and i of triplicate measures. The condition without inhibitor is the same in panels a and b, in panels c and d, in panels e and f, and in panels g, h, and i. See also Supplementary Fig. 5

### Safety and efficacy of belimumab plus standard therapy for up to thirteen years in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus [^7f5b0b12]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intravenous (IV) belimumab (10 mg/kg) is approved for the treatment of active, autoantibody‐positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in more than 60 countries, including the US, Japan, and countries in Europe 1, 2, 3. A phase II, placebo‐controlled, dose‐ranging trial (GlaxoSmithKline trial no. LBSL02; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00071487) of IV belimumab administered in conjunction with standard of care (SOC) therapy in 449 patients with active, autoantibody‐positive SLE demonstrated that belimumab was well tolerated through 52 weeks 4. This study also informed the design of phase III trials 5, 6 and the development of the SLE Responder Index (SRI) 7. Two pivotal phase III trials further demonstrated the efficacy and safety of IV belimumab plus SOC therapy for up to 76 weeks 5, 6.

To investigate the long‐term safety and efficacy of belimumab plus SOC therapy, a continuation study of LBSL02 was conducted. Previous interim analyses from this study have shown that belimumab was well tolerated, and disease control was maintained through 7 years 8, 9. Herein we report the final analysis of this study, which is currently the longest SLE therapy study measuring the efficacy and safety of IV belimumab 9, in which patients received treatment with belimumab for up to 13 years.

### B-cell-targeted treatment for multiple sclerosis: mechanism of action and clinical data [^a82d68a7]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Strategies for treating autoimmune disorders are increasingly employing targeted therapies rather than non-specific, multitargeted treatments. Accumulating evidence on the involvement of B lymphocytes in the pathophysiology of autoimmune demyelinating disease has led to a renewed interest in B cells as potential therapeutic targets. In particular, antigen presentation between B cells and T cells, increased trafficking of B cells across the blood-brain barrier, and autoantibodies produced by plasma cells may contribute to the pathophysiology of autoimmune disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Several B-cell-targeted, depletion therapies are currently in development, including rituximab, epratuzumab, diphtheria toxin-single chain Fv (DC2219), belimumab, atacicept, abatacept, and abetimus sodium. Of these agents, only rituximab and abatacept have been evaluated in multiple sclerosis patients. Preliminary results of a phase II trial of rituximab in multiple sclerosis suggest that rituximab is well tolerated and significantly reduces the number of gadolinium enhancing lesions over 24 weeks of treatment. Results of an exploratory analysis suggest the potential promise of abatacept 10 mg/kg for multiple sclerosis. It is expected that future clinical trials will establish a role for B-cell-targeted therapies in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune neurological diseases. This article describes the mechanism of action behind B-cell-targeted depletion therapies in development and reviews available clinical data.

### Treatment targets in SLE: remission and low disease activity state [^247b27bf]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of T2T endpoints in clinical trials

When compared with other rheumatic diseases, there has been a considerable lag in the development of effective targeted therapies for treatment of SLE. Of the multiple potential therapeutic agents in the clinical trial pipeline, only two have managed to hit Phase III trial primary endpoints in the last 8 years. Belimumab, an antibody blocking B-lymphocyte stimulation, reached statistical significance in two Phase III trials, particularly in serologically active patients with musculoskeletal and mucocutaneous disease. However, the absolute effect size of belimumab over placebo as measured by the SLE responder index (SRI) appears to be small, suggesting both the need for a more robust endpoint to better discriminate responders from non-responders and the need for therapies with different mechanisms of action. Anifrolumab, an antibody to the type I interferon receptor, achieved the primary endpoint of the British Isles Composite Lupus Assessment (BICLA) in a second pivotal Phase III trial.

### Effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of belimumab in patients with refractory SLE: a review of observational clinical-practice-based studies [^90cb4170]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, autoimmune disorder of unknown etiology that can virtually involve any organ system of the body.

Conventional drugs for the treatment of SLE include antimalarials, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants. Despite the advances in the treatment, patients with SLE still have an unsatisfactory long-term prognosis. Due to persistent disease activity or disease flares, a high percentage of patients require long-term corticosteroid and/or immunosuppressive treatment, which leads to progressive damage accrual and worsening of quoad vitam and quoad valetudinem prognosis.

Recent studies on SLE treatment have mainly been focused on two directions: new therapeutic strategies, such as treat-to target, and new targeted therapies.

Unlike rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis, biologic therapy is still limited in lupus. Several biologics have been tested in recent years, targeting both the adaptive and the innate immune system. Despite the encouraging evidences provided by case series and clinical-practice-based uncontrolled studies, the majority of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) did not achieve the primary endpoint, thereby committing physician to off-label use of targeted therapies in SLE. To date, the only biological drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) is belimumab (Benlysta®, GSK, United Kingdom), a fully-human IgG1-λ monoclonal antibody which selectively binds and inhibits soluble BLyS.

BLyS (B lymphocyte stimulator) is a 250 amino acid protein that plays an important role in the development, selection, and survival of B cells. The rationale behind indirect targeting of B cells by BLyS, rather than direct targeting by a CD20-based approach, is to preferentially suppress pathogenic B cells, without affecting the protective role of lymphocytes against infections. There are indeed strong evidences, both in mice and in humans, that BLyS could contribute to the loss of tolerance in SLE: The excess concentration of BLyS inhibits the physiological apoptosis of low-affinity self-reactive B cells and promotes their pathological differentiation into autoantibody-producing plasma cells. In contrast, there is no evidence that autoreactive B cells are more sensitive than non-autoreactive B cells to CD20-based depletion. The clinical trials began in late 2001 and belimumab was finally approved in 2011, after the encouraging results of two randomized-controlled phase III trials (BLISS-52 and BLISS-76).

### Effectiveness of belimumab after rituximab in systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomized controlled trial [^c114b981]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

B-cell depletion with rituximab is commonly used for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that is refractory to conventional therapy, but it yields variable responses. We hypothesized that high B-cell activating factor (BAFF) levels after rituximab can cause disease flares, thereby limiting its effectiveness.

Objective

To obtain preliminary evidence for efficacy of the anti-BAFF therapeutic belimumab after rituximab in SLE.

Design

Phase 2, randomized, double-blind (patients, assessors, researchers, care providers), placebo-controlled, parallel-group, superiority trial. (ISRCTN: 47873003).

Setting

England.

Participants

Fifty-two patients who had SLE that was refractory to conventional treatment and whose physicians had recommended rituximab therapy were recruited between 2 February 2017 and 28 March 2019.

Intervention

Participants were treated with rituximab and 4 to 8 weeks later were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous belimumab or placebo for 52 weeks.

Measurements

The prespecified primary end point was serum IgG anti-double-stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibody levels at 52 weeks. Secondary outcomes included incidence of disease flares and adverse events.

Results

At 52 weeks, IgG anti-dsDNA antibody levels were lower in patients treated with belimumab compared with placebo (geometric mean, 47 [95% CI, 25 to 88] vs. 103 [CI, 49 to 213] IU/mL; 70% greater reduction from baseline [CI, 46% to 84%]; P < 0.001). Belimumab reduced risk for severe flare (BILAG-2004 grade A) compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.27 [CI, 0.07 to 0.98]; log-rank P = 0.033), with 10 severe flares in the placebo group and 3 in the belimumab group. Belimumab did not increase incidence of serious adverse events. Belimumab significantly suppressed B-cell repopulation compared with placebo (geometric mean, 0.012 [CI, 0.006 to 0.014] vs. 0.037 [CI, 0.021 to 0.081] × 10 9 /L) at 52 weeks in a subset of patients (n = 25) with available data.

Limitations

Small sample size; biomarker primary end point.

Conclusion

Belimumab after rituximab significantly reduced serum IgG anti-dsDNA antibody levels and reduced risk for severe flare in patients with SLE that was refractory to conventional therapy. The results suggest that this combination could be developed as a therapeutic strategy.

### Reductions in circulating B cell subsets and immunoglobulin G levels with long-term belimumab treatment in patients with SLE [^6869b3a2]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

SLE, a chronic autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs, is driven by the abnormal activation of B and T lymphocytes, and is associated with elevated titres of autoantibodies.B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS; also known as B cell activating factor, or BAFF) is a ligand of the tumour necrosis factor cytokine family that is expressed as membrane-bound or soluble protein. BLyS is a vital B cell survival factor with important roles in B cell maturation and Ig class switching and production. Overexpression of BLyS is thought to be linked to the pathogenesis of SLE and other autoimmune diseases, and increased concentrations of circulating BLyS are correlated with worsening SLE disease activity that is indicative of mild-to-moderate flares. Furthermore, elevated (≥ 2 ng/mL) levels of BLyS were found to be predictive of SLE flares in a post hoc analysis of BLISS-52 and BLISS-76 belimumab trials.

Belimumab is a human IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that is approved in the USA, the European Union, and Japan for the treatment of patients ≥ 5 years of age with active, autoantibody-positive SLE receiving standard therapy. Recently, belimumab was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with active lupus nephritis receiving standard therapy. Belimumab inhibits the activity of soluble BLyS and may restore the ability of autoimmune B cells to undergo apoptosis in a partially selective manner, ultimately leading to reduced SLE disease activity. Previous studies of up to 76 weeks (1.5 years) of belimumab therapy have demonstrated a sustained reduction in Ig levels and in several circulating B cell subsets, including naïve and activated B cells. Concurrently, reductions in SLE Responder Index (SRI-4), including Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment version of the SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA-SLEDAI), newly occurring British Isles Lupus Assessment Group A and B organ domain scores, Physician's Global Assessment, and incidence rate of severe flares were observed.

### Safety and efficacy of belimumab in older adults with SLE: results of an integrated analysis of clinical trial data [^baa22715]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Older adults with SLE have high unmet needs due to comorbidities and increased risk of treatment toxicities, as well as greater damage accrual and higher mortality rates versus early-onset SLE. Although disease activity of patients with true late-onset SLE may differ from older patients who developed SLE earlier in life, these risks will remain.

Belimumab has demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with SLE. Due to low numbers of older adults within clinical trials and the low SLE incidence in this age group, data on the use of belimumab in this population are limited. The objectives of this analysis were to assess the safety and efficacy of belimumab in older adults with SLE.

Drug Administration Amendments Act and the Pediatric Research Equity Act. This review focuses on all unlabeled adverse events associated with belimumab in pediatric patients.

1. 1 PEDIATRIC REGULATORY HISTORY Belimumab is a B-lymphocyte stimulator -specific inhibitor, approved by the FDA on. receiving standard therapy. This review was prompted by the pediatric labeling change on April 26, 2019, that expanded the indication from adults to pediatric patients aged 5 years and older with active, autoantibody- positive SLE who are receiving standard therapy. The determination of efficacy in pediatric patients was based on pharmacokinetic and. efficacy results from a pediatric SLE study, as well as PK exposure and extrapolation of the established efficacy of belimumab plus standard therapy from the Phase 3 intravenous studies in adults; the adverse event profile in pediatric patients aged 5 years and older were consistent with those observed in adults.

If confirmed, consider discontinuation of immunosuppressant therapy, including BENLYSTA.  Hypersensitivity Reactions, including Anaphylaxis: Serious and fatal reactions have been. Intravenous administration of BENLYSTA in patients with SLE is indicated in children aged 5 years and older. Determination of efficacy in pediatric patients was based on pharmacokinetic and efficacy results from a pediatric SLE study, as well as PK exposure and extrapolation of the established efficacy of BENYLSTA plus standard therapy from the Phase 3 intravenous. studies in adults with SLE.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, PK, efficacy, and safety study to evaluate intravenously administered BENLYSTA 10 mg/kg plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy over 52 weeks was conducted in 93 pediatric patients with SLE. The proportion of pediatric patients achieving an SRI-4 response was higher.

### Recent advances in the biologic therapy of lupus: the 10 most important areas to look for common pitfalls in clinical trials [^5032672b]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease affecting different organs. The improved knowledge of the disease's pathogenesis has contributed to the emergence of immune targets and new biologic drugs directed at them. Although rheumatologists continue to use off-label biologics in SLE resistant to other immunosuppressants, only belimumab has been approved as a biological therapy since 2011.

Areas Covered

In this review, an overview is provided on: 1) the classification of the biologic drugs in clinical trials and of those under research; 2) the results of clinical trials of biologic therapy with an interpretation of pitfalls and syntheses of potential approaches to overcome these pitfalls and, 3) the commonly used disease activity metrics and composite indices for assessing response to drugs.

Expert Opinion

Some drugs that have failed in previous drug trials have shown to be efficacious in the treatment of lupus in observational studies. Moreover, the post-hoc analyses of the data of negative drug trials have shown that results of the same trials could be altered with the modification of some pitfalls. For future clinical trials, the consideration of these pitfalls is crucial when designing clinical trials. This could potentially enhance the approval of novel drugs for SLE.

Evaluation of standard-of-care SLE therapeutics in mouse models

To date, only a handful of drugs have been approved for the treatment of SLE. In the 1950s, the US Food and Drug Administration approved aspirin, CSs and the antimalarial drug HCQ as non-specific treatments for SLE. These drugs were not approved following clinical trials, but based on clinical experience and eminence-based intuition. It took nearly 60 years of research before the approval of the next therapeutic and first targeted biologic, belimumab, in 2011. Additionally, several off-label agents were introduced to SLE therapy, predominantly systemic immunosuppressants such as CYC, MTX and MMF. Despite being the pillars of SLE treatment, their mechanisms of action are not completely understood. NZB/W and MRL/ lpr models have been extensively used to study these mechanisms and to evaluate side effects, dosage regimens and response to treatment, especially the ability to delay or prevent renal disease.

### Pragmatic approaches to therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus [^a3e6f0be]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex autoimmune disease with substantial clinical heterogeneity. Current treatments for SLE are effective at reducing morbidity and mortality but fail to provide a cure, and they frequently have adverse effects. Traditional treatments include NSAIDs and antimalarial agents, which are the first-line therapies for mild SLE. In addition, glucocorticoids and cytotoxic or immunosuppressive agents — such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine and methotrexate — are used for SLE with organ involvement. Advances in understanding the immunopathogenesis of SLE have led to the development of targeted immunotherapies, such as the anti-BAFF antibody belimumab, which has been approved as an add-on therapy for patients who have active disease despite receiving standard therapy. This Review presents an overview of the current therapies and nonpharmacological management approaches for SLE, and discusses the best approaches for treating specific disease manifestations such as lupus nephritis, neuropsychiatric lupus and cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

Discussion

SLE is a complicated systemic autoimmune disease. Numerous targeted treatments, such as type I interferon blockers, anti-interleukin-12/23 and Janus kinase inhibitors, have been tested aiming to control or reduce disease activity in patients with active SLE in the past decade. The efficacy measurements, therefore, are largely based on disease activity indexes, such as SRI (SLEDAI dominant) or BICLA(BILAG-based Composite Lupus Assessment). Belimumab is the first FDA-approved biologics for active lupus with a time-merit robustness of clinical evidence.

It is noteworthy that only few trials designated to address flare prevention as the primary endpoint in lupus, which is another key question in the management of SLE. According to our previous randomised trials and retrospective studies, on the background of standard of care, the annual flare risk of a patient with low-grade SLE (SLEDAI ≤ 6) was still approximately 30%–40%, indicating the unmet needs in clinical practice. Whether belimumab could serve as a flare-prevention tool among patients with SLE with low-grade disease is yet to be explored in a serious randomised controlled trial. The dosage of belimumab used in the current trial is based on the data of BLISS-52, BLISS-76 trials and their post hoc analysis, where the efficacy of both 1 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg belimumab was evaluated. Only a slight lower rate of SRI-4 and LLDAS attainment was observed in patients treating with 1 mg/kg belimumab compared with 10 mg/kg, especially in BLISS-76 with longer follow-up (SRI-4, 40.7% vs 43.2%; LLDAS 11.6% vs 14.4%). Thus, a fix dose of 120 mg, that is, approximately 2 mg/kg of belimumab is decided by investigators in the current clinical trial.

### Belimumab and antimalarials combined against renal flares in patients treated for extra-renal systemic lupus erythematosus: results from 4 phase III clinical trials [^6820d835]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

In our analysis, patients allocated to i.v. belimumab 1 mg/kg exhibited the lowest incidence rate of renal flares as well as the most consistent and pronounced protective effect in survival analysis across the different belimumab formulations. It could be hypothesized that belimumab pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics lie under this observation. In the subgroup of patients with active LN and elevated proteinuria levels, in whom belimumab clearance is expected to be higher, high-dose i.v. belimumab (10 mg/kg) has been shown to be effective. In contrast, in the subgroup of patients with active extra-renal SLE and lower proteinuria levels, in whom belimumab clearance is comparatively lower, lower doses of belimumab may exert an optimal protection against renal flares. In this respect, one investigator-initiated RCT testing the efficacy of i.v. belimumab doses lower than 10 mg/kg (120 mg as a fixed dose) on flare prevention is currently ongoing in China.

Several cases of de novo LN in patients treated with the approved dose of belimumab for reasons other than nephritis have been reported. It has been speculated that these observations may be due to potential suppressive effects of belimumab on B cells that acquire regulatory properties at active SLE, partly based on observations that serum levels of IL-10 decreased prominently and rapidly upon belimumab treatment in SLE patients from Sweden. Nevertheless, despite an increasing understanding of the immunological effects exerted by belimumab, its influence on regulatory B-cell populations remains unknown. Differential effects of different belimumab doses on B-cell subpopulations may shed light on the mechanisms underlying our observations.

In our subgroup analysis of patients with renal BILAG E at baseline (i.e. no current or prior renal involvement), < 1% of the study participants developed renal flares during the study period, and no signals of elevated risk for renal flares among patients receiving belimumab were detected. There are several differences between the aforementioned real-world observational studies and the RCT population of the present study regarding patient populations, definitions of outcomes, and study design, including the lack of a placebo-receiving control group in the reported case series. Nevertheless, in the highly selected RCT population of the present study, patients receiving belimumab for active extra-renal SLE were not found to be at an increased risk of developing de novo LN during the first 52–76 weeks of treatment.
