## Question

Does central thrombocytosis cause macrocytosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether central thrombocytosis causes macrocytosis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of "central thrombocytosis" and "macrocytosis". Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of thrombocytosis in clonal versus reactive settings. Next, I will examine mechanisms of macrocytosis and whether they plausibly arise from thrombocytosis per se. After that, I should review population and disease-specific data for any direct causal links or merely associations. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and outline practical clinical implications for evaluation when both findings coexist.

> Let me first confirm the definitions so I don't conflate terms. Central thrombocytosis generally refers to a clonal, primary thrombocytosis such as essential thrombocythemia (ET), driven by megakaryocytic proliferation with JAK2/CALR/MPL mutations, rather than reactive secondary thrombocytosis from iron deficiency, inflammation, or splenectomy, and ET is defined by sustained platelets ≥ 450×10⁹/L with clonal driver mutations after excluding other myeloid neoplasms. Macrocytosis is typically defined as MCV > 100 fL and reflects larger-than-normal red cell volume, which can be megaloblastic from B12/folate deficiency or non-megaloblastic from reticulocytosis, liver disease, alcohol, medications, or myelodysplasia, among other causes.

> Now, I need to check the pathophysiology of thrombocytosis to see if there is a direct mechanism that would enlarge red cells. In ET, constitutive JAK–STAT signaling drives megakaryocyte proliferation and platelet production; thrombopoietin physiology supports this lineage-specific drive and does not directly govern erythroid size control, which is more tightly linked to nuclear-cytoplasmic maturation, hemoglobin synthesis, and membrane/cytoskeletal integrity rather than megakaryopoiesis signaling [^112k81Zq] [^114kde5i] [^111bDP7o]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — could cytokine spillover indirectly alter RBC size? Even if TPO has pan-hematopoietic stem cell effects, there is no established mechanism whereby TPO-driven megakaryocytic proliferation would systematically increase RBC MCV, so a direct causal link remains implausible mechanistically.

> Next, I should review what causes macrocytosis to ensure I'm not missing a bridge from thrombocytosis to larger RBCs. True macrocytosis arises from impaired DNA synthesis (B12/folate deficiency, certain drugs), altered hydration or membrane composition, or reticulocytosis; spurious causes include cold agglutinins, hyperglycemia, and extreme leukocytosis, none of which are explained by platelet overproduction itself [^111bDP7o] [^115bpJKG]. Wait, let me verify whether clonal hematopoiesis or specific mutations could link the two indirectly; SF3B1 mutations can associate with elevated MCV, but that reflects dysplastic erythropoiesis rather than thrombocytosis per se causing macrocytosis, reinforcing that any association is lineage-intrinsic rather than a direct effect of high platelet counts on RBC size [^116H8bsd] [^115HYhi9].

> I will now examine the clinical evidence for a direct causal relationship. Population-based cohorts show macrocytosis and thrombocytosis can co-occur, but macrocytosis is not causally linked to thrombocytosis; rather, both may reflect underlying clonal hematopoiesis or dysplasia, and importantly, macrocytosis was not associated with clonal hematopoiesis overall in some analyses, while SF3B1-related cases were an exception, underscoring mutation-specific rather than platelet-count–driven biology [^116H8bsd] [^115HYhi9]. Hold on, I should double-check the overlap data; minimal overlap between high RDW/macrocytosis cohorts and macrocytosis alone further argues against a causal thrombocytosis–macrocytosis axis, supporting independent or parallel processes rather than causation [^116jHfFC].

> Let me consider disease-specific contexts where both can appear together without implying causality. In myelodysplastic syndromes, macrocytic anemia is common and some subtypes (e.g., 5q−) can feature thrombocytosis, but the macrocytosis stems from ineffective erythropoiesis and nuclear-cytoplasmic asynchrony, not from the elevated platelet count itself; likewise, overlap MDS/MPN syndromes may show both features due to multilineage clonal dysfunction rather than platelets driving RBC enlargement [^114EUrzm] [^111k9TQ8] [^113VtTxR]. But wait, what if reactive thrombocytosis from iron deficiency confuses this? Iron deficiency causes reactive thrombocytosis and, if anything, microcytosis, not macrocytosis, so the directionality is opposite and again argues against thrombocytosis causing macrocytosis [^116116vp] [^116Dsjse].

> I should confirm whether any authoritative reviews or guidelines assert a causal link. Comprehensive reviews of ET emphasize clonal megakaryocytic proliferation and thrombotic/bleeding risks without describing macrocytosis as a disease feature or consequence of thrombocytosis, and macrocytosis reviews enumerate causes that do not include thrombocytosis, aligning with the absence of a causal relationship in standard teaching and references [^112k81Zq] [^111bDP7o]. Hmm, wait a minute, could I be overlooking a niche mechanism? I briefly wondered about cytokine-mediated stress erythropoiesis, but reticulocytosis-associated macrocytosis reflects larger immature RBCs, not an effect of platelet overproduction, so that line of thought does not establish causality from thrombocytosis to macrocytosis either [^115bpJKG].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I need to ensure my bottom line is precise. Central (clonal) thrombocytosis does not cause macrocytosis; when both coexist, they reflect independent biology or a shared underlying process such as clonal hematopoiesis, myelodysplasia, liver disease, alcohol, medications, or nutritional deficiency, rather than a direct effect of elevated platelet counts increasing RBC size [^116H8bsd] [^111bDP7o]. Clinically, if both are present, I should confirm true macrocytosis with smear and reticulocyte count, evaluate for B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, hypothyroidism, alcohol/medications, and consider clonal marrow disease when cytopenias, dysplasia, or adverse mutations are present, while remembering that reactive thrombocytosis from iron deficiency yields microcytosis, not macrocytosis [^111bDP7o] [^115bpJKG] [^115HbiS5].

---

Central thrombocytosis does not directly cause macrocytosis. Macrocytosis in thrombocytosis is usually due to **coexisting factors** such as myelodysplastic syndromes, vitamin B12/folate deficiency, liver disease, or medication effects [^111bDP7o]. In essential thrombocythemia, platelets are typically normal in size, and macrocytosis is not a defining feature [^112k81Zq]. If macrocytosis is present, evaluate for **underlying causes** — including nutritional deficiencies, liver disease, and myelodysplastic syndromes — rather than attributing it to thrombocytosis alone [^114EUrzm].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms of macrocytosis

Macrocytosis reflects **increased RBC size** (MCV > 100 fL) and arises from several mechanisms:

- **Impaired DNA synthesis**: Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency causes megaloblastic anemia with macrocytosis [^111bDP7o].
- **Increased reticulocytosis**: Reticulocytes are larger than mature RBCs, raising MCV [^115bpJKG].
- **Liver disease**: Altered lipid metabolism and membrane composition cause macrocytosis.
- **Medications**: Hydroxyurea, zidovudine, and others can cause macrocytosis [^11257GV6].

---

## Relationship between central thrombocytosis and macrocytosis

Central thrombocytosis is a clonal megakaryocytic proliferation (e.g. essential thrombocythemia) and does not directly cause macrocytosis. Macrocytosis is not a hallmark of ET; when present, it reflects **coexisting conditions** such as myelodysplastic syndromes, vitamin deficiencies, liver disease, or medication effects [^112k81Zq].

---

## Clinical evidence and studies

Clinical studies and case reports show that macrocytosis in thrombocytosis is usually due to **coexisting conditions**:

- **Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)**: MDS often presents with macrocytic anemia and thrombocytosis due to ineffective erythropoiesis and dysmegakaryopoiesis [^111k9TQ8].
- **Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency**: Common causes of macrocytosis, often coexisting with thrombocytosis [^notfound].
- **Liver disease**: Frequently associated with macrocytosis and thrombocytosis.
- **Medication-induced macrocytosis**: Hydroxyurea, zidovudine, and others can cause macrocytosis [^11257GV6].

---

## Diagnostic implications

When macrocytosis coexists with thrombocytosis, a **comprehensive evaluation** is essential:

- **Evaluate for myelodysplastic syndromes**: Bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetic analysis may be necessary [^1166mbw3].
- **Assess nutritional status**: Vitamin B12 and folate levels should be measured [^111bDP7o].
- **Evaluate liver function**: Liver function tests and imaging may be indicated.
- **Review medication history**: Identify potential drug-induced macrocytosis [^11257GV6].

---

## Clinical management

Management focuses on **treating the underlying cause** of macrocytosis while managing thrombocytosis:

- **Treat nutritional deficiencies**: Vitamin B12 or folate supplementation.
- **Manage liver disease**: Address underlying hepatic conditions.
- **Adjust medications**: Discontinue or modify causative drugs when possible.
- **Manage thrombocytosis**: Cytoreductive therapy (e.g. hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha) may be indicated for high-risk patients [^1131VoXA].

---

Central thrombocytosis does not directly cause macrocytosis; macrocytosis in this setting reflects **coexisting conditions** such as myelodysplastic syndromes, vitamin deficiencies, liver disease, or medication effects. Accurate diagnosis and management require a thorough evaluation of these underlying causes.

We next questioned whether the triad of macrocytosis, CH and a blood count abnormality represents a more profound disturbance of haematopoiesis. Macrocytosis was associated with only a subtle increase in the prevalence of blood count abnormalities (e.g. anaemia 7.4% vs. 4.2%, p = 0.082; thrombocytopenia 5.8% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.018; Figure 3H, Table S7). The triad of macrocytosis, CH and a concurrent blood count abnormality showed no distinct mutational patterns, except for a higher prevalence of SF3B1 mutations (p = 0.007; Figure 3I, Figure S5). This triad (n = 24) associated with inferior survival (HR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.39–6.98, p = 0.006; Figure 3J) and from this subgroup of individuals, 13% were diagnosed with haematological malignancies over a median follow‐up of 7.0 years (Table S6).

Some familial platelet disorders are associated with predisposition to leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or dyserythropoietic anemia. We identified a family with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia, high erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and two occurrences of B cell-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous single-nucleotide change in ETV6 (ets variant 6), c.641C > T, encoding a p. Pro214Leu substitution in the central domain, segregating with thrombocytopenia and elevated MCV. A screen of 23 families with similar phenotypes identified 2 with ETV6 mutations. One family also had a mutation encoding p. Pro214Leu and one individual with ALL. The other family had a c.1252A > G transition producing a p. Arg418Gly substitution in the DNA-binding domain, with alternative splicing and exon skipping. Functional characterization of these mutations showed aberrant cellular localization of mutant and endogenous ETV6, decreased transcriptional repression and altered megakaryocyte maturation. Our findings underscore a key role for ETV6 in platelet formation and leukemia predisposition.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

RESULTS

Macrocytosis and a highare associated with an increased risk of developing haematological malignancies

To evaluate the risk of incident haematological malignancies for individuals with abnormal red blood cell or platelet morphology, we analysed all individuals ≥ 60 years in the population‐based Lifelines cohort with available blood cell cytometric data (total n = 17 588; Figure 1). Macrocytosis and a high RDW are associated with an increased risk of developing haematological malignancies (MCV > 100 fL: hazard ratio [HR], 5.11; 95% confidence interval, 2.75–9.49, p < 0.001 and RDW ≥ 16%: HR, 6.49; 95% CI, 3.57–11.81, p < 0.001) and inferior overall survival (Figure 2A, B, Figure S3). The association between macrocytosis and incident haematological malignancies remained after correction for vitamin B12 deficiency and smoking (Table S2). Cause of death analysis revealed that the excess death rate of individuals with a high RDW was predominantly accounted for by CH‐associated causes, including cardiovascular death, death from haematological malignancies and death from solid cancers (Figure 2C, Table S3). For individuals with macrocytosis, death could not be attributed to a specific cause. Abnormal elevated MPV or PDW, markers of a disturbed platelet morphology, was not associated with overall survival nor the risk of developing haematological malignancies. However, cause of death analysis revealed both parameters to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death (Figure 2C).

DISCUSSION

Identifying individuals at high risk of progression to haematological malignancy remains a challenge in clinical practice. As was first indicated in a comprehensive analysis of the UK Biobank population by Weeks et al.peripheral cell morphological alterations may reflect an early disruption in haematopoiesis. In their clonal haematopoiesis risk score, the authors assigned the same statistical weight to morphological alterations of red blood cells (both macrocytosis and a high RDW) and a set of high‐risk gene mutations while the prognostic value of cytopenia, number of mutations and clone size was estimated to be lower.

Data on the association between MCV and CH remain inconclusive, with different findings across population‐based studies. In our cohort, macrocytosis did not associate with CH in terms of prevalence, clone size and number and type of mutated genes, also after correction for potential confounders. Cause of death analyses revealed no specific enrichment of disease categories and macrocytosis associated with a higher risk of haematological malignancy development and inferior overall survival with and without concomitant presence of CH. We speculate that macrocytosis may serve as a surrogate measure for an overall adverse health status or common risk factors, that may be mostly independent of CH or blood count abnormalities. While gene‐specific analysis of high‐risk mutated genes in CH was limited due to the low prevalence of these mutations in the general population, we found a specific association between macrocytosis and SF3B1 mutations that persisted independently of blood count alterations. These findings are in line with previously reported data obtained from population‐based studies, MDS patients and mice with mutated sf3b1.

### Classification and molecular biology of polycythemias (erythrocytoses) and thrombocytosis [^115FS2K1]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In this article, polycythemic disorders are classified based on the current understanding of biology of erythropoieses and divided into primary and secondary polycythemias. Special emphasis is given to recently uncovered molecular bases of newly described congenital polycythemic disorders. This clarification of the pathophysiology of some of the congenital polycythemic states has obvious utility for more accurate diagnosis and rational prognostic determination. The molecular basis of congenital thrombocytoses is only beginning to be uncovered. In contrast, the molecular bases of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia remain unknown, thus their diagnostic criteria are imprecise and their treatment remains largely empirical. The central premise of this article is that deciphering the molecular basis of human diseases leads to improved understanding of hematopoiesis, precise diagnosis, and the potential for development of a specific therapy.

### Management of MPN beyond JAK2 [^111qoYsh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis has a large number of potential underlying causes, but the dominant group of hematological conditions for consideration in this setting are the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In this chapter, we consider several key linked questions relating to the management of thrombocytosis in MPNs and discuss several issues. First, we discuss the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis, which myeloid disorders to consider, and practical approaches to the discrimination of each individual MPN from other causes. Second, there have been several major advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of these conditions and we discuss how these findings are likely to be practically applied in the future. Third, we consider whether there is evidence that thrombocytosis contributes to the complications known to be associated with MPN: thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to leukemia and myelofibrosis. Last, we review current ideas for risk stratification and management of essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera as the 2 entities within the MPN family that are most frequently associated with thrombocytosis.

### Clonal haematopoiesis associates with distinct cytometric changes of red blood cells and platelets [^116jHfFC]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

High RDW was associated with blood count abnormalities, including anaemia (p < 0.001), thrombocytosis (p < 0.001) and leucocytosis (p = 0.037) (Figure 4H, Table S10). These individuals, and not those with an isolated high RDW, had a higher VAF and higher prevalence of TET2 and JAK2 mutations (Figure 4I, Figure S8). The triad of high RDW, CH and a blood count abnormality was associated with markedly inferior overall survival (HR, 5.24; 95% CI, 2.71–10.12; p < 0.001; Figure 4J). A blood count abnormality in multiple lineages was observed in 27.4% of individuals with this triad, and 7.9% of individuals with the triad were diagnosed with a haematological malignancy during a median follow‐up of 3.8 years (Table S6). Interestingly, individuals with CH and a blood count abnormality (representative of clonal cytopenia of unknown significance [CCUS]), but in the absence of a high RDW, had no inferior overall survival (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.16–3.10; p = 0.64). There was minimal overlap between individuals with a high RDW and macrocytosis (4.13%, p = 0.21) and only 2/15 individuals with a high RDW who developed a haematological malignancy had macrocytosis. In addition to somatic mutations, mosaic chromosomal abnormalities (mCAs) may also confer a fitness advantage, leading to the expansion of a haematopoietic clone and the development of CH. While we could not assess all mCAs, we evaluated the prevalence of loss of chromosome Y (LoY) based on previously generated data. Among 74 individuals from the high RDW cohort and 41 individuals from the macrocytosis cohort, no significant differences in the prevalence of LoY were found (Table S11).

Summary

Individuals with macrocytosis or a high RDW are at increased risk of developing haematological malignancies. The mechanisms that mediate this association remain unknown but may involve the presence of clonal haematopoiesis (CH). Here, we performed targeted next‐generation sequencing on all individuals ≥ 60 years with macrocytosis (MCV > 100 fL; n = 269) or high RDW (RDW ≥ 16%; n = 242) and 1:2 age‐ and sex‐matched controls from the population‐based Lifelines cohort. Macrocytosis is not associated with CH or peripheral blood count abnormalities. In contrast, individuals with a high RDW were associated with an increased number of mutated genes, larger clone sizes and a high prevalence of blood count abnormalities. Interestingly, individuals with a high RDW and CH display a uniform population of red blood cells in the distribution plots, despite not all cells carrying the respective mutation, suggesting an indirect effect of CH on the red blood cell population. While macrocytosis is not associated with CH in general, SF3B1 mutations associate with an elevated MCV. Individuals with a combination of TET2 and SRSF2 mutations show marked disturbances in platelet morphology. In conclusion, cytometric parameters of peripheral blood cells may serve as early indicators of dysplastic changes and are associated with distinct mutational patterns in CH.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis [^111bDP7o]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.

### Genetic origins and clinical phenotype of familial and acquired erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^114yaJm9]. American Journal of Hematology (2009). Low credibility.

Familial and acquired erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis are characterized by myeloid lineage hyperproliferation, which is either single or multi-lineage in origin. The single lineage disorders exhibit Mendelian inheritance with polyclonal hematopoiesis and often arise from a single genetic defect. In contrast, the multi-lineage disorders exhibit complex patterns of inheritance with multi-genetic origins and clonal hematopoiesis. They have the potential to acquire JAK2 somatic mutations, but this is not the primary event. Identification of the disease-causing genes will enable better classification of familial and acquired erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis. Furthermore, it will provide an insight into the mechanisms regulating myeloid cell proliferation.

### Clonal haematopoiesis associates with distinct cytometric changes of red blood cells and platelets [^11271YXK]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Individuals with macrocytosis or a high RDW are at increased risk of developing haematological malignancies. The mechanisms that mediate this association remain unknown but may involve the presence of clonal haematopoiesis (CH). Here, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing on all individuals ≥ 60years with macrocytosis (MCV > 100fL; n = 269) or high RDW (RDW ≥ 16%; n = 242) and 1:2 age- and sex-matched controls from the population-based Lifelines cohort. Macrocytosis is not associated with CH or peripheral blood count abnormalities. In contrast, individuals with a high RDW were associated with an increased number of mutated genes, larger clone sizes and a high prevalence of blood count abnormalities. Interestingly, individuals with a high RDW and CH display a uniform population of red blood cells in the distribution plots, despite not all cells carrying the respective mutation, suggesting an indirect effect of CH on the red blood cell population. While macrocytosis is not associated with CH in general, SF3B1 mutations associate with an elevated MCV. Individuals with a combination of TET2 and SRSF2 mutations show marked disturbances in platelet morphology. In conclusion, cytometric parameters of peripheral blood cells may serve as early indicators of dysplastic changes and are associated with distinct mutational patterns in CH.

### Thrombocytosis in the NICU [^114qxXds]. Neurocritical Care (2008). Low credibility.

An elevated platelet count may occur during care of neurology/neurosurgical patients and is usually due to reactive or secondary thrombocytosis (ST) caused by inflammation or infection. Primary (clonal) thrombocythemia or essential thrombocythemia associated with myeloproliferative disorders is usually known before or during early patient assessment. Rarely, paraneoplastic causes of thrombocytosis may be discovered. Although no single test differentiates primary from secondary etiologies, laboratory tests that show increased acute phase responses, such as C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and interleukin-6, may be useful in diagnosing ST. Thrombosis due to ST is rare in any platelet count. ST, however, should be considered within the overall risk assessment for thromboembolism in any patient. If treatment is initiated, low-dose aspirin is sufficient.

### How to approach chronic anemia [^116116vp]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

We present herein an approach to diagnosing the cause of chronic anemia based on a patient's history and complete blood cell count (CBC). Four patterns that are encountered frequently in CBCs associated with chronic anemias are considered: (1) anemia with abnormal platelet and/or leukocyte counts, (2) anemia with increased reticulocyte counts, (3) life-long history of chronic anemia, and (4) anemia with inappropriately low reticulocytes. The pathophysiologic bases for some chronic anemias with low reticulocyte production are reviewed in terms of the bone marrow (BM) events that reduce normal rates of erythropoiesis. These events include: apoptosis of erythroid progenitor and precursor cells by intrinsic and extrinsic factors, development of macrocytosis when erythroblast DNA replication is impaired, and development of microcytosis due to heme-regulated eIF2α kinase inhibition of protein synthesis in iron-deficient or thalassemic erythroblasts.

### Blood cytology in children with down syndrome [^112BwnGR]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Down syndrome is the most common human genetic disorder. In Mexico, the Secretary of Health estimates its prevalence at 1 in 650 live newborns [2]. This chromosomal anomaly causes intellectual disability, specific phenotypic characteristics, and a combination of systemic conditions. Among the hematological alterations seen are leukemia, transient abnormal myelopoiesis, neutrophilia, and thrombocytopenia with giant platelets. Macrocytosis, thrombocytosis, and leukopenia have been reported in older children.

Values for the major hematological indicators vary with age and sex, but these values have not been described for Mexican children with Down syndrome. The objective of this study is to do so, as well as to describe the non-malignant hematological alterations found in this population.

This study was approved by the Research and Investigation Committees of the National Institute of Pediatrics (Approval No. 2018/025).

### Central retinal vein occlusion secondary to severe iron-deficiency anaemia resulting from a plant-based diet and menorrhagia: a case presentation [^1119hprT]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

CRVO secondary to IDA has previously been reported in the literature, but this is the first case with use of anti-VEGF in such a setting.

A variety of underlying mechanisms have been hypothesized to explain the thrombotic events in IDA including a direct process of reactive thrombocytosis, and other mechanisms following the principles of Virchow's triad mainly endothelial injury and hypercoagulability. Iron functions to regulate platelet numbers and function by inhibiting thrombopoiesis. In a state of iron-deficiency, there is a reactive thrombocytosis, thus leading to hypercoagulability. Red cell deformability is reduced in microcytic iron-deficient cells, resulting in an increased viscosity and furthermore contributing to the hypercoagulable state. It has been hypothesized that anemic hypoxic injury to the retino-choroidal circulation causes endothelial cell dysfunction and a weaker anti-oxidant defence in the IDA state, results in increased platelet aggregation.

Visual loss from CRVO is commonly secondary to macular oedema and treatment with IVI anti-VEGF with strong evidence backing the practice. However, from our literature review, this is the first instance that anti-VEGF has been used in the context of macular oedema secondary to IDA-induced CRVO.

Dietary and lifestyle factors can affect the retina health and this has investigated in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) studies. The AREDS and AREDS2 studies found a supplementation of lutein and zeaxanthin to be helpful in reducing the risk of developing advanced AMD in the high-risk group. Lutein and zeaxanthin are carotenoids abundant in dark leafy vegetables. Further studies have found that people with high intake of vegetables had a lower risk for AMD compared to those with low intakes. Studies have also shown the converse of high meat intake increasing the risk of AMD.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^116TcaJt]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Much less common are cases of acquired microcytosis or acquired thalassemia. Here, patients have had to acquire a haematopoietic stem cell germ-line mutation in a one of the globin loci or in a regulatory region or gene controlling globin-chain production.

MDS is most typically associated with an acquired macrocytosis. Acquired microcytosis occurs in a very small subset of patients with known MDS or other haematological disorders such as primary myelofibrosis, acute myeloid leukaemia and essential thrombocytosis. While alpha-thalassemia is more common, beta-thalassemia associated with haematological disease has also been reported.

Mutations in the non-globin gene ATRX have been demonstrated to cause acquired thalassemia in patients with MDS. ATRX is a chromatin remodelling gene that appears to play a role in α-globin chain production. Patients with inherited mutations of ATRX show alpha-thalassemia as well as developmental delay, the pathology after which the gene is named. When an acquired ATRX mutations occurs in the haematopoietic stem cells, alpha-globin chain expression is reduced without affecting the protein structure.

The phenomenon has recently been designated alpha-thalassemia associated myelodysplastic syndrome (ATMDS), and a registry database was established for the collection of patient data. Over 100 different missense mutations have been registered, and new cases are still being reported. Diagnosis of ATMDS depends on the detection of HbH by haemoglobin electrophoresis or examination of the peripheral blood smear and has only been seen in the context of another haematological disorder.MDS appears to be the most commonly associated condition, and 43% of patients with MDS and new microcytosis were found to have mutations in ATRX.

While ATMDS is a well-documented cause of thalassemia in patients with MDS, MDS/MPN overlap syndrome has no such strong association to date. The diagnosis of MDS/MPN overlap depends on genetic profiling, and MDS and MPN/MDS overlap share some common mutations. JAK2 is one of the most common mutations found in MPN, but it is found in a small minority of MDS patients. ASXL1 is more common in MPN and MDS/MPN overlap patients, and the most common mutation in MDS/MPN overlap, with a male predominance. This patient's mutation burden in IDH1 is atypical for MDS/MPN overlap syndrome.

### Diagnostic workflow for hereditary erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis [^1141UaUZ]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

In the patient presenting with an elevated blood count who does not have an acquired clonal disorder causing a myeloproliferative neoplasm, hereditary erythrocytosis or hereditary thrombocytosis needs to be considered as a possible explanation. A young patient and/or those with a family history of myeloproliferative neoplasm should specifically raise this possibility. Among the causes of hereditary erythrocytosis are mutations in the genes in the oxygen sensing pathway and high-affinity hemoglobins. Hereditary thrombocytosis has been shown to be accounted for by mutations in THPO, MPL, and JAK2 genes. In those who have a possible hereditary erythrocytosis or thrombocytosis, the investigative pathway includes specific investigation to rule out the more common acquired clonal disorders, and, if indicated, other secondary causes, measurement of specific cytokines as indicated, and search for specific identified molecular lesions that have been shown to cause these hereditary disorders. There remain individuals who appear to have a hereditary disorder in whom a genetic lesion cannot currently be identified.

### Primary thrombocytosis in children [^1131ih5H]. Haematologica (2014). Low credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms are uncommon disorders in children, for which we have limited understanding of the pathogenesis and optimal management. JAK2 and MPL mutations, while common drivers of myeloproliferative neoplasms in adult patients, are not clearly linked to pediatric disease. Management and clinical outcomes in adults have been well delineated with defined recommendations for risk stratification and treatment. This is not the case for pediatric patients, for whom there is neither a standard approach to workup nor any consensus regarding management. This review will discuss thrombocytosis in children, including causes of thrombocytosis in children, the limited knowledge we have regarding pediatric primary thrombocytosis, and our thoughts on potential risk stratification and management, and future questions to be answered by laboratory research and collaborative clinical study.

### Pediatric extreme thrombocytosis: etiology, management, and outcomes [^112MuYup]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

Extreme thrombocytosis (EXT) is defined as a platelet count > 1000×10⁹/L. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the etiology, management, and outcome of pediatric patients with EXT, focusing on thrombotic complications.

Study Design

We conducted a retrospective study at a large tertiary center, examining cases of pediatric EXT identified from electronic medical records over a 5-year period. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, and laboratory data were reviewed. Additionally, the underlying etiology was documented for each case, and follow-up information was analyzed, including platelet count trends and thrombotic events within three months post-EXT.

Results

Among 204 patients with EXT, 98% were secondary thrombocytosis, predominantly attributed to infections and inflammatory conditions. EXT prevailed among infants (median age 1.3 years), with 67% aged 3 years or younger. Thrombotic events occurred in 10 cases (4.9%), primarily related to central venous lines or other risk factors rather than elevated platelet counts alone. Aspirin prophylaxis was uncommon, administered in 14% of patients, mainly in those with existing comorbidities.

Conclusions

Secondary EXT in pediatric patients is commonly associated with infections and persists for up to 2 months in many cases. While EXT alone may not significantly increase thrombotic risk, it may contribute to risk in patients with additional predisposing factors, such as central venous line. Further prospective studies are warranted to clarify thrombotic risk in children with EXT and evaluate the potential benefit of antithrombotic prophylaxis.

### Three-generation female cohort with macrocytic anemia and iron overload [^111etdk1]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

Macrocytosis is defined as an MCV above the upper limit of normal for age, which varies from infants to adults. Increased MCV in an automatic complete blood count (CBC) may be artifactual, such as with a marked compensatory reticulocytosis in response to anemia; reticulocytes are normally larger than mature circulating red cells (up to 126 fL for healthy adults), while they can be even larger in conditions of stress erythropoiesis, raising the perceived MCV of the total erythrocytes (mature and non‐mature) in automated CBC measurements. Cold agglutinins may also cause spurious macrocytosis due to cell counting errors of red cell aggregates. Obtaining the reticulocyte count and evaluating the blood smear are always valuable first steps to confirm a true macrocytosis and start the diagnostic evaluation.

True macrocytosis, typically associated with anemia, can have numerous causes based on clinical context, encompassing both acquired and congenital disorders. The most common pathophysiologic mechanisms involved are (1) impaired DNA synthesis in the erythroblast nuclei during terminal erythropoiesis causing megaloblastic bone marrow changes because of nuclear‐cytoplasmic asynchrony, (2) altered red cell hydration increasing cell volume, or (3) altered composition of the lipid bilayer of the RBC membrane.

Impaired DNA synthesis in megaloblastic anemia is caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, both critical components in the thymidine synthesis pathway. Deficiency of folate and/or vitamin B12 occurs either due to dietary restrictions, malabsorption syndromes like short‐gut syndrome, or in autoimmune disorders associated with loss of intrinsic factor production (atrophic gastritis) or anti‐intrinsic factor antibodies, which would prevent vitamin B12 absorption. Rare genetic disorders of vitamin B12 or folate transport and metabolism also exist, leading to syndromes that may present not only with megaloblastic anemia, but also with failure to thrive, other cytopenias, neurodevelopmental disorders, and/or thromboembolic events. Medications, such as methotrexate (a folate antimetabolite), antiretrovirals, and chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogs, all of which interfere with DNA synthesis, may also cause macrocytosis with or without anemia. Notably, a very rare cause of macrocytosis is copper deficiency which also causes neutropenia and neurological manifestations like B12 deficiency.

### Can polycythaemia vera disease be predicted from haematologic parameters? A machine learning-based study [^114AKcVC]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Absolute erythrocytosis is divided into three subclasses: primary erythrocytosis caused by an intrinsic defect in the precursor cells of the haematopoietic series, secondary erythrocytosis caused by extrinsic stimuli such as erythropoietin (EPO) and idiopathic erythrocytosis in which no aetiological cause is identified. The prototype of primary erythrocytosis is PV. PV is defined as an acquired stem cell disease characterised by uncontrolled clonal production of precursor cells with normal morphology of erythrocytes, platelets (PLT) and leukocytes in the absence of any stimulus and extramedullary haematopoiesis. Although the aetiology of the disease has not been fully elucidated, the incidence is 5–17/million in the United States and Europe. PV is more frequently seen in people older than 60 years of age, but is extremely rare in people younger than 40 years of age. Although the incidence is similar in men and women, it is slightly higher in men. At the time of diagnosis, splenomegaly is found in 70% of patients and hepatomegaly in 30%. Therefore, PV patients usually have mild to moderate leucocytosis and thrombocytosis. Leucocytosis is found in 60% of patients with PV, and thrombocytosis in half of the patients. Serum EPO level is frequently low in PV. The V617F point mutation in exon 14 of JAK2 is present in 95% of patients with PV. Currently, the diagnostic criteria of the updated International Consensus Classification (ICC) are used for PV. The diagnostic criteria for PV require either all three major criteria or the first two major criteria and minor criteria to be met. These major criteria are as follows: HGB > 16.5 g/dL in men, > 16.0 g/dL in women; HCT > 49% in men, > 48% in women, bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellularity for age with trilineage enlargement (panmyelosis) including marked erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic proliferation with pleomorphic, mature megakaryocytes (size differences) and presence of JAK2 V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation. Minor criteria are subnormal serum EPO level (normal range of EPO in adults: 4.1–19.5 mU/mL). Major criterion 2 (bone marrow biopsy) may not be necessary in cases with persistent absolute erythrocytosis (persistent absolute erythrocytosis is defined as HGB levels higher than 18.5 g/dL in men or 16.5 g/dL in women or HCT higher than 55.5% in men and 49.5% in women). Accordingly, three major criteria or the first two major criteria plus minor criteria must be present for the diagnosis of PV.

### Unexplained chronic cytopenia: is it idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance or myelodysplastic syndrome [^112CnrUT]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Idiopathic cytopenia is a condition where there is a decrease in peripheral blood counts causing either anaemia, leucopoenia and thrombocytopaenia. Most cases of cytopenia reveal a cause on further workup. But very rarely, in some cases, a definitive cause could not be identified. Unexplained cytopenia becomes challenging and poses difficulty in diagnosis and management. Discriminating these groups of bone marrow failure disorders from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) becomes an important clinical question. We describe a case of a middle-aged Hispanic woman who presented with pancytopenia and on extensive workup did not reveal any specific cause. Her bone marrow examination revealed severely reduced megakaryocytes but with normal haemopoiesis of other lineages. Cytogenetics, flow cytometry, comprehensive next-generation whole genomic analysis did not reveal any abnormalities. She fit the criteria for idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance rather than MDS. She remained asymptomatic and her counts never improved with immunosuppressives or thrombopoietin mimetics.

### Histological and genetic characterization and follow-up of 130 patients with chronic triple-negative thrombocytosis [^116EnDUw]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

In a cohort of 130 patients with chronic, non-reactive triple-negative thrombocytosis, we first had bone marrow biopsies reviewed by experts of the French group of hematopathologists (GEBOM), then asked whether targeted NGS could help reach a diagnosis. We also asked whether the outcome of patients was predicted better when the diagnostic classification was based on genetic and/or histological features.

Patients followed at Angers or Brest university hospitals, for ET or chronic thrombocytosis, were included if their platelet count at diagnosis was > 400x10⁹ /L, there was no reactive cause (iron deficiency, splenectomy, inflammation) for the raised platelet count and they did not have JAK2 V617F, CALR exon 9 or MPL W515L/K mutations (as determined by allele-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction [PCR] analysis, PCR fragment length polymorphism and quantitative PCR followed by allelic discrimination using probe competition, as previously described). Bone marrow biopsies had been performed in all patients, 118 of which were available for central review. All patients were > 18 years old and provided written informed consent, in accordance with law n. 2004–800 of 2004 and law n. 2012–300 of 2012. The median age at diagnosis was 53 years old (range, 18–84) and 72% were females.

### A man with polycythemia vera, myelodysplastic syndrome and acquired microcytosis [^116sTZky]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

When evaluating for the cause of microcytosis, a longitudinal evaluation can be very helpful. The timing and rate of decline of the MCV can be informative in determining the aetiology. Our patient's microcytosis appears to have developed over the course of almost 4 years. His decline in MCV was slow but consistent, beginning at an MCV of roughly 90 and decreasing to a nadir of 68.5. This very gradual decline in MCV suggests a more insidious and chronic process than an iron deficiency or anaemia of chronic disease. It remains unclear whether the timeline of the development of microcytosis is connected with progression in mutation burden.

Learning points

Microcytosis has several common causes, but an unremarkable initial workup may warrant a more thorough investigation.
Acquired microcytosis has been associated with certain haematological disorders, most commonly myelodysplastic syndromes and most commonly affecting production of alpha-haemoglobin.
Elements of the timeline and severity of microcytosis can offer clues to its aetiology.
Microcytosis is caused by increased nucleic acid synthesis and progenitor divisions relative to haemoglobin production.

### Thrombopoietin from beginning to end [^114kde5i]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

In the two decades since its cloning, thrombopoietin (TPO) has emerged not only as a critical haematopoietic cytokine, but also serves as a great example of bench-to-bedside research. Thrombopoietin, produced by the liver, is the primary regulator of megakaryocyte progenitor expansion and differentiation. Additionally, as TPO is vital for the maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells, it can truly be described as a pan-haematopoietic cytokine. Since recombinant TPO became available, the molecular mechanisms of TPO function have been the subject of extensive research. Via its receptor, c-Mpl (also termed MPL), TPO activates a wide array of downstream signalling pathways, promoting cellular survival and proliferation. Due to its central, non-redundant role in haematopoiesis, alterations of both the hormone and its receptor contribute to human disease; congenital and acquired states of thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia and aplastic anaemia as a result from dysregulated TPO expression or functional alterations of c-Mpl. With TPO mimetics now in clinical use, the story of this haematopoietic cytokine represents a great success for biomedical research.

### Essential thrombocythaemia and its neurological complications [^112g1vTf]. Practical Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocythaemia is one of the chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms and is characterised by a sustained platelet count ≥ 450 × 10⁹/L. The clinical course is often indolent but a significant number of patients have thrombotic and haemorrhagic complications. A patient with neurological complications is described, and the pathogenesis and clinical features of this disease are reviewed, including its neurological sequelae and management, along with an outline for the investigation of patients with thrombocytosis.

Laboratory findings

Table 1 lists the laboratory abnormalities that are typical, yet not specific for patients with MDS. C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate can be elevated. At least 90% of MDS patients will be anemic, and ~50% of them will have a hemoglobin concentration of less than 10 g/dL. The anemia is usually mildly macrocytic, with an increased red cell distribution width. Reflecting the BM dysfunction that characterizes MDS, patients usually do not have an increased reticulocyte count, in contrast to patients with hemolytic anemia. Table 1 lists other laboratory findings.

Serum chemistry is usually normal unless there is a comorbidity associated with anemia. Serum iron and iron saturation as well as serum ferritin can be elevated in the sideroblastic subtype. It is important to exclude nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid and vitamin B12 deficiency, both of which can cause macrocytic anemia. Blood chemistries can also rule out underlying liver or kidney disease. Hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus and parvovirus B19 infections must be ruled out.

The PB smear is usually non-specific, but it might show features consistent with disease. For example, the red blood cells (RBC) might have anisocytosis or poikylocytos, and sometimes there may be nucleated RBC. The white blood cells may include an increased number of immature myeloid cells ("left shift") with hypolobulation ("Pelger"-like cells) and hypogranulation. PB platelets might be distorted, clumped, and big (megaplatelets), in addition to being present in low number. Persistent monocytosis suggests CMML, on the assumption that other etiologies for monocytosis have been excluded. The PB smear is especially helpful in that it may uncover a disease other than or in addition to MDS. For example, thrombocytosis or leukocytosis would suggest an MPN, or at least an overlap MDS/MPN syndrome.

Altogether, the combination of symptoms and laboratory findings along with the exclusion of other causes of anemia/cytopenia, raises the suspicion of MDS (Table 1), but other investigations are required in order to establish the diagnosis of MDS.

### Blood cytology in children with down syndrome [^111ezUHo]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Newborns with Down syndrome may have normal blood counts, although they can show subtle anomalies and dysplastic characteristics of the white corpuscles, platelets, and red corpuscles. These characteristics are often described as incidental findings. Although they are probably not clinically important, the early recognition of non-malignant alterations in these patients is important. To date there are no reference values for different age groups in this population; those reported for the general population have been used in an arbitrary way.

Other hematological alterations that have been found in newborns with Down syndrome include neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and polycythemia, with incidences of 80, 66, and 34%, respectively, reported by Henry et al. These anomalies generally have a benign clinical course and resolve spontaneously at three weeks of age. The neutrophilia is slight, rarely over 30.000/μL, and is not associated with an infection. The thrombocytopenia is also slight, the majority with platelet counts < 150,000/μL, and is not associated with hemorrhage. Kivivuori et al. carried out a prospective follow-up study of the platelet counts of twenty-five newborns with Down syndrome during their first year of life and found that thrombocytopenia is generally brief, resolves itself in the first few weeks, and is later replaced by thrombocytosis. Polycythemia is usually slight, and only some presented cyanosis, which is corrected with partial exchange transfusion. It is usually independent of the heart defects and hypoxia that are often associated with this condition.

Our study included only twenty-six newborns; none of them presented polycythemia, only one with neutrophilia (3.8%), and three with thrombocytopenia (11.5%), a contrast with the findings of Henry et al. However, the small size of our sample in this age group must be considered.

At later ages, anemia, macrocytosis, and leukopenia were common in our sample, at levels like those previously reported by Roizen and Kivivuori. High levels of mean corpuscular volume have been reported in patients with Down syndrome at all ages. David et al. found no underlying cause for macrocytosis and postulated an altered folate remethylation path as an effect of greater cystathionine-β-synthase activity. Our findings coincide with these studies. Evaluation of a patient with anemia should consider its possible underestimation due to macrocytosis, and consider the use of other tools, such as analysis of folates, vitamin B12, and iron for greater diagnostic certainty.

### Essential thrombocythemia [^112k81Zq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on essential thrombocythemia:

- **Definition**: ET is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal proliferation of megakaryocytes leading to sustained thrombocytosis (platelets ≥ 450×10⁹/L). The disease most often results from driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and manifests with increased thrombotic and hemorrhagic risk, vasomotor symptoms, and, less frequently, progression to myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia.
- **Pathophysiology**: ET results from constitutive activation of cytokine signaling, most frequently through the JAK2V617F mutation, found in about 60% of patients, or through CALR or MPL mutations, found in about 20–25% and 3–4%, respectively. These driver mutations stimulate uncontrolled megakaryocytic proliferation and platelet production. Additional mutations in genes such as ASXL1, TET2, DNMT3A, SF3B1, or TP53 can influence disease behavior and risk of progression. Abnormal interactions between activated platelets and the vascular endothelium contribute to thrombotic events, while very high platelet counts may cause acquired von Willebrand syndrome and bleeding.
- **Epidemiology**: ET has an incidence of about 1.5–2 cases per 100,000 persons each year and is most common in older adults, though up to one fifth of patients are diagnosed before the age of 40. Women are slightly more often affected than men. It accounts for about one third of all myeloproliferative neoplasms. About 10–15% of patients lack detectable mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL and are referred to as triple-negative.
- **Risk factors**: The primary risk factors for ET include age and genetic predisposition.
- **Disease course**: The disease often remains stable for many years but can be interrupted by vascular complications. Thrombosis is the most frequent cause of morbidity, occurring in about 15–20% of patients, especially in those > 60 years or carrying a JAK2 mutation. Hemorrhagic events may occur, particularly in the setting of extreme thrombocytosis. Progression to post-ET myelofibrosis occurs in about 5–10% of cases, and transformation to acute leukemia in less than 2% over ten years. Median survival is about 18–20 years overall and exceeds 30 years in younger individuals. Prognostic models such as the triple A system, which considers age, neutrophil, and lymphocyte counts, or mutationally enhanced models that include adverse mutations, help stratify outcomes. Triple-negative disease generally has the most favorable prognosis.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Life expectancy in ET is somewhat reduced compared with the general population but remains substantially better than in other myeloproliferative neoplasms such as polycythemia vera or myelofibrosis. Median survival is approximately 18 years but can exceed 35 years in younger patients. Adverse prognostic factors include advanced age, leukocytosis, abnormal karyotype, and mutations in SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1, or TP53. Patients with CALR type 2 mutations or triple-negative status have the lowest risk of thrombosis and longest survival, whereas those with CALR type 1 or MPL mutations are more prone to fibrotic transformation. The major therapeutic focus remains prevention of thrombosis and close monitoring for disease progression.

Distinguishing ET from early/prefibrotic PMF

Morphology

Diagnosis of WHO-defined ET requires absence of BCR-ABL1 (to exclude the possibility of ET-like chronic myeloid leukemia), absence of dyserythropoiesis (to exclude the possibility of myelodysplastic or overlap syndromes associated with thrombocytosis)and, most importantly, absence of bone marrow morphological changes that are more consistent with early/prefibrotic myelofibrosis (MF; megakaryocytes in ET are large, hyperlobulated and appear mature, and are usually not accompanied by erythroid or granulocyte proliferation, whereas those of early/prefibrotic MF display abnormal maturation with hyperchromatic, irregularly folded bulky nuclei and often accompanied by left-shifted granulocyte proliferation).

In clinical practice, clues for a diagnosis of early/prefibrotic MF, in a patient suspected of having ET, include anemia, leukocytosis, increased serum lactate dehydrogenase level, leukoerythroblastosis and palpable splenomegaly. Some studies have also associated higher JAK2 V617F allele burden with early/prefibrotic MF; in one study, no ET patient displayed an allele burden of > 40%, whereas nearly 25% of patients with early/prefibrotic MF displayed > 50% allele burden.

Clinical relevance

The International Working Group for MPN Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) recently subjected 1104 cases of locally diagnosed ET to a central pathology review; 891 met the revised WHO criteria for ET and 180 for early/prefibrotic MF. The results revealed significantly worse overall survival (15-year survival 59% vs 80%), leukemic transformation rate (risk over 15 years 11.7% vs 2.1%) and fibrotic progression (risk over 15 years 16.9% vs 9.3%), in early/prefibrotic MF compared with WHO-defined ET. Patients with early/prefibrotic MF also suffered from a higher risk of bleeding (12% vs 6% incidence after 6–7 years follow-up), especially in the presence of aspirin therapy, leukocytosis or previous bleeding event. On the other hand, their thrombosis risk (10-year cumulative incidence of 17.9%)was similar to that of ET (10-year cumulative incidence of 16.2%), and risk factors for arterial thrombosis in early/prefibrotic MF included leukocytosis; overall thrombosis risk was lower in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.

### Real-world study of children and young adults with myeloproliferative neoplasms: identifying risks and unmet needs [^113Nm89T]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

The retrospective nature of this study could imply some biases. In particular, the number of patients included in this study does not necessarily reflect the total number of cases observed by country because members of the EHA MPN SWG, although reference centers in their country, are not the exclusive care centers for MPNs (supplemental Figure 1). In addition, most of the cases are diagnosed by pediatricians, and some of them may be missed in centers for adults. Recording of mutational status, absence of central review of bone marrow biopsies, and challenges in detecting splenomegaly are also pertinent. Furthermore, the cohort of patients included those diagnosed before 2000 (∼25%), when many institutions may not have performed bone marrow biopsy for diagnosis. We asked the clinicians to only include patients with a confirmed diagnosis, and thus, for these historical patients with long follow-up, any other causes, for example, of thrombocytosis, would have declared themselves. Finally, in the absence of specific guidelines for this population of young MPN patients, management could be heterogeneous among centers, potentially influencing the rate of complications. However, this is mitigated by the very high number of such extremely rare patients included in our cohort, suggesting that we revealed a reliable picture of MPN in very young patients.

FIGURE 1
(A) Peripheral blood smear. The peripheral blood smear shows morphological abnormalities typically described in hyposplenism (e.g. Howell‐Jolly bodies, Heinz bodies, spiculated cells, target cells) (Hematoxylin–eosin ×100). (B) Bone marrow biopsy.

During the assessment of a new‐onset thrombocytosis, it is of the upmost importance to distinguish secondary (or reactive) thrombocytosis from true hematological diseases. First of all, for practical purposes, we searched for causes of secondary thrombocytosis. The most common causes of reactive thrombocytosis are iron deficiency, inflammation, infection, hemolysis, and other causes that trigger an acute‐phase response (Table 1). Thus, we performed serum tests to check for the iron status (iron, transferrin, and ferritin) and for an acute‐phase reaction (CRP, ESR): all of them were normal. A normal LDH serum level, together with a normal hemoglobin concentration and reticulocyte count, excluded hemolytic processes. Despite the absence of symptoms and signs of an underlying infection, we performed a chest radiograph that ruled out a pulmonary infection, and an abdominal ultrasound that revealed no signs of abdominal infection and reported a poorly assessable spleen. The most common mutations associated with myeloid neoplasms (BCR‐ABL rearrangement for chronic myeloid leukemia and JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations for Philadelphia‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms) were not found.

### Histological and genetic characterization and follow-up of 130 patients with chronic triple-negative thrombocytosis [^115Q1D8C]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

In order to assess whether NGS data could better discriminate thrombocytosis patients with a higher risk of complications, we reclassified patients with an acquired pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in the "MPN" group, irrespective of their histology. Similarly, patients with germline variants in JAK2 or MPL were reclassified as having constitutional thrombocythemia. Overall, applying these criteria in the "non-MPN" group, NGS was not informative for 39 patients, allowed confirmation of non-MPN in four (constitutional thrombocythemia) and prompted reclassification into the "MPN" group in nine patients. In the MPN group, NGS was not informative for 44 patients, allowed confirmation (acquired pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant) in 17 and prompted reclassification into constitutional thrombocythemia in eight patients. For the 11 patients for whom bone marrow biopsy was not able to provide a classification, NGS did not give additional information in nine, but detected an acquired mutation in two patients: DNMT3A D835M (variant allele frequency, 2%) and CBL L380P (variant allele frequency, 3%), allowing a reclassification to MPN.

It is worth noting that mutations with such a low allele burden could be considered as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential and the clinical interpretation of these cases remains challenging.

In order to determine whether the NGS-based or histology-based classifications allow for a better prognostic discrimination, clinical characteristics and evolution were assessed in the groups defined by histological findings or NGS findings. The demographic, biological, and main clinical data of the patients, divided into groups according to the initial diagnosis, histology review or the NGS-based diagnosis, are detailed in Table 1A and Online Supplementary Table S2. Age at diagnosis and sex ratio were similar between MPN and non-MPN patients whereas MPN patients had higher platelet counts and lower leukocyte counts. These findings held true regardless of the diagnostic classification applied. In contrast, while the ratio of treated versus untreated patients was similar in the two groups (MPN and non-MPN) after initial assessment (67% in MPN vs. 51% in non-MPN, P = 0.128), it became significantly higher in MPN patients after central review (69% vs. 46%, P = 0.025), suggesting that therapeutic decisions in current clinical practice were not based only on the WHO classification and/or decisional algorithms. In survival analyses, we used information on event status and follow-up time to estimate a survival function (median follow-up of 5 years).

### Marked reactive thrombocytosis in a female with iron deficiency anaemia [^115HbiS5]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

This case report presents the clinical evaluation and management of a female patient from a rural background who presented with leg pain, headache, weakness and irritability. Initial investigations revealed iron deficiency anaemia accompanied by a significantly elevated platelet count, prompting suspicion of an underlying myeloproliferative neoplastic disorder. However, subsequent genetic testing ruled out these mutations, suggesting a reactive response to iron deficiency anaemia rather than an independent neoplastic process. Treatment was focused on addressing the underlying iron deficiency anaemia, resulting in significant improvement in the patient's blood profile and resolution of symptoms. Follow-up assessments demonstrated a complete normalisation of the blood profile and platelet counts, further supporting the efficacy of the treatment. This case highlights the importance of considering reactive thrombocytosis in the context of iron deficiency anaemia and emphasises the favourable response achieved through appropriate management strategies.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^1166mbw3]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

After exclusion of all causes of reactive thrombocytosis, a new platelet count should be repeated to confirm the persistence of unexplained thrombocytosis. Thus, investigations to search for hematological disorders should be performed. Molecular markers for the most common myeloid neoplasms associated with thrombocytosis can be searched on peripheral blood: BCR‐ABL rearrangement for chronic myeloid leukemia and JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations for Philadelphia‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms. Subsequently, according to the clinical suspicion, a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy, together with cytogenetic and other molecular analysis (including a myeloid next‐generation sequencing panel), should be carried out. Bone marrow biopsy is particularly useful to exclude triple‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms.

Hyposplenism, defined as an abnormally low rate of activity of the spleen, is one of the most overlooked causes of thrombocytosis. Irrespective of the underlying cause, hyposplenism is suggested by typical morphological abnormalities of circulating red blood cells, including acanthocytes, spiculated spherocytes, stomatocytes, target cells, pitted erythrocytes, and Howell‐Jolly bodies. Pitted red cells are erythrocytes whose membrane appears to contain the so‐called "pits". It has been shown by electron microscopy that these "pits" are large vacuoles attached to or beneath the plasma membrane. Within these vacuoles, there is waste material (e.g. ferritin, hemoglobin, and residual material of mitochondria and membranes) that confers a low optical density. Normal splenic function is characterized by pitted red cells less than 4% of total erythrocytes. A pitted erythrocyte count > 4% has been suggested as the gold standard for a diagnosis of hyposplenism. Howell‐Jolly bodies that consist of basophilic DNA remnants within erythrocytes, also strongly support a diagnosis of hyposplenism if elevated, but are considered a less sensitive morphological feature than pitted red cells. Finally, radio‐isotopic methods (e.g. 99mTc‐labeled heat‐altered autologous erythrocyte scintigraphy) allow a splenic morpho‐functional assessment by studying the uptake and clearance of an injected radiolabeled tracer. However, given their high costs, their use in clinical practice is limited. This underlies the remarkable importance of morphological examination of peripheral blood smear when assessing a patient with a new‐onset thrombocytosis. New MRI techniques have increased the detection of splenic diseases so that, nowadays, MRI is an excellent tool for diagnosis and characterization of both focal and diffuse splenic abnormalities.

### Essential thrombocythemia: a review of diagnostic and pathologic features [^1164HjFn]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Essential thrombocythemia (ET) is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder (CMPD) characterized predominately by thrombocytosis and abnormal megakaryocyte proliferation. The current diagnostic criteria require a combination of clinical, histologic, and cytogenetic data. The diagnosis relies largely on exclusion of other causes of thrombocytosis.

Objective

Describe historical, clinical, and laboratory features of ET in order to understand, clarify, and more accurately diagnose this entity.

Data Sources

Review contemporary and historical literature on ET and other causes of thrombocytosis.

Conclusions

ET is a relatively indolent and often asymptomatic CMPD that is characterized primarily by a sustained elevation in platelets ≥ 600 × 10³/μL (≥ 600 × 10⁹/L), proliferating enlarged and hyperlobated megakaryocytes, and minimal to absent bone marrow fibrosis. Significant changes and revisions to the diagnostic requirements and criteria for ET have occurred during the last 30 years. Recently, a mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene has been found in a significant number of cases of ET and other CMPDs. In up to 57% of ET cases, a mutation in the JAK2 gene can be detected. In the absence of a JAK2 mutation and features of another CMPD, the diagnosis of ET remains a diagnosis of exclusion after other causes of thrombocytosis have been excluded.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^111qT6NT]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

1 CASE PRESENTATION

We herein report on a 26‐year‐old Caucasian female who was referred to our outpatient clinic with a history of abnormal blood count, including thrombocytosis and monocytosis known for the last 7 years. No family history of hematological disorders was reported. Her past medical history was significant for a papillary thyroid carcinoma that was treated with surgery and radioiodine therapy, obtaining a complete remission; the patient is currently taking levothyroxine. Her physical exam was normal and no signs and/or symptoms of infection were noticed.

Thrombocytosis, defined as a platelet count > 450 × 10⁹ /L, is a common finding in routine blood tests and a common cause of referral to hematologists for further investigation. Causes of thrombocytosis can be grouped into primary, secondary, and spurious (Table 1). To find out the etiology of the thrombocytosis, the clinical hematologist should take into consideration data from familial and medical history, physical examination, results of hematological exams, clonal genetic abnormalities and bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy for morphological features, flow cytometric data, and cytogenetic and molecular markers of clonality.

TABLE 1
Causes of thrombocytosis

During the visit, we performed additional blood tests. A complete blood count revealed the following values: Hemoglobin 150 g/L, hematocrit 42.8%, mean cell volume 88 fL, white blood cell count 10.23 × 10⁹ /L, and platelet count 582 × 10⁹ /L. Differential white blood cell count revealed a normal absolute neutrophil count and a slightly increased number of monocytes (1.2 × 10 9 /L). Morphological examination of peripheral blood smear confirmed the higher‐than‐normal platelet count with no significant platelet clumping and also showed several target cells, acanthocytes, and Howell‐Jolly bodies within red blood cells (Figure 1 A). C‐reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) results within the normal range. Serum levels of iron, transferrin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation were normal. Serum level of lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH) was within the normal range. A chest X‐ray revealed no abnormalities attributable to pulmonary infection. Abdominal ultrasound showed no evidence of infection and reported limited visualization of the spleen. The BCR‐ABL rearrangement was absent in peripheral blood. No mutations of JAK2, CALR, and MPL genes were found in DNA from peripheral blood granulocytes.

### Papillary muscle rupture associated to essential thrombocytosis [^116ZZsLr]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocytosis (ET) falls under the umbrella of myeloproliferative disorders, which also includes chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia. Essential thrombocytosis results from a clonal proliferation of megakaryocites within the bone marrow, leading to an absolute elevation of platelets that can cause both hemorrhagic and thrombotic complications.

### Marked thrombocytosis in a child with advanced myelodysplastic syndrome [^114E9HXB]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2004). Low credibility.

Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis with rare occurrence in childhood. Conversely to adult affected patients, refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts and the 5q-syndrome, which are associated with thrombocytosis are virtually absent in the pediatric age group. We describe the case of an 1-year-old boy with advanced MDS, specifically refractory anemia with excess of blasts who presented with leukocytopenia and anemia but marked thrombocytosis at diagnosis. Thrombocytosis resolved without therapy. This case illustrates the relationship between MDS and myeloproliferative disorders.

A 59-year-old white man with known myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) presented with worsening leucocytosis and thrombocytosis in the setting of a presumed infection. The patient had been diagnosed 2 years earlier with an MPN/MDS overlap syndrome, based on characteristic mutations in JAK2, IDH1 and SRSF2. During his current evaluation, he was noted to have new microcytosis, with a mean corpuscular volume of ~70 fL down from his baseline of ~90 fL. His laboratory workup showed normal iron studies, normal haemoglobin electrophoresis, and no evidence of haemoglobin H or mutations in his ATRX coding region. Without any identifiable cause of his new microcytosis, he was given a presumptive diagnosis of acquired thalassemia in the setting of his unusual MPN/MDS overlap syndrome.

### Reduced ribosomal protein gene dosage and p53 activation in low-risk myelodysplastic syndrome [^116Nzj5p]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Reduced gene dosage of ribosomal protein subunits has been implicated in 5q- myelodysplastic syndrome and Diamond Blackfan anemia, but the cellular and pathophysiologic defects associated with these conditions are enigmatic. Using conditional inactivation of the ribosomal protein S6 gene in laboratory mice, we found that reduced ribosomal protein gene dosage recapitulates cardinal features of the 5q- syndrome, including macrocytic anemia, erythroid hypoplasia, and megakaryocytic dysplasia with thrombocytosis, and that p53 plays a critical role in manifestation of these phenotypes. The blood cell abnormalities are accompanied by a reduction in the number of HSCs, a specific defect in late erythrocyte development, and suggest a disease-specific ontogenetic pathway for megakaryocyte development. Further studies of highly purified HSCs from healthy patients and from those with myelodysplastic syndrome link reduced expression of ribosomal protein genes to decreased RBC maturation and suggest an underlying and common pathophysiologic pathway for additional subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for essential thrombocythemia, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ESMO 2015 guidelines recommend to ensure accurate differentiation among the three unique myeloproliferative neoplasm subtypes as well as the exclusion of reactive conditions (in mutation-negative patients only) and disorders, such as myelodysplasia and chronic myeloid leukemia, for appropriate prognosis and treatment decision-making. Do not use the generic diagnostic label 'myeloproliferative neoplasm' alone.

### Isolated congenital asplenia: an overlooked cause of thrombocytosis [^113fRm4W]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). Medium credibility.

In view of the persistent thrombocytosis (platelet count was 532 × 10⁹/L at the next blood count), we performed a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy to search for hematological causes. Histological examination (Figure 1 B) revealed a cellularity of 40% and a slightly reduced number of erythroid precursors with a preserved ratio of myeloid to erythroid precursors and a normal number of megakaryocytes without significant abnormalities. The number of CD34+ precursors was also normal (2%–3% of the total nucleated cells). No significant bone marrow reticulin fibrosis was detected (grade 0 according to the WHO grading system). Bone marrow flow cytometric analysis and cytogenetic analysis were also normal.

Bone marrow biopsy is not usually required to investigate a secondary thrombocytosis. However, in absence of a reactive etiology, we performed a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy to search for hematological disorders associated with thrombocytosis.

The most common hematological malignancies associated with thrombocytosis are chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR‐ABL1 positive, and the so‐called Philadelphia‐negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (i.e. polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myelofibrosis). In our case, all of these entities were ruled out because of the absence of their typical molecular markers (searched on peripheral blood, see the previous paragraph) associated with normal findings on bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy examination. The diagnosis of a myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (e.g. atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR‐ABL1 ‐negative, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis) was also excluded by cytomorphological examination of the bone marrow aspirate. The absence of a clonal marker at cytogenetics also supported the nonclonal etiology of the thrombocytosis.

### A 59-year-old woman with visible precordial pulsations [^111SumE1]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

CLINICAL INTRODUCTION: A retired 59-year-old woman presented to the cardiology clinic concerned with cardiac pulsations that were visible on her chest wall. These were not associated with dyspnoea, syncope or chest discomfort. Of note, 8years previously, she complained of recurrent nocturnal diaphoresis and 5kg weight loss. Blood sampling at that time revealed a microcytic anaemia, reactive thrombocytosis and raised inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate 99mm/hour, C-reactive protein 161mg/L). Following an episode of transient diplopia, ophthalmoscopy demonstrated a cotton wool spot in the left inferotemporal retinal arcade. She commenced a 2-year tapering course of 1mg/kg prednisolone. On examination, she had a lean physique with a supine blood pressure of 162/60mm Hg and palpable Corrigan's pulse. She had a prominent apical pulsation and a loud early diastolic murmur was present at the left sternal edge radiating to the apex. Echocardiography showed severe central aortic regurgitation and a dilated aortic root (see online supplementary figure 1). Cardiac CT was performed to clarify the diagnosis (figure 1).DC1SP110.1136/heartjnl-2017–312193.supp1Supplementary file 1 heartjnl;104/3/273/F1F1F1Figure 1Contrast-enhanced CT of the thorax at index presentation (A) and 6months (B).

### Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective study [^113oMRJM]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

A final consideration is that macrocytosis may be a manifestation of altered hematopoiesis. In one study of non-dialysis elderly patients, 25/49 with unexplained macrocytosis had dysplastic changes or findings consistent with MDS on bone marrow biopsy. Alternatively, altered hematopoiesis may be due to high doses of ESAs. Macrocytosis due to suspected abnormal rapid cellular maturation in states of massive erythropoietic stimulation has been observed in rat models, and we did observe an association between darbepoetin alfa dose and MCV > 102 fl. However, altered hematopoiesis was not confirmed with bone marrow biopsy in this study. Furthermore, bone marrow dysplasia was not identified in an earlier study of dialysis patients treated with recombinant erythropoietin for 24 months who subsequently underwent bone marrow biopsy. In addition, macrocytosis in dialysis patients has been identified prior to the introduction of ESAs.

### Peripheral-blood cytopenia, an early indicator of inborn errors of immunity [^11285AhP]. British Journal of Haematology (2022). Medium credibility.

The pathogenic mechanisms of cytopenia in IEI are multifactorial. They are commonly attributed to cell‐mediated and humoral immune dysfunction or dysregulation, driving autoimmunity and autoinflammation. However, non‐immune causes should also be considered. B‐ and T‐cell responses have a complex interdependent relationship, primary defects resulting in altered maturation and regulation with subsequent decreased number and function. Haemophagocytosis is an important cause of cytopenia, particularly in the paediatric population, and may herald an underlying primary aetiology. Secondary factors such as splenic sequestration and bone‐marrow infiltration by malignancy or infection are non‐immune causes that should not be overlooked (Figure 1).,

FIGURE 1
Mechanisms contributing to cytopenia in inborn errors of immunity (IEI). (A) The pathogenic mechanisms of cytopenia are multifactorial and include: humoral and cell‐mediated immune dysfunction and/or dysregulation, haemophagocytosis, splenic sequestration (secondary to abnormal lymphoproliferation), bone‐marrow dysfunction including ineffective maturation, myelodysplasia, primary bone‐marrow failure and myelosuppression due to secondary infections and bone‐marrow infiltration.(B) Cytoskeletal dysfunction with megakaryocyte dysfunction, increased apoptosis and splenic platelet destruction. Contributory causes of non‐immune thrombocytopenia in IEI include: increased clearance and apoptosis; myelosuppression by infections, myelofibrosis/bone‐marrow malignancy, cytotoxic drugs or transplant are also contributory.(C) Defective myeloid cell differentiation or release of granulocytes from the bone marrow, enhanced apoptosis and increased destruction of peripheral‐blood granulocytes are the main physiological mechanisms underlying chronic severe or intermittent neutropenia in primary immunodeficiency patients.(D) Lymphopenia driven by B‐ and T‐cell‐intrinsic defect with abnormal maturation and defective function, negative selection of autoreactive T lymphocytes in the thymus as well as defects in the number or function of regulatory T‐cells, impaired apoptosis of autoreactive lymphocytes, loss or breakage of tolerance, increased lymphoid production and cytokine secretion which likely also drives the immune dysregulation and associated autoimmune cytopenia.

### Central retinal vein occlusion secondary to severe iron-deficiency anaemia resulting from a plant-based diet and menorrhagia: a case presentation [^117UhL65]. BMC Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is the second most common retinal vascular disease, following diabetic retinopathy.

Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is a known cause of CRVO, with previously documented cases in the literature. The underlying mechanism of thrombosis in IDA is the result of: 1) reactive thrombocytosis (e.g. increased platelet count, and activity); 2) hypoxia from anaemia leading to injury of endothelial cells in the retino-choroidal circulation; and 3) dysregulation of coagulation (e.g. fibronlysis). Life-threatening complications of iron deficiency anaemia have also been reported with cases of cerebral vascular accidents, pulmonary thromboembolism, and cerebral venous thrombosis also arising.

Iron is essential in retina metabolism but a state of haemostasis needs to exist as high levels of iron contribute to a range of disorders.

Plant-based diets have gained widespread popularity globally in the last decade, with reports of 70% of the world population actively reducing meat consumption, a trend backed by the millennials. In Australia, 11.2% of the population have identified with veganism in 2016, up from 9.7% in 2014. Similar trends have been observed in America, United Kingdom, Germany and Asia.

In this case presentation, we present a young vegan patient who developed a CRVO secondary to severe IDA attributable to menstrual losses and limited iron intake.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^11686JZY]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic approach

In clinical practice, hematology referrals for erythrocytosis are triggered by Hgb/Hct level above 16.5 g/dl/49% and 16 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, and should be confirmed by at least two separate blood counts evaluated at different time points. This should be followed by distinguishing true from apparent erythrocytosis; the former is a result of either a clonal MPN, as in PV, or a non-clonal process resulting in secondary erythrocytosis. It is also important to recognize inapparent (masked) erythrocytosis in which an increase in red cell mass (RCM) is accompanied by a concomitant increase in plasma volume and therefore masked by a normal Hgb/Hct. Similarly, in situations with normal Hgb/Hct and concomitant iron deficiency, PV is often underrecognized. Conversely, an apparent erythrocytosis may result from either a reduction in plasma volume (relative erythrocytosis) or extreme high normal values which exceed the 95th percentile of sex-, race-and altitude-adjusted normal values. RCM measurement is no longer available at our institution; however, upon evaluation of its performance and practical utility in a total of 105 patients with erythrocytosis; elevated RCM was seen in 76%, 20%, 21%, and 57% with PV, secondary erythrocytosis, apparent erythrocytosis, and essential thrombocythemia, respectively. In the particular study RCM significantly correlated with both Hct and Hgb levels (p < 0.001). Hgb/Hct values below which an elevated RCM was not observed were 16/48% for males and 13/39% for females. In contrast, values > 19.5/58% for males and 17.5/53% for females were almost always associated with increased RCM. In other words, RCM measurement was found to be suboptimal in distinguishing PV from other causes of erythrocytosis and failed to offer any additional diagnostic value. Furthermore, obesity is a confounding factor that hinders accurate interpretation of RCM values.

### Evaluation of children with acute central nervous system infections admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit and pediatric ward: a retrospective study [^1124WQco]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The presence of a low leukocyte count in the CSF has been reported as a definitive factor associated with PICU admission. Patients diagnosed with encephalitis often require PICU admission because of the potentially life-threatening nature of the disease. The higher number of patients diagnosed with encephalitis among patients with CNS infections requiring PICU admission may have led to a significantly lower CSF leukocyte count in patients hospitalized in the PICU than in patients in the pediatric ward. A study involving pediatric patients with ABM found that a low WBC count in the CSF, along with elevated protein and/or reduced glucose levels, was associated with adverse outcomes. The rare absence of pleocytosis in the CSF often leads to unfavorable patient outcomes. A decreased WBC count in the CSF may indicate a compromised host immunity and an inadequate response, leading to unfavorable clinical outcomes.

The presence of generalized seizure and status epilepticus in pediatric patients with encephalitis has been identified as a factor associated with the need for PICU admission. Impaired consciousness is an independent risk factor associated with a less favorable prognosis in pediatric patients with ABM. Our study demonstrated that a significantly higher number of patients presenting with impaired consciousness and seizure upon admission required PICU admission. Increased activity of the reticular activation system and damage to the cerebral cortex can contribute to impaired consciousness.

An elevated platelet counts due to increased megakaryocyte production and thrombopoiesis is a characteristic of secondary thrombocytosis, and underlying infections usually cause this reactive process. The relationship between platelet counts and the outcomes of pediatric infections is still a topic of debate. Patients with lower respiratory tract infections and elevated platelet counts may experience severe clinical progression. Thrombocytosis is linked to the severity of urinary tract infections. Our study found a significant increase in platelet counts among patients with CNS infections requiring PICU care compared with those not needing PICU care. This finding suggests a link between platelet count and the severity of CNS infection requiring PICU admission. None of the patients experienced thromboembolic complications, and reactive thrombocytosis manifested as a CNS infection. Subsequent to infection treatment, the thrombocytosis subsided, rendering additional therapeutic interventions unnecessary.

### Essential thrombocythemia: 2024 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management [^1131VoXA]. American Journal of Hematology (2024). Medium credibility.

Overview

Essential thrombocythemia is a Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutation-prevalent myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by clonal thrombocytosis; clinical course is often indolent but might be interrupted by thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications, microcirculatory symptoms (e.g., headaches, lightheadedness, and acral paresthesias), and, less frequently, by disease transformation into myelofibrosis (MF) or acute myeloid leukemia.

Diagnosis

In addition to thrombocytosis (platelets ≥ 450×10⁹/L), formal diagnosis requires the exclusion of other myeloid neoplasms, including prefibrotic MF, polycythemia vera, chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndromes with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis. Bone marrow morphology typically shows increased number of mature-appearing megakaryocytes distributed in loose clusters.

Genetics

Approximately 80% of patients express myeloproliferative neoplasm driver mutations (JAK2, CALR, MPL), in a mutually exclusive manner; in addition, about 50% harbor other mutations, the most frequent being TET2 (9%-11%), ASXL1 (7%-20%), DNMT3A (7%), and SF3B1 (5%). Abnormal karyotype is seen in < 10% of patients and includes +9/20q-/13q-.

Survival and Prognosis

Life expectancy is less than that of the control population. Median survival is approximately 18years but exceeds > 35years in younger patients. The triple A survival risk model, based on Age, Absolute neutrophil count, and Absolute lymphocyte count, effectively delineates high-, intermediate-1-, intermediate-2-, and low-risk disease with corresponding median survivals of 8, 14, 21, and 47years.

Risk Factors For Thrombosis

Four risk categories are considered: very low (age ≤ 60years, no thrombosis history, JAK2 wild-type), low (same as very low but JAK2 mutation present), intermediate (same as low but age > 60years), and high (thrombosis history or age > 60years with JAK2 mutation).

Mutations and Prognosis

MPL and CALR-1 mutations have been associated with increased risk of MF transformation; spliceosome with inferior overall and MF-free survival; TP53 with leukemic transformation, and JAK2V617F with thrombosis. Leukemic transformation rate at 10years is < 1% but might be higher in JAK2-mutated patients with extreme thrombocytosis and those with abnormal karyotype.

Treatment

The main goal of therapy is to prevent thrombosis. In this regard, once-daily low-dose aspirin is advised for all patients and twice daily for low-risk disease. Cytoreductive therapy is advised for high-risk and optional for intermediate-risk disease. First-line cytoreductive drugs of choice are hydroxyurea and pegylated interferon-α and second-line busulfan.

Additional Content

The current review includes specific treatment strategies in the context of extreme thrombocytosis, pregnancy, splanchnic vein thrombosis, perioperative care, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF, as well as new investigational drugs.

### Is very high platelet count always associated with essential thrombocythemia? An unusual presentation in a child [^111kB47k]. Laboratory Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms are rare in childhood. They are categorized as Philadelphia chromosome-positive and Philadelphia chromosome-negative. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is the most common myeloproliferative disease in which the Philadelphia chromosome is detected as a result of BCR-ABL rearrangements. In others, the most common genetic abnormality is JAK2V617F mutation. The coexistence of these 2 abnormalities in CML is unexpected, and rare cases have recently been reported in adults. We present a child who had a very high platelet count in which we found this coexistence. The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, management, and prognosis of this coexistence is challenging in such a rare condition.

### Clinical impact of bone marrow morphology for the diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia: comparison between the BCSH and the WHO criteria [^114fVVqr]. Leukemia (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Accurate diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia (ET) is normally accomplished by applying either the recently updated British Committee for Standards in Haematology (BCSH) guidelines, or the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. This, however, continues to be a controversial and challenging issue. The WHO classification places considerably more weight on bone marrow (BM) morphology as a major diagnostic criterion, which contrasts to the BCSH guidelines, that are mainly focused on an exclusion of the other subtypes of myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Consequently, the first set of BCSH diagnostic criteria (A1–A3) allows ET diagnosis without BM biopsy examination by the following criteria: A1-sustained platelet count > 450 × 10⁹/l; A2-presence of an acquired pathogenetic mutation; A3-no other myeloid malignancy, especially polycythemia vera (PV), primary myelofibrosis (PMF), chronic myeloid leukemia or MDS. This definition represents a major difference from the WHO classification. However, performance of a BM biopsy is included in the second set of the BCSH criteria (A1+A3−A5). In addition to the threshold value of the platelet count (A1) and exclusion of another myeloid malignancy (A3), these criteria require no reactive cause for thrombocytosis and normal iron stores (A4) and also BM morphology (A5) as diagnostic feature ('BM aspirate and trephine biopsy showing increased megakaryocyte numbers displaying a spectrum of morphology with predominantly large megakaryocytes with hyperlobulated nuclei and abundant cytoplasm. Reticulin is generally not increased (grades 0–2/4 or grade 0/3)'). Performance of a BM biopsy is recommended in cases where there are atypical features, if a change in management is planned during the course of treatment (such as change of cytoreductive therapy), or if transformation into myelofibrosis is suspected. In this context, the challenging differentiation of ET from major subtypes of MPN with presenting thrombocytosis is needed, and it is clinically important to be defined correctly already at diagnosis. This concerns particularly PV that is excluded according to the BCSH by revealing a normal hematocrit (Hct) in an iron-replete patient, and PMF. Following the BCSH criteria, PMF is defined as showing a significant BM fibrosis and palpable splenomegaly, blood film abnormalities (circulating progenitors and tear-drop cells) or unexplained anemia consistent with overt myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM). Conversely, the prodromal stages, that is, prefibrotic PMF (prePMF), which often present with conspicuous thrombocytosis, but fail to meet the diagnostic signs and symptoms characterizing MMM, have to be addressed in context with MPN. Further, clinically, it is well known that a small fraction of PV patients may present initially with hemoglobin (Hb) and Hct levels that do not fulfill the 2008 threshold criteria, but a platelet count that is within BCSH- and WHO-defined ET criteria, thus mimicking phenotypically ET at onset.

### An unusual case of extreme thrombocytosis caused by iron deficiency [^116Dsjse]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Iron deficiency is a common cause of reactive thrombocytosis resulting in usually mild to moderately increased but sometimes even in extreme thrombocytosis (ie, > 1000×10⁹/L). We report a case of a 34-year-old woman who developed an increased platelet count of 1953×10 9 /L. Upon admission, cytoreductive therapy was initiated until an underlying chronic myeloproliferative neoplasia was ruled out. The patient had undergone bariatric surgery 5 years previously, and surprisingly, a diagnosis of reactive thrombocytosis due to iron deficiency secondary to iron malabsorption was made. It is concluded that the degree of extreme thrombocytosis may be even fourfold to fivefold increased in patients with severe iron deficiency. Our finding emphasises the importance of regular control of possible need for iron supplementation following bariatric surgery.

### Spontaneous resolution of extreme thrombocytosis in 2 children [^114BiGYv]. Pediatric Hematology and Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

Essential thrombocytosis (ET) is rare in children, sometimes difficult to be distinguished from secondary thrombocytosis. This report concerns 2 children with extreme thrombocytosis of 4100 × 10(9)/L and 1644 × 10(9)/L with partial and complete remission at 3 months and 4 years from diagnosis, with a follow-up of 4 and 17 years, respectively, with no cytoreduction therapy. Diagnosis of ET was suggested according to accepted criteria. However, spontaneous remission of the thrombocytosis argues for the diagnosis of secondary thrombocytosis. These patients highlight the complexity of distinguishing childhood ET from secondary thrombocytosis and the need for cautious personalized decision on cytoreduction therapy.

5.9	Hematopoietic Complications

Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin (the active metabolite of CEREBYX). These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression.

There have been a number of reports that have suggested a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized), including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. Macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported with phenytoin.

### JAK2V617F expression in murine hematopoietic cells leads to MPD mimicking human PV with secondary myelofibrosis [^113DYr5J]. Blood (2006). Low credibility.

A JAK2(V617F) mutation is frequently found in several BCR/ABL-negative myeloproliferative disorders. To address the contribution of this mutant to the pathogenesis of these different myeloproliferative disorders, we used an adoptive transfer of marrow cells transduced with a retrovirus expressing JAK2(V617F) in recipient irradiated mice. Hosts were analyzed during the 6 months after transplantation. For a period of 3 months, mice developed polycythemia, macrocytosis and usually peripheral blood granulocytosis. Transient thrombocytosis was only observed in a low-expresser group. All mice displayed trilineage hyperplasia in marrow and spleen along with an amplification of myeloid and erythroid progenitor cells and a formation of endogenous erythroid colonies. After 3 to 4 months, polycythemia regressed, abnormally shaped red blood cells and platelets were seen in circulation, and a deposition of reticulin fibers was observed in marrow and spleen. Development of fibrosis was associated with anemia, thrombocytopenia, high neutrophilia, and massive splenomegaly. These features mimic human polycythemia vera and its evolution toward myelofibrosis. This work demonstrates that JAK2(V617F) is sufficient for polycythemia and fibrosis development and offers an in vivo model to assess novel therapeutic approaches for JAK2(V617F)-positive pathologies. Questions remain regarding the exact contribution of JAK2(V617F) in other myeloproliferative disorders.

### Thrombocytosis [^111E9wqA]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Major progress in understanding the pathogenesis in patients with thrombocytosis has been made by identifying mutations in the key regulators of thrombopoietin: the thrombopoietin receptor MPL and JAK2. Together, these mutations can be found in 50% to 60% of patients with essential thrombocythemia or primary myelofibrosis and in 10% to 20% of hereditary thrombocytosis. A decrease in expression of the Mpl protein can cause thrombocytosis even in the absence of mutations in the coding sequence, due to a shift in the balance between stimulation of signaling in megakaryopoiesis and removal of thrombopoietin by receptor mediated internalization in platelets. When present in a heterozygous state the JAK2-V617F mutation preferentially stimulates megakaryopoiesis and in most cases manifests as essential thrombocythemia (ET), whereas homozygous JAK2-V617F reduces megakaryopoiesis in favor of increased erythropoiesis, resulting in polycythemia vera and/or myelofibrosis. In 30% to 40% of patients with ET or primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and in 80% to 90% of pedigrees with hereditary thrombocytosis the disease-causing gene remains unknown. Ongoing genetic and genomic screens have identified genes that, when mutated, can cause thrombocytosis in mouse models. A more complete picture of the pathways that regulate megakaryopoisis and platelet production will be important for finding new ways of controlling platelet production in patients with thrombocytosis.

### Personalized management of essential thrombocythemia-application of recent evidence to clinical practice [^112BCHrC]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Impact on clinical practice

On the basis of the above fact, we reiterate the prognostic importance of confirming the diagnosis of true ET in any patient with a reported diagnosis of 'ET'. In this regard, one must carefully examine the complete blood count (anemia or leukocytosis suggest early/prefibrotic MF), peripheral blood smear (increased red cell distribution width, decreased mean corpuscular volume that is not associated with iron deficiency, or leukoerythroblastosis suggests early/prefibrotic MF), serum lactate dehydrogenase (increased levels are more consistent with early/prefibrotic MF) and JAK2 V617F allele burden (diagnosis of ET must be questioned in the presence of > 25% allele burden).

In terms of management, caution is required in the use of aspirin in early/prefibrotic MF because of the increased baseline risk of bleeding. In general, we recommend avoidance of prophylactic aspirin therapy in early/prefibrotic MF, especially in the presence of a bleeding history. This is different from our treatment approach in WHO-defined ET, in which we recommend universal use of aspirin therapy in the absence of clear contraindications, such as clinically relevant acquired von Willebrand syndrome. On the other hand, the indications to use cytoreductive therapy remain similar to those of ET, but might require deeper cytoreduction in the presence of leukocytosis.

### Survival and disease progression in essential thrombocythemia are significantly influenced by accurate morphologic diagnosis: an international study [^112DiPbM]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

The WHO diagnostic criteria underscore the role of bone marrow (BM) morphology in distinguishing essential thrombocythemia (ET) from early/prefibrotic primary myelofibrosis (PMF). This study examined the clinical relevance of such a distinction.

Methods

Representatives from seven international centers of excellence for myeloproliferative neoplasms convened to create a clinicopathologic database of patients previously diagnosed as having ET (N = 1,104). Study eligibility criteria included availability of treatment-naive BM specimens obtained within 1 year of diagnosis. All bone marrows subsequently underwent a central re-review.

Results

Diagnosis was confirmed as ET in 891 patients (81%) and was revised to early/prefibrotic PMF in 180 (16%); 33 patients were not evaluable. In early/prefibrotic PMF compared with ET, the 10-year survival rates (76% and 89%, respectively) and 15-year survival rates (59% and 80%, respectively), leukemic transformation rates at 10 years (5.8% and 0.7%, respectively) and 15 years (11.7% and 2.1%, respectively), and rates of progression to overt myelofibrosis at 10 years (12.3% and 0.8%, respectively) and 15 years (16.9% and 9.3%) were significantly worse. The respective death, leukemia, and overt myelofibrosis incidence rates per 100 patient-years for early/prefibrotic PMF compared with ET were 2.7% and 1.3% (relative risk [RR], 2.1; P < .001), 0.6% and 0.1% (RR, 5.2; p = 0.001), and 1% and 0.5% (RR, 2.0; p = 0.04). Multivariable analysis confirmed these findings and also identified age older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR], 6.7), leukocyte count greater than 11 × 10(9)/L (HR, 2.01), anemia (HR, 2.95), and thrombosis history (HR, 2.81) as additional risk factors for survival. Thrombosis and JAK2V617F incidence rates were similar between the two groups. Survival in ET was similar to the sex- and age-standardized European population.

Conclusion

This study validates the clinical relevance of strict adherence to WHO criteria in the diagnosis of ET and provides important information on survival, disease complication rates, and prognostic factors in strictly WHO-defined ET and early/prefibrotic PMF.

### Laboratory practice guidelines for detecting and reporting JAK2 and MPL mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms: a report of the Association for Molecular Pathology [^113digfU]. The Journal of Molecular Diagnostics (2013). Medium credibility.

JAK2 mutation testing — screening indications include unexplained polycythemia, neutrophilia, or thrombocytosis after ruling out secondary causes; additional indications include splanchnic vein thrombosis and refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (RARS-T), with 31% of splanchnic vein thrombosis patients having associated JAK2 mutations and nearly one third of RARS-T patients having a JAK2 mutation; after secondary causes of polycythemia have been ruled out, JAK2 analysis (first exon 14 V617F, then exon 12 if negative) is indicated to support the diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV).

### Primary myelofibrosis and the myeloproliferative neoplasms: the role of individual variation [^114Tr8Tr]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

The classic myeloproliferative neoplasms — essential thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis — are acquired, clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by an overproduction of mature blood cells, bone marrow hypercellularity, extramedullary hematopoiesis, a tendency for thrombosis, and, rarely, leukemic transformation. Despite being classified as neoplastic diseases, the myeloproliferative neoplasms are often characterized by longevity, with survival measured in decades, even in the absence of treatment. Primary myelofibrosis is the rarest of the myeloproliferative neoplasms, is the most obscure with regard to its pathophysiology, and carries the least favorable although highly variable natural history. The identification of molecular lesions specific to the myeloproliferative neoplasms, in particular JAK2 V617F, has broadened understanding of the common features within these disorders and has advanced diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tools. This article highlights the challenges inherent in the management of primary myelofibrosis and presents an opportunity to address the basis of individual variation within a rare and complex disorder.

### Macrocytosis may be associated with mortality in chronic hemodialysis patients: a prospective study [^116ZGeYj]. BMC Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

As a predictor of increased mortality, macrocytosis does have advantages over other laboratory markers commonly used in dialysis patients. In our study, macrocytosis was a strong predictor of mortality evidenced by a high hazard ratio. In addition, as it is included in the routine CBC, measurement of the MCV requires no additional laboratory tests and is cheaper compared to conventional laboratory markers of mortality.

There are limitations to this study. With only 23 outcomes, we were unable to do extensive multivariate analyses without risk of over-fitting. Therefore, there is the possibility of residual confounding. However, this is primarily a pilot study and the main purpose is to stimulate hypothesis generation for future analyses. Another limitation is that the lack of serum B12 and red cell folate levels in all patients makes it difficult to completely exclude vitamin deficiency as a cause of macrocytosis. In addition, only a few patients had reticulocyte levels measured at baseline (a known cause of macrocytosis). However, 93 and 100% of patients with an MCV > 102 fl were on multivitamin and folate supplementation, and at six months, RBC folate and serum B12 levels were normal in over 90% of macrocytic patients (data not shown). In addition, a reanalysis at six months revealed comparable reticulocyte counts between macrocytic and normocytic patients, and an absolute reticulocytosis in only a few macrocytic patients (data not shown). Finally, as this is a single-centre study, we acknowledge that the findings of this study cannot necessarily be generalized to other dialysis populations. A recent study in a larger cohort of dialysis patients identified a lower mean MCV than our cohort, and did not find an association between MCV and mortality. However, our study is unique as we analyzed MCV both as a continuous and categorical variable. Furthermore, our population is not unlike other dialysis cohorts with respect to its identified predictors of mortality. These predictors include age, stroke, cancer, albumin and ferritin. Nonetheless, our population may be unique with respect to a high prevalence of macrocytosis and validation with another dialysis population may increase the strength of our findings. In addition, if macrocytosis is associated with higher comorbidity it would fluctuate based on patient clinical status. Thus, a study using marginal structural models that adjust for time dependent confounding would be clinically relevant.

Case presentation

In June 2021, a 32-year-old woman was admitted to the Emergency Department with a two-week history of asthenia and jaundice without choluria, recent infections, or medications. Laboratory tests identified mild regenerative macrocytic anemia (hemoglobin 10.4 g/dL; mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 105 fL [normal range (NR): 79–99 fL]; reticulocytes count, 204000/µL [NR: 15000–80000/µL]) associated with hemolysis pattern (total and indirect bilirubin (6.4 and 6.1 mg/dL, respectively) [NR: 0.30–1.20 and 0.10–0.30 mg/dL, respectively], LDH 674 U/L [NR: 208–378 U/L], undetectable haptoglobin), thrombocytosis (platelets 814000/µL), along with iron overload (ferritin 176 ng/mL [NR:10–120 ng/mL]) and hypergammaglobulinemia (1.9 g/dL) [NR: 0.8–1.4 g/dL]. Chronic liver disease, monoclonal gammopathy, hereditary spherocytosis, β-thalassemia, and autoimmune origin were excluded. Abdominal ultrasound did not show hepatosplenomegaly.

A PB smear showed anisocytosis, polychromasia, and thrombocytosis with anisothrombia (Fig. S1). Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and pyruvate kinase (PK) levels were within reference limits.

Throughout recent years (2017–2019), compensated hemolysis was evidenced by normal hemoglobin levels but elevated bilirubin and LDH. In fact, due to recurrent hepatic colic, she underwent cholecystectomy in 2018. Notably, the onset of anemia coincided with the appearance of thrombocytosis (June 2019, Fig. 1A). Her pediatric history indicated she was born after two first-trimester miscarriages and was the oldest of three siblings (Fig. 1B). She suffered from neonatal sepsis caused by coagulase-positive staphylococci, followed by anemia and hyperbilirubinemia requiring RBC transfusion. Despite these early complications, she showed compensated hemolysis without signs of other hematological abnormalities.

### A critical review of the molecular pathophysiology of lenalidomide sensitivity in 5q-myelodysplastic syndromes [^111k9TQ8]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2012). Low credibility.

Abstract The 5q deletion is a chromosomal abnormality that is observed in a subset of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). When isolated, this abnormality defines a specific clinical syndrome termed MDS associated with isolated deletion 5q, presenting with macrocytic anemia, normal platelet count or slight thrombocytosis, hypolobated megakaryocytes and fewer than 5% blasts in the bone marrow. MDS with the 5q deletion have a particular sensitivity to treatment with lenalidomide, a thalidomide analog. In this article, molecular changes in 5q- MDS derived from haploinsufficiency of genes encoded from the deleted region in 5q are reviewed, and mechanisms that link these molecular lesions with lenalidomide sensitivity are proposed.

Case presentation

Approximately 2 years prior to presentation (figure 1, grey arrow), this man underwent evaluation for an abnormal peripheral blood smear that demonstrated the presence of immature white blood cells concerning for myeloid blasts. A bone marrow biopsy evaluation demonstrated a hypercellular marrow with evidence of myeloid dysplasia. There were no ringed sideroblasts. Mutational analysis done at the time confirmed the presence of mutations in three genes: JAK2, IDH1 and SRSF2 (table 1). While the JAK2V617F mutation is diagnostic of a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), the IDH1 and SRSF2 mutations are commonly associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114RWzbo]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Risk stratification in PV and ET — leukocytosis and thrombocytosis: Leukocytosis at diagnosis is associated with higher risk of thrombosis and major hemorrhage in patients with PV and ET, though some studies suggest the prognostic significance for recurrent thrombosis may be significant only in patients < 60 years of age and other studies report no association with subsequent thrombosis. Thrombocytosis (platelet count > 1000 × 10⁹/L) is associated with an immediate risk of major hemorrhage but not with risk of thrombosis in ET, and elevated platelet counts at diagnosis (> 1000 x 10⁹/L) are associated with significantly lower rate of thrombosis, including in JAK2‑mutated ET. The potential benefit of initiating cytoreductive therapy solely for elevated leukocytosis or thrombocytosis at diagnosis has not been evaluated in prospective studies.

A 60-year-old woman with no premorbidities presented with symptoms of sudden painless vision loss in the left eye (LE). Best-corrected visual acuity in the LE was counting fingers close to face. A relative afferent pupillary defect was observed in the LE. Ocular fundus examination of LE was suggestive of central retinal artery occlusion. Systemic evaluation revealed splenomegaly and normal cardiac and carotid arteries. Haematological investigations revealed increased haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count and leucocytosis with low erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Features of myeloproliferative neoplasm were noted on bone marrow aspiration. An assay for JAK2 mutation was positive. Since erythropoietin levels were normal, a diagnosis of primary polycythaemia vera was made and treated with aspirin and phlebotomy twice weekly until the target haematocrit of under 45% was achieved.

Conclusions

This cohort study found that an increased platelet count among individuals with normal platelet levels in the prior 2 years was associated with an increased risk of cancer. Increased risk of a solid-tumor diagnosis was predominant among lung, ovarian, kidney, and gastrointestinal malignant tumors. The findings suggest that individuals with unexplained thrombocytosis should be offered screening for several common cancers.

### Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2013 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^112ecCRg]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

Polycythemia Vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) primarily characterized by erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis, respectively. Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombohemorrhagic complications, vasomotor disturbances, pruritus and a small risk of disease progression into acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis.

Diagnosis

Almost all patients with PV harbor a JAK2 mutation. When PV is suspected, the presence of a JAK2 mutation highly suggests the diagnosis and its absence, combined with normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, excludes the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis of ET should include reactive thrombocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, prefibrotic myelofibrosis and RARS-T (refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis). A JAK2 mutation is found in 50–70% of patients with ET, myelofibrosis or RARS-T and is capable of distinguishing reactive from clonal thrombocytosis.

Risk Stratification

Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications: high-risk is defined by the presence of age > 60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk is defined by the absence of both of these two risk factors. Recent data considers JAK2V617F and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors as additional risk factors for thrombosis. Presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count > 1,000 × 10(9) /L) might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding. Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include advanced age, leukocytosis, and history of thrombosis.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

Survival is near-normal in ET and reasonably long in PV. The 10-year risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation is < 1%/1% in ET and < 3%/10% in PV. In contrast, the risk of thrombosis exceeds 20%. The main goal of therapy is therefore to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. In low risk patients, this is effectively and safely accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin in both PV and ET and phlebotomy (hematocrit target of < 45%) in PV. In high risk patients, treatment with hydroxyurea is additionally recommended, although not mandated in older patients without JAK2V617F or CV risk factors. Treatment with busulfan or interferon-α is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures. Screening for clinically significant AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.

NCCN Myeloproliferative Neoplasms — WHO and ICC diagnostic criteria for essential thrombocythemia (ET) list four major criteria: platelet count ≥ 450 × 10⁹/L; bone marrow biopsy showing proliferation mainly of the megakaryocytic lineage with increased numbers of enlarged, mature megakaryocytes with hyperlobulated nuclei and no significant increase or left shift in neutrophil granulopoiesis or erythropoiesis; WHO criteria for BCR::ABL1-positive CML, PV, PMF, and other myeloid neoplasms are not met; and JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation. Minor criteria are presence of a clonal marker or exclusion of reactive thrombocytosis. The diagnosis of ET requires either all the major criteria or the first 3 major criteria plus a minor criterion to be met.

### Evaluation of macrocytosis… [^115bpJKG]. AAFP (2009). Low credibility.

Table 1. 1, 3–5 Although it is associated with anemia, hypothyroidism is a more common cause in older persons than in other age groups. Results of a study in New York City indicated that medications for treating human immunodeficiency virus infection have become a more prominent cause of macrocytosis. Table 2). 1, 3–5, 7–16 Megaloblastic processes are characterized on the peripheral smear by macroovalocytes and hypersegmented neutrophils, which are absent in nonmegaloblastic macrocytic processes. Nonmegaloblastic processes have round macrocytes or macroreticulocytes. Nonmegaloblastic processes develop from multiple mechanisms and have not been fully outlined. Macrocytosis can occur when there is increased RBC production secondary to peripheral blood cell destruction or loss, leading to a reticulocytosis. Reticulocytes are incompletely processed RBCs and, therefore, are slightly larger than the average RBC.

The mechanisms by which the other diseases listed in Table 1 1, 3–5 cause macrocytosis have not been fully explained. Although uncommon, consider the possibility of spurious macrocytosis. This may be caused by cold agglutinins, hyperglycemia, or leukocytosis. Cold agglutinins cause the RBCs to clump, making them appear larger to the automatic counter. 10 Hyperglycemic blood is more concentrated, and when it is diluted to measure the mean corpuscular volume, the cells swell more than usual, causing a false elevation. 11 Increased turbidity of a sample with marked leukocytosis also can cause the machine to overestimate the cell size.
12. OTHER ETIOLOGIES Medications, hypothyroidism, liver and renal disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are associated with less dramatic elevations in the mean corpuscular volume. Nonalcoholic liver disease and hypothyroidism account for a substantial portion of macrocytosis.

Patient history and physical examination should include a history of these medical diseases. Splenectomy may cause macrocytosis because cells are not processed as thoroughly when the spleen is absent. Down syndrome also may be associated with reticulocytosis or myeloproliferative disorders. 30 Treatment, if needed, can be directed at the underlying disorder.

### Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia… [^112GtMyG]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia are chronic myeloproliferative diseases. The main goal of treatment in patients with these conditions is to prevent thrombo-hemorrhagic complications. Tefferi and colleagues reviewed the medical literature to summarize the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. When phlebotomy was the sole treatment of polycythemia vera, the average rate of survival was extended to more than 12 years. Adding chlorambucil therapy to phlebotomy decreased the rate of survival to about nine years. Similarly, radioactive phosphorus plus phlebotomy decreased the rate of survival to less than 11 years. Patients who received these medications also had a higher risk of acquiring acute leukemia than those being treated with phlebotomy alone. However, chlorambucil and radioactive phosphorus were associated with a lower risk of thrombosis than treatment with phlebotomy alone.

Patients taking hydroxyurea had lower incidences of early thrombosis and acute leukemia. Based on this information, the authors recommend that all patients with polycythemia vera be treated with phlebotomy; patients at high risk for thrombosis should also receive hydroxyurea. Essential thrombocythemia is diagnosed after reactive and clonal thrombocytosis are excluded. This can be done by measuring Creactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rates and fibrinogen levels. A bone marrow biopsy can rule out other chronic myeloid disorders. Women have essential thrombocythemia more often than men. Vasomotor symptoms such as headaches and paresthesias are more common, while thrombotic and bleeding events are progressively less common. There is a low incidence of transformation into acute leukemia or myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia.

Prognosis is worse in patients older than 60 years and those who have a history of thrombosis. Qualitative or quantitative platelet abnormalities are not consistent predictors of thrombosis risk, although extreme thrombocytosis may be related to a higher incidence of gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage. The risk of thrombosis is reduced by the use of hydroxyurea and by keeping the platelet count less than 400 × 10.

Symptoms are variable based on evidence of cirrhosis, liver dysfunction, gastrointestinal bleeding, ascites, hepatomegaly, and jaundice Abnormal intrinsic liver function testing, imaging and liver biopsy as clinically indicated Based on etiology; often supportive Hypersplenism often is present contributing to thrombocytopenia. Long history of abnormal platelet count or family history of thrombocytopenia Many disorders associated with giant platelets, neutrophil inclusions, or other congenital anomalies Varies depending on primary abnormality Often asymptomatic when there is no bleeding diathesis Acute illness; bleeding, acute renal failure, hepatic and respiratory dysfunction, and shock are common clinical manifestations.

Identified during initial prenatal CBC No associated fetal thrombocytopenia Spontaneous resolution after delivery No treatment indicated Platelet counts approaching 50 ×103 per μL often are considered ITP and treated with corticosteroids or IVIG Possible immunologic etiology. Often asymptomatic, although symptoms can range from petechiae and easy bruising to severe bleeding diathesis Secondary ITP may present in patients with autoimmune disorders, infections, and lymphoproliferative disorders.

Secondary ITP also requires treatment of underlying cause Diagnosis of exclusion Patients older than 60 years should have bone marrow biopsy to rule out myelodysplastic syndrome or lymphoproliferative disorder MMR vaccination causes one case of ITP per 40, 000 doses Viral: prodrome or asymptomatic; known viruses include cytomegalovirus, Epstein- Barr virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, human immunodeficiency virus, parvovirus B19, varicella-zoster virus.
