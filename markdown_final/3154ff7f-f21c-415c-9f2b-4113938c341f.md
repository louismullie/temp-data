## Question

Can give estrogen to cva and heart failure

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether estrogen therapy can be given to patients with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA/stroke) and heart failure, and how to approach this situation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions, including timing since menopause and baseline cardiovascular risk. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence on stroke risk with estrogen therapy. Next, I will examine heart failure–specific data. After that, I need to check guideline positions and contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and outline safer alternatives if estrogen is not appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions, because timing and baseline risk drive the answer. Estrogen therapy in menopause is typically considered for vasomotor symptoms, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and osteoporosis prevention; it is not indicated for primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention, and the risk profile varies by age at initiation and time since menopause, with the most favorable balance generally in women younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause who are otherwise low risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and breast cancer [^114WrBok] [^115G8fey] [^112BccEB].

> Now, I should verify the stroke risk signal from high-quality evidence before drawing conclusions. Multiple randomized trials and meta-analyses consistently show that estrogen-containing menopausal hormone therapy increases ischemic stroke risk, with WHI showing a higher stroke risk for estrogen plus progestin (HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.07–1.76) and a smaller but significant increase with estrogen alone, and a Cochrane review showing an increased stroke risk overall (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10–1.41), with the excess risk more pronounced when therapy is initiated more than 10 years after menopause [^111zFtXc] [^116rZnfb] [^113a85Z4]. Wait, let me verify the absolute risk framing: the USPSTF estimates roughly 52–79 additional strokes per 10,000 women treated per year depending on regimen, which is clinically meaningful in older or higher-risk populations [^1171bbtd].

> Hold on, I should also review secondary prevention data in women with established coronary disease, because that informs risk in vascular patients. HERS and HERS II showed no cardiovascular benefit and no reduction in stroke events with combined estrogen–progestin, reinforcing that hormone therapy should not be used for cardioprotection or stroke prevention in women with established atherosclerotic disease [^1165tZhu]. I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from coronary disease to cerebrovascular disease; nonetheless, the absence of benefit and potential early harm in vascular cohorts is pertinent when counseling after stroke or with heart failure [^112fWf2k].

> Next, I will examine heart failure–specific data, but I should confirm how limited it is. Most available signals are observational; for example, a retrospective cohort of older women with symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction suggested lower all-cause and cardiac mortality with estrogen use, but this design is vulnerable to confounding and should be viewed as hypothesis-generating rather than practice-changing [^115nvim8]. Let me consider mechanistic plausibility: estrogen has favorable vascular and myocardial effects in experimental models, yet these have not translated into consistent clinical benefit in randomized trials of postmenopausal women, and any potential benefit would need to be weighed against increased thrombotic risk inherent to systemic estrogen, especially in heart failure where thrombosis and arrhythmia risks are elevated [^116VFkVu] [^1171bbtd].

> I should double-check guideline positions to anchor decisions. The 2024 AHA/ASA primary prevention guideline advises that oral estrogen-containing menopausal hormone therapy is associated with excess stroke risk in women aged 60 or older, more than 10 years postmenopause, or at elevated cardiovascular or stroke risk, and recommends evaluating and modifying vascular risk factors in those with premature or early menopause rather than using hormone therapy for stroke prevention [^115bp6Qg] [^115Fvrg4] [^1136Gx42]. The European Stroke Organisation explicitly recommends avoiding hormone replacement therapy to reduce ischemic stroke risk or mortality after acute ischemic stroke in postmenopausal women, aligning with a harm-avoidance approach in cerebrovascular disease [^114ZCApv]. For heart failure and coronary disease, cardiology guidance advises against systemic estrogen for cardiovascular risk reduction or secondary prevention, again emphasizing thrombotic concerns and lack of outcome benefit [^1137t3y6] [^115bp6Qg].

> Let me think about contraindications and risk modifiers, because these often clinch the decision. Active or recent venous thromboembolism, arterial thromboembolism such as stroke or myocardial infarction, and uncontrolled hypertension are commonly cited contraindications or strong cautions for systemic estrogen, and FDA labeling for estrogen products carries boxed warnings about stroke, venous thrombosis, and myocardial infarction, advising immediate discontinuation if these events occur or are suspected [^117WMusj] [^111dGHEf] [^116FLbP7]. I should confirm that even in women without overt vascular events, transdermal routes and lower doses may mitigate some thrombotic risk, but stroke risk does not appear eliminated, particularly in older initiators or those with vascular disease [^112x5uVP] [^117QbLCj].

> But wait, what if the patient is very early postmenopausal and low risk — does the "timing hypothesis" change this? Observational and some trial subgroup analyses suggest a more favorable cardiovascular risk–benefit balance when hormone therapy is initiated in women younger than 60 or within 10 years of menopause, yet even in this window, WHI showed no stroke benefit and a small increase in stroke with estrogen plus progestin, and no randomized data demonstrate stroke risk reduction with hormone therapy in any population, so the timing hypothesis does not convert systemic estrogen into a stroke-preventive strategy [^114WrBok] [^111zFtXc] [^116rZnfb]. I should confirm that guidelines still allow symptom-directed use in carefully selected, low-risk, younger women, but that is distinct from use after stroke or for heart failure management [^114WrBok] [^112BccEB].

> I will now synthesize the clinical answer. For patients with prior CVA/stroke, systemic estrogen therapy should be avoided because it increases ischemic stroke risk and confers no proven cardiovascular benefit; if menopausal symptom control is needed, prioritize nonhormonal options, and if local genitourinary symptoms persist, consider low-dose vaginal estrogen given its minimal systemic absorption and lack of demonstrated stroke signal in trials, while still individualizing and monitoring [^1171bbtd] [^115mnMhv] [^116rfndN]. For patients with heart failure, there is no evidence base supporting systemic estrogen to improve heart failure outcomes, and potential thrombotic harms outweigh theoretical benefits; therefore, systemic estrogen should not be initiated for heart failure management, and guideline-directed heart failure therapy should be optimized instead [^112fWf2k].

> Next, I should review safer alternatives and risk-mitigation strategies, so I don't leave the patient without options. Nonhormonal therapies such as SSRIs/SNRIs, gabapentin, or clonidine can treat vasomotor symptoms; low-dose vaginal estrogen is appropriate for genitourinary symptoms and is not contraindicated solely due to remote stroke or heart failure; and if, after shared decision-making, a very low-risk, early postmenopausal patient strongly prefers systemic therapy, transdermal estradiol at the lowest effective dose with attention to progestogen choice may reduce thrombotic risk compared with oral formulations, though stroke risk is not eliminated and must be explicitly discussed [^116n48UV] [^115mnMhv] [^113r69Zv] [^112x5uVP].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up reflect the risk discussion. I should record baseline cardiovascular risk, contraindications, and the patient's preferences. If any systemic estrogen is used, plan the lowest effective dose, prefer transdermal delivery, reassess need at 6–12 months, and stop immediately if stroke, VTE, or MI occurs. For all patients with stroke or heart failure, prioritize aggressive management of blood pressure, diabetes, lipids, weight, and lifestyle factors, and consider early menopause or premature ovarian insufficiency as risk enhancers warranting intensified primary prevention even though hormone therapy is not a prevention strategy in this context [^114WrBok] [^111dGHEf] [^115bp6Qg] [^112VjFBi].

In general, **estrogen therapy is not recommended** for patients with a history of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) or heart failure due to increased risks of stroke, venous thromboembolism, and cardiovascular events [^111zFtXc]. Estrogen therapy is **contraindicated in patients with a history of stroke or thromboembolic disease** [^116FLbP7] and should be avoided in heart failure because it can worsen fluid retention and thrombotic risk [^116FLbP7]. If menopausal symptom control is needed, consider non-hormonal options or low-dose transdermal estrogen only after careful risk assessment and shared decision-making [^116n48UV] [^113r69Zv].

## Risks of estrogen therapy in patients with CVA and heart failure

### Cerebrovascular accident (CVA)

- **Increased stroke risk**: Estrogen therapy, particularly oral formulations, significantly increases the risk of ischemic stroke, especially in women aged ≥ 60 years or > 10 years postmenopause [^115bp6Qg] [^1171bbtd].

- **Thromboembolic risk**: Estrogen therapy increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which can precipitate or worsen stroke [^115Dy18c].

- **Guideline recommendations**: Major guidelines (AHA/ASA, NAMS, AACE) advise against estrogen therapy in patients with a history of stroke or thromboembolic disease due to these risks [^112BccEB] [^117WMusj].

---

### Heart failure (HF)

- **Fluid retention and edema**: Estrogen therapy can cause sodium and water retention, exacerbating heart failure symptoms and worsening clinical status [^116FLbP7].

- **Thrombotic risk**: Increased VTE risk with estrogen therapy is particularly concerning in heart failure patients, who already have elevated thromboembolic risk [^115Dy18c].

- **Lack of benefit**: There is no evidence that estrogen therapy improves heart failure outcomes, and it may worsen symptoms and increase complications [^112fWf2k].

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

| **Condition** | **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|
| CVA | - AHA/ASA <br/> - NAMS <br/> - AACE | - Estrogen therapy contraindicated <br/> - Increased stroke and VTE risk [^115bp6Qg] [^114WrBok] [^1171bbtd] |
| Heart failure | - ACC/AHA <br/> - AACE | - Estrogen therapy not recommended <br/> - Fluid retention and thrombotic risk [^116k1ZJo] [^116FLbP7] |

---

## Alternative therapies and management strategies

Given the risks, **alternative therapies and management strategies** should be considered:

- **Non-hormonal therapies**: SSRIs, SNRIs, gabapentin, and clonidine are effective for vasomotor symptoms without the cardiovascular risks associated with estrogen therapy [^117F5iL1].

- **Lifestyle modifications**: Diet, exercise, weight management, and smoking cessation are essential for symptom control and cardiovascular risk reduction [^117F5iL1].

- **Local estrogen therapy**: For genitourinary symptoms, low-dose vaginal estrogen may be considered due to minimal systemic absorption, but caution is advised in patients with significant cardiovascular risk [^115mnMhv].

---

## Individualized risk assessment and shared decision-making

If estrogen therapy is considered, **individualized risk assessment and shared decision-making** are essential:

- **Risk assessment**: Evaluate cardiovascular risk factors, including age, hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and thromboembolic history [^112gaeGy].

- **Shared decision-making**: Discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives with the patient, emphasizing the potential harms of estrogen therapy in patients with CVA or heart failure [^11211fam].

- **Monitoring**: If estrogen therapy is initiated, closely monitor for adverse effects, including stroke, VTE, and worsening heart failure symptoms [^111dGHEf].

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Estrogen therapy is **not recommended** for patients with a history of CVA or heart failure due to increased risks of stroke, VTE, and cardiovascular events. If menopausal symptom control is needed, consider non-hormonal options or low-dose transdermal estrogen only after careful risk assessment and shared decision-making.

### Association between hormone replacement therapy and subsequent arterial and venous vascular events: a meta-analysis [^115gvDsx]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

The finding that younger women do not benefit from HRT was also shown in a recent observational study. One problem in assessing response by age is that few papers provide information on time between menopause and recruitment; previous studies used a cut in age at 60, although this is arbitrary. Using another cut at 55 years does not greatly alter the findings (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.19–2.57) and the recent WHI analysis showed age and time from menopause to be well correlated.

Subgroup analyses showed no difference in CHD events by type of oestrogen (CEE vs. oestradiol) with and without progesterone, or oral vs. transdermal administration (although the number of trials using transdermal administration was small). The diverse dosing regiments precluded meaningful analysis of the effect of dose of HRT.

In comparison with other meta-analyseswe have counted the number of patients with at least one event rather than the total number of events. This is important as many patients suffer more than one event during the course of a trial (i.e. a patient with a non-fatal stroke may go on to have a fatal stroke) and the present approach may provide a more accurate estimate of the risk associated with HRT to an individual.

Several caveats should be made about the present study. First, data from heterogeneous trials have been aggregated, for example, duration and type of HRT. This is unlikely to have altered the results materially since most data came from modern large trials (e.g. WHI, WISDOM) involving tens of thousands of patients and the impact of data from older smaller trials will have been small. Secondly, sensitivity analyses did not reveal any differences in hazard between different types of intervention, participant, or trial design. Lastly, several of the analyses had limited power since trial authors did not report uniformly the effect of HRT on stroke, MI, and VTE, or on the outcome after these events. It is vital that future trial reports give such data.

### Hormone replacement therapy and stroke: clinical trials review [^117L6YcB]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Bench research suggests that postmenopausal hormonal therapy is associated with beneficial effects on the brain and vascular system. Observational data suggest that postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy is associated with a 25% to 50% lower rate of cardiovascular disease; however, observational data for hormonal therapy is associated with the potential for significant biases. Clinical trial data are needed. There are 3 major clinical trials that inform us about stroke and postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy. Two trials focused on secondary prevention: the Heart and Estrogen/progesterone Replacement Study (HERS) and the Women's Estrogen for Stroke Trial (WEST). One examined primary prevention: the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). All indicate that postmenopausal hormone therapy is not effective for reducing the risk of a recurrent stroke or death among women with established vascular disease or for prevention of a first stroke. Similar results exist for cardiovascular disease. The results of these trials are now reflected in national guidelines. Hormone therapy should not be initiated to prevent vascular disease among postmenopausal women. As a result of these trials, the portion of postmenopausal women using hormone replacement therapy in the United States has fallen by more than half over the past decade.

Coronary heart disease — combined estrogen–progestogen therapy (EPT): Age at initiation of EPT does not appear to influence the relative risk of CHD; in WHI women aged 50 to 59 there was a trend toward excess risk of CHD, but no increased risk was apparent in women < 10 years since menopause onset. A randomized osteoporosis trial reported that 10 years of MHT treatment in women < 50 years old at study onset was associated with the reduction of a composite safety endpoint (death, hospital admission for MI, or heart failure), although it has been criticized for its composite index and nonblinded nature.

Primary prevention of stroke — gynecologic factors: Endometriosis, premature ovarian failure (before 40 years of age), and early-onset menopause (before 45 years of age) are all associated with an increased risk for stroke, and screening for all 3 of these conditions is a reasonable step in the evaluation and management of vascular risk factors to reduce stroke risk.

### Estrogen and cardiovascular disease [^1144igNQ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

A large body of scientific research accumulated over the past twenty years documents the cardiovascular (CV) benefits of estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in reproductive aged women. In contrast, accelerated development of CV disease (CVD) occurs in the absence of ovarian produced E2 and P4. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) with E2 and P4 has been shown to cause no harm to younger menopausal women. This robust scientific data supports a reconsideration of the prescriptive use of E2 and P4 as preventative therapeutics for the reduction of CVD, even without additional large-scale studies of the magnitude of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI). With the current expanded understanding of the critical modulatory role played by E2 on a multitude of systems and enzymes impacting CVD onset, initiation of HRT shortly after cessation of ovarian function, known as the "Timing Hypothesis", should be considered to delay CVD in recently postmenopausal women.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112DM7K1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — evidence on age and timing and use of risk tools: Results showing fewer excess CHD and stroke events when MHT was initiated in younger rather than older study participants in the WHI provide the foundation for the widely accepted consensus that MHT should be initiated primarily in younger women (age < 60 y) close in time (< 10 y) to menopause onset. We feel that methods to integrate these factors to categorize individual risk as minimal, moderate, and high are useful and can be accomplished qualitatively by clinical judgment or quantitatively by risk assessment tools, and country- and population-specific CVD risk calculators are available to quantify individual risk per local guidelines; however, specific cutoffs for the safe use of MHT have not been formally validated, and practice differs from country to country.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy: new questions and the case for new clinical trials [^111KQET5]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Observational studies suggest that postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) prevents coronary heart disease, whereas randomized clinical trials have not confirmed a cardioprotective effect. Although observational studies may have overestimated the coronary benefit conferred by postmenopausal hormone use, there are other plausible explanations for the apparent discrepancy between previous results and the less favorable findings from clinical trials such as the large Women's Health Initiative. There is now a critical mass of data to support the hypothesis that age or time since menopause may importantly influence the benefit-risk ratio associated with HT, especially with respect to cardiovascular outcomes, and that the method of administration, dose, and formulation of exogenous hormones may also be relevant. Although the weight of the evidence indicates that older women and those with subclinical or overt coronary heart disease should not take HT, estrogen remains the most effective treatment currently available for vasomotor symptoms, and its effects on the development of coronary disease in newly postmenopausal women remain unclear. Moreover, effects of HT on quality of life and cognitive function in recently postmenopausal women merit further study. These unresolved clinical issues provide the rationale for the design of the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study, a 5-year randomized trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of low-dose oral estrogen and transdermal estradiol in preventing progression of atherosclerosis in recently postmenopausal women.

### Estrogen does not benefit women who survive MI… [^115BbChP]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Combined hormone therapy recently has been shown to offer no long-term advantage in women with coronary heart disease. It is associated with an increase in adverse cardiac events during the first year of therapy. The effect of estrogen alone is less clear. In one observational study, postmenopausal women who had used estrogen had improved survival rates following coronary heart disease. Other studies have given conflicting results. The oEStrogen in the Prevention of ReInfarction Trial was designed to assess the effect of unopposed estradiol on cardiac events in postmenopausal women who survived a first myocardial infarction. All women 50 to 69 years of age who were admitted to one of 35 participating hospitals in Britain because of proven myocardial infarction were considered for the trial if they were discharged within 31 days and had none of the specified contraindications to estrogen therapy.

More than 1, 000 women were randomly assigned to receive estradiol or a placebo. Patients received study medications from their family physicians at 12, 24, 48, and 72 weeks. The primary study outcomes were cardiac death, nonfatal reinfarction, or death from any cause. Patients were monitored for two years by questionnaires completed by their family physicians at three, six, 12, 18, and 24 months. Of the 71 women who died during follow-up, 38 deaths resulted from confirmed cardiac causes, and it was likely that an additional 13 resulted from cardiac causes. During the two-year follow-up period, 32 women in the treatment group died compared with 39 in the control group, and 91 women had reinfarction. The combined measure of rein-farction or cardiac death was confirmed in 123 women — 62 in the treatment group and 61 in the control group. The groups did not differ significantly in any of the primary outcomes.

Although the risk of death from any cause was lower in the treatment group, the difference was not significant, even after adjustment for potential confounders. There was no difference in secondary measures such as stroke, embolic events, breast cancer, or fractures. The authors conclude that estradiol therapy is not associated with any advantage in rein-farction or cardiac death in the two years following first myocardial infarction in post-menopausal women and was associated with high rates of uterine bleeding.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1156ZBTF]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Menopause, vasomotor symptoms, and hormone therapy — stroke and cardiovascular disease risk are outlined as follows: Premature menopause (onset before 40 years of age) and early menopause (before 45 years of age) are described, and reproductive life span if < 30 years has been identified as a potential risk factor for stroke. More than 50% of women experience frequent vasomotor symptoms during the menopausal period, and severe and frequent symptoms are associated with an increased risk of CVD, although whether vasomotor symptoms are independently associated with the risk of stroke is uncertain. Estrogen-based therapies are the most effective treatments for moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms; however, HT, particularly oral HT, has been associated with risk of CVD in multiple RCTs and meta-analyses, and topical estrogen treatments are not associated with stroke risk. Approximately 5% of women experience a natural menopause before 45 years of age.

Menopausal hormone therapy — cardiovascular risk evaluation: For women < age 60 or < 10 years past menopause considering MHT for menopausal symptom relief, we suggest evaluating the baseline risk of cardiovascular disease and taking this risk into consideration when advising for or against MHT and when selecting type, dose, and route of administration.

### Current recommendations: what is the clinician to do? [^111Jkgg2]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) has complex biologic effects but continues to have an important clinical role in the management of vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms. The rational use of menopausal HT requires balancing the potential benefits and risks of treatment. Findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other randomized clinical trials have helped to clarify the benefits and risks of HT and have provided insights to improve decision making. Several clinical characteristics have utility in identifying women for whom benefits of HT are likely to outweigh the risks. Age and time since menopause are strong predictors of health outcomes and absolute risks associated with HT, and differences by age have been particularly apparent for estrogen alone. In the WHI trial of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) alone, younger women (50–59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index, but not for stroke and venous thrombosis. Age trends were less clear for CEE + medroxyprogesterone acetate, owing to increased risks of breast cancer, stroke, and venous thrombosis in all age groups. Absolute risks of adverse events were lower in younger than in older women in both trials, however. Other predictors of lower vascular risk from HT include favorable lipid status and absence of the metabolic syndrome. Transdermal administration may be associated with lower risks of venous thrombosis and stroke, but additional research is needed. The use of risk stratification and personalized risk assessment offers promise for improved benefit-risk profile and safety of HT. One approach to decision making is presented. Key elements include: assessment of whether the patient has moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, the primary indication for initiating systemic HT (vaginal estrogen may be used to treat genitourinary symptoms in the absence of vasomotor symptoms); understanding the patient's own preference regarding therapy; evaluating the patient for the presence of any contraindications to HT, as well as the time since menopause onset and baseline risks of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer; reviewing carefully the benefits and risks of treatment with the patient, giving more emphasis to absolute than to relative measures of effect; and, if HT is initiated, regularly reviewing the patient's need for continued treatment.

### Estrogen improves survival in older women with CHF… [^115nvim8]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Congestive heart failure is one of the leading causes of death in the elderly. Recent reports have indicated that estrogen may have a positive impact on the myocardium. Because prior studies have limited the number of women enrolled, there is insufficient information regarding the outcome in elderly women with CHF and the effect of menopause-related estrogen loss on these patients. Reis and colleagues studied the impact of postmenopausal estrogen use on the mortality of aging women with CHF. Of the women with symptomatic CHF who were older than 50 years, 1, 134 were enrolled in the study. Those included in the study had symptoms consistent with CHF and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 30 percent or less. Estrogen users were using oral or transdermal estrogen alone or in combination with progesterone. The outcome measured was the relative risk of mortality, both cardiac and all-cause, in estrogen users and nonestrogen users.

The all-cause mortality rate in nonusers was 27 percent versus 15 percent in the estrogen-user group, a statistically significant difference. In addition, similar rates were found for cardiac mortality, and these, too, were statistically significant. Regression analysis of the data revealed that estrogen use was independently associated with improved survival rates. The authors conclude that estrogen use among older women with CHF is associated with decreased overall and cardiac mortality rates. They also noted that this was a retrospective study that generates a new hypothesis and that it needs to be tested by a large-scale, prospective randomized clinical trial. editor's note: Again, physicians are provided with a new study suggesting that estrogen replacement therapy does have a positive impact on cardiac disease in women. However, the authors point out that this study was a retrospective analysis, and further studies need to be performed.

Currently, the information regarding the effect of estrogen on cardiac disease appears to be mixed, with positive results in some studies and negative results in others. When discussing the risks and benefits of estrogen replacement therapy with patients, physicians need to provide balanced information concerning the impact of this hormone on the cardiac system. — k. e. m.

### Use of menopausal hormone therapy beyond age 65 years and its effects on women's health outcomes by types, routes, and doses [^113HkYC1]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

For decades, menopausal HT after age 65 years was considered to be unnecessary because symptoms due to estrogen withdrawal rarely persisted beyond age 65. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that some vasomotor symptoms do persist in many elderly women, and thus HT can benefit them. Recognizing this reality, in 2022, The Menopause Society changed their position about use of HT in women aged 65 years and older, suggesting that the decision to start or continue HT beyond age 65 years should be individualized (ie, based on the individual's specific needs, overall health, and medical history) and highlighted the use of lower doses and nonoral preparation to minimize risks of adverse effects. In this study, we explored the initiation/continuation of menopausal HT beyond age 65 years and effects of 40 different HT preparations on 13 health outcomes. We found important variations across different types, routes, and strengths of HT.

Compared with never use or discontinuation of HT after 65 years, ET use beyond age 65, overall, was associated with significant reductions in mortality risk. It was also associated with reduced risks of three cancers (breast, lung, and colorectal), four CV conditions (congestive heart failure [CHF], VTE, AF, and AMI), and dementia. Generally, risk reduction was greater for E2 (vs CEE), vaginal and transdermal (vs oral), and low or medium (vs high dose). For EPT use, E+ progestin marginally exhibited risk reductions in endometrial and ovarian cancers, IHD, CHF, and VTE, whereas E+ progesterone exhibited risk reduction only in CHF.

Coronary heart disease risk with estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT) — women near menopause: An intervention RCT in recently (< 3 y) postmenopausal women ages 42 to 58 found no difference in atherosclerosis progression after 4 years, and the guideline states, "In summary, EPT does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of CHD among women close to the onset of menopause, and if any risk elevation is present in women younger than 60 years, its magnitude is small", while noting that a definitive conclusion requires an appropriately powered RCT.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114WrBok]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular disease — key points: For healthy symptomatic women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, the favorable effects of hormone therapy on coronary heart disease (CHD) and all-cause mortality should be considered against potential rare increases in risks of breast cancer, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and stroke (Level I), and hormone therapy is not government approved for primary or secondary cardioprotection (Level I). Personal and familial risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, VTE, and breast cancer should be considered when initiating hormone therapy (Level III). The effects of hormone therapy on CHD may vary depending on when hormone therapy is initiated in relation to a woman's age or time since menopause onset (Level I). Women who initiate hormone therapy aged older than 60 years or more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset are at higher absolute risks of CHD, VTE, and stroke than women initiating hormone therapy in early menopause (Level I).

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy and risk of stroke: the heart and estrogen-progestin replacement study (HERS) [^1165tZhu]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Observational studies have shown that postmenopausal hormone therapy may increase, decrease, or have no effect on the risk of stroke. To date, no clinical trial has examined this question. To investigate the relation between estrogen plus progestin therapy and risk of stroke among postmenopausal women, we analyzed data collected from the Heart & Estrogen-progestin Replacement Study (HERS), a secondary coronary heart disease prevention trial.

Methods and Results

Postmenopausal women (n = 2763) were randomly assigned to take conjugated estrogen plus progestin or placebo. Primary outcomes for these analyses were stroke incidence and stroke death during a mean follow-up of 4.1 years. The number of women with strokes was compared with the number of women without strokes. A total of 149 women (5%) had 1 or more strokes, 85% of which were ischemic, resulting in 26 deaths. Hormone therapy was not significantly associated with risk of nonfatal stroke (relative hazard [RH] 1.18; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.66), fatal stroke (RH 1.61; 95% CI 0.73 to 3.55), or transient ischemic attack (RH 0.90; 95% CI 0.57 to 1.42). Independent predictors of stroke events included increasing age, hypertension, diabetes, current cigarette smoking, and atrial fibrillation. Black women were at increased risk compared with white women, and unexpectedly, body mass index was inversely associated with stroke risk.

Conclusions

Hormone therapy with conjugated equine estrogen and progestin had no significant effect on the risk for stroke among postmenopausal women with coronary disease.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113P1zKz]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Postmenopausal hormone therapy and cardiovascular risk — statin therapy: In postmenopausal women on hormone therapy and with other risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), we recommend statin therapy to reduce CV risk. Hormone therapy is described as estrogen ± progesterone/progestin, and menopause may be associated with an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Hormone therapy regimens such as oral conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg plus medroxyprogesterone acetate 2.5 mg, or oral conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg alone, increased CVD, especially when given to older women (> 10 years after age of menopause); in WHI, increased coronary heart disease risk was found with CEE + MPA at one year (HR 1.80; 95% CI, 1.08–2.99), and stroke, deep vein thrombosis, and total cardiovascular events were significantly increased with lower risk in younger women. Technical remarks note that hormone therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, specifically venous thromboembolism and stroke, although absolute risk is lower in younger compared to older postmenopausal women; risk factors may be traditional risk factors or risk-enhancing factors. A Cochrane review concluded no CVD benefit and potential harm of hormone therapy and stated that they do not recommend the use of hormone therapy to treat dyslipidemia.

### Cardiovascular disease outcomes during 6.8 years of hormone therapy: heart and estrogen / progestin replacement study follow-up (HERS II) [^112fWf2k]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

The Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS) found no overall reduction in risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events among postmenopausal women with CHD. However, in the hormone group, findings did suggest a higher risk of CHD events during the first year, and a decreased risk during years 3 to 5.

Objective

To determine if the risk reduction observed in the later years of HERS persisted and resulted in an overall reduced risk of CHD events with additional years of follow-up.

Design and Setting

Randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled trial of 4.1 years' duration (HERS) and subsequent unblinded follow-up for 2.7 years (HERS II) conducted at outpatient and community settings at 20 US clinical centers.

Participants

A total of 2763 postmenopausal women with CHD and average age of 67 years at enrollment in HERS; 2321 women (93% of those surviving) consented to follow-up in HERS II.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to receive 0.625 mg/d of conjugated estrogens and 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate (n = 1380), or placebo (n = 1383) during HERS; open-label hormone therapy was prescribed at personal physicians' discretion during HERS II. The proportions with at least 80% adherence to hormones declined from 81% (year 1) to 45% (year 6) in the hormone group, and increased from 0% (year 1) to 8% (year 6) in the placebo group.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death. Secondary cardiovascular events were coronary revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina or congestive heart failure, nonfatal ventricular arrhythmia, sudden death, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and peripheral arterial disease.

Results

There were no significant decreases in rates of primary CHD events or secondary cardiovascular events among women assigned to the hormone group compared with the placebo group in HERS, HERS II, or overall. The unadjusted relative hazard (RH) for CHD events in HERS was 0.99 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81–1.22); HERS II, 1.00 (95% CI, 0.77–1.29); and overall, 0.99 (0.84–1.17). The overall RHs were similar after adjustment for potential confounders and differential use of statins between treatment groups (RH, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.82–1.14), and in analyses restricted to women who were adherent to randomized treatment assignment (RH, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.77–1.19).

Conclusions

Lower rates of CHD events among women in the hormone group in the final years of HERS did not persist during additional years of follow-up. After 6.8 years, hormone therapy did not reduce risk of cardiovascular events in women with CHD. Postmenopausal hormone therapy should not be used to reduce risk for CHD events in women with CHD.

Figure 6 — Considerations for menopausal hormone treatment (MHT) to minimize stroke risk present an algorithm: Women with moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, or both) should first be assessed for contraindications to menopausal hormone therapy use (history of breast cancer, liver disease, history of myocardial infarction, known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia, history of deep vein thrombosis, thrombophilic disorders). If contraindications are present, consider alternative nonhormonal therapy. If no contraindications are present, the ideal candidate for starting MHT is defined by all of the following: 1) < 60 y of age; 2) Within 10 years since menopause onset; 3) No elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, stroke, or breast cancer. For oral formulations, if previous hysterectomy use estrogen only; if uterus intact use estrogen plus progesterone or bazedoxifene, and during MHT use monitor for abnormal vaginal bleeding and endometrial hyperplasia.

### Contemporary menopausal hormone therapy and risk of cardiovascular disease: Swedish nationwide register based emulated target trial [^116nJoQ2]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, contributing to approximately 30% of all deaths. Women tend to develop cardiovascular disease several years later than men do, with a notable increase during midlife, a period coincident with the menopausal transition. This transition is characterised by a decline in oestrogen and an increase in follicle stimulating hormone concentrations. These hormonal changes can induce effects on the neuroendocrine system, resulting in hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disorders, anxiety, and memory loss. As the world population ages, a significant demographic shift places a larger fraction of women in the postmenopausal phase. Managing this phase, marked by decreased oestrogen concentrations and various menopausal symptoms, largely relies on systemic menopausal hormone therapy. Systemic menopausal hormone therapy is based on administration of oestrogen with or without the addition of progestogens, effectively mitigates vasomotor symptoms, and reduces the incidence of vertebral and hip fractures. However, although menopausal hormone therapy alleviates menopausal symptoms, studies have suggested an association between its use and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Experimental studies have shown that oestrogen plays a protective role in cardiovascular health by promoting angiogenesis and vasodilation, reducing cardiac fibrosis and oxidative stress and increasing high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. More than two decades ago, observational studies conducted through the Nurses' Health Study in the US and the General Practice Research Database in the UK supported a potential cardiovascular benefit for postmenopausal women using hormone therapy. However, subsequent randomised trials, including the Heart and Oestrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) and the Women's Health Initiative trial, showed the opposite.HERS showed no reduction in coronary heart disease rates and an increase in coronary events and myocardial infarctions in the treatment group. Similarly, the Women's Health Initiative found increased risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, and pulmonary embolism, leading to the conclusion that the risks of hormone therapy outweighed the benefits, especially because of the increased risk of stroke. These trials challenged the initial positive outlook inspired by observational studies and altered our comprehension of the complexities and associated risks of menopausal hormone therapy, prompting a critical reassessment of its usage.

Sex-specific risk assessment for the primary prevention of stroke

In 2019, more than one-half (57%) of all stroke deaths were among women, as women have a slightly higher lifetime risk of stroke compared to men (20%-27% vs 14%-17%). The 2024 Primary Prevention of Stroke Guideline dedicated a new section for sex-specific risk assessment and management. The guideline emphasized the prognostic and therapeutic implications of pregnancy-associated stroke, screening for endometriosis, premature ovarian failure, and early onset menopause, as well as care of individuals on sex hormone supplementation.

For the prevention of pregnancy-related stroke, the 2024 Guideline provided recommendations for the management of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Among women with severe hypertension in pregnancy or postpartum, defined by a systolic BP ≥ 160 or diastolic BP ≥ 110 mm Hg on 2 separate measurements, a Class 1 recommendation was provided for immediate antihypertensive treatment for the prevention of maternal intracerebral hemorrhage. A Class 2a recommendation was provided to target a goal BP of < 140/90 mm Hg for all women, with either chronic hypertension before or during pregnancy or who develop hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, specifically to reduce the risk of pregnancy-associated stroke.

The guidelines strongly recommend providers routinely screen for premature ovarian failure (before 40 years of age) and early-onset menopause (before 45 years of age) (Class 1) during clinical visits for the prevention of stroke. To mitigate CVD risk, the most optimal candidates for hormone therapy for the moderation of vasomotor symptoms in premature ovarian failure or early-onset menopause include those < 60 years old who have experienced menopause within the last 10 years and do not have elevated risk for CVD, stroke, or breast cancer. Estrogen therapy among transgender women is also associated with a significantly higher risk of stroke, and a 2a recommendation is provided for risk factor evaluation and modification in this patient population.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^117F5iL1]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Currently, MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD and is not recommended for women with a high CVD risk. In women who may benefit from the vasomotor, genitourinary, and bone health properties of MHT, CV risk should be assessed and optimized prior to initiation. A 2020 New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) hormone therapy clinical practice review outlines reasonable guidelines for hormone administration based on current data. Patients with vasomotor symptoms who are < 60 years old and/or within 10 years of menopause onset and are healthy without contraindications [i.e. prior stroke, MI, or pulmonary embolism (PE), high risk for breast cancer or venous thromboembolism (VTE)] are reasonable candidates for hormone therapy. Risk factors such as obesity, DM, and migraines, among others, should prompt providers to trial transdermal MHT. In patients who are ⩾60 years or > 10 years from menopause, the risks of MHT mentioned above outweigh the benefits, and emphasis should be placed on lifestyle changes, though the North American Menopause Society (NAMS) suggests a collaborative decision be made on an individual basis between patient and provider. Other pharmacologic options can be trialed, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), gabapentin, and clonidine. Of the above, only low dose paroxetine (7.5 mg) is FDA-approved. In patients with primarily genitourinary symptoms, lubricants or moisturizers are recommended first. If these fail to improve symptoms, vaginal hormonal therapies can be utilized. Figure 1 addresses CVD risks in women and stratifies those risks with acceptable thresholds for MHT use.

### Raloxifene and cardiovascular events in osteoporotic postmenopausal women: four-year results from the MORE (multiple outcomes of raloxifene evaluation) randomized trial [^116ySQ5t]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, improves cardiovascular risk factors, but its effect on cardiovascular events is unknown.

Objective

To determine the effect of raloxifene on cardiovascular events in osteoporotic postmenopausal women.

Design

Secondary analysis of data from the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation trial, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between November 1994 and September 1999.

Setting

Outpatient and community settings at 180 sites in 25 countries.

Participants

A total of 7705 osteoporotic postmenopausal women (mean age, 67 years).

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to receive raloxifene, 60 mg/d (n = 2557), or 120 mg/d (n = 2572), or placebo (n = 2576) for 4 years.

Main Outcome Measures

Cardiovascular events, including coronary events (myocardial infarction, unstable angina, or coronary ischemia) and cerebrovascular events (stroke or transient ischemic attack), collected as safety end points and subsequently adjudicated by a cardiologist blinded to therapy. Cardiovascular risk at study entry was determined by the presence of multiple cardiovascular risk factors or prior coronary events or revascularization procedure.

Results

In the overall cohort, there were no significant differences between treatment groups in the number of combined coronary and cerebrovascular events: 96 (3.7%) with placebo, 82 (3.2%) with 60 mg/d of raloxifene, and 94 (3.7%) with 120 mg/d of raloxifene. Relative risks (RRs) were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–1.15) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.74–1.30) for 60 mg/d and 120 mg/d of raloxifene, respectively. Similar results were obtained when coronary and cerebrovascular events were analyzed separately. Among the subset of 1035 women with increased cardiovascular risk at baseline, those assigned to raloxifene had a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular events compared with placebo (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.38–0.95 for both raloxifene groups). The number of cardiovascular events during the first year was not significantly different across groups in the overall cohort (P = 0.94), or among women at increased cardiovascular risk (P = 0.86) or with evidence of established coronary heart disease (P = 0.60).

Conclusions

Raloxifene therapy for 4 years did not significantly affect the risk of cardiovascular events in the overall cohort but did significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in the subset of women with increased cardiovascular risk. There was no evidence that raloxifene caused an early increase in risk of cardiovascular events. Before raloxifene is used for prevention of cardiovascular events, these findings require confirmation in trials with evaluation of cardiovascular outcomes as the primary objective.

Menopause transition

An important highlight of the 2023 Guideline is the recognition of menopause transition and its impact on the cardiometabolic health of the individual. Previous observational studies indicated a possible cardiovascular benefit of postmenopausal hormone therapy, yielding the 2012 Guideline recommendation which approved estrogen therapy based on shared decision-making, even in patients with CCD. Recent trials have shown that hormone therapy has no benefit on major adverse cardiovascular events with a significantly increased risk of venous thromboembolism, resulting in a guideline recommendation that women with CCD should not receive hormone therapy. There remains significant discussion on the risk profile of systemic estrogen therapy, with some researchers indicating that estrogen therapy is low risk, if provided within 10 years of menopause. This new guidance lends a framework for clinicians for the management of vasomotor symptoms in the menopause transition.

### Hormone replacement therapy and the cardiovascular system lessons learned and unanswered questions [^115CNzUC]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among women in the U.S., exceeding breast cancer mortality in women of all ages. Women present with cardiovascular disease a decade after men, and this has been attributed to the protective effect of female ovarian sex hormones that is lost after menopause. Animal and observational studies have shown beneficial effects of hormone therapy when it is initiated early in the perimenopausal period or before the development of significant atherosclerosis. However, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in older women have not shown any benefit in either primary prevention or secondary prevention of cardiovascular events, with a concerning trend toward harm. This review outlines the lessons learned from the basic science, animal, observational, and randomized trials, and then summarizes yet-unanswered questions of hormone therapy and cardiovascular risk.

Menopause hormone therapy

Based on the above, it is probable that decline in endogenous sex hormone levels play a part in the increased CV risk women face with age. However, only a few longitudinal studies have gone so far as to study associations between circulating sex hormone, sex hormone-binding globulin levels, and CVD, with varying results. Moreover, as both menopause and biological aging are interrelated in time, the extent to which one contributes to age-related CV risk over the other is difficult to delineate. However, the question of a possible CV benefit from MHT has been promoted for decades, as noted in several observational studies such as the Nurse's Health Study, which found postmenopausal hormone use to decrease risk for major coronary events in women without previous CVD. Since the 1990s, several placebo-controlled trials studying various MHT have taken place, looking at both primary and secondary prevention outcomes.

The 1998 Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) was the first published secondary prevention trial to evaluate hormone therapy in women with known coronary disease. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a combination of conjugated estrogens (CE) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). The primary outcome was nonfatal MI and IHD death with no significant decreases in rates of these events in women assigned to the hormone group compared with those assigned to the placebo group after 4.1 years of follow up. Post hoc analyses showed a statistically significant time trend in which more IHD events actually occurred during the first year of treatment, with fewer in years 3–5. With this knowledge, investigators hypothesized that this early risk may be due to a prothrombotic effect of treatment that may be outweighed by beneficial effects with time. Surveillance was continued for 6.8 years via the HERS II trial, at which time hormone therapy failed to reduce risk of CV events in women with IHD. Treatment for 6.8 years also increased rates of venous thromboembolism and biliary surgery.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115Yruv2]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Combined hormonal contraception (CHC) — age and risk factor interactions are described, with marked age-related increases and synergistic effects. With CHC, stroke risk increased with age, growing from 3.4 to 64.4 events per 100 000 person-years for individuals 15 to 49 years of age, and risk is higher especially when 35 years of age is used as a cutoff. CHC synergistically increases the risk of hypertension up to 4-fold, smoking up to 3-fold, and migraine with aura up to 6-fold, and higher estrogen doses significantly increased the risk of stroke in those who smoke. Progestin-only contraception in all routes is not associated with an overall increased stroke risk, but in the setting of hypertension progestin-only contraception can increase stroke risk. In RATIO data, higher risk of stroke in women with cardiovascular risk factors than women without was seen in combinations containing 30 μg of estrogen plus second or third-generation progestins, whereas the different generations of progestin stroke risk did not differ in women without stroke risk factors.

In the WHI Memory Study, estrogen plus progestin increased probable dementia vs placebo (1.8% vs 0.9%; HR, 2.05 [95% CI, 1.21–3.48]), while no significant increase was found for estrogen alone. The WHI reported increased gallbladder disease with estrogen plus progestin (1.13% annualized vs 0.84% annualized; HR, 1.57 [95% CI, 1.36–1.80]) and with estrogen alone (1.64% annualized vs 1.06% annualized; HR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.34–1.79]). For urinary incontinence, the WHI showed higher incident rates with estrogen plus progestin (16.6% (annualized) vs 11.1% (annualized); HR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.36–1.63]) and with estrogen alone (22.6% annualized vs 14.0% annualized; HR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.46–1.79]), with elevated risk persisting 6 years after stopping (28.6% vs 23.1%; HR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.13–1.37]). Pooled analyses showed no significant difference in all-cause mortality for estrogen plus progestin (RR, 1.01 [95% CI, 0.88–1.16] during 3.2 to 5.6 years of follow-up) or for estrogen alone (RR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.89–1.21] during a mean follow-up of 7.1 years).

### Association between hormone replacement therapy and subsequent arterial and venous vascular events: a meta-analysis [^112XaE2b]. European Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which involves giving sex steroid hormones in the form of an oestrogen, with or without progesterone, is regularly used in the treatment of menopausal symptoms. It is also used in women with premature ovarian failure, and has also been advocated for the prevention of osteoporosis since it reduces fracture risk. In observational studies, HRT was reported to reduce the risk of arterial vascular events, and this led to trials investigating whether HRT could prevent stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD) events.

Unfortunately, adverse effects of HRT have been proposed, including a possible increased risk of breast cancer, whilst there is debate over whether the benefits of protecting bone density may be lost once treatment is discontinued. Furthermore, HRT has been shown, in meta-analyses, to increase the risk of strokeand venous thromboembolic disease [including both pulmonary embolism (PE) and deep vein thrombosis (DVT)]. However, the effects of HRT on CHD remains unclearalthough the possibility of benefit in younger women (age < 60 years) has been suggested.

Both oestrogen and progesterone have shown cytoprotective properties in laboratory studies – suggesting that they might alter the severity as well as frequency of vascular events. Conversion of binary vascular events (e.g. stroke/no stroke) into an ordinal scale (e.g. fatal stroke/non-fatal stroke/no stroke) allows the effect of interventions on severity to be assessed. This is of practical clinical value as severity is clearly relevant; it is preferable to have a non-fatal event than a fatal one, and severity impacts on quality of life, especially with respect to stroke.

In parallel, there are no randomized data comparing the relative effects of the addition of progesterone with oestrogen (dual-HRT) vs. oestrogen monotherapy. This reflects that trials have chosen to use dual or monotherapy depending on the presence or absence of the uterus. However, it is possible to assess the additive effects of progesterone on thrombotic event rates using indirect comparison of existing trial data.

We have reviewed systematically all trials of HRT assessing effects on arterial and venous vascular events including cerebrovascular events, CHD events, and venous thromboembolism (VTE); analyses assessed both the frequency and severity of events, and examined the effect of progesterone on the risk of thrombotic events.

### Health risks and benefits 3 years after stopping randomized treatment with estrogen and progestin [^112ifnxP]. JAMA (2008). Excellent credibility.

Context

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) trial of estrogen plus progestin vs placebo was stopped early, after a mean 5.6 years of follow-up, because the overall health risks of hormone therapy exceeded its benefits.

Objective

To report health outcomes at 3 years (mean 2.4 years of follow-up) after the intervention was stopped.

Design, Setting, and Participants

The intervention phase was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) 0.625 mg daily plus medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) 2.5 mg daily, in 16,608 women aged 50 through 79 years, recruited by 40 centers from 1993 to 1998. The postintervention phase commenced July 8, 2002, and included 15 730 women.

Main Outcome Measures

Semi-annual monitoring and outcomes ascertainment continued per trial protocol. The primary end points were coronary heart disease and invasive breast cancer. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the 2 primary end points plus stroke, pulmonary embolism, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.

Results

The risk of cardiovascular events after the intervention was comparable by initial randomized assignments, 1.97% (annualized rate) in the CEE plus MPA (343 events) and 1.91% in the placebo group (323 events). A greater risk of malignancies occurred in the CEE plus MPA than in the placebo group (1.56% [n = 281] vs 1.26% [n = 218]; hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04–1.48). More breast cancers were diagnosed in women who had been randomly assigned to receive CEE plus MPA vs placebo (0.42% [n = 79] vs 0.33% [n = 60]; HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.91–1.78) with a modest trend toward a lower HR during the follow-up after the intervention. All-cause mortality was somewhat higher in the CEE plus MPA than in the placebo group (1.20% [n = 233] vs 1.06% [n = 196]; HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.95–1.39). The global index of risks and benefits was unchanged from randomization through March 31, 2005 (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.03–1.21), indicating that the risks of CEE plus MPA exceed the benefits for chronic disease prevention.

Conclusions

The increased cardiovascular risks in the women assigned to CEE plus MPA during the intervention period were not observed after the intervention. A greater risk of fatal and nonfatal malignancies occurred after the intervention in the CEE plus MPA group and the global risk index was 12% higher in women randomly assigned to receive CEE plus MPA compared with placebo.

### Sex does matter: risk of stroke in LVAD recipients [^111GGnh4]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Advanced heart failure therapies including both heart transplant and left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are underutilized in women. Proposed reasons for this include delayed recognition of advanced heart failure symptoms, comorbidities affecting eligibility, and concerns around the willingness of women to undergo advanced therapies. As technological improvements continue to decrease the burden of hemocompatibility-related adverse events (AEs), it is paramount to identify the reasons behind the underutilization of this therapy in women and tailor therapy based on sex-related differences.

Earlier generations of LVADs have had variable results related to sex-based differences in AEs. Even with the current generation of devices, LVAD-related AEs remain a significant burden for patients contributing to morbidity and mortality in > 50% of patients. Older studies suggested that women are at a higher risk of major bleeding, right ventricular failure, stroke, and post-LVAD mortality, particularly earlier post-implant. However, more contemporary data from the MOMENTUM 3 trial showed no differences in survival between men and women at 2 years post-implant, though women make up approximately 20% of the study population.

A common and devastating LVAD-related AE, stroke, is the primary cause of death amongst LVAD recipients; it occurs in up to 13% of patients within the first year post-implant. Hemodynamic changes that predispose to the stroke risk in LVAD patients include endothelial damage and activation of the coagulation cascade due to continuous flow, as well as dysfunction in the syntheses of fibrinolytic substances contributing to hypercoagulability.

Specific to sex, stroke risk has been frequently described as being higher in females when compared to males with the leading proposed mechanisms including hormonal sex-related differences. It has been noted that when a female has traditional modifiable risk factors for stroke such as hypertension, they are more likely to have a stroke when compared to male. Specific to LVAD therapy, a prior INTERMACS analysis found female sex to be a preimplant predictor of stroke implanted with a LVAD between 2012 and 2015. Although the role of estrogen's influence on stroke risk remains unclear, estrogen can influence both coagulability and endothelium function along with nitric oxide formation.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — risk-tiered treatment selection: High risk includes known MI, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and 10-year CVD risk > 10%. For women at high risk of CVD, we suggest initiating nonhormonal therapies to alleviate bothersome VMS (with or without climacteric symptoms) over MHT. For women with moderate risk of CVD, we suggest transdermal estradiol as first-line treatment, alone for women without a uterus or combined with micronized progesterone (or another progestogen that does not adversely modify metabolic parameters) for women with a uterus because these preparations have less untoward effect on blood pressure, triglycerides, and carbohydrate metabolism.

Figure 3.
Pooled odds ratio for ischaemic stroke in menopausal women treated with HRT versus non-prior HRT.

The first trial investigating the risk of stroke with HRT analysed data collected from the Heart & Estrogen-progestin Replacement Study (HERS) study, designed as a secondary prevention trial of coronary heart disease. One thousand three hundred eighty postmenopausal women with coronary heart disease were randomly assigned to treatment with conjugated equine oestrogen (0.625 mg/d) and 2.5 mg/d medroxyprogesterone acetate, and 1383 women were assigned to placebo. Participants were recruited between 1993 and 1994 in 20 centres in the USA. The results showed no significant difference in the number of ischaemic strokes in both groups OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.83–1.67 after a mean follow-up of 2, 4 years.

The second study is a pooled analysis of 5 phase III studies – Selective estrogens, Menopause, And Response to Therapy (SMART trials)performed to improve the understanding of vascular safety of a combined HRT and receptor modulator treatment. Four different pooled groups were analysed: 1585 women randomly assigned to 0.45 mg tissue-selective oestrogen complex pairs conjugated oestrogens (CE) plus 20 mg bazedoxifene, 1583 women allocated to 0.625 mg CE plus 20 mg bazedoxifene, 4868 women assigned to any dosage of CE and bazedoxifene and 1241 women treated with placebo. Study duration varied between the individual SMART trials, and safety data was collected for up to 2 years in the pooled analysis. Healthy participants were recruited between 2002 and 2011 in clinical centres in the USA, South America, Europe and Australasia. The results of the pooled analysis showed no significant difference in the number of ischaemic strokes in all groups both groups: 0.45 mg CE/20 mg bazedoxifene and 0.625 mg CE/20 mg bazedoxifene: relative risk (RR) 0.9, 95% CI 0.2–4.8; a group with any dosage CE and bazedoxifene: RR 0.5, 95% CI 0.1–2.6.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^113aTo92]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality — For healthy women within 10 years of the menopause transition who have bothersome symptoms, observational data suggest the benefits of hormone therapy (ET or EPT) outweigh the risks, with fewer cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in younger versus older women. Randomized controlled trials of surrogate atherosclerosis outcomes are mixed: in the Early Versus Late Intervention Trial With Estradiol, oral 17β-estradiol 1 mg/d plus progesterone vaginal gel 45 mg reduced carotid artery intima-media thickness after a median of 5 years when initiated within 6 years (median, 3.5 y) of menopause onset but not when initiated 10 or more years (median, 14.3 y) after menopause onset; in the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study, oral CEE 0.45 mg/d or transdermal estradiol patch 50 μg/wk each with sequential oral MP 200 mg for 12 d/mo showed no effect on subclinical atherosclerosis progression. Meta-analyses of clinical outcomes conflict: a 2015 Cochrane review found reduced coronary heart disease (CHD) (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29–0.96) and all-cause mortality (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52–0.95) but increased venous thromboembolism (VTE) (RR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.11–2.73) with initiation fewer than 10 years after menopause; a 2020 systematic review showed null effects on all-cause mortality, stroke, and VTE; and a 2019 meta-regression reported that participants aged < 60 y had lower odds of CHD (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37–1.00), all-cause mortality (OR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57–0.91), and cardiac mortality (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.37–1.00) but higher odds of a composite cerebrovascular outcome (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.10–1.78), with these benefits attenuated after excluding open-label trials.

### Estradiol cypionate (Depo-estradiol) [^111dGHEf]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

1. Cardiovascular disorders

Estrogen and estrogen/progestin therapy have been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (venous thromboembolism or VTE). Should any of these occur or be suspected, estrogens should be discontinued immediately.

Risk factors for arterial vascular disease (e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity) and/or venous thromboembolism (e.g., personal history or family history of VTE, obesity, and systemic lupus erythematosus) should be managed appropriately.

Hormonal contraception — recommendations: For individuals considering combined hormonal contraception (CHC), lower doses of ethinyl estradiol are recommended (Class 1, Level B-NR) to minimize potential increased stroke risk. In individuals with specific stroke risk factors (age ≥ 35 years, tobacco use, hypertension, or migraine with aura) who are considering contraception, shared decision-making is recommended (Class 1, Level C-EO) to determine the best contraceptive choice to balance the risk of stroke from contraception and the risk of stroke with pregnancy. In individuals with these stroke risk factors considering contraception, progestin-only contraception or nonhormonal contraception is reasonable (Class 2a, Level C-LD) to reduce the increased stroke risk associated with estrogen-containing contraception.

### Patient management following percutaneous coronary intervention [^114UHQAt]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Medical management Post-PCI

Medical therapy reassessment should be performed post-PCI to ensure that patients are receiving appropriate medical therapy for secondary prevention. In completely revascularized patients, antianginal medications (eg, beta-blockers, nitrates, calcium channel blockers) can often be discontinued, provided they are not needed for other indications. The 2021 ACC/AHA/SCAI Guideline for Coronary Artery Revascularization recommends against beta-blocker use for secondary prevention post-PCI in completely revascularized patients with stable ischemic heart disease and normal left ventricular function. In patients with comorbid conditions (eg, hypertension, atrial fibrillation), appropriate medications for treatment of these conditions should be continued. Given historical associations between menopausal hormone therapy and thrombosis, female, postmenopausal patients might request counseling on its safety post-PCI. With newer agents and transition toward lower doses, shorter duration, and earlier onset of therapy, contemporary evidence suggests venous thrombosis as the main cardiovascular concern related to hormone therapy. However, the ACC CVD in Women Committee recommends that systemic hormone therapy be generally avoided in women with atherosclerotic CVD and that alternative therapy be considered. Low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is considered safe for all patients, and individualized, shared decision-making can be considered for those with persistent, severe symptoms.

### Different mechanisms for benefit and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke in early postmenopausal women: a hypothetical explanation [^1179t5CC]. Menopause (2011). Low credibility.

In younger postmenopausal women, estrogen is thought to be protective against coronary heart disease. The mechanism for this effect is likely to be an inhibition of the development of atherosclerosis. However, in older postmenopausal women with established atherosclerosis, the initiation of estrogen therapy may cause coronary artery plaque instability and rupture, resulting in coronary thrombosis and myocardial infarction. Compared with these findings of coronary disease prevention in younger women, estrogen therapy has been linked to an increased risk of ischemic stroke in both younger and older postmenopausal women, although the risk is small and the event rate in younger women is considered to be rare. Here, we provide an argument that the mechanism for stroke risk in younger women is not based on atherosclerotic disease, as occurs in older women for both coronary disease and stroke, but is related to thrombosis. Susceptibility for stroke is increased in women, and various factors leading to thrombosis may explain this risk. This notion is supported by data that estrogen regimens that decrease the risk of venous thrombosis (lower oral doses and transdermal therapy) may not be associated with an increase in ischemic stroke risk.

Subgroup analyses of women 50 to 59 years of age suggest no increased risk of stroke for those women receiving CE (0.625 mg)-alone versus those receiving placebo (18 versus 21 per 10,000 women-years)3.

In the WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy, a statistically significant increased risk of stroke was reported in women 50 to 79 years of age receiving daily CE (0.625 mg) plus MPA (2.5 mg) compared to women in the same age group receiving placebo (33 versus 25 per 10,000 women-years) [see CLINICAL STUDIES].

Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

The study EMERALD was published by Francois-Clement Bidard and colleagues in 2022 in the journal J Clin Oncol. This study is related to the following diseases: Breast cancer. In the EMERALD study, the trial question was: what is the role of elacestrant in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer? In the EMERALD study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the EMERALD study, the population was: 477 patients (470 female, 7 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had 1–2 lines of endocrine therapy pretreated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor and ≤ 1 chemotherapy. The key exclusion criteria were symptomatic metastatic visceral disease; any of the following cardiovascular events within 6 months of enrolment: severe/unstable angina, myocardial infarction, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, prolonged corrected QT interval grade ≥ 2, uncontrolled AF, ongoing grade ≥ 2 cardiac dysrhythmias, ≥ class II NYHA HF, coagulopathy, or cerebrovascular accident. In the EMERALD study, the interventions were: n = 239 elacestrant (at an oral dose of 400 mg/day) n = 238 standard of care (fulvestrant, anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane monotherapy). In the EMERALD study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in progression-free survival in overall population (39.7% vs. 34.5%; HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.82). In the EMERALD study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in progression-free survival in estrogen receptor 1-mutated population (46.1% vs. 31%; HR 1.82, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.56) No significant difference in overall survival in overall population (70.7% vs. 66.8%; HR 1.33, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.85) Significant increase in overall survival in estrogen receptor 1-mutated population (75.7% vs. 64.6%; HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.78). In the EMERALD study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events. In the EMERALD study, the conclusion was: in patients with ER+/HER2- advanced breast cancer who had 1–2 lines of endocrine therapy pretreated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor and ≤ 1 chemotherapy, elacestrant was superior to standard of care with respect to a progression-free survival in overall population.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy and risk of stroke: impact of the route of estrogen administration and type of progestogen [^116pyLX9]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Cases Identification

The starting point was all women aged 51 to 62 years (n = 15 794) with a first hospitalization between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2011, for a stroke (International Classification of Diseases 10th edition codes I60 to I64). We subsequently excluded cases identified in aftercare and rehabilitation units or home hospitalization (n = 464) because these patients were more likely to have had a stroke before 2009. We also excluded cases who presented a contraindication to HT use defined as a personal history of cardiovascular disease or gynecological cancers (breast, uterine, ovary) before the stroke occurrence (n = 3301). Then, we excluded cases using antithrombotic (including platelet aggregation inhibitors) therapy during the 3 months before the event (n = 2355).

Of the 9674 remaining cases, we excluded non-IS cases who presented International Classification of Diseases 10th edition diagnoses codes I60 (n = 1936), I61 (n = 1832), I62 (n = 445), and I64 (n = 944), IS cases with the I63 code as a secondary diagnosis (n = 877), and cases with a related diagnosis corresponding to sequela of cerebral infarction I69.3 (n = 239), leading to 3401 first IS. Details of these exclusions and characteristics of patients by stroke subtypes are given in the(please see Table I in the). There were large differences in cardiovascular risk factors between ischemic and nonischemic cases, justifying not pooling stroke subtypes in the analyses.

Selection of Controls

Controls were randomly selected among healthy women who had never been hospitalized during the follow-up and who had no contraindication to HT use (same definition as for cases). Of the 5 516 547 women who were not potential stroke cases, we excluded those who had at least one hospitalization (n = 2 145 439) and those with long-term chronic disease codes for cardiovascular disease or gynecological cancers (n = 815 720). Among the 2 555 388 remaining women, ≤ 4 controls without antithrombotic therapy were selected randomly and matched to each case for 1-year age band and exact zip code (n = 13 154). If 4 controls with adequate criteria were not found, ≤ 3 were selected. There were 2995 cases matched to 4 controls, 371 to 3, 26 to 2, and 9 to 1 control.

### Hormone therapy in menopause: an update on cardiovascular disease considerations [^115Q6Qrz]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the number one cause of death and morbidity worldwide, and while overall CVD incidence rates declined in both genders between 1999 and 2007, age-specific data suggest that coronary risk factors in women are on the rise. While early observational data favored menopausal hormone therapy's (MHT's) role in primary CVD prevention, the initial interventional study data from the WHI did not. Further detailed analyses of both observational and interventional data have pointed to the possibility that MHT may play a role in primary CVD prevention if initiated within 10 years of menopause and less than 60 years of age (the timing hypothesis). Unanswered questions remain regarding the optimal route and dosage of estrogen in MHT. Data so far, favor transdermal estradiol over conventional-dose CEE with respect to CVD risk and oral estradiol over conventional-dose CEE with respect to stroke risk. Low-dose oral CEE may similarly have benefit over conventional-dose oral CEE for some CVD events. In addition, the transdermal route of delivery may avoid the excess risk of certain CVD events associated with MHT and lower doses of estrogen may have fewer adverse effects than the doses previously tested in WHI. Because questions regarding benefits versus risks remain, MHT is yet to be recommended for CVD prevention. However, it is indicated for menopausal symptom management in women within 10 years of menopause and under the age of 60 years, in whom it does not appear to carry increased cardiovascular risk. Additional research is ongoing and needed to confirm or refute the comparative safety of the various MHT options.

### Estrogen modulates serotonin effects on vasoconstriction through src inhibition [^111o4hGR]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of death in developed countries. However, there are sex-specific clinical characteristics, some of which may be dependent on levels of the sex hormone estrogen. Observational studies have demonstrated that both the incidence of CVD and the resultant morbidity and mortality are much lower in premenopausal women compared to age-matched men, and this sex advantage for women becomes far less or disappears with increased age and reduced estrogen levels after menopause –. Observational studies have also shown that postmenopausal women who receive hormone replacement therapy (HRT) have a lower rate of CVD and cardiac death than those not receiving HRT. However, two randomized prospective primary or secondary prevention trials, the Women's Health Initiative (WHI)and the Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS I and II), showed that HRT may actually increase the risk and events of CVD in postmenopausal women. The reasons for this paradoxical characterization of HRT as both beneficial and detrimental remain unclear. Many potential factors may contribute to the adverse outcomes, namely, age, preexisting CVD and/or risk, when HRT was initiated, the type of HRT given (conjugated equine estrogen with progestin), dosage, and the thromboembolic properties of estrogen and progestin. Overall, the use of HRT has become one of the most controversial topics related to women's health, making it all the more urgent to clarify whether estrogens prevent or promote CVD, as well as the mechanism(s) involved.

### Circulating estradiol and mortality in men with systolic chronic heart failure… [^116VFkVu]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Conclusion Among men with chronic HF and reduced LVEF, high and low concentrations of estradiol compared with the middle quintile of estradiol are related to an increased mortality. Estrogens have numerous biological effects in men1–3 and have a complex effect on the normal cardiovascular system. 4–6 Several studies have identified a role for estrogens in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease in men. 4–6. Estrogens have beneficial effects on the myocardium and vasculature in men, such as attenuation of cardiovascular remodelling7, 8 and reduction in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and necrosis. 9–11 These cardioprotective and vasoprotective properties of estrogens may explain the link between low estradiol concentrations and an increased risk of cardiovascular events in a general male population.

12 In elderly men, hyperestrogenemia is related to an increased risk of stroke13; whereas, in men with severe infection, an excess of circulating estrogens has been linked to an increased risk of death.
14. In the literature, there is no consensus regarding the associations between circulating estrogens and cardiovascular risk in men. 12, 13, 30 There are links between certain polymorphisms of estrogen receptors in men and the severity of coronary artery disease, 31 a risk of fatal and nonfatal. remodelling and left ventricular dilatation in male mice. 11 Estradiol interacts with proteins modulating cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and can lessen hypertrophic myocardial response to intracellular calcium derangements. 7 Estradiol exerts anti-oxidative properties9, 10 and makes male cardiomyocytes resistant to angiotensin II–induced apoptosis.

9 Moreover, estrogen signaling can activate bone marrow–derived endothelial progenitor cells, stimulate their mobilization and incorporation into neovascularization areas of ischemic myocardium; however, these effects have been demonstrated so far only in female mice. 39, 40. Adamopoulos et al41 demonstrated that estrogens improved cardiac systolic performance and decreased pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance in patients with advanced chronic HF. In 2 other studies, low doses of estrogens have been shown to improve endothelial dysfunction in men with hypogonads42 and increase myocardial perfusion in healthy men. 43 Based on the presented data.

Traditional CV risk factors not equal in men and women

Well-established risk factors for CVD include diabetes mellitus (DM), tobacco use, hypertension (HTN), obesity, and lack of physical activity. These risk factors affect men and women differently and portend a higher risk of CVD in women. See Table 1 for a summary.

Table 1.
Traditional CV risk factors and their disproportionate effects on CVD in women compared with men.

Women are disproportionately affected by DM: mortality for diabetic women is an estimated 2.1 million versus 1.8 million in diabetic men, and a majority of these deaths are CV in nature. In women with DM, there is a 1.81-fold increased risk of death from IHD compared with women without DM, and in men there is a 1.48-fold increased risk when compared with non-diabetic men. Additionally, risk of heart failure is 5-fold higher in diabetic women as compared with non-diabetic women, which is higher than the 2-fold increase in heart failure seen in diabetic men as compared with non-diabetic men. The risk differences in DM on CVD by gender appear multifactorial. Women have higher rates of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), hypercoagulability, and increased expression of concurrent metabolic syndromes. – Further compounding these disparities, diabetic women are also less frequently prescribed evidence-based therapies by their healthcare providers.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^115G8fey]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

NAMS position statement — conclusions on effectiveness and benefit-risk stratification state that hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for VMS and GSM and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture, and that risks differ by type, dose, route, timing, and progestogen need; treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation. Absolute attributable risks for hormone therapy in the 50- to 59-year-old age group or within 10 years of menopause onset are low, whereas risks appear greater when initiated at 60 years and older or further than 10 years from menopause onset, particularly for those aged 70 years and older or more than 20 years from menopause onset. For women aged younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset and without contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio appears favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for the prevention of bone loss and reduction of fracture, and based on the WHI RCTs, longer duration may be more favorable for ET than for EPT. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or when aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable than for younger women because of greater absolute risks of CHD, stroke, VTE, and dementia.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^117TijsH]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

HTN is another well-established risk factor for CVD and the leading cause of CV mortality worldwide. Women with HTN have a higher population-adjusted CV mortality when compared with men and are less likely to be treated to guideline-directed blood pressure goals. Postmenopausal women are particularly susceptible to this – as estrogen levels decline, so do its protective vasodilatory effects and resulting benefits on blood pressure.

Obesity, another traditional CV risk factor, is more prevalent in women than in men. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2013, among the 37.7% of adults aged 20 years or older who were classified as obese, 35% were men and 40.4% were women. Obesity has independently shown to be associated with increased risk of CVD in women. The Framingham Heart Study, for example, found obesity to increase relative risk of CAD by 64% in women compared with 46% in men. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest inactivity levels are higher among women than in men, especially with older age. Given observational data that higher levels of activity may be associated with lower rates of chronic diseases such as CVD, this may also be adding to the increased CV risk that women face.

### Hormone therapy for preventing cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women [^116rZnfb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence from systematic reviews of observational studies suggests that hormone therapy may have beneficial effects in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular disease events in post-menopausal women, however the results of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have had mixed results. This is an updated version of a Cochrane review published in 2013.

Objectives

To assess the effects of hormone therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women, and whether there are differential effects between use in primary or secondary prevention. Secondary aims were to undertake exploratory analyses to (i) assess the impact of time since menopause that treatment was commenced (≥ 10 years versus < 10 years), and where these data were not available, use age of trial participants at baseline as a proxy (≥ 60 years of age versus < 60 years of age); and (ii) assess the effects of length of time on treatment.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases on 25 February 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and LILACS. We also searched research and trials registers, and conducted reference checking of relevant studies and related systematic reviews to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

RCTs of women comparing orally administered hormone therapy with placebo or a no treatment control, with a minimum of six months follow-up.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome. We combined results using random effects meta-analyses, and undertook further analyses to assess the effects of treatment as primary or secondary prevention, and whether treatment was commenced more than or less than 10 years after menopause.

Main Results

We identified six new trials through this update. Therefore the review includes 19 trials with a total of 40,410 post-menopausal women. On the whole, study quality was good and generally at low risk of bias; the findings are dominated by the three largest trials. We found high quality evidence that hormone therapy in both primary and secondary prevention conferred no protective effects for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, angina, or revascularisation. However, there was an increased risk of stroke in those in the hormone therapy arm for combined primary and secondary prevention (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.41). Venous thromboembolic events were increased (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.69), as were pulmonary emboli (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.48) on hormone therapy relative to placebo. The absolute risk increase for stroke was 6 per 1000 women (number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) = 165; mean length of follow-up: 4.21 years (range: 2.0 to 7.1)); for venous thromboembolism 8 per 1000 women (NNTH = 118; mean length of follow-up: 5.95 years (range: 1.0 to 7.1)); and for pulmonary embolism 4 per 1000 (NNTH = 242; mean length of follow-up: 3.13 years (range: 1.0 to 7.1)). We performed subgroup analyses according to when treatment was started in relation to the menopause. Those who started hormone therapy less than 10 years after the menopause had lower mortality (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.95, moderate quality evidence) and coronary heart disease (composite of death from cardiovascular causes and non-fatal myocardial infarction) (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.96; moderate quality evidence), though they were still at increased risk of venous thromboembolism (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73, high quality evidence) compared to placebo or no treatment. There was no strong evidence of effect on risk of stroke in this group. In those who started treatment more than 10 years after the menopause there was high quality evidence that it had little effect on death or coronary heart disease between groups but there was an increased risk of stroke (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.38, high quality evidence) and venous thromboembolism (RR 1.96, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.80, high quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Our review findings provide strong evidence that treatment with hormone therapy in post-menopausal women overall, for either primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease events has little if any benefit and causes an increase in the risk of stroke and venous thromboembolic events.

### Should progestins be blamed for the failure of hormone replacement therapy to reduce cardiovascular events in randomized controlled trials? [^115qiKEu]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2004). Low credibility.

Many observational studies and experimental and animal studies have demonstrated that estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (estrogen plus progestin) significantly reduces the risk of coronary heart disease. Nonetheless, recent randomized controlled trials demonstrated some trends toward an increased risk of cardiovascular events rather than a reduction of risk. Recently, both the HRT and ERT arms of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study were terminated early because of an increased/no incidence of invasive breast cancer, increased incidence of stroke, and increased trend/no protective effects of cardiovascular disease. We discuss the controversial effects of HRT and ERT on cardiovascular system and provide a hypothesis that the failure of HRT and ERT in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in postmenopausal women might be because of the stage of their atherosclerosis at the time of initiation of HRT or ERT.

Introduction

Despite recent improvements in sex and gender research in cardiovascular disease (CVD), disparities still exist. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) in particular remains a leading cause of death in women. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include biological, social, environmental, and economic factors. While men and women share many traditional risk factors for CVD, these alone do not explain the sex-specific increased risk of CVD in women. Additional female-specific risk factors, most notably menopause, contribute significantly. Menopause has been associated with an increased CVD risk in women aged ⩾55 years. The transition to menopause has shown to be associated with negative alterations in the lipid profile, increased susceptibility to weight gain and metabolic syndrome, and both epicardial and paracardial fat deposition. – It represents a vulnerable time for women and an opportunity for consideration of menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

In prior decades, MHT was thought to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, large trials demonstrating the risks of MHT have changed clinician and public perception of these strategies. As our understanding of MHT has evolved, so has our knowledge regarding the appropriate timing and patient characteristics for safe administration. Given the efficacy of MHT in reducing the unpleasant vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, which can severely alter quality of life, understanding the safety and potential cardiovascular (CV) risks and benefits of MHT is important in optimizing the health of our female patients.

Menopause and stroke risk — Early menopause and cardiometabolic changes are linked to stroke risk as follows: The preponderance of data support that early menopause (before 45 years of age) is a risk factor for stroke, during the menopausal transition low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels generally rise and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels decline, and in many women menopause contributes to a rise in blood pressure (BP), warranting monitoring during the menopausal transition. Premature menopause and early menopause have been associated with a substantially increased risk of stroke, data are lacking on whether hormone replacement therapy, at least until the average age of menopause, might modify this risk, and premature menopause is a risk-enhancing factor in cholesterol management; primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and screening for and managing risk factors are warranted for those with a history of premature and early menopause.

### Postmenopausal hormone therapy for cardiovascular health: the evolving data [^114JFwKA]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Postmenopausal (PM) hormone therapy (HT) was extremely popular for years as a treatment for many conditions, including cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) prevention. The adverse results from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) ended the widespread prescriptive use of HT for nearly 20 years. The WHI findings have been broadly and unfairly applied to all hormone formulations, including modern treatments using human-identical hormones. Although CV health is indisputably linked to oestrogen status, HT involving any combination of hormones currently is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. In the wake of more positive results from recent studies and re-evaluation of the WHI, HT has re-emerged as an issue for specialists in CVD to discuss with their patients. Rigorous scientific analysis is needed to explain the paradox of cardioprotection conferred by endogenous ovarian hormones with apparent cardiotoxicity inflicted by HT. This review will cover the origins of HT, hormone terminology and function, and key studies that contribute to our current understanding. Based on evolving evidence, if HT is to be used, we propose it be initiated immediately after cessation of ovarian hormone production and dosed as transdermal oestradiol combined with cyclic dosing of human-identical progesterone (P4).

### Sex-based differences in patients with Left ventricular-assisted devices and strokes [^111Pccyd]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Women have different risk factors for stroke depending on whether they are premenopausal or postmenopausal. Menarche and menopause have been proven to be indicators of stroke risk in women. Women who have early-onset menopause have an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke development, and stroke risk continues to increase in postmenopausal women. Higher premenopause estrogen levels are suspected to have a protective effect against stroke and cardiovascular disease, so it was theorized that hormone replacement therapy might serve as a protective measure against stroke as well. However, there have been studies suggesting both that hormone replacement therapy has no effect on stroke rate and that hormone replacement therapy causes an increase in stroke rate and severity. Estrogen appears to play a very nuanced role in stroke incidence, and the topic warrants significant further research.

The discrepancy in anticoagulation management in women compared to men could contribute to the higher incidence of stroke in women as well. Anticoagulant treatment with LVAD includes warfarin therapy managed at a low INR (1.5–2.5) window. A study noted that for CF-LVAD recipients' receiving warfarin, women and prior warfarin usage were predictors of lower time in therapeutic range (TTR).TTR evaluates the safety efficacy of warfarin therapy. A low TTR is indicative of poor outcomes, including ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. Women presenting with poor outcomes on warfarin anticoagulant therapy as opposed to men can potentially explain the reason for increase in strokes in women. However, further research is necessary to understand the sex disparities in effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy in CF-LVAD recipients.

In addition, platelet function and response to antiplatelet therapy is now known to be sex-dependent. In a recent study on sex-specific mortality risk score in LVAD recipients, Nayak et aldemonstrated a sex-specific prognostic impact of a lower platelet count and ischemic cardiomyopathy as the causes of heart failure. This provides valuable insight into the difference in effects of platelet therapy, but further research is necessary to validate these findings.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^1146ThMd]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Menopause hormone therapy — overview and symptom relief benefits emphasize that systemic hormone therapy is an acceptable option for relatively young (up to age 59 or within 10 years of menopause) and healthy women who are bothered by moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, and that individualization is key with consideration of quality-of-life priorities and risk factors including age, time since menopause, and risks of blood clots, heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Systemic hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for most menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy; estrogen therapy as a single agent is sufficient in women who have undergone hysterectomy, whereas progestogen therapy is required to prevent endometrial cancer when estrogen is used systemically in women with a uterus. For symptoms limited to vaginal dryness or discomfort with intercourse, local estrogen therapy is effective and preferred, and low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is recommended in this setting.

Chronic coronary disease — hormone therapy and contraceptives in women: In secondary prevention trials of hormone therapy, there was no effect on cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, stroke, angina, or coronary revascularization, but a statistically significant increased risk of venous thromboembolism was observed (relative risk, 2.02 [95% CI, 1.13–3.62]). In angiographic trials, no benefit of hormone therapy was seen on progression of disease in native coronary artery disease with estrogen only or with estrogen-progestin therapy, and increased thromboembolism risk was also documented among women with previous venous thromboembolism. A review concluded that combined hormonal contraceptives and injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate should be avoided among women with chronic coronary disease or previous stroke because both forms increase thrombosis risk. Among transwomen, increased cardiovascular risk has been documented with higher rates of venous thromboembolism, acute myocardial infarction, and stroke compared with ciswomen, though not always compared with cis men.

### Oral hormone therapy and cardiovascular events… [^1136FPtm]. JAMA Network (2014). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions and Relevance In an observational study of oral hormone therapy users, CEEs use was associated with a higher risk of incident venous thrombosis and possibly myocardial infarction than estradiol use. This risk differential was supported by biologic data. These findings need replication and suggest that various oral estrogen drugs may be associated with different levels of cardiovascular risk. In this contemporary observational study of women using HT, we found that current oral CEEs use was associated with a greater risk of an incident VT than current oral estradiol use. We also found that among controls women using oral CEEs had a greater resistance to APC than women using oral estradiol, providing biologic support for the increased risk seen in the case-control analysis. For arterial end points, MI relative risk estimates were similar to estimates for VT but did not reach statistical significance.

For ischemic stroke, our data did not suggest relative risk differences by estrogen type. Although no statistical differences were observed in subgroups, the relative risks of VT and MI were only slightly elevated for low-dose CEEs users compared with low-dose estradiol users. For VT, there was also a suggestion that relative risks were elevated for those using progestogen and for recent HT initiators compared with non–progestogen users and with longer-term users, findings that parallel those of the Women's Health Initiative, 11, 19 which compared CEEs with placebo. The comparative safety of oral esterified estrogen compared with oral CEEs has been previously described, and it was found that oral CEEs use compared with oral esterified estrogen use was associated with an increased risk of VT and possibly MI and ischemic stroke; findings were validated in controls, where oral CEEs users had greater resistance to APC than oral esterified estrogen users.

3, 4, 28 Furthermore, recent data suggest that estrogen and progestogen drug type may be differentially associated with cardiovascular event risk, although primary analyses compared HT use with nonuse. 26, 27. In summary, we found in an observational study of HT use that women using oral CEEs were at an increased risk of incident VT compared with women using oral estradiol. This finding was supported by biologic data on APC resistance. Our data also suggested an increase in the risk of MI but not ischemic stroke for CEEs use compared with estradiol use. These results need replication but suggest that oral estrogen drugs have different levels of cardiovascular risk.

### Menopausal hormone treatment cardiovascular disease: another look at an unresolved conundrum [^114kN6pS]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death in women. Before the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone trials, evidence favored the concept that menopausal hormone treatment (MHT) protects against CVD. WHI studies failed to demonstrate CVD benefit, with worse net outcomes for MHT versus placebo in the population studied. We review evidence regarding the relationship between MHT and CVD with consideration of mechanisms and risk factors for atherogenesis and cardiac events, results of observational case-control and cohort studies, and outcomes of randomized trials. Estrogen effects on CVD risk factors favor delay or amelioration of atherosclerotic plaque development but may increase risk of acute events when at-risk plaque is present. Long-term observational studies have shown ∼40% reductions in risk of myocardial infarction and all-cause mortality. Analyses of data from randomized control trials other than the WHI show a ∼30% cardioprotective effect in recently menopausal women. Review of the literature as well as WHI data suggests that younger and/or more recently menopausal women may have a better risk-benefit ratio than older or remotely menopausal women and that CVD protection may only occur after > 5 years; WHI women averaged 63 years of age (12 years postmenopausal) and few were studied for > 6 years. Thus, a beneficial effect of long-term MHT on CVD and mortality is still an open question and is likely to remain controversial for the foreseeable future.
