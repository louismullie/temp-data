## Question

Aneurysm of the renal artery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage renal artery aneurysm. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to establish and characterize the diagnosis. Then, I should stratify rupture risk by symptoms and size thresholds. Next, I will choose a treatment modality based on anatomy and patient factors, including pregnancy and infection. After that, I need to define surveillance before and after repair. Finally, I will verify outcomes, complications, and triggers for re-evaluation, integrating guideline recommendations throughout.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic approach and initial characterization. CTA is the first-line imaging to diagnose RAA, delineate morphology, branch involvement, and plan interventions, and this is explicitly recommended in the ESVS 2025 guideline, while MRA without contrast is reasonable when radiation or renal function are concerns per SVS 2020, with catheter angiography reserved when distal branches are inadequately visualized or when endovascular therapy is contemplated and detailed roadmaping is needed [^116BmCLP] [^111dPQGj] [^112yADUk].

> I need to check the key anatomic features that guide management. Size, shape, and location matter: RAAs are commonly saccular and often arise at the primary or secondary bifurcations, and neck characteristics strongly influence endovascular feasibility, while classification systems such as Rundback or newer schemes can help map anatomy to modality choice; wait, I initially wrote "Type I/I", but I should correct that to Type I for main trunk lesions, Type II for bifurcation or narrow-neck branch lesions, and Type III for wide-neck, multi-branch involvement where branch preservation is required and open reconstruction may be favored [^114XrLG6] [^114B4HpC].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment until symptom status is clear. Symptomatic RAAs including pain, hematuria, rupture, or hemodynamic instability warrant urgent repair regardless of size by both ESVS 2025 and SVS 2020, and rupture during pregnancy carries particularly high maternal and fetal risk, which should heighten urgency and influence choice toward minimally invasive approaches when feasible [^1152xdLs] [^115kt5Nf] [^117BbS9H].

> Next, I should review size thresholds for asymptomatic aneurysms because this will anchor decision-making. Wait, older dogma used a 2 cm threshold, but contemporary guidelines and natural history data argue for more conservative thresholds; both ESVS 2025 and SVS 2020 align around offering repair at ≥ 3 cm in acceptable-risk patients, while cohorts show very slow growth and near-zero rupture for lesions under 3 cm, supporting surveillance in appropriately selected patients [^111FhzHX] [^113tCYkf] [^113x7NvV] [^115YWw4m].

> I should confirm the exceptions where size does not drive the decision. Patients who are pregnant or of childbearing potential should generally be offered repair regardless of size due to the disproportionate rupture risk, and that principle is consistently emphasized across ESVS and SVS guidance and supported by case-based literature showing catastrophic outcomes when rupture occurs in pregnancy [^114aC8HC] [^116V8uua] [^117BbS9H].

> Let me now set the surveillance plan for asymptomatic RAAs below threshold. ESVS 2025 recommends annual imaging for the first three years, then individualized intervals thereafter, preferably with duplex ultrasound and CTA reserved for inadequate sonographic windows or more complex anatomy, which is consistent with their broader post-procedural imaging guidance, and is operationalized in IR standards where CTA or duplex are commonly used [^115XzroV] [^113ydApm] [^112ggy7s].

> For asymptomatic RAAs at or above threshold or those crossing exception criteria, I need to ensure the recommendation to offer elective repair is explicit but individualized. ESVS 2025 and SVS 2020 recommend repair at ≥ 3 cm, while surveillance may still be appropriate in very high-risk or limited-life-expectancy patients where operative risk outweighs benefit, an approach echoed in reviews focused on older adults [^111FhzHX] [^113tCYkf] [^115AKAQA].

> Now I will examine modality selection, but I should double-check guideline concordance given some evolution between societies. ESVS 2025 favors endovascular repair over open repair when anatomy is suitable, whereas SVS 2020 supports endovascular for anatomically appropriate lesions but also notes open reconstruction as a mainstay in acceptable-risk patients; reconciling this, a practical approach is endovascular-first for suitable anatomy, with a premium on arterial reconstruction over occlusion when feasible to preserve parenchyma [^116rsUx1] [^115qEjy5] [^112Eu2xB] [^111MQxF9].

> Let me think about technical mapping from anatomy to technique. Main trunk or proximal lesions with adequate landing zones can be excluded with covered stents; bifurcation or narrow-neck lesions may suit stent-assisted coiling or balloon remodeling with liquid embolics; distal or branch lesions often undergo selective coil or liquid embolic exclusion, and contemporary series demonstrate high technical success with low reintervention when performed by experienced teams, although parent artery preservation must be weighed carefully against infarction risk [^112ESqNd] [^1138sAMX] [^112yADUk].

> But wait, what if the aneurysm is wide-necked at a bifurcation with multiple essential branches or involves infection. In those settings, open surgical reconstruction or ex vivo repair with autotransplantation may better preserve renal parenchyma, and mycotic aneurysms require urgent open surgery with antibiotics when feasible, with endovascular therapy considered non-curative in patients unfit for surgery; minimally invasive laparoscopic or robotic approaches are reasonable in specialized centers when anatomy is unfavorable for endovascular therapy [^115EkXfS] [^116aLxHJ] [^1166vojX] [^113f5TVG].

> I should review outcomes to calibrate expectations. Endovascular therapy achieves approximately 96% technical success with short hospital stays and low reintervention, with renal infarction seen in a minority but overall preservation of renal function in most patients, while open surgery offers excellent patency and long-term survival at the cost of longer recovery; emerging robotic series suggest feasibility with preserved function, though data remain limited and center-dependent [^1138sAMX] [^116B74kz] [^116huaBo] [^114JneUg].

> Next, I should review surveillance after repair to ensure durability and detect complications. Both ESVS 2025 and SVS 2020 support long-term imaging surveillance, with schedules individualized by repair type and residual risk, and CTA is commonly used in follow-up although duplex is acceptable when image quality and operator expertise allow [^112ggy7s] [^115XzroV] [^1138sAMX].

> Hold on, I should verify how we adjust management over time. If a previously observed aneurysm accelerates in growth or becomes symptomatic, management should pivot toward repair; while some clinicians use a pragmatic threshold such as growth > 0.5 cm per year, the stronger evidence base shows that most untreated RAAs enlarge very slowly with mean growth under 0.1 cm per year, so any deviation from that benign pattern warrants re-evaluation and multidisciplinary review [^113x7NvV].

> Let me not overlook special scenarios beyond pregnancy and infection. For spontaneous renal artery dissection, conservative therapy with blood pressure control and antiplatelet therapy is first-line if asymptomatic or uncomplicated, but refractory hypertension or symptoms can prompt endovascular revascularization, and annual duplex ultrasound is reasonable to surveil for aneurysm formation or progressive stenosis in conservatively managed cases [^111JeuYy] [^115k4RCp] [^1135BZdr].

> Final check and synthesis before concluding. A practical, guideline-concordant pathway is: diagnose and characterize with CTA, triage by symptoms and size, treat urgently if symptomatic, offer elective repair at ≥ 3 cm or in pregnancy/childbearing potential, prefer endovascular when anatomically suitable while reserving open or hybrid strategies for complex branch or infected lesions, and implement structured pre- and post-repair surveillance, all while individualizing decisions to patient comorbidity, anatomy, and institutional expertise [^116BmCLP] [^1152xdLs] [^111FhzHX] [^116rsUx1] [^115XzroV].

Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) are rare, often incidental, and carry a low rupture risk except during pregnancy or when large [^113z3wdh] [^117BbS9H]. CTA is the diagnostic **gold standard** for anatomic definition and procedural planning [^116BmCLP], while endovascular repair is **preferred** for anatomically suitable cases due to lower morbidity and shorter recovery [^116rsUx1] [^112yADUk]. Repair is indicated for **symptomatic RAAs** [^1152xdLs] [^115kt5Nf], aneurysms **≥ 3 cm** [^111FhzHX] [^113tCYkf], or any size in **women of childbearing potential** [^114aC8HC] [^116V8uua]; **urgent intervention** is required for rupture or rapid growth. Open surgery is reserved for complex anatomy or failed endovascular therapy [^111FhzHX], while small, stable, asymptomatic RAAs are managed with surveillance [^113ydApm] [^115XzroV].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

RAAs are rare, with a **prevalence** of 0.1–1% in the general population [^114XrLG6] [^115puc7J]. Risk factors include atherosclerosis, **fibromuscular dysplasia**, hypertension, **connective tissue disorders** (e.g. Ehlers-Danlos, Marfan), trauma, and iatrogenic injury [^115puc7J] [^114XrLG6].

---

## Clinical presentation

Most RAAs are **asymptomatic**, typically found incidentally on imaging [^114XrLG6] [^115gbUm4], but when **symptomatic** they present with flank or abdominal pain, hematuria, hypertension, or, if ruptured, acute pain, hypotension, and shock [^114XrLG6] [^117BbS9H].

---

## Diagnostic imaging modalities

Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the **gold standard** for diagnosis, anatomic characterization, and procedural planning [^116BmCLP]. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is an alternative for patients with renal insufficiency or when radiation exposure is a concern [^111dPQGj]. Duplex ultrasound is useful for surveillance, particularly for small, stable aneurysms [^113ydApm] [^115XzroV].

---

## Indications for intervention

Per ESVS 2025 guidelines, **intervention is recommended** in the following scenarios:

| **Indication** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic aneurysms (pain, hematuria, hypertension) | Urgent repair regardless of size [^1152xdLs] [^115kt5Nf] |
| Asymptomatic aneurysms ≥ 3 cm | Elective repair [^111FhzHX] [^113tCYkf] |
| Rapidly expanding aneurysms (> 0.5 cm/year) | Urgent repair [^113z3wdh] |
| Pregnant patients or women of childbearing potential | Repair regardless of size [^114aC8HC] [^116V8uua] |
| Mycotic aneurysms | Urgent open surgical intervention with antibiotics [^116aLxHJ] |

---

## Treatment options

### Endovascular repair

- **Techniques**: Coil embolization, covered stent placement, flow-diverting stents [^116rsUx1] [^112yADUk].
- **Advantages**: Minimally invasive, shorter hospital stay, lower perioperative morbidity, faster recovery [^116rsUx1] [^115qEjy5].
- **Limitations**: Not suitable for complex anatomy, wide-neck aneurysms, or extensive branch involvement [^116rsUx1] [^114B4HpC].

---

### Open surgical repair

- **Techniques**: Aneurysmectomy with arterial reconstruction, bypass grafting, ex vivo repair with autotransplantation [^111MQxF9] [^115EkXfS].
- **Advantages**: Durable long-term results, suitable for complex anatomy, wide-neck aneurysms, or failed endovascular attempts [^111MQxF9] [^112Eu2xB].
- **Limitations**: Higher perioperative morbidity, longer hospital stay, longer recovery [^111MQxF9].

---

## Outcomes and complications

| **Parameter** | **Endovascular repair** | **Open surgical repair** |
|-|-|-|
| Technical success | 96% [^1138sAMX] | 93–100% [^116huaBo] |
| Perioperative morbidity | Lower [^116rsUx1] | Higher [^111MQxF9] |
| Hospital stay | Shorter [^116rsUx1] [^116B74kz] | Longer [^111MQxF9] |
| Renal function preservation | 84% [^1138sAMX] | 93–100% |
| Reintervention rate | 3% [^1138sAMX] | 0–7% [^116huaBo] |

---

## Follow-up and surveillance

Post-repair surveillance generally entails **annual imaging** (duplex ultrasound or CTA) for the first 3 years, then individualized thereafter [^112ggy7s] [^115XzroV] [^111431C5], while conservative management of asymptomatic RAAs < 3 cm involves **annual surveillance** [^113ydApm] [^113z3wdh].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: High rupture risk; repair recommended regardless of size [^114aC8HC] [^117BbS9H].
- **Mycotic aneurysms**: Urgent open surgical intervention with antibiotics [^116aLxHJ].
- **Renal artery dissection**: Conservative management with blood pressure control and antiplatelet therapy; endovascular revascularization if refractory hypertension [^111JeuYy] [^115k4RCp] [^1135BZdr].

---

Renal artery aneurysms are rare vascular lesions with a low rupture risk except during pregnancy or when large [^113z3wdh] [^117BbS9H]. Endovascular repair is **preferred** for anatomically suitable cases, while open surgery is reserved for complex anatomy or failed endovascular attempts [^112yADUk]. Surveillance is **recommended** for small, stable, asymptomatic RAAs [^113ydApm] [^111431C5].

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^112yADUk]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). High credibility.

At the time of writing, it is widely accepted in guidelines that endovascular therapy is preferable to open repair unless the endovascular approach is unsuccessful due to an occluded or endovascularly inaccessible main feeding vessel. Surgery remains an option when endovascular exclusion would not eliminate a symptomatic mass effect, a situation sometimes associated with giant VAAs.

- **General considerations**: High-resolution dynamic CTA and multi-planar reconstructions are necessary to assess the precise anatomy of the vascular territory and to determine the most appropriate treatment strategy and the easiest vascular access route. In cases of acute angulation of the feeding vessel from the aorta, brachial or radial access and the use of longer catheters and stents should be considered.

- **Equipment and guidelines**: High-quality standard angiographic equipment with high-resolution fluoroscopy and a wide assortment of dedicated materials and endovascular armamentarium for emergency treatment are mandatory for treating these patients according to the guidelines of the European, US, and Canadian IR societies (CIRSE, SIR, and CIRA/CAIR).

Decision-making around the approach to the intervention should be based on the necessity or willingness to preserve the parent artery; the shape, size, and type of aneurysm (narrow neck or fusiform/wide neck); the tortuosity and size of the parent artery; how distally the aneurysm is located; and the clinical acuity of the situation.

The aim of EVT is to exclude the VAA/VAPA from the arterial circulation.

### Wide-neck renal artery aneurysm: Parenchymal sparing endovascular treatment with a new device [^114XrLG6]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is a rare disorder, occurring in 0.01%–1.3% of the general population. It represents 1% of all aneurysms but is the second most common visceral artery aneurysm, accounting for approximately 25%.

RAAs are classified into four categories: saccular (70%), fusiform (22.5%), dissecting (7.5%), and mixed, including microaneurysms. Saccular aneurysms, the most common, typically occur at the primary or secondary bifurcations of renal arteries; more rarely, they are located intraparenchymally in a segmental artery or more distal branches. Etiologies for saccular aneurysms include atherosclerosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, and neurofibromatosis. RAAs are often noted incidentally but can also be accompanied by hypertension, hematuria, or pain. Hypertension related to RAA remains a controversial topic; however, most case series on RAA treatment report improvement or resolution of hypertension after treatment.

The indication for treatment is currently based on a size threshold that continues to be debated, although most authors believe that aneurysms 2 cm or less in diameter do not require treatment. However, the decision to treat an aneurysm should be made not only on the basis of size but also after considering other issues, such as the presence of clinical symptoms (hematuria, hypertension, back pain, and renal infarction), anatomical and morphological characteristics (location, wall calcification, enlarging lesion), and general clinical features (life expectancy, comorbidities, planned pregnancy).

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for renal artery aneurysm, more specifically with respect to surveillance imaging, the ESVS 2025 guidelines recommend considering annual surveillance for the first three years and individualized follow-up thereafter. This is preferably done with duplex ultrasound, and otherwise with CTA, in patients with an asymptomatic visceral artery aneurysm with a diameter of less than 30 mm.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^115puc7J]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). High credibility.

The writing group for this document, established by the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee, consisted of five clinicians with internationally recognized expertise in interventional radiological treatment of visceral artery aneurysms. They reviewed existing literature on VAA and VAPA endovascular treatment, performing a pragmatic evidence search using PubMed for publications from 1980 to 2022. The recommendations were formulated by consensus.

- **Definition**: Visceral and renal artery aneurysms (VAAs) are rare pathologies with an incidence of 0.01–0.2%. Visceral aneurysms affect the splanchnic arteries, including the celiac axis and its branches, the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA), and their branches. The splenic artery is involved in up to 60% of cases, followed by the hepatic artery as the second most commonly affected.

- **Overview of VAAs**:
	- **VAA/VAPA risk factors**: Atherosclerosis and hypertension, infection, fibromuscular dysplasia, Kawasaki disease, Osler–Weber–Rendu disease, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and Marfan's syndrome.

A true aneurysm is defined as a focal dilatation of an artery more than 50% of the expected diameter for the anatomical area and patient gender, involving all three vessel layers; it may have a saccular or fusiform shape. A false aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm results from a contained rupture of the artery that is lined only by the adventitia.

### An anatomic classification scheme for surgical planning of renal artery aneurysms [^114B4HpC]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is a rare disease, and this study proposed and evaluated a new classification for RAA to assist in surgical decision-making.

- **Materials and methods**: Single-center data of 105 patients with RAAs from the vascular department of vascular surgery were collected retrospectively. A new classification scheme was proposed:
	- Type I aneurysms arise from the main trunk, accessory branch, or first-order branches away from any bifurcation.
	- Type II aneurysms arise from the first bifurcation with narrow necks (defined as a dome-to-neck ratio > 2) or from intralobular branches.
	- Type III aneurysms with a wide neck arise from the first bifurcation and affect two or more branches that cannot be sacrificed without significant infarction of the kidney.

- **Results**: There were 50 (47.62%) type I, 33 (31.43%) type II, and 22 (20.95%) type III aneurysms. The classification assigned endovascular repair as the first-line treatment for type I or II, while open techniques were conducted if anatomically suitable for type III. A kappa level of 0.752 was achieved by the classification compared with a level of 0.579 from the classic Rundback classification. Technical primary success was achieved in 100% and 96.05%, and symptoms were completely resolved in 100% and 84.85%, while hypertension was relieved in 84.21% and 72.92% of patients receiving open surgery or endovascular repair, respectively. No significant difference was observed for perioperative or long-term complications among the three classification types.

### Endovascular vs open repair of renal artery aneurysms: Outcomes of repair and long-term renal function [^116B74kz]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2013). Low credibility.

Endovascular repair (ER) of renal artery aneurysms (RAA) has been widely used recently due to its assumed lower morbidity and mortality compared with open surgery (OS). The purpose of this study was to investigate the outcomes of OS and ER and to compare long-term renal function.

- **Study design**: Data from 2000 to 2012 were retrospectively collected to identify patients treated for RAA at a single institution. Morbidity, mortality, freedom from reinterventions, and renal function were compared between OS and ER for RAA.

- **Results**: Forty-four RAA repairs were identified in 40 patients (28 women, mean age ± SD 54 ± 13 years). Twenty RAAs were repaired with OS (45%), and 24 RAAs (55%) with ER. Mean aneurysm sizes were 2.5 ± 1.5 cm for OS and 2.2 ± 2.2 cm for ER (p = 0.66). Endovascular repair included coil embolization with or without stent placement in 19 patients (79%) and stent grafts in 4 patients (17%). Open surgery included excision or aneurysmorrhaphy of the aneurysm in 11 kidneys (55%), graft interposition or bypass in 4 kidneys (20%), and 4 nephrectomies (20%). There was 1 technical failure in each group. Comorbidities were similar between the two groups (American Society of Anesthesiologists III-IV: OS, 40%; ER, 58%; p = 0.44).

	- Endovascular repair and OS had equivalent perioperative morbidity (any complication OS, 15%; ER, 17%; p = 1.0) and no mortality (OS, 0%; ER, 0%). Endovascular repair was associated with shorter hospitalization (OS, 6.3 ± 2.5 days; ER, 2 ± 3.4 days; p < 0.001). Mean follow-ups were 21 ± 32 months for OS and 27 ± 36 months for ER. A 30% reduction in glomerular filtration rate was noted, though the text is cut off here.

### Pregnancy with a ruptured renal artery aneurysm: Management concerns and endovascular management [^117BbS9H]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). High credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) affects less than 0.01% of the general population. Rupture of RAA is a rare catastrophe that can complicate pregnancy and is associated with high maternal and fetal mortality. Presentation is usually acute, with severe flank pain, with or without haematuria, and haemodynamic instability requiring exploration and nephrectomy. A 26-year-old pregnant woman experienced a sudden onset of gross haematuria and, upon evaluation, was found to have a left RAA with an intrapelvic rupture and thinned out renal parenchyma. Due to the high risk of surgery, she was managed with endovascular placement of an Amplatzer type II vascular plug. Immediate and complete occlusion of blood flow was achieved, and nephrectomy was avoided. Follow-up Doppler ultrasound revealed a reduced 5 cm mass in the left renal fossa with no internal flow and the plug in position. She is currently under follow-up with 3–6 monthly ultrasonography, not requiring any intervention.

### The Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines on the management of visceral aneurysms [^113z3wdh]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2020). High credibility.

These Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines describe the care of patients with aneurysms of the visceral arteries. They include evidence-based size thresholds for the repair of aneurysms of the renal arteries, splenic artery, celiac artery, and hepatic artery, among others. Specific open surgical and endovascular repair strategies are also discussed. The guidelines describe particular circumstances in which aneurysms may be repaired at smaller sizes than these size thresholds, such as in women of childbearing age and in cases of false aneurysms. These guidelines offer important recommendations for the care of patients with aneurysms of the visceral arteries and provide long-awaited guidance for clinicians who treat these patients.

### A qualitative systematic review of endovascular management of renal artery aneurysms [^1138sAMX]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to perform a qualitative systematic review of endovascular management of renal artery aneurysms (RAAs).

- **Materials and methods**: A comprehensive electronic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, and Cochrane databases from 2000 to 2022 was performed using the search terms "renal artery", "aneurysm", and "endovascular". Means of outcome measures were calculated with a primary endpoint focused on RAA-related mortality and rupture. Secondary endpoints included reintervention rates and renal infarction.

- **Results**: Twenty-six single-center, retrospective, observational studies were included. There were 454 RAAs treated in 427 patients using endovascular techniques. The mean age was 53.8 years, with a female predominance (62%). A variety of endovascular treatments of RAA were used with excellent technical success (96%), renal parenchymal preservation, and a low rate of moderate/severe adverse events (AEs). Primary coil embolization was the most commonly used technique (44.7%). There was an overall AE rate of 22.9%, of which 6.7% were moderate/severe, and there was 0% periprocedural mortality. The most common AE was renal infarction (49 patients, 11.5%); however, renal function was preserved in 84% of patients. The nephrectomy rate was 0.4%. Computed tomography (CT) angiography was the most common imaging follow-up modality used in 72% of studies. Only 9 studies (34%) reported anticoagulant use. Although the risk of delayed aneurysm reperfusion warrants clinical and imaging surveillance, relatively few patients (3%) required reintervention in this cohort.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^116huaBo]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Options for treatment of a renal artery aneurysm (RAA) include open surgical repair or endovascular approaches. Open surgery includes ex-vivo reconstruction with auto-transplantation of the kidney or in-situ repair of the aneurysm. These open surgical approaches offer good vascular patency rates ranging from 93% to 100% and long-term survival rates averaging 90% at 10 years. Additionally, when these surgeries are performed in the appropriate patient, they are well-tolerated with minimal morbidity and complication rates.

Endovascular treatments for RAA include deployment of a covered stent or renal angioembolization. Small series have shown that the endovascular approach is well-tolerated, with reported success rates of 83% to 100% and variable complication rates of 13% to 60%. When comparing the endovascular approach to the open surgical approach, retrospective studies have suggested that the endovascular approach is associated with shorter hospitalizations, similar or fewer complications, and similar success rates. Additionally, no studies have reported a significant difference in mortality, perioperative morbidity, freedom from reintervention, or decline in renal function when comparing open and endovascular approaches to repairing RAAs.

Endovascular stenting or embolization is also the preferred approach for renal artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP). In rare cases in which angioembolization is unsuccessful, open surgery with nephrectomy is necessary. Angioembolization of a RAP has a high success rate ranging from 93% to 96% in select series, and the procedure is well-tolerated with a complication rate of around 5%. The most common complications include incomplete embolization and post-embolization syndrome.

### Surgery of renal artery aneurysms: A monocentric retrospective study [^111uTESj]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to report the results of conventional surgery for renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) in our center.

- **Material and methods**: We retrospectively reviewed the files of all the patients operated for RAAs between 2009 and 2018 in our center. We collected demographic, biological (renal function), morphological (computed tomography [CT] scan), and functional (ultrasound examination and resistance index) preoperative and postoperative data. Clinical and paraclinical operative data were examined. Results were expressed as average ± standard deviation or median and extremes.

- **Results**: A total of 26 aneurysms were operated on in 20 kidneys (10 right kidneys) among 19 patients, including 13 (68%) women with an average age of 55 (± 12) years. Three (16%) patients presented an aneurysm in a single kidney. The discovery of the aneurysm was fortuitous in 14 (74%) patients. One patient with Marfan syndrome was operated on following a postpartum rupture. The median diameter of the operated aneurysms was 22 mm (7–48), and 23 (90%) were hilar aneurysms. Arterial repair was carried out in situ in 16 (80%) kidneys. The surgery consisted of a direct arterial repair in 21 cases (81%), including 4 resections and anastomoses, 12 aneurysmorrhaphies, and 5 complex reconstructions. Four arterial replacements were carried out (one prosthetic graft, 2 femoral grafts, and one internal iliac graft). The average duration of renal clamping was 30.5 (± 17.3) minutes. Postoperative renal function was unchanged in all the patients except for one (5.2%) who required 2 days of postoperative dialysis.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^117RPerz]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Treatment for a renal artery aneurysm (RAA) or renal artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) is typically sought when the aneurysm is greater than 3 cm in size, in a woman of childbearing age, or in a patient with medically refractory hypertension. The main reason for treatment is to reduce the risk of aneurysm rupture, which can lead to life-threatening hemorrhage. Earlier reports estimated a high risk of RAA rupture ranging from 14% to 30%. Prior guidelines recommended repair of visceral artery aneurysms greater than 2 cm. However, more recent reports suggest RAAs have a much lower risk of rupture, even in aneurysms greater than 2 cm in size.

Tham et al. followed 69 patients with RAA conservatively over a mean of 4 years and found that none of these patients developed RAA ruptures. A multicenter study by Klausner et al. showed that out of a cohort of 547 patients with untreated RAA, the rupture rate was 0.55%, and ruptures only occurred in patients with aneurysms greater than 3 cm in size. Pregnancy has been associated with a higher rate of aneurysm rupture, possibly due to changes in vascular flow and hormonal shifts that result in weakening of the arterial wall elastic tissue. However, the true incidence of RAA within the pregnant population is unknown.

The presence of a RAA with renovascular hypertension is also an indication for treatment. Studies have shown that reconstruction of a RAA can improve or cure co-existing hypertension, and the benefit of repair on hypertension is more likely to occur in those with renovascular hypertension than in those without arterial stenosis.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: a case report and review of the literature [^113L9HsE]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

A renal artery aneurysm is a rare clinical presentation that can be found incidentally on imaging or during workup for refractory hypertension. Its presentation can be similar to that of a renal artery pseudoaneurysm, but the etiologies of the two vascular lesions differ. We present a patient who had an incidental finding of a large renal artery aneurysm that was managed with endovascular embolization and describe the literature surrounding the etiology, presentation, and management of both renal artery aneurysms and renal artery pseudoaneurysms.

- **Case presentation**: A 62-year-old man was referred to a urologic oncologist for workup of a newly found renal mass. Initial imaging with computed tomography showed a homogenous, well-circumscribed mass arising from the right kidney. Further evaluation with Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated pulsatile flow within the renal mass that was concerning for a renal artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient initially underwent a diagnostic angiogram by interventional radiology and was found to have a true renal artery aneurysm. Interventional radiology considered the placement of a covered stent or angioembolization, but treatment was deferred due to concern for compromising the patient's renal function. The patient was subsequently transferred to a neighboring hospital for management by vascular surgery. After considering both open surgical and endovascular approaches, the patient ultimately underwent angioembolization of the renal artery aneurysm. Short-term follow-up showed successful exclusion of the aneurysm with minimal adverse effects.

### Therapy of renal artery aneurysms in New York State: Outcomes of patients undergoing open and endovascular repair [^114RWDvW]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate changing trends in therapy and determinants of outcomes among patients with a renal artery aneurysm (RAA) undergoing surgical or endovascular repair in New York State (NYS). A retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent therapy for RAA in NYS from October 1, 2000, to December 31, 2006, was identified from the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System database. Regression models that included hospital and patient characteristics were created to identify predictors of untoward events following surgical or endovascular intervention. Over this time period, 215 patients with RAA repairs were analyzed.

In multivariate analysis, preoperative predictors of death included diabetes (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 57.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.3–1,430.1, p = 0.013), the presence of other aneurysms (adjusted OR = 18.5, CI 1.5–234.4, p = 0.024), and coagulopathy (adjusted OR = 16.9, CI 3.4–393.1, p = 0.03) but not repair type. Perioperative cardiac (adjusted OR = 16.7, CI 1.4–197.1, p = 0.026) and vascular device-related (adjusted OR = 11.1, CI 1.003–123.0, p = 0.049) complications were predictive of mortality. When patients with other aneurysms were excluded from analysis (n = 153), there were no significant predictors of death.

Ninety-one endovascular and 124 open surgical repairs were performed, with a significant increase in the proportion of endovascular repairs performed over time (p < 0.001). However, since 2003, the proportion of both has been roughly equal. Diabetes (15.4% vs. 5.6%, p = 0.018), chronic anemia (5.5% vs. 0.8%, p = 0.04), and emergencies…

### Growth patterns of true renal artery aneurysms in the current published literature [^113x7NvV]. Clinical Radiology (2025). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to describe the methods for surveying true renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) and to identify the pattern of growth of RAA in the literature.

- **Materials and methods**: A comprehensive electronic database search was performed, applying limits including full text and English language. The reference lists of included publications were manually searched for further relevant studies. Studies that surveyed RAA on imaging and calculated mean aneurysm growth rates per year were included.

- **Results**: The literature review yielded six studies comprising 876 patients and approximately 988 aneurysms. Computed tomography (CT) was the most common imaging modality utilized for evaluation of RAA. The mean initial RAA diameter ranged from 1.21 to 1.6 cm. The combined cohort was followed radiologically for up to a maximum of 142 months, reporting a zero percent rupture rate. Mean growth rates were consistently below 0.1 cm/y across the included studies, with a range of 0.017–0.086 cm/y.

- **Conclusion**: The present study highlights a benign course of RAA. The evidence yields a rupture rate of zero in a combined cohort of approximately 988 aneurysms followed for up to 11 years. Future guidelines should recognize this indolent course and consider the rationalization of RAA surveillance, particularly where the initial aneurysm size is well below the threshold for treatment.

### Robot-assisted laparoscopic reconstructed management of multiple aneurysms in renal artery primary bifurcations: a case report and literature review [^115YJ6Sh]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is rare and its incidence in the general population remains elusive. There have been few reports on the repair of multiple aneurysms conducted with the Da Vinci robot-assisted surgical platform (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), especially for those located in renal artery primary bifurcations.

- **Case presentation**: We report our experience in the surgical management of two expanding right-sided RAAs in a 64-year-old man using a robot-assisted laparoscopic approach. Two aneurysms were located in renal artery primary bifurcations, with diameters of 1.8 and 1.2 cm. The aneurysms were resected and the renal artery branch reconstructed by in situ arteriorrhaphy. The operation lasted for 2 hours and 35 minutes with a warm ischemia time of 26 minutes and estimated blood loss of 150 ml. The hospital stay was 6 days. The computed tomography (CT) scan performed 2 months after the surgery showed resolution of the aneurysms. Additionally, split renal function indicated the preservation of right renal function in the follow-up period.

- **Conclusions**: The robot-assisted laparoscopic procedure is a safe and effective surgical technique, which may be considered as an alternative to open surgery for complex multiple RAAs in the future.

### Repair of complex renal artery aneurysms by laparoscopic nephrectomy with ex vivo repair and autotransplantation [^115dY45e]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysms are increasingly being discovered due to the use of non-invasive imaging. Complex renal artery aneurysms involving multiple secondary or tertiary branches are not fit for in vivo or endovascular treatment and often require ex vivo repair with autotransplantation. To minimize incisional morbidity and expedite recovery, a technique combining laparoscopic nephrectomy with backbench ex vivo repair, followed by autotransplantation through a small laparoscopic extraction incision, was developed. This study describes the initial experience with this combined technique in patients who were not candidates for endovascular techniques or in vivo arterial reconstruction.

- **Methods**: Seven patients with complex renal artery aneurysms underwent laparoscopic nephrectomy and ex vivo repair using multiple saphenous vein grafts and autotransplantation through the small laparoscopic extraction incision. The aneurysms measured between 2.5 to 5.0 cm. In all cases, the aneurysm was resected ex vivo, leaving multiple branch arteries that were extended with saphenous vein grafts. Arterial inflow was re-established with sequential saphenous vein anastomoses to the external iliac artery. Ureteral reconstruction was performed via standard Lich ureteroneocystostomy. Patients were followed postoperatively for two to eight years.

- **Results**: Laparoscopic nephrectomy with ex vivo repair of complex aneurysms was successfully employed in seven patients with renal aneurysms that were unfit for endovascular or in vivo repair. There were no incisional morbidities.

### Surgical renovascular reconstruction for renal artery stenosis and aneurysm: Long-term durability and survival [^113itBMh]. European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

To study functional outcome, mortality, and dialysis-free survival in patients undergoing open primary surgical repair of renal artery stenosis (RAS) or aneurysm (RAA), a retrospective single-center study was conducted. The study included patients undergoing open surgical renal artery reconstruction from 1993 to 2007. Key parameters such as blood pressure, renal function, dialysis dependence, vessel patency, and mortality were recorded. Survival data was obtained by cross-referencing with the population registry, allowing for up to 20 years of follow-up.

Of the 40 patients operated on, 25 (63%) were women. RAS was the indication for reconstruction in 31 patients; with 23 having atherosclerotic aetiology (ARAS), and eight having fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). Nine patients had RAA. Patients with ARAS were older (p = .008), exhibited more extensive peripheral arterial disease (p = .004), and had inferior renal function (p = .003) compared with patients with FMD or RAA. In the FMD and RAA groups, the right renal artery was affected in 13/17 cases (76%), whereas in ARAS, the disease was evenly distributed.

In patients with ARAS, 15/25 (60%) stenotic renal arteries (including two bilateral procedures) were managed via aorto-renal bypass, while 2/25 (8%) were addressed through ilio-renal bypass. An endarterectomy was performed in 8/25 (32%) of cases. In the FMD group, all but one patient underwent aorto-renal bypass. The early mortality rate was 2.5% (one patient with ARAS). Post-operatively, one patient with ARAS required dialysis. Systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced in patients with ARAS, decreasing from 180 mmHg (median) pre-operatively to 155 mmHg at one month (p = .003) and 160 mmHg thereafter.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^1165k9Yu]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

A renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is a rare vascular malformation that is typically found incidentally on imaging. On rare occasions, RAAs can rupture and cause a life-threatening hemorrhage with a mortality rate approaching 10%. This risk is significantly higher in pregnant women.

The RAA is characterized by a localized defect in the internal elastic tissue that allows it to dilate; a true aneurysm contains all three layers of the arterial wall. In contrast, a renal artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) is a hematoma that forms from an arterial defect that intermittently ruptures and clots off, forming a collection of blood products surrounded by the renal parenchyma or the renal capsule. RAPs occur due to injury to the kidney following abdominal trauma or renal surgery.

We present the case of an incidentally discovered renal artery aneurysm and review some of the literature surrounding the etiology, presentation, and management of both RAAs and RAPs.

### Robotic renal artery aneurysm repair [^114JneUg]. European Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is a rare condition, traditionally managed with endovascular or open surgical techniques. This study aims to report our experience with robotic RAA repair.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Nine consecutive patients underwent intracorporeal robotic surgery for 10 RAAs.

- **Surgical procedure**: Two patients underwent concomitant robotic partial nephrectomy. One patient had RAA in a solitary kidney. The median RAA diameter was 2.2 cm (range: 1.8–3 cm). Intracorporeal transarterial hypothermic renal perfusion was performed in five patients. Robotic techniques included tailored aneurysmectomy and repair (n = 5), excision with end-to-end anastomosis (n = 2), aneurysmectomy with branch reimplantation (n = 1), prosthetic interposition graft repair (n = 1), and simple nephrectomy (n = 1; this patient's data were excluded from analysis).

- **Measurements**: Demographics, RAA characteristics, intraoperative techniques, perioperative outcomes, and follow-up data were analyzed. Aneurysms were diagnosed by computed tomography, angiography, or incidentally during the performance of a partial nephrectomy.

- **Results and limitations**: All cases were performed robotically, without conversion to open surgery. The median operative time was 3.8 hours (range: 3–6 hours), warm ischemia time 26 minutes (range: 19–32 minutes), hypothermic renal perfusion time 34 minutes (range: 29–69 minutes), and estimated blood loss was 100 mL (range: 25–400 ml). No intraoperative blood transfusion was required. The median hospital stay was 3 days (range: 2–6 days). One patient had a Clavien-Dindo grade II complication. At a median follow-up of 16 months (range: 2–67 months), all patients had preserved renal function.

### Natural history and management of renal artery aneurysms in a single tertiary referral center [^1164jjXP]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Although renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) are uncommon, several large reports have been published indicating their benign natural history. The objective of our study was to review our single-center experience managing this disease entity.

A retrospective review of the Yale radiologic database from January 1999 to December 2016 was performed. Only patients with RAAs and a computed tomography scan of the abdomen were selected for review. Demographics of the patients, aneurysm characteristics, management, postoperative complications, and follow-up data were collected.

There were 241 patients with 259 RAAs identified, with a mean age of 69 years (range, 35–100 years); 147 were female (61%). On computed tomography, aneurysms were solitary and right-sided in 224 (86%) and 159 (61%), respectively; 64 (27%) patients had aneurysms elsewhere. The breakdown of RAAs by location was as follows: renal bifurcation in 84 (32%), renal pelvis in 77 (30%), distal renal artery in 58 (22%), mid renal artery in 34 (13%), and proximal renal artery in 6 (2%).

Five patients had symptoms that were attributed to the RAA and underwent operative repair; all others were observed without an operation. Symptoms in the operative repair group included flank pain in four and uncontrolled hypertension in one. The mean overall diameter of the RAAs was 1.22 ± 0.49 cm. The diameter of operatively repaired and observed RAAs was 1.84 ± 0.55 cm and 1.21 ± 0.48 cm, respectively (P = 0.002). Operative repair included four coil embolizations and one open resection.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^115xPwzc]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

The CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee convened an expert writing group tasked with creating up-to-date recommendations on the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms (VAAs) and visceral and renal artery pseudoaneurysms (VAPAs). This document is not a clinical practice guideline or a systematic review of the literature. As with all CIRSE Standards of Practice documents, it is not intended to impose a standard of clinical patient care. Instead, it recommends a reasonable approach to and best practices for the endovascular treatment of VAAs and VAPAs. Institutions should regularly review their internal procedures for development and improvement, taking into account international guidance, local resources, and regular internal morbidity and mortality reviews.

A summary of key recommendations on the endovascular management of visceral and renal aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms is presented below:

- **Visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs)**: Recommendations for treatment strategies and best practices.
- **Visceral artery pseudoaneurysms (VAPAs)**: Recommendations for management and intervention techniques.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^113879rS]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms is an effective, minimally invasive treatment that has been successfully used since the early 1990s, with refined and expanded techniques and tools currently offering excellent outcomes. Due to increased detection of such lesions in recent years, many of which are asymptomatic, the revision of the indications for intervention and the correct endovascular treatment approaches has become essential.

- **Purpose**: This document will presume that the indication for treatment is clear and approved by the multidisciplinary team. It will define the standards required for the performance of each intervention, as well as their relative advantages and limitations. The CIRSE Standards of Practice documents are not intended to impose a standard of clinical patient care but recommend a reasonable approach to, and best practices for, the performance of the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms.

- **Methods**: The writing group was established by the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee and consisted of five clinicians with internationally recognized expertise in endovascular treatments. The writing group reviewed the existing literature on visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms, performing an evidence search using PubMed to identify publications in English and relating to human subjects from 1990 to 2022. The final recommendations were formulated through consensus.

- **Results**: Endovascular treatment has an established role in the successful management of these conditions.

### Atypical renal artery preservation with an iliac branch device in an infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm [^114RLvwh]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Anatomical variations of the renal arteries may complicate endovascular repair of infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Occlusion of renal branches may be necessary to seal the aneurysm sac efficiently. Depending on the size of the affected renal arteries and the supplied parenchyma, this can lead to loss of renal function. Iliac branch devices (IBDs) have been created to preserve the internal iliac artery in aortoiliac or isolated iliac aneurysms; however, IBDs have the potential to maintain patency of other arteries as well.

This case report describes the off-label use of an IBD inside the main body of a bifurcated endoprosthesis in a patient with an AAA and multiple renal arteries to preserve the main renal artery that emerges directly out of the aneurysm sac. Special considerations, such as limited craniocaudal dimensions for endoprosthesis placement and the reduced vascular space, are discussed.

### Management of complex symptomatic renal artery aneurysm in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus [^111b2Quu]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: RAAs, primarily when symptomatic, present significant clinical challenges, potentially leading to pain, haematuria, or other acute symptoms requiring urgent intervention. Due to their challenging anatomical features, complex RAAs have traditionally been treated with open surgery, including auto-transplantation of the kidney. However, the introduction of endovascular techniques has shifted the management of these complex aneurysms towards percutaneous approaches, offering reduced morbidity and faster recovery times. To our knowledge, this is the first time a C-Guard stent was used to exclude a symptomatic renal artery aneurysm, complex in morphology, while preserving the distal side branches, benefiting from flow-diverting modulation (figure 2).

	- According to the 2020 Society for Vascular Surgery clinical practice guidelines on the management of visceral aneurysms, on suspicion of a RAA, CTA is the diagnostic modality of choice (recommendation level 1B). Alternative methods are MRA (recommendation level 1C) and catheter-based angiography, especially if the distal artery branches cannot be adequately assessed by CTA (recommendation level 1C).

### Natural history of renal artery aneurysms [^115YWw4m]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

The existing renal artery aneurysm (RAA) literature largely consists of reports on patients who underwent intervention. The objective of this study was to review the natural history of RAA. This single-institution retrospective analysis studied all patients with RAA diagnosed by computed tomography imaging between 2015 and 2019, identified through our institutional radiology database. Imaging, demographic, and clinical data were obtained via the electronic medical record. The growth rate was calculated for all patients with radiological follow-up.

The cohort consists of 331 patients with 338 RAAs. Most patients were female (61.3%), with 11 (3.3%) of childbearing age. The mean age at diagnosis was 71.5 years (range, 24–99 years). Medical comorbidities included hypertension (73.7%), prior smoking (34.4%), and connective tissue disease (3.9%). Imaging indications included abdominal pain (33.5%), unrelated follow-up (29.6%), and follow-up of an RAA initially diagnosed before the study period (10.7%).

Right RAA (61.9%) was more common than left (35.1%); 3% of patients had bilateral RAA. The mean diameter at diagnosis was 12.9 ± 5.9 mm. Size distribution included lesions measuring < 15 mm (69.9%), 15 to 25 mm (27.1%), and more than 25 mm (3.0%). Anatomic locations included the distal RA (26.7%), renal hilum (42.4%), and mid-RA (13.1%). The majority were true aneurysms (98%); of these, 72.3% were fusiform and 27.7% were saccular. Additional characteristics included calcification (82.2%), thrombus (15.9%), and dissection (0.9%).

### Wide-neck renal artery aneurysm: Parenchymal sparing endovascular treatment with a new device [^117AQnpV]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

In the present case, considering the patient's comorbidities and the location of the aneurysm, surgical repair would have been very invasive and likely required bench surgery, making endovascular exclusion preferable. The anatomical features and location of the aneurysm, along with the need for accurate coil deployment before release, justified the use of this new type of neurointerventional detachable coil. This approach had not been previously reported for treating renal artery aneurysms (RAA). A high packing density was achieved with fewer coils and a shorter procedure time than required by other procedures using different materials.

To our knowledge, this is the first case of a visceral aneurysm treated with the Penumbra Coil 400™ Embolization System (Penumbra Inc.), incorporating 3 years of follow-up. These 0.020-inch coils are larger in diameter than other neurointerventional coils and are inherently softer, due to their diameter (softness increases by the third power of the diameter) and the different thickness of the nitinol stretch-resistant wire. The coil-within-a-coil design enhances the device's ability to occupy the aneurysmal sac, reducing the risk of misplacement.

As previously reported, in treating complex renal aneurysms in difficult locations, a neurointerventional coil system may facilitate complete sac embolization with lower morbidity and less risk of decreased renal function than surgery or other endovascular techniques can achieve. The Penumbra system in particular, due to its conformability and greater length-volume ratio, demonstrates potential advantages in this context.

### Robot-assisted laparoscopic reconstructed management of multiple aneurysms in renal artery primary bifurcations: A case report and literature review [^116v1TQj]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Robot-assisted laparoscopic reconstruction of renal artery aneurysms (RAA) presents significant challenges due to the rarity of the condition. Multiple RAAs occur in about 18% of RAA cases and are even rarer overall. Reaching a consensus on intervention indications is complicated by factors like clinical symptoms, anatomical and morphological characteristics, and general clinical features. Symptoms include hematuria, refractory hypertension, persistent back pain, and renal infarction. The characteristics consider size, location, wall calcification, and lesion enlargement, while clinical features include life expectancy, comorbidities, and planned pregnancy. Widely accepted intervention indications involve aneurysms larger than 2 cm, women of reproductive age planning pregnancy, and positive clinical manifestations such as pain or refractory hypertension attributed to the RAA. The presence of two RAAs in the renal artery increases the rupture risk and progression, necessitating intervention.

- **Treatment options**: RAAs can be managed by surgical or percutaneous interventional radiological treatments. While percutaneous interventional radiology surpasses traditional surgery due to its lower invasiveness and reduced morbidity, it is not ideal for all cases, such as aneurysms at artery bifurcations or distal branches. Open surgery, the gold standard, results in considerable blood loss and prolonged recovery, imposing a heavier burden on patients. Laparoscopic repair offers a less invasive alternative with a reduced recovery burden.

### Technical considerations of endovascular management of true visceral artery aneurysms [^112ESqNd]. CVIR Endovascular (2023). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) account for 22% of visceral artery aneurysms (VAAs). Treatment is generally recommended when RAAs reach 20 mm, in symptomatic patients, and at any size in female patients of childbearing age. The complexity of treatment primarily depends on the aneurysm location. According to the Rundback classification, a type 1 RAA, which arises from the main trunk, can be treated with covered stents, favorably with a landing zone of 15 mm on either side. A type 2 RAA is usually situated at the extrarenal proximal arterial bifurcation, while type 3 RAAs arise from the distal branches. To preserve as much renal parenchyma as possible, a type 2 RAA located at the extrarenal proximal arterial bifurcation should be treated by stent-assisted coil embolization or the balloon remodeling technique with a non-adhesive liquid embolic agent such as Onyx (Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA), with or without coils.

### Management of complex symptomatic renal artery aneurysm in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus [^113xpMc7]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

The prevalence of renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) on angiographic and CT angiography (CTA) studies is estimated to be between 0.3% and 2.5%, encompassing a range of small, asymptomatic lesions to larger, clinically significant aneurysms. They are usually discovered during imaging tests performed to investigate other medical conditions. While smaller RAAs typically remain asymptomatic and only necessitate regular monitoring, larger aneurysms may present with complications such as haematuria, hypertension, renal insufficiency, and rupture. In turn, rupture of a RAA can cause internal haemorrhage, shock, kidney loss, and death.

RAAs are categorized according to an angiographic classification system. Type I are saccular/fusiform aneurysms arising from the main renal artery; type II are fusiform/saccular aneurysms located on the main renal artery or a large segmental branch, and type III are more complex, involving multiple branches or intralobar, arising from small segmental arteries or intraparenchymal branches. All types are amenable to surgery, while types I and II are better suited to an endovascular approach. Type III RAAs are particularly concerning due to their larger size, irregular morphology, and proximity to vital renal structures, all of which elevate the risk of rupture and other complications during surgery, as commonly managed by autotransplantation after on-table reconstruction of the renal vessels.

### Renal artery aneurysm: Successful exclusion with a stent graft [^111waqHh]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2004). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysms are uncommon, typically discovered incidentally or during a workup for secondary hypertension. An association exists between aneurysm rupture and sizes greater than 1.5 cm. In this case report, the exclusion of a renal aneurysm with a covered stent is described. Despite the compromise of a side-branch vessel, there were no deleterious effects on renal function at 6-month follow-up.

### Management and outcomes of renal artery aneurysms in older adults [^115AKAQA]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) are rare but clinically significant vascular abnormalities. The management of RAA in older adults poses unique challenges related to their baseline comorbidities and age-related vascular changes. Traditionally, open surgery has been the gold standard for large or complex RAA. However, recent data and guidelines support a more conservative threshold for intervention and broader adoption of endovascular therapies, which offer lower perioperative morbidity, shorter hospital stays, and overall faster recovery.

General indications for repair include symptomatic aneurysms, medically refractory hypertension, and lesions ≥ 3 cm. Medical management and surveillance are appropriate for asymptomatic patients with stable aneurysms < 3 cm, especially for those with limited life expectancy. Open surgical techniques include both in situ and ex vivo reconstructions with demonstrated long-term durability but are associated with higher perioperative risk.

Endovascular techniques, including coil embolization and stent grafting, are increasingly being used in anatomically suitable patients with high success. Postoperative outcomes suggest comparable long-term results between open and endovascular approaches. However, endovascular repair is associated with fewer complications and is increasingly preferred in elderly or high-risk populations.

An individualized approach is essential to optimize outcomes, balancing the risks of intervention with the natural history of the disease.

The European Society for Vascular Surgery (ESVS) has developed clinical practice guidelines for the care of patients with diseases of the mesenteric and renal arteries and veins, following the first 2017 guidelines, with the aim of assisting physicians and patients in selecting the best management strategy.

These guidelines are based on scientific evidence and expert opinion. By summarizing and evaluating the best available evidence, recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of patients have been formulated. The recommendations are graded according to the new ESVS clinical practice guidelines class of recommendation grading system, where the strength (class) of each recommendation is graded from I to III, and the letter A to C marks the level of evidence.

A total of 102 recommendations have been issued on the management of chronic arterial mesenteric ischemia, median arcuate ligament syndrome, acute arterial mesenteric ischemia, non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia, venous mesenteric thrombosis and ischemia, occlusive disease of the renal arteries and veins, visceral artery aneurysms, and spontaneous isolated dissection of the visceral arteries.

These 2025 ESVS clinical practice guidelines provide comprehensive and up-to-date advice to physicians and patients on the management of diseases of the mesenteric and renal arteries and veins.

### Wide-neck renal artery aneurysm: Parenchymal sparing endovascular treatment with a new device [^113Xt6cR]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm is a rare disorder with a high mortality rate in the event of rupture, the most frequent complication, which can also occur in lesions smaller than those indicated for treatment by criteria. Surgery is still the first-line treatment, although a growing trend toward endovascular management of visceral artery aneurysms has emerged because of the high efficacy and low invasiveness that has been demonstrated by several authors. Treatment of wide-necked aneurysms and, depending on location, those at renal artery bifurcations or distal branches is more complex and may require invasive surgical techniques, such as bench surgery.

- **Case presentation**: We describe the successful use of a new neurointerventional coil to treat an enlarging wide-necked segmental-branch renal aneurysm in an elderly woman who was not a candidate for surgery because of several comorbidities.

- **Conclusions**: The technique described allowed safe, successful treatment of a wide-necked aneurysm in an unfavorable vascular territory, reducing the risk of downstream artery embolization and consequent parenchymal damage and decreased renal function. In similar cases, other endovascular devices have often proven to be ineffective at nephron sparing. To validate the safety and efficacy of this system, more cases treated in this manner should be studied.

### Renal artery aneurysm: Improved renal function after coil embolization [^113sogE9]. Journal of Endovascular Therapy (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study is to describe a case of improved renal function and renovascular hypertension following the percutaneous treatment of a renal artery aneurysm.

- **Case report**: A 72-year-old hypertensive woman with a hilar saccular aneurysm of the right renal artery underwent percutaneous coil embolization under local anesthesia. Four individual, soft, detachable platinum embolization coils were successfully inserted in the aneurysm with incomplete aneurysm exclusion; nonetheless, the patient's blood pressure and renal function returned to normal. The arteriogram at 3 months demonstrated complete exclusion of the lesion and good renal perfusion. The patient remains normotensive with documented improved renal function at 18 months after treatment.

- **Conclusions**: Superselective coil embolization is an effective treatment for renal artery aneurysms that display proper morphological features. The long-term outcome of this less invasive therapy still must be assessed, but it appears plausible that embolotherapy of renal artery aneurysms can correct secondary hypertension and deteriorating renal function.

### Multimodal repair of renal artery aneurysm - 10-year single center experience [^115SEa75]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is a rare disease with various treatment options in indicated patients. In the survey, the 10-year experience in the treatment of RAAs using different endovascular and surgical treatments depending on RAA characteristics is discussed.

- **Methods**: All patients undergoing RAA treatment via endovascular or surgical approaches at our center between January 2010 and December 2020 were enrolled. Patient demographics and peri-operative and late results were collected from a prospectively maintained database.

- **Results**: Eleven patients with RAA underwent treatment as follows: four patients received an endovascular approach, four patients underwent in-situ RAA repair, and kidney autotransplantations were carried out in three patients. In all three treatment groups, the first therapeutic attempt was successful, and none of the patients underwent secondary intervention due to RAA. Kidney autotransplantation was associated with higher blood loss and a longer procedure time compared to the endovascular approach and in-situ repair. In-hospital postoperative complications were reported in five patients, including renal pole perfusion defect, renal artery thrombosis, and urinary tract infection. No acute kidney organ loss was observed, but one patient suffered from chronic kidney loss due to renal artery occlusion. In one patient undergoing autotransplantation, ureter anastomosis led to acute renal failure, necessitating surgical treatment with resection and reanastomosis of the ureter. Hypertension was not resolved after RAA repair in any patient.

### Robotic surgery for in situ renal artery aneurysm repair: Technical note and literature review about a mini-invasive alternative [^1176LuLp]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

A case report of classical surgical options for renal artery aneurysm (RAA) usually includes endovascular surgery or open repair, either using an in-situ or ex-situ approach. In this instance, a 45-year-old woman presenting with a 20-mm complex RAA with hilum location, not suitable for endovascular repair, was treated using a mini-invasive robotic approach. This procedure allowed for in-situ reconstruction in a completely mini-invasive manner employing the Da Vinci Xi robot (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA). The robotic system facilitated both surgical exposure and aneurysmectomy with patch closure. The clamping time was 38 minutes (warm ischemia), and the total operative time was 210 minutes.

- **Literature review**: A comprehensive literature review identified studies reporting a robotic approach for RAA. The primary outcomes of interest included surgical technique, total operative time, clamping time, blood loss, and postoperative renal function. Seven studies were identified, detailing a total of 20 RAAs. Most were treated via aneurysmorrhaphy (n = 9). Median total operative time varied between 228 and 300 minutes (range: 155–360 minutes), while median clamping time ranged between 26 and 44 minutes (range: 10–82 minutes). Median blood loss was between 100 and 150 mL (range: 25–650 mL). No alteration of renal function in the early postoperative period was reported.

The conclusion drawn is that in-situ RAA repair with a robotic approach is both feasible and safe. It should be considered as an alternative to open surgical repair when the endovascular technique is not an option.

### Robot-assisted laparoscopic reconstructed management of multiple aneurysms in renal artery primary bifurcations: A case report and literature review [^115r14y1]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is rare, and its incidence in the general population remains elusive. There have been few reports on the repair of multiple aneurysms conducted with the Da Vinci robot-assisted surgical platform (Intuitive Surgical Inc, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), especially for those located in renal artery primary bifurcations.

- **Case presentation**: We report our experience in the surgical management of two expanding right-sided RAAs in a 64-year-old man using a robot-assisted laparoscopic approach. Two aneurysms were located in renal artery primary bifurcations, with diameters of 1.8 and 1.2 cm. The aneurysms were resected, and the renal artery branch was reconstructed by in situ arteriorrhaphy. The operation lasted for 2 hours and 35 minutes, with a warm ischemia time of 26 minutes and an estimated blood loss of 150 ml. The hospital stay was 6 days. The computed tomography (CT) scan performed 2 months after the surgery showed resolution of the aneurysms. Additionally, split renal function indicated the preservation of right renal function in the follow-up period.

- **Conclusions**: The robot-assisted laparoscopic procedure is a safe and effective surgical technique, which may be considered as an alternative to open surgery for complex multiple RAAs in the future.

### Endovascular techniques for the treatment of renal artery aneurysms [^115uVw1b]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Our goal was to analyze the indications and limitations of the different percutaneous endovascular approaches reported for the treatment of renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) and to develop a scientific approach for optimum selection of treatment strategy of RAAs through analyzing our experience and reviewing available literature.

- **Methods**: This retrospective study was designed to evaluate the treatment and follow-up of 13 consecutive patients who presented with 13 RAAs by using a variety of endovascular interventional techniques. Different combinations of coil embolization, liquid embolization, stenting, and stent-graft exclusion were used in correlation with variable-specific aneurysm criteria.

- **Results**: All patients were successfully treated with no significant short- or long-term complications. Patients were followed for an average period of 43 months (range 13–103 months).

- **Conclusions**: Ten different determinants were found to affect our decision making: shape, size, neck, position of aneurysm on artery, branches arising, artery involved, condition of the artery, age, general condition of the patient, and renal function.

### Ex vivo repair and renal autotransplantation for complex renal artery aneurysms in a solitary kidney [^1159VMes]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Renal artery aneurysm (RAA) is a rare clinical entity with an incidence of 0.015–1%. Indications for interventional or surgical repair of RAAs include expanding aneurysms, diameter greater than 2.5 cm, intractable renovascular hypertension, dissecting RAA, hematuria, and renal infarction after distal embolization. Interventional insertion of a stent graft, as well as aortorenal bypass implantation, are both low-risk procedures in simple aneurysms of the proximal renal artery. However, complex distal renal aneurysms involving several renal artery branches require not only an excellent result of vascular reconstruction, but also a surgical technique offering maximal protection for the kidney during the ischemic period. We present a case of a solitary kidney with two consecutive RAAs of segmental renal artery branches, classified as type 2 RAA. A surgical strategy, including renal explantation, ex vivo renal preservation, ex vivo reconstruction of the renal artery, and renal heterotopic autotransplantation, was successfully applied. The technique of ex vivo repair is a safe and effective surgical procedure in this clinical setting.

### Endovascular intervention in renovascular disease: A pictorial review [^116NK111]. Insights into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

- **Table 1: Renal artery aneurysm classification and management**
	- Bare metal stent (BMS) is considered in comparison to aneurysm diameter. Complications of the endovascular intervention in renal artery aneurysm (RAA) include non-target embolization, which can potentially result in renal failure or loss secondary to infarction, worsening hypertension, stent thrombus, infection, and radiation skin burns. Available short-term data have demonstrated promising findings with respect to safety, successful aneurysm exclusion, and improvement in hypertension and renal dysfunction. Unfortunately, studies analyzing the long-term efficacy of endovascular RAA intervention are currently lacking.

### Management of complex symptomatic renal artery aneurysm in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus [^1171FiEY]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis concluded that endovascular methods were associated with higher rates of reintervention, but other visceral aneurysms were also included. Based on the complex morphology of our presented case of RAA, simple ligation would lead to a possible loss of renal parenchyma and subsequently compromise the renal function of the patient, who already necessitated four medications for blood pressure management. Additionally, the patient was in his 70s, so reconstruction or autotransplantation was not deemed appropriate. The decision to proceed with an endovascular approach was straightforward. However, embolisation or placing a covered stent graft would also lead to occlusion of these vital branches and subsequently to possible kidney function deterioration. An attempt to preserve the RAA branches involved was decided via the use of a flow diverter.

Although the C-Guard stent has been approved in Europe since 2015 for the treatment of carotid artery disease, its innovative dual-layer design has the potential to manage complex arterial aneurysms. We employed the C-Guard stent, characterised by its open-cell structure wrapped in MicroNet mesh, to restrict blood flow and pressure into the aneurysmal sac, thereby promoting thrombosis while ensuring continued perfusion through the parent artery and aneurysm side branches.

The outcomes achieved in our patient align with our previous clinical experiences with RAAs, where a flow-modulating stent led to both symptom relief and functional improvement, offering a less invasive alternative to traditional surgery.

### Aneurysms of the renal artery [^112md7Xj]. Seminars in Vascular Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Increasing utilization of diagnostic imaging studies has provided new insights into our knowledge of visceral artery aneurysms. Because many are "silent", the true incidence and natural history of these nonaortic arterial aneurysms are only recently being understood. Historical data suggest that renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) occur in approximately 0.1% of the general population. Recognized complications associated with RAAs include renovascular hypertension, renal artery thrombosis, infarction from distal embolization, arteriovenous fistula formation, and, most importantly, rupture. Unfortunately, continued controversy surrounds the indications for and mode of treating RAAs. This article aims to illuminate contemporary management options in light of advances in percutaneous endoluminal interventions.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^112fRuTp]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Our case report demonstrates a patient who presented with an incidental finding of a renal artery aneurysm (RAA) during workup for a renal mass. Although the renal lesion was initially diagnosed as a renal artery pseudoaneurysm (RAP) by Doppler ultrasonography, the subsequent angiography study revealed that the patient had a true aneurysm. RAAs are a rare phenomenon, with an overall incidence of 0.09% within the general population. They can be classified into three different forms: type 1 consists of saccular aneurysms arising from the main renal artery or a large segmental branch; type 2 includes fusiform aneurysms; and type 3 includes intralobar artery aneurysms. Our patient presented with a saccular type aneurysm, which accounts for about 94% of all aneurysms.

RAAs typically present without symptoms, but as they grow in size, they can lead to pain, hematuria, and hypertension due to compression of the renal parenchyma. Additionally, RAAs typically present after 60 years of age, are more commonly seen in females than males, are associated with hypertension, and are predominantly found on the right side when presenting as a unilateral lesion. RAAs can be diagnosed on physical exam as a pulsatile mass in the region of the renal hilum or when heard as a bruit on auscultation. However, these exam findings are rare, and RAAs are more commonly found incidentally on imaging. Our patient was initially diagnosed with a pseudoaneurysm given the presence of a "yin-yang sign" on Doppler sonography, which is depicted by the swirling motion pattern of arterial blood flow in a cystic structure.

### Renal artery aneurysms: A 35-year clinical experience with 252 aneurysms in 168 patients [^112py34J]. Annals of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

To define the relevance of treating renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) surgically, a retrospective review was conducted on 168 patients (107 women, 61 men) with 252 RAAs over 35 years at the University of Michigan Hospital. Aneurysms were solitary in 115 patients and multiple in 53 patients. Bilateral RAAs occurred in 32 patients. Associated diseases included hypertension (73%), renal artery fibrodysplasia (34%), systemic atherosclerosis (25%), and extrarenal aneurysms (6.5%). Most RAAs were saccular (79%) and noncalcified (63%). The main renal artery bifurcation was the most common site of aneurysms (60%). RAAs were often asymptomatic (55%), with a diagnosis made most often during arteriographic study for suspected renovascular hypertension (42%).

- **Methods**: Surgery was performed in 121 patients (average RAA size 1.5 cm), including 14 patients undergoing unilateral repair with contralateral RAA observation. The remaining 47 patients (average RAA size 1.3 cm) were not treated surgically. Operations included aneurysmectomy and angioplastic renal artery closure or segmental renal artery reimplantation, aneurysmectomy and renal artery bypass, and planned nephrectomy for unreconstructable renal arteries or advanced parenchymal disease. Eight patients underwent unplanned nephrectomy, being considered a technical failure of surgical therapy.

### CIRSE standards of practice for the endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms [^114YAdTP]. Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms is an effective, minimally invasive procedure that has been successfully used since the early 1990s. Refined and expanded techniques and tools now offer excellent outcomes. Due to increased detection of such lesions in recent years, many of which are asymptomatic, revision of the indications for intervention and the correct endovascular treatment approaches has become essential.

- **Purpose**: This document presumes that the indication for treatment is clear and approved by the multidisciplinary team. It will define the standards required for the performance of each intervention, as well as their relative advantages and limitations. CIRSE Standards of Practice documents are not intended to impose a standard of clinical patient care but recommend a reasonable approach and best practices for performing endovascular treatment of visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms.

- **Methods**: The writing group was established by the CIRSE Standards of Practice Committee and consisted of five clinicians with internationally recognized expertise in endovascular treatments. The writing group reviewed the existing literature on visceral and renal artery aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms, performing an evidence search using PubMed to identify publications in English related to human subjects from 1990 to 2022. The final recommendations were formulated through consensus.

- **Results**: Endovascular treatment has an established role in the successful management of these cases.

### Management of complex symptomatic renal artery aneurysm in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus [^117K6GcW]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Regarding indications for treatment, the guidelines suggest that aneurysms larger than 3 cm should be treated (the previous cut-off was 2 cm) but with a low level of evidence (recommendation level 2C); symptomatic or ruptured renal artery aneurysms (RAA) must be treated irrespective of their size (recommendation level 1B).

The patient's underlying systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) further complicated the clinical picture since the disease's associated systemic inflammation and autoimmunity-caused vasculopathy increased the risk of aneurysm rupture. SLE vasculitis could lead to the degradation of arterial muscular and elastic elements and subsequently lead to fibrosis or aneurysm formation. However, visceral vasculitis in SLE is a rare phenomenon; medium-sized aneurysms are usually found in cases of polyarteritis nodosa.

In previously documented cases of renal aneurysms in SLE patients, the autoimmune disease was in an active status, which could suggest that active vessel wall inflammation could be present. In our patient, no recent flare-up of the disease was documented; however, he has received intermittent treatment with steroids for several years since his initial diagnosis.

In a meta-analysis of 35 cases, Kurata et al. evaluated patient characteristics and possible pathogenetic mechanisms for aortic aneurysm in SLE. The authors documented a positive correlation between steroid duration and 10-year and 20-year survival and between atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Although glucocorticoids can be pro-atherogenic, vascular injury in SLE is more likely to result from disease-specific etiologies, as well as traditional risk factors.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^113hDL6q]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Our case report documents a unique case of an asymptomatic patient who presented for evaluation of a renal mass but was incidentally found to have a large renal artery aneurysm (RAA). An RAA is a rare clinical finding that can be managed with surveillance, open surgical reconstruction, or endovascular approaches. Given the size of the RAA and its risk for rupture, our patient underwent successful treatment with renal angioembolization and experienced minimal adverse effects following treatment. Although our patient initially presented for oncologic workup due to initial imaging findings, additional testing with Doppler ultrasound elucidated the presence of a renal aneurysm, which allowed the patient to be directed to the proper therapy. In addition to reviewing the etiology, presentation, and management of both RAAs and renal artery pseudoaneurysms (RAPs), we also aim to use our case to highlight the importance of utilizing multiple imaging modalities for the workup of renal masses.

### Endovascular management of a large renal artery aneurysm: A case report and review of the literature [^116ds6HU]. BMC Urology (2021). Low credibility.

A renal artery aneurysm is a rare clinical presentation that can be found incidentally on imaging or during workup for refractory hypertension. Its presentation can be similar to that of a renal artery pseudoaneurysm, but the etiologies of the two vascular lesions differ. We present a patient who had an incidental finding of a large renal artery aneurysm that was managed with endovascular embolization. We also describe the literature surrounding the etiology, presentation, and management of both renal artery aneurysms and renal artery pseudoaneurysms.

- **Case presentation**: A 62-year-old man was referred to a urologic oncologist for workup of a newly found renal mass. Initial imaging with computed tomography showed a homogenous, well-circumscribed mass arising from the right kidney. Further evaluation with Doppler ultrasonography demonstrated pulsatile flow within the renal mass that was concerning for a renal artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient initially underwent a diagnostic angiogram by interventional radiology and was found to have a true renal artery aneurysm. Interventional radiology considered placement of a covered stent or angioembolization, but treatment was deferred due to concern for compromising the patient's renal function. The patient was subsequently transferred to a neighboring hospital for management by vascular surgery. After considering both open surgical and endovascular approaches, the patient ultimately underwent angioembolization of the renal artery aneurysm. Short-term follow-up showed successful exclusion of the aneurysm with minimal adverse effects.

### Successful repair of transplant renal artery aneurysm (TRAA) [^1169VXY9]. BMC Urology (2023). High credibility.

Renal transplantation is the definitive treatment for end-stage renal failure. Vascular complications, although rare, can potentially lead to allograft loss. Anastomotic renal artery aneurysms are often iatrogenic. Transplant renal artery aneurysm (TRAA), when detected in renal grafts, is often resected at the back-table before grafting. However, TRAA that develops de novo post-transplantation poses a unique challenge in management.
