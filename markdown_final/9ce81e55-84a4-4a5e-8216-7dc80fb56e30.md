## Question

Does a high coronary artery calcium (CAC) score indicate that a patient has coronary artery disease (CAD)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a high coronary artery calcium (CAC) score means the patient has coronary artery disease (CAD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the CAC score actually measures and its pathophysiologic meaning. Then, I should assess how CAC relates to total plaque burden and obstructive disease. Next, I will review prognostic implications of "high" CAC thresholds and the counterpoint of CAC = 0. After that, I must check guideline-endorsed uses of CAC for risk stratification and treatment allocation. Finally, I will consider key limitations, including non-calcified plaque, statin effects on calcification, and plaque location, before summarizing a clinically actionable answer.

> Let me first confirm what CAC quantifies and whether calcium implies atherosclerosis. CAC is derived from non-contrast, ECG-gated CT using the Agatston method, summing calcified plaque area and density across coronary arteries; any CAC > 0 indicates coronary atherosclerosis, as calcium is almost exclusively present in atherosclerotic, not normal, coronary walls [^111CH6Mg] [^114KprZm] [^112NgB7R].

> I need to verify how CAC relates to overall plaque burden and the presence of obstructive lesions. CAC correlates with total atherosclerotic plaque (calcified plus non-calcified) and shows a graded relationship with the prevalence and severity of obstructive CAD; diagnostic performance improves with higher CAC thresholds, though CAC alone is less accurate than coronary CT angiography for detecting stenosis, particularly at intermediate ranges [^113zdevv] [^1178i5fo].

> Next, I should review the prognostic meaning of "high" CAC. Hold on, thresholds vary across studies; commonly CAC ≥ 100 signals substantial disease and CAC ≥ 300–400 denotes high risk, with very high scores (≥ 1000) portending marked event rates and mortality; over 15 years, mortality rises from about 3% with CAC = 0 to roughly 28% with CAC ≥ 1000, and individuals with very high CAC have cardiovascular risk comparable to those with prior events, warranting intensive prevention [^117C9X7G] [^112TZXrB] [^116rF4pb].

> But wait, what about a CAC of zero; does that exclude CAD. At first glance, I might say "yes", but I should double-check because CAC detects calcified — not soft — plaque. Indeed, CAC = 0 carries a very high negative predictive value for obstructive CAD across ages and settings, yet obstructive disease can still be present — more often in younger or symptomatic patients where non-calcified plaque predominates — so a zero score does not absolutely rule out CAD, especially when symptoms or high-risk features are present [^112DFL6U] [^111CppcY] [^114A8Z3f].

> I will now examine how guidelines advise using CAC to guide prevention. The 2018–2021 multisociety guidance endorses CAC to reclassify borderline–intermediate risk adults when statin decisions are uncertain: consider deferring statins when CAC = 0 (except in diabetes, severe hypercholesterolemia, or strong family history), consider statins when CAC 1–99 (context-dependent), and recommend statins when CAC ≥ 100, with CAC ≥ 300 typically prompting high-intensity therapy; the 2024 ESC guidance further supports CAC for reclassification around testing and treatment thresholds and to refine pretest likelihood in chronic coronary syndromes [^113xX2Fc] [^1132LUMg] [^116uL4Rx]. I should confirm ancillary decisions: aspirin for primary prevention may be considered when CAC ≥ 100 if bleeding risk is low, and generally avoided when CAC = 0 due to net harm, which aligns with MESA-derived inferences and contemporary analyses [^113LHp9Q].

> Hold on, I need to ensure important nuances are not missed. CAC only captures calcified plaque and can underestimate disease in patients with largely non-calcified plaque; statins may increase calcification and density while reducing risk, modifying the relationship between CAC composition and outcomes; and disease location matters — left main calcification independently augments mortality risk beyond the total Agatston score, so distribution can refine risk further [^113zdevv] [^1115UWtN] [^1134nuDA] [^11667xAV].

> Let me reconsider diagnostic versus prognostic use so I do not conflate them. CAC is primarily a measure of atherosclerotic burden and a prognostic tool, not a direct test for flow-limiting stenosis; in symptomatic patients or when clinical suspicion for obstructive CAD is high, anatomic or functional testing (for example, CCTA or stress imaging) remains appropriate, with ESC 2024 endorsing CAC derived from attenuation correction CT to complement PET/SPECT in selected patients and to refine clinical likelihood categories [^115sRxz1] [^116uL4Rx] [^112TZXrB].

> Putting this together, I should state the answer clearly while preserving the caveats. Yes — a high CAC score indicates the presence of coronary atherosclerosis, which by definition is coronary artery disease; higher CAC reflects greater plaque burden and confers higher risk of events and mortality, with thresholds such as CAC ≥ 100 and especially ≥ 300–400 identifying patients who merit intensive preventive therapy, while CAC ≥ 1000 signals very high near-term risk; however, CAC does not assess luminal ischemia directly, CAC = 0 does not absolutely exclude CAD (particularly non-calcified plaque in younger or symptomatic patients), and clinical context should drive further testing and treatment decisions [^114KprZm] [^112TZXrB] [^117C9X7G] [^112DFL6U] [^111CppcY] [^116rF4pb].

---

Yes, elevated coronary artery calcium (CAC) indicates coronary atherosclerosis and therefore **confirms CAD** [^112TZXrB]. However, CAC does not specify stenosis severity or ischemia; thus, **further testing** (such as CCTA or functional imaging) [^113zdevv] is needed to assess obstructive disease [^112DFL6U] and guide management [^1178i5fo] [^115sRxz1].

---

## Pathophysiological basis of CAC and CAD

CAC reflects calcified atherosclerotic plaque — a hallmark of CAD — and is **almost exclusively** found in atherosclerotic arteries [^111CH6Mg] [^112bW6Qt]. Calcification occurs as plaques mature; therefore, CAC is a **direct marker** of coronary atherosclerosis [^113zdevv] [^112TZXrB].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated CAC scores

Elevated CAC correlates with higher total plaque burden and increased risk of CAD events, showing a **graded risk** relationship by score [^117C9X7G] [^112TZXrB]. Typical risk categories:

- **CAC 1–99**: Mild atherosclerosis; modestly increased risk [^113xX2Fc].
- **CAC 100–399**: Moderate atherosclerosis; significantly increased risk [^1132LUMg].
- **CAC ≥ 400**: Severe atherosclerosis; high risk of obstructive CAD and events [^116rF4pb].

---

## Diagnostic accuracy of CAC for CAD

CAC is a **highly specific** marker of coronary atherosclerosis, though it does not quantify stenosis severity or ischemia [^111CH6Mg] [^1178i5fo]. Key points:

- **Specificity**: High for atherosclerosis; calcification is rarely present without CAD [^112NgB7R].
- **Sensitivity**: Limited for obstructive CAD; noncalcified plaques can cause significant stenosis [^114A8Z3f].
- **Negative predictive value**: High; CAC = 0 strongly suggests low short-term risk, but does not exclude noncalcified plaque [^112xmfTc] [^111CppcY].

---

## Limitations of CAC scoring

CAC scoring has important limitations: it can **miss noncalcified plaques**, which may be obstructive or rupture-prone [^114A8Z3f], and it **does not quantify luminal narrowing or ischemia** [^1178i5fo]. Calcification can also occur without significant stenosis, particularly in older adults [^112TZXrB].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines endorse CAC to refine risk and guide prevention but emphasize that **additional testing** is needed to define obstructive disease and ischemia [^1132LUMg] [^115sRxz1]. The **ACC/AHA 2018** guidelines advise using CAC to refine risk and guide statin decisions in intermediate-risk adults [^113zdevv] [^114KprZm], and the **ESC 2024** guidelines recommend using CAC to improve risk classification and inform treatment decisions [^116uL4Rx] [^114U1Ct6].

---

## Clinical management implications

Elevated CAC warrants **aggressive risk reduction** (lifestyle, statins, blood pressure control) and further testing to define obstructive disease and ischemia [^116rF4pb] [^112TZXrB]:

- **CAC 1–99**: Lifestyle and consider statins based on risk [^113xX2Fc].
- **CAC 100–399**: Initiate statins; consider further testing if symptomatic [^1132LUMg].
- **CAC ≥ 400**: High-intensity statins; consider CCTA or functional testing to assess obstruction and ischemia [^116rF4pb] [^115sRxz1].

---

## Conclusion

Elevated CAC confirms coronary atherosclerosis and therefore **indicates CAD** [^112TZXrB], but it does not define stenosis severity or ischemia. Additional testing (CCTA or functional imaging) is required to assess obstructive disease and guide management [^115sRxz1] [^1178i5fo].

### Coronary calcium score and computed tomography coronary angiography in high-risk asymptomatic subjects: Assessment of diagnostic accuracy and prevalence of non-obstructive coronary artery disease [^1178i5fo]. European Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to compare the coronary artery calcium score (CACS) and computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) for assessing non-obstructive/obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in high-risk asymptomatic subjects.

Two hundred and thirteen consecutive asymptomatic subjects (113 male; mean age 53.6 ± 12.4 years) with more than one risk factor and inconclusive or unfeasible non-invasive stress test results underwent CACS and CTCA in an outpatient setting. All patients underwent conventional coronary angiography (CAG). Data from CACS (threshold for positive image: Agatston score 1/100/1,000) and CTCA were compared with CAG regarding the degree of CAD (non-obstructive/obstructive; ≥ 50% lumen reduction).

The mean calcium score was 151 ± 403, and the prevalence of obstructive CAD was 17% (8% one-vessel and 10% two-vessel disease).

Per-patient sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values:

- **CACS (Agatston ≥ 1)**: 97%, 75%, 45%, 100%
- **CACS (Agatston ≥ 100)**: 73%, 90%, 60%, 94%
- **CACS (Agatston ≥ 1,000)**: 30%, 98%, 79%, 87%
- **CTCA**: 100%, 98%, 97%, 100% (p < 0.05)

Prevalence of CAD detected:

- **CTCA**: 65% prevalence of all CAD (48% non-obstructive)
- **CACS**: 37% prevalence of all CAD (21% non-obstructive) (p < 0.05)

CACS proved inadequate for detecting obstructive and non-obstructive CAD compared with CTCA. CTCA has a high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of both non-obstructive and obstructive CAD.

### Incremental prognostic value of coronary artery calcium score versus CT angiography among symptomatic patients without known coronary artery disease [^112DFL6U]. Atherosclerosis (2014). Low credibility.

To evaluate the prognostic value and test characteristics of the coronary artery calcium (CAC) score for the identification of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), a retrospective cohort study was conducted at two large hospitals involving all symptomatic patients without prior CAD who underwent both coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and CAC. The accuracy of CAC for identifying ≥ 50% and ≥ 70% stenosis by CCTA was evaluated. The prognostic values of CAC and CCTA were compared for the prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, late coronary revascularization (> 90 days), and unstable angina requiring hospitalization.

Among 1145 included patients, the mean age was 55 ± 12 years, with a median follow-up of 2.4 (interquartile range: 1.5–3.5) years. Of the CCTA results, 406 (35%) were normal, 454 (40%) showed < 50% stenosis, and 285 (25%) revealed ≥ 50% stenosis. The prevalence of ≥ 70% stenosis was 16%. Among 483 (42%) patients with a CAC score of zero, 395 (82%) had normal CCTA results, 81 (17%) had < 50% stenosis, and 7 (1.5%) had ≥ 50% stenosis, with only 2 (0.4%) showing ≥ 70% stenosis.

For diagnosing ≥ 50% stenosis, CAC had a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 55%. The negative predictive value (NPV) for CAC was 99% for ≥ 50% stenosis and 99.6% for ≥ 70% stenosis by CCTA. There were no adverse events among the 7 patients with a zero calcium score and ≥ 50% CAD. For predicting MACE, the c-statistic for clinical risk factors increased from 0.62 to 0.73 (p < 0.001) with CAC and reached 0.77 (p = …).

Assessment of ASCVD risk using CAC

CAC measurements improve and refine risk assessment in patients without clinical ASCVD, which are part of the primary prevention population. In fact, CAC has been shown to be a better predictor of incident ASCVD than lipid levels or traditional risk estimators. Initially, coronary plaque is predominantly non-calcified and at higher risk for rupture, eventually becoming more calcified over time. CAC scans recognize and account for only calcified plaque. Despite this, CAC directly correlates with the total atherosclerotic plaque burden.

A recent paper further explored the connection between CAC scores and the degree of calcified and non-calcified coronary atherosclerosis. Hollenberg and colleagues found that among symptomatic patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) in the Progression of Atherosclerotic Plaque Determined by Computed Tomographic Angiography Imaging (PARADIGM) registry, the degree of obstructive CAD (≥ 50% stenosis), as measured on coronary CT angiography (cCTA), correlated directly with CAC scores. On the mean 3.8-year follow-up imaging, the proportion of plaque burden that was calcified increased in patients with baseline CAC > 100. Moreover, in subjects with CAC scores of ≥ 400, there was disproportional growth in the calcified plaque with a volumetric increase 16 times that of non-calcified plaque.

Ultimately, coronary plaque burden does confer an increased risk for adverse cardiac outcomes. A CAC score of 0 has a strong negative predictive value for clinical cardiovascular events and death in primary prevention populations over the next few years.

### Race/ethnicity and the prognostic implications of coronary artery calcium for all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality: The Coronary Artery Calcium Consortium [^111qTs2F]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

All participants had risk factor and laboratory data collected as part of their routine clinic visit and/or at the time of the CAC scans.

- **Measurement and definition of risk factors**: Hypertension was defined based on a prior diagnosis of hypertension or treatment with antihypertensive therapy. Blood pressure taken at the time of CAC scans was not used to override a clinical diagnosis of hypertension. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a prior diagnosis of diabetes mellitus or treatment with antidiabetic medications. Dyslipidemia was characterized by a prior diagnosis of dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides and/or low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), treatment with any lipid-lowering drugs, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol > 160 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 150 mg/dL. Smoking status was determined based on cigarette smoking status (Yes/No). A family history of CHD was mostly determined by the presence of a first-degree relative with a history of CHD. A more stringent definition of premature family history (< 55 years in a male or < 65 years in a female relative) was applied in the Columbus, OH site. In cases where individuals had partially missing risk factor data, multiple imputation was employed. A validation of the imputation approach has been previously reported.

The 10-year risk of ASCVD was calculated according to the Pooled Cohort Equations.

- **Computed tomography data**: Noncontrast cardiac-gated computed tomography scans were performed at individual sites.

### Interpreting the coronary artery calcium score - Critical information for the practicing physician [^116rF4pb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium scanning is a routine test for assessing the severity of atherosclerosis in asymptomatic individuals. This inexpensive, noninvasive test quantifies the calcium deposition in the four principal coronary arteries. Correct interpretation is important for both physicians (for recommending therapy) and patients (for determining their lifetime risk of a cardiovascular event). A score of 0 indicates that a cardiovascular event is extremely unlikely in the next five years. In contrast, a score greater than 0 portends a coronary event; the higher the score, the greater the risk. Both the arterial location of the calcium and the number of coronary arteries involved alter the interpretation of the calcium score. At any given age, females have significantly lower scores than males. One-third of individuals with scores greater than 1000 will have a cardiovascular event within three years. For all elevated calcium scores, aggressive treatment is warranted, including significant lifestyle changes and medications to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Understanding the importance of the coronary artery calcium score will result in improved therapy and patient compliance.

### Coronary calcium scoring for long-term mortality prediction in patients with and without a family history of coronary disease [^114VN89D]. Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Minimal data are available regarding the long-term mortality risk of subclinical atherosclerosis using coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring among patients with a family history (FH) of coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of the present analysis was to assess the prognostic utility of CAC scoring among cohorts of young and older patients with and without an FH of CAD.

A total of 9,715 consecutive asymptomatic patients, free of known CAD, underwent CAC scoring for cardiovascular risk assessment. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, with a median follow-up of 14.6 years. Unadjusted and risk-factor adjusted Cox proportional hazard modeling was employed. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC) from receiver operating characteristics analysis.

Fifteen-year all-cause mortality rates ranged from 4.7% to 25.0% for FH patients and from 5.0% to 38.0% for non-FH patients with CAC scores of 0 to > 400. For patients aged ≥ 60 years with an FH of CAD, there was a significant improvement in the AUC with CAC over CAD risk factors (AUC: 0.539 vs 0.725, p < 0.001). No such improvement was observed in FH patients aged < 60 years (AUC: 0.636 vs 0.626, p = 0.67).

CAC effectively stratified the mortality risk of patients with and without FH of CAD. However, for younger and lower-risk FH cohorts, CAC screening did not provide additive prognostic information beyond that of the traditional cardiac risk factors.

### Calcium scoring: A personalized probability assessment predicts the need for additional or alternative testing to coronary CT angiography [^114GoLmA]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

In conclusion, routine evaluation of coronary artery calcium scoring (CACS) before coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) may be advised as it significantly increases diagnostic accuracy to identify patients who will need further testing following coronary CTA. Deferring these patients to other diagnostic modalities might be beneficial, as coronary CTA does not lead to a final decision regarding coronary artery disease (CAD) management.

### Long-term prognosis after coronary artery calcium scoring among low-intermediate risk women and men [^1131MHGL]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular screening of women using traditional risk factors has been challenging, with results often classifying a majority of women as lower risk than men. The aim of this report was to determine the long-term prognosis of asymptomatic women and men classified at low-intermediate risk undergoing screening with coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring.

- **Methods and results**: A total of 2,363 asymptomatic women and men with traditional risk factors aggregating into a low-intermediate Framingham risk score (6%-9.9%; 10-year predicted risk) underwent CAC scanning. Individuals were followed up for a median of 14.6 years. We estimated all-cause mortality using Cox proportional hazards models; hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated. The area under the curve from a receiver operating characteristics curve analysis was calculated. There were 1,072 women who were older (55.6 years) when compared with the 1,291 men (46.7 years), and P10 had a higher mortality risk when compared with men.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings extend previous work on cardiovascular risk assessments, highlighting the potential differences in mortality risk predictions between genders.

### Prognostic utility of risk enhancers and coronary artery calcium score recommended in the 2018 ACC/AHA multisociety cholesterol treatment guidelines over the pooled cohort equation: Insights from 3 large prospective cohorts [^1132LUMg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

It is not surprising that CAC score and, to some extent, ABI were the strongest predictors of events, because they both represent subclinical markers of disease. This finding is consistent with a prior analysis of the utility of risk markers over the pooled cohort equation, which showed that CAC score, ABI, and family history of premature CVD independently predicted ASCVD events. However, only the CAC score showed a modest reclassification benefit when used alone.

The finding of the incremental value of CAC scoring is also in agreement with prior studies, where the presence of CAC has been shown to predict future ASCVD events and provide better incremental benefit when compared with selected traditional risk factors. Extending the findings from these prior studies, our analysis supports the reclassification value of CAC based on the new risk categories in the 2018 guideline.

Importantly, we also showed that the presence of ≥ 3 enhancers performed comparably to the CAC score for identifying participants with elevated risk. Although similar utility of combining multiple biomarker risk markers had been reported in the literature, our analysis is the first to evaluate the combination of the guideline-recommended risk enhancers. In our analysis, having ≥ 3 of the 6 risk enhancers we identified as being independently predictive (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥ 2 mg/L, apolipoprotein B ≥ 130 mg/dL, CKD, family history of premature CVD, Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL, and ABI < 0.9) is associated with a similar rate of events as a CAC score ≥ 100. Moreover, CAC scoring did not show meaningful incremental value over the PCE.

### Cardiovascular lifetime risk predicts incidence of coronary calcification in individuals with low short-term risk: the Dallas Heart Study [^115jwWTE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

The absence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in middle age is associated with very low short‐term risk for coronary events. However, the long‐term implications of a CAC score of 0 are uncertain, particularly among individuals with high cardiovascular lifetime risk. We sought to characterize the association between predicted lifetime risk and incident CAC among individuals with low short‐term risk.

- **Methods and results**: We included 754 Dallas Heart Study participants with serial CAC scans (6.9 years apart) and both low short‐term risk and baseline CAC = 0. Lifetime risk for cardiovascular disease was estimated according to risk factor burden. Among this group, 365 individuals (48.4%) were at low lifetime risk and 389 (51.6%) at high lifetime risk. High lifetime risk was associated with higher annualized CAC incidence (4.2% versus 2.7%; P < 0.001). Similarly, mean follow‐up CAC scores were higher among participants with high lifetime risk (7.8 versus 2.4 Agatston units). After adjustment for age, sex, and race, high lifetime risk remained independently associated with incident CAC (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.27; P = 0.01). When assessing risk factor burden at the follow‐up visit, 66.7% of CAC incidence observed in the low lifetime risk group occurred among individuals reclassified to a higher short‐ or long‐term risk category.

- **Conclusion**: Among individuals with low short‐term risk and CAC scores of 0, high lifetime risk is associated with a higher incidence of CAC. These findings highlight the importance of lifetime risk even among individuals with very low short‐term risk.

### Personalization of primary prevention: Exploring the role of coronary artery calcium and polygenic risk score in cardiovascular diseases [^1171nUaK]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Personalized healthcare is becoming increasingly popular given the vast heterogeneity in disease manifestation between individuals. Many commonly encountered diseases within cardiology are multifactorial in nature, and disease progression and response are often variable due to environmental and genetic factors influencing disease states. This makes accurate early identification and primary prevention difficult in certain populations, especially young patients with limited atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors.

Newer strategies, such as coronary artery calcium (CAC) scans and polygenic risk scores (PRS), are being implemented to aid in the detection of subclinical disease and heritable risk, respectively. Data surrounding CAC scans have shown promising results in their ability to detect subclinical atherosclerosis and predict the risk of future coronary events, especially at the extremes; however, predictive variability exists among different patient populations, limiting the test's specificity.

Furthermore, relying only on CAC scores and ASCVD risk scores may fail to identify a large group of patients needing primary prevention who lack subclinical disease and traditional risk factors but harbor genetic variabilities strongly associated with certain cardiovascular diseases. PRS can overcome these limitations. These scores can be measured in individuals as early as birth to identify genetic variants placing them at elevated risk for developing cardiovascular disease, irrespective of their cardiovascular health status. By applying PRS alongside CAC and other strategies, clinicians can enhance the effectiveness of primary prevention and tailor interventions to individual genetic profiles.

### The risk of death in patients with a high coronary calcification score: Does it include predialysis patients [^11279yLq]? Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

The high coronary artery calcification score (CACS), assessed by computed tomography, is related to mortality in asymptomatic patients with normal kidney function. However, the predictive value of CACS remains disputed in patients with end-stage renal disease and is unknown in patients with pre-terminal renal failure. Chiu and co-workers provide evidence that CACS is associated with mortality, even in patients with chronic kidney disease who are not yet on dialysis.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^114z8yVN]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Predictors of the presence and extent of coronary artery calcification: Age and sex were strong predictors of the presence of CAC in logistic regression models. There was no evidence that the effects of age were non-linear (i.e. J- or U-shaped) (p-value = 0.32 for a quadratic age term). Conventional CHD risk factors were also independent predictors of the presence of CAC (p < 0.001 in all cases). The logistic model with age, sex, and all CHD risk factors produced the most accurate model (C-statistic = 0.78). The Framingham 10-year CHD risk estimate was also a very strong predictor of coronary artery calcification, though the model containing the 10-year risk estimate as the only predictor was slightly less accurate (C-statistic = 0.74).

Among patients with non-zero CAC scores, age and sex remained strong predictors of the extent of coronary artery calcification, as measured by the Ln(CAC score). Again, the effects of age appeared to be linear (p = 0.16 for the quadratic age term). All conventional CHD risk factors remained statistically significant predictors of the extent of coronary artery calcification (p < 0.001 for all predictors except high cholesterol at p = 0.004). Again, the Framingham 10-year CHD risk estimate was a very strong predictor of the extent of calcification, though when used alone in a model, it explained somewhat less of the variance (R² = 0.11) than the full model (R² = 0.17).

### Role of coronary artery calcium score in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114KprZm]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

First developed in 1990, the Agatston coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an internationally guideline-endorsed decision aid for further risk assessment and personalized management in the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This review discusses key international studies that have informed this 30-year journey, from an initial coronary plaque screening paradigm to its role informing personalized shared decision-making.

Special attention is paid to the prognostic value of a CAC score of zero (the so-called "power of zero"), which, in a context of low estimated risk thresholds for the consideration of preventive therapy with statins in guidelines, may be used to de-risk individuals and thereby inform the safe delay or avoidance of certain preventive therapies. We also evaluate recommendations for CAC scoring in clinical practice guidelines around the world, and past and prevailing barriers to its use in routine patient care.

Finally, we discuss emerging approaches in this field, with a focus on the potential role of CAC in informing not only the personalized allocation of statins and aspirin in the general population but also other risk-reduction therapies in special populations, such as individuals with diabetes and those with severe hypercholesterolemia.

### Does coronary calcium scoring with a SCORE better predict significant coronary artery stenosis than without? Correlation with computed tomography coronary angiography [^113myRL3]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

To determine the effectiveness of coronary artery calcium score (CACS) alone and combined with Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) in adult patients for significant coronary artery stenosis by using computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) as the reference standard, two thousand twenty-one patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent CACS tests and CTCA. Patients were examined with dual-source CT and were grouped according to age, gender, CACS, and estimated SCORE risk. Coronary plaque existence and the degree of stenosis were assessed with CTCA. Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves were analyzed.

CACS was the single independent variable in estimating the relative risk of critical stenosis and had a superior outcome when compared with SCORE risk in logistic regression and ROC curve. The area under the ROC curve was greatest in the interval between 50–59 years. When SCORE was combined with CACS in patients with zero CACS, the percentage of significant stenosis increased from 1.4% to 7.0% in patients with high or very high SCORE risk and decreased to 0.9% in patients with low or moderate SCORE risk.

In conclusion, the combination of CACS with SCORE risk predicts coronary artery stenosis. When CACS is zero, CTCA can be performed in patients with high or very high SCORE risk.

### Prognostic value of coronary artery calcium score, area, and density among individuals on statin therapy vs. non-users: The coronary artery calcium consortium [^1134nuDA]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Low credibility.

Statins do not decrease coronary artery calcium (CAC) and may increase existing calcification or its density. Therefore, we examined the prognostic significance of CAC among statin users at the time of CAC scanning.

- **Methods**: We included 28,025 patients (6,151 statin-users) aged 40–75 years from the CAC Consortium. Cox regression models were used to assess the association of CAC with coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Models were adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors. Additionally, we examined the predictive performance of CAC components including CAC area, volume, and density using an age- and sex-adjusted Cox regression model.

- **Results**: Participants (mean age 53.9 ± 10.3 years, 65.0% male) were followed for a median of 11.2 years. There were 395 CVD and 182 CHD deaths. One unit increase in log CAC score was associated with an increased risk of CVD mortality (hazard ratio (HR), 1.2; 95% CI = 1.1–1.3) and CHD mortality (HR, 1.2; 95% CI = 1.1–1.4) among statin users. There was a small but significant negative interaction between CAC score and statin use for the prediction of CHD (p-value = 0.036) and CVD mortality (p-value = 0.025). The volume score and CAC area were similarly associated with outcomes in statin users and non-users. Density was associated with CVD and CHD mortality in statin-naïve patients, but with neither in statin users.

- **Conclusion**: CAC scoring retains robust risk prediction in statin users, and the changing relationship of CAC density with outcomes may explain the slightly weaker relationship of CAC.

### Improving cardiovascular disease prediction using automated coronary artery calcium scoring from existing chest CTS [^1125jUAR]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction models are widely used in modern medicine and are incorporated into prominent guidelines. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a marker of coronary atherosclerotic disease and has proven utility for predicting cardiovascular disease. Despite this, guidelines recommend against including CAC scores in CVD prediction models due to the medical and financial costs of acquiring it and the insufficient evidence concerning its ability to improve existing models. Modern machine learning models are capable of automatically extracting coronary calcium scores from existing chest computed tomography (CT) scans, negating these costs.

To determine whether the inclusion of CAC scores, automatically extracted using a machine learning algorithm from chest CTs performed for any reason, improves the performance of the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology 2013 pooled cohort equations (PCE), a retrospective cohort of patients with available chest CTs prior to an index date (2012) was used. The goal was to compare the performance of the PCE model and an augmented-PCE model which utilizes the CT-based CAC scores on top of the existing model. The PCE and the augmented-PCE predictions were calculated as of an index date (2012) using data from the electronic health record and existing chest CTs.

The performance of both models was evaluated by comparing their predictions to cardiovascular events that occurred during a 5-year follow-up period (until 2017). A total of 14,135 patients aged 40–79 years were included in the study, of whom 470 (3.3%) experienced cardiovascular events within the follow-up period.

### Influence of age on the diagnostic value of coronary artery calcium score for ruling out obstructive coronary disease in symptomatic patients [^111CppcY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Concerns have been raised about the added diagnostic value of a coronary artery calcium score (CACS) of 0 for reducing the likelihood of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in younger patients. Our study aimed to assess the influence of age on the value of CAC = 0 in symptomatic patients who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). We conducted a two-center retrospective study assessing symptomatic patients with suspected CAD who underwent CACS and CCTA. Pretest probability was calculated according to the Juarez-Orozco method, and obstructive CAD was defined as ≥ 50% luminal stenosis. The diagnostic likelihood ratios and negative predictive values were used to assess the diagnostic value of a CACS of 0 to rule out obstructive CAD.

A total of 2,043 patients (mean age 60 ± 11 years, 60% women, 48.5% CACS of 0) were analyzed. The pretest probability of obstructive CAD increased with age, whereas the proportion of patients with a CACS of 0 decreased with age. The added diagnostic value of a CACS of 0 was lower in younger patients, with negative likelihood ratios ranging from 0.36 for those under 50 years to 0.10 for those 70 years or older. However, the prevalence of obstructive CAD in patients with a CACS of 0 was low in all age groups. In a cohort of symptomatic patients who underwent CCTA for suspected CAD, the added diagnostic value of a CACS of 0 decreases significantly at younger ages. However, it is offset by their lower pretest probabilities, yielding high negative predictive values independently of age.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for coronary artery disease, specifically with respect to coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend measuring the CAC score from unenhanced chest CT imaging (used for attenuation correction) to improve detection of both non-obstructive and obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients selected for PET or SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging.

### Coronary artery calcium: Where do we stand after over 3 decades [^113xX2Fc]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

In 2018, cardiovascular society cholesterol guidelines recommended the use of coronary artery calcium to guide statin therapy in patients 40–79 years of age who are at intermediate risk by multiple risk factor equations (i.e. estimated 10-year risk for atherosclerotic disease of 7.5%-19.9% but in whom statin benefit is uncertain). Many such patients have no coronary calcium and remain at < 5% risk over the next decade; hence, statin therapy can be delayed until a repeat calcium scan is conducted. Exceptions include patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and a strong family history of atherosclerotic disease.

- **Coronary calcium equals 1–99 Agatston units**: The 10-year risk is borderline (5% to < 7.5%) and statin therapy is optional pending a repeat scan.
- **Coronary calcium equals 100–299 Agatston units**: The patient is clearly statin eligible (7.5% to < 20% 10-year risk).
- **Coronary calcium is ≥ 300 Agatston units**: A patient is at high risk and is a candidate for high-intensity statins.

Risk factor analysis combined judiciously with coronary calcium scanning offers the strongest evidence-based approach to the use of statins in primary prevention.

### Coronary artery calcium: From risk prediction to treatment allocation and clinical trials [^112TZXrB]. Heart (2023). High credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a direct measure of an individual's coronary atherosclerotic burden. Higher levels of CAC are strongly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, and individuals with very high CAC levels have a CVD risk similar to stable persons with a prior CVD event. Conversely, the absence of CAC (CAC = 0) is associated with a low long-term risk of CVD even among groups classified as high risk based on traditional risk factors.

The guideline-based role of CAC in the allocation of CVD prevention therapies has expanded to include both statin and non-statin medications. Beyond prevention therapies, it is now widely recognized that the total burden of atherosclerosis is a stronger risk factor for CVD than a sole focus on coronary stenosis.

Furthermore, evidence is accruing to support expanding the value of CAC = 0 among low-risk symptomatic patients given its very high negative predictive value for ruling out obstructive coronary artery disease. There is now an appreciation of the value of routine assessment of CAC on all non-gated chest CTs, and with the advent of artificial intelligence, automated interpretation is now possible. Additionally, CAC is now firmly established in randomized trials as a tool to identify high-risk patients most likely to benefit from pharmacotherapies.

Future studies incorporating measures of atherosclerosis beyond the Agatston score will lead to continued refinement of CAC scoring, further improvements in personalization of CVD risk prediction, and more individualized allocation of prevention therapies.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^116uL4Rx]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

For the classification and risk stratification of coronary artery disease, especially in relation to risk assessment of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering the obtaining of a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score. This helps in reclassifying patients and identifying more individuals with a very low (≤ 5%) CAC score-weighted clinical likelihood among those with a low (> 5–15%) pre-test likelihood of obstructive CAD.

### Calcium scoring: A personalized probability assessment predicts the need for additional or alternative testing to coronary CT angiography [^115wC3q6]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

One of the new recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology in 2019 is the endorsement of coronary CTA as an initial non-invasive test for those by whom clinical assessment alone is not enough to rule out obstructive CAD. These recommendations follow previous initiatives of the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence in the UK, where coronary CTA is recommended as the initial diagnostic test in stable chest pain patients. In compliance with the guidelines, it is prognosticated that a 700% increase in coronary CTA delivery is required in the UK alone. To decrease the burden on healthcare systems, identification of patients in whom coronary CTA does not lead to a final diagnostic decision may be needed, as these patients may benefit more from alternative tests.

- **Predictors of further testing of CAD**: Heart rate, presence of heart rhythm irregularity, type of chest pain, and coronary artery calcium were all significant independent predictors. From all these factors, coronary calcification was by far the most prominent predictor (OR = 33.83 for CACS 401–1000 and OR = 164.90 for those with CACS > 1000). These results were mainly driven by the ability of CACS to predict obstructive CAD, which needs further testing or intervention. As observed in our sub-analysis predicting non-diagnostic IQ, the model with simple anthropometric parameters had the same diagnostic accuracy as more complex models incorporating risk factors and CACS.

Coronary artery calcification has been reported to be an important predictor of significant coronary artery stenosis.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^112YLHAM]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Finally, our analysis provides a guide for how to use the CAC score as a surrogate outcome when studying causes of coronary artery disease, a widely used study design. The central problem with this approach is the fundamentally non-normal distribution of CAC scores, which makes parametric statistic testing, including both simple t-tests and multivariable linear regression, invalid. In dealing with this issue, some researchers have used the Ln(CAC score +1) as an outcome in linear regression analyses. This approach is not ideal, as the Ln(CAC score +1) is still grossly non-normal — there are too many zero scores. Adding 1 to the CAC score makes the log-transformation possible, yielding zeroes instead of negative infinity, but it does not solve the distributional problem and leads to predictions that misrepresent actual CAC score distributions (see Figure 2).

This observation has led others to present only non-parametric percentile data without multivariable modeling, but this approach does not allow adjustment for conventional CHD risk factors that we have shown are strong predictors of the CAC score. One other group used ordinal logistic regression analysis to analyze CAC scores categorized into four ordinal categories, or quartiles, in their study sample. While such an approach does allow multivariable modeling with ordinal logistic regression, it does not take full advantage of the continuous nature of the CAC score and may blur the important distinction between zero and non-zero scores. Our analysis suggests that a two-step approach, using first logistic regression, may be more effective in addressing these challenges.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^114omWdh]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

We considered three sets of predictors: 1) age and sex; 2) age, sex, hypertension, high cholesterol, smoking, and diabetes; and 3) the Framingham 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk estimate. We examined whether the effects of age were linear (as opposed to J-shaped, for example) by testing a quadratic term in the model containing only age and sex. We evaluated the ability of each logistic model to discriminate subjects at high and low risk for coronary artery calcium (CAC) using the C-statistic and estimated the proportion of variability in the extent of CAC explained in each linear regression model using the adjusted R-squared statistic.

We used coefficients, intercepts, and residual variance from logistic and linear models to estimate the probability that the CAC score of an individual with known risk factors would fall into each of four standard CAC score categories (0, 1–100, 101–400, and > 400). These probabilities were estimated using models containing the 10-year risk estimate as the only predictor, for a range of 10-year risk estimates. Additionally, we estimated these probabilities using models with all CHD risk factor predictors for the specific clinical scenario described in the introduction (a 60-year-old woman with hypertension and high cholesterol) as well as for several other scenarios. We compared the actual distribution of CAC scores among 58–62-year-old women with hypertension and high cholesterol in our sample (n = 130) with predictions from: 1) our two-stage model; 2) a one-stage model using Ln(CAC score + 1) as a continuous outcome in a linear regression model; and 3) a one-stage model using a censored normal.

### Risk factors for incident coronary artery calcium in younger (age 32 to 45 years) versus intermediate (46 to 64 years) versus older (65 to 84 years) persons [^116VAdKF]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2022). Low credibility.

The prognostic value of traditional atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors may decrease with age. We sought to determine whether the association between traditional ASCVD risk factors and incident coronary artery calcium (CAC) differs for younger versus older persons. We included 5,108 participants with a baseline CAC of 0. Repeat CAC scoring occurred over 3 to 11 years of follow-up. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association between traditional risk factors and incident CAC in young (32 to 45 years), middle-aged (46 to 64 years), and older adults (65 to 84 years). A total of 61% of the participants were women and 37% were Black. The proportion with incident CAC ranged from 22% among young adults, 34% for middle-aged adults, and 45% for older adults.

In young adults, traditional risk factors were significantly associated with incident CAC except for diastolic blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. In contrast, only total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio ≥ 3.5 (p = 0.04) was significantly associated with incident CAC in older persons. Non-HDL cholesterol (p = 0.02) was more strongly associated with incident CAC in young (hazard ratio [HR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09 to 1.31) and middle-aged (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.23) compared to older adults (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.23). When added to demographics, traditional risk factors provided a greater C-statistic improvement for incident CAC prediction in young (0.752, +0.070, p < 0.001) versus middle-aged (0.645, +0.054, p < 0.001) and older adults (0.597).

### Coronary artery calcium score-directed primary prevention with statins on the basis of the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Multisociety cholesterol guidelines [^116EEAiK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is a pivotal measure in assessing the risk of cardiovascular disease. When applied in line with the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, it aids in informing primary prevention strategies with statins. This approach offers a personalized assessment of cardiovascular risk and guides clinicians in determining the necessity of statin therapy. However, the interpretation and implementation of this method should be grounded in patient-specific contexts considering the latest research and clinical findings.

### Real-world evidence linking the predicting risk of cardiovascular disease events risk score and coronary artery calcium [^113WFxM6]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

When added to the PREVENT score, continuous CAC score improved discrimination of incident myocardial infarction. These results may be helpful in shaping future guidelines regarding the use of CCTA in routine clinical care. The US Preventative Task Force recommends against CAC assessment, while the European Society of Cardiology and the American Heart Association suggest its use in intermediate-risk scenarios, where the presence of CAC might suggest lipid-lowering therapy. Given the prevalence of clinically significant CAC in the PREVENT intermediate-risk group, this study supports the latter recommendations. High-risk groups are already recommended for treatment (and in our study had a high prevalence of CAC). Low-risk groups were least likely to have CAC (among those with PREVENT risk < 5%, 18% had CAC ≥ 1, and 6% had CAC ≥ 100).

The prevalence of CAC in low-risk groups may be even lower in the general population; our cohort represents a clinical referral population, likely enriched for risk factors such as family history and high lipoprotein (a). Other limitations include that data were abstracted solely from the electronic health record, the improvement in the c-statistic was relatively small and follow-up was limited, and noncalcified plaque was not assessed.

In summary, the 10-year risk estimates from PREVENT are accurate in discriminating not only incident CVD but also subclinical atherosclerosis in a real-world cohort of patients undergoing CCTA, providing face validity to the PREVENT scores in a novel setting.

### Real-world evidence linking the predicting risk of cardiovascular disease events risk score and coronary artery calcium [^114b5AnF]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). High credibility.

- **Patient characteristics**: Characteristics and coronary artery calcium (CAC) scores by predicted 10-year PREVENT cardiovascular disease risk score are detailed. Figures are represented as mean ± SD or n (%). CAC is represented as median (25th–75th percentile).

- **Violin plot**: A violin plot illustrates CAC scores by predicted 10-year PREVENT CVD risk score groups using a log scale.

- **Probability modeling**: The probability of Agatston score ≥ 1 and Agatston score > 100 is evaluated based on the PREVENT score, modeled as cubic splines.

- **Risk discrimination**: The risk discrimination of incident myocardial infarction using PREVENT alone, CAC alone, or both methods is analyzed. Overall, 485 events were recorded over a mean follow-up period of 1.2 years.

The tabled value (*20%* indicating P value for the difference in c-statistic from PREVENT only) was 101, suggesting a moderate ASCVD plaque burden with high CVD risk. This finding aligns well with the Cardiovascular–Kidney–Metabolic Syndrome staging system, which classifies obesity in conjunction with cardiovascular risk factors.

### The association between left main coronary artery calcium and cardiovascular-specific and total mortality: The Coronary Artery Calcium Consortium [^11667xAV]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Low credibility.

Left main (LM) coronary artery disease is associated with greater myocardial infarction-related mortality; however, coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring does not account for disease location. We explored whether LM CAC predicts excess mortality in asymptomatic adults.

- **Methods**: Cause-specific cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were studied in 28,147 asymptomatic patients with non-zero CAC scores in the CAC Consortium. Multivariate regression was performed to evaluate if the presence and burden of LM CAC predict mortality after adjustment for clinical risk factors and the Agatston CAC score. We further analyzed the per-unit hazard associated with LM CAC in comparison to CAC in other arteries.

- **Results**: The study population had a mean age of 58.3 ± 10 years and a CAC score of 301 ± 631. LM CAC was present in 21.7% of the cases. During 312,398 patient-years of follow-up, 1,907 deaths were observed. LM CAC was associated with an increased burden of clinical risk factors and total CAC and was independently predictive of increased hazard for all-cause (HR 1.2 [1.1, 1.3]) and cardiovascular disease death (HR 1.3 [1.1, 1.5]). The hazard for death increased proportionately to the percentage of CAC localized to the LM. On a per-100 Agatston unit basis, LM CAC was associated with a 6–9% incremental hazard for death beyond knowledge of CAC in other arteries.

- **Conclusions**: The presence and high burden of left main CAC are independently associated with a 20–30% greater hazard for cardiovascular and total mortality in asymptomatic adults, arguing that LM CAC should be considered in risk assessments.

### Coronary artery calcification and cardiovascular risk factors: Impact of the analytic approach [^1159iWvY]. Atherosclerosis (2004). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcification (CAC) may help identify novel risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis. However, analysis of CAC is challenging because of the distribution of CAC in the population, which has resulted in difficulty in interpreting and comparing results across studies.

We applied several analytic approaches to CAC data to determine the impact of analytic methods on the association with established cardiovascular risk factors in 914 asymptomatic subjects in the Study of Inherited Risk Factors for Coronary Atherosclerosis.

- **Multivariable analyses included**:
	- Linear regression of different transformations of CAC scores.
	- Tobit regression of the log of (CAC + 1).
	- Logistic regression using CAC zero as a cut-point.
	- Ordinal logistic regression using CAC categories.

Linear regression of the log CAC scores and logistic regression of CAC zero cut-point failed to detect associations with some risk factors. In contrast, linear and tobit regression of the log (CAC + 1) and ordinal regression of CAC categories identified more associations and provided consistent results. Commonly applied methods of CAC analysis may fail to detect associations with cardiovascular risk factors. We present analytic approaches that are likely to provide consistent results and recommend using at least two distinct multivariable methods.

### Coronary artery calcium as a synergistic tool for the age- and sex-specific risk of cardiovascular and cancer mortality: The Coronary Artery Calcium Consortium [^115uTeaK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

For individuals with elevated CAC scores, the results of our study demonstrate that younger men with even mildly elevated CAC scores are more likely to experience death from CVD than cancer, while for younger women aged 40 to 65 years, elevated CAC scores are less strongly associated with CVD mortality and more strongly associated with cancer mortality. In contrast, for older individuals aged > 65 years, our results show that while even men with relatively high CAC scores are less likely to die from CVD, women with only moderate CAC scores are more likely to suffer a fatal CVD event. Accordingly, maximal CVD prevention treatment strategies have a much higher likelihood of extending life and reducing CVD mortality among people with elevated CAC scores. Conversely, among individuals with CAC = 0, CVD preventive therapies are unlikely to reduce CVD mortality, and less strict CVD risk factor treatment goals can be considered in a shared decision-making process.

The results presented in this study should be considered with the following limitations:

- **Population limitations**: Most of the participants in the CAC Consortium are white, and we were therefore not able to examine whether there are ethnicity-based differences in the observed relationship.

- **Data limitations**: We did not have information on the prevalence of cancer at the time of the CAC scan, although it is unlikely that many patients with cancer had a clinically ordered CAC scan for CVD risk stratification.

- **Methodological limitations**: Limitations exist in the ascertainment of the cause of death by relying on the documentation provided by death certificates only.

### Long-term prognosis after coronary artery calcification testing in asymptomatic patients: A cohort study [^117C9X7G]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The extent of coronary artery calcification (CAC) and near-term adverse clinical outcomes are strongly related through 5 years of follow-up.

- **Objective**: To describe the ability of CAC scores to predict long-term mortality in persons without symptoms of coronary artery disease.

- **Design**: Observational cohort.

- **Setting**: Single-center, outpatient cardiology laboratory.

- **Patients**: 9715 asymptomatic patients.

- **Measurements**: Coronary artery calcification scoring and binary risk factor data were collected. The primary end point was time to all-cause mortality (median follow-up, 14.6 years). Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare survival distributions. The net reclassification improvement statistic was calculated.

- **Results**: In Cox models adjusted for risk factors for coronary artery disease, the CAC score was highly predictive of all-cause mortality (P < 0.001). Overall 15-year mortality rates ranged from 3% to 28% for CAC scores from 0 to 1000 or greater (P < 0.001). The relative hazard for all-cause mortality ranged from 1.68 for a CAC score of 1 to 10 (P < 0.001) to 6.26 for a score of 1000 or greater (P < 0.001). The categorical net reclassification improvement using cut points of less than 7.5% to 22.5% or greater was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.16 to 0.32).

- **Limitations**: Data collection was limited to a single center with generalizability limitations. Only binary risk factor data were available, and CAC was only measured once.

- **Conclusion**: The extent of CAC accurately predicts 15-year mortality in a large cohort of asymptomatic patients.

### Imaging cardiovascular calcification [^111CH6Mg]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) is the most established noninvasive tool to detect coronary artery calcium (CAC). It can provide a simple, rapid, and reliable quantification of macroscopic calcium and generate a clinical coronary artery calcium score (CACS). In the 1990s, quantification of CAC on non‐contrast-enhanced ECG-gated CT examination became recognized as an important noninvasive imaging technique for identifying coronary atherosclerosis.

CACS relies upon the high attenuation coefficient of calcium to detect calcified plaques. The standard method of scoring is the Agatston method, which considers total calcified area and maximum density of calcification (> 130 Hounsfield units [HU]) to provide a summed score of all calcified lesions. Although other methods of scoring have been used, the Agatston score remains the criterion standard because of its simplicity.

CACS provides quantification of the total coronary calcification burden and has become a useful clinical tool for risk stratification in asymptomatic patients with low‐to‐intermediate and intermediate risk of cardiovascular events. It predicts future cardiovascular risk beyond the traditional Framingham risk score alone. An elevated CACS may indicate an increased risk of cardiovascular events in some patients. Specifically, the Multi‐Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) with 6,722 patients followed for an average of 3.8 years showed that those with CACS > 300 have a nearly 10‐fold increased risk of coronary events across ethnic groups.

### Predictive values of coronary artery calcium and arterial stiffness for long-term cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary artery disease [^113LHp9Q]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Contrary to CAVI, the CAC score is more widely used, and studies support its use as a screening test to guide treatment in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Our findings support the hypothesis that adding a high CAC score (≥ 100) into the model, which contained only clinical risk factors, could increase the magnitude of MACE risk beyond that obtained from clinical risk factors alone. Similar to the MESA findings, participants with CAC scores ≥ 100 have more than a 4.2-fold higher risk for a CAD event and a 2.8-fold higher risk for a CVD event compared with those with a CAC score of 0. A CAC score ≥ 100 is also strongly associated, and in a graded fashion, with a 10-year risk of ASCVD (including stroke) above 7.5%. In the recent 2019 ACC/AHA guidelines on primary prevention of CVD, the CAC score was the only noninvasive test recommended to guide statin prescription in intermediate-risk patients with a CAC score ≥ 100.

The role of aspirin in the primary prevention of ASCVD is still controversial. Preliminary findings suggest that the CAC score may also help guide decisions for initiating (or deferring) antiplatelet therapy for primary prevention. Recently, the MESA researchers suggested that patients with CAC scores ≥ 100 may be good candidates for aspirin therapy for primary prevention, although the net benefit is expected to be modest. Importantly, in patients with a CAC score of zero, the risk of bleeding appears to be greater than the potential benefit, so aspirin therapy for primary prevention should be avoided.

The Clinical Research Roundtable at the Institute of Medicine has identified the translation of clinical research findings into improvements in medical care as the "next scientific frontier". While our analysis has some limitations, it provides methodology that will directly assist in the translation of research into practice. Our models, once validated, can be used directly by patients and clinicians to decide when it might be useful to order this potentially expensive test and what to do with the results.

### Association of coronary artery calcium in adults aged 32 to 46 years with incident coronary heart disease and death [^1169itjm]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD); however, prognostic data on CAC are limited in younger adults. This study aims to determine if CAC in adults aged 32 to 46 years is associated with incident clinical CHD, CVD, and all-cause mortality during 12.5 years of follow-up.

The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study is a prospective community-based study that recruited 5115 Black and White participants aged 18 to 30 years from March 25, 1985, to June 7, 1986. The cohort has been under surveillance for 30 years, with CAC measured 15 (n = 3043), 20 (n = 3141), and 25 (n = 3189) years after recruitment. The mean follow-up period for incident events was 12.5 years, from the year 15 computed tomographic scan through August 31, 2014.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Incident CHD included fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome without myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or CHD death. Incident CVD included CHD, stroke, heart failure, and peripheral arterial disease. Death included all causes. The probability of developing CAC by age 32 to 56 years was estimated using clinical risk factors measured 7 years apart between ages 18 and 38 years.

At year 15 of the study, among 3043 participants (mean [SD] age, 40.3 [3.6] years; 1383 men and 1660 women), 309 individuals (10.2%) had CAC, with a geometric mean Agatston score of 21.6 (interquartile range, 17.3–26.8). Participants were followed up for 12.5 years.

### Calcium scoring: A personalized probability assessment predicts the need for additional or alternative testing to coronary CT angiography [^115SquKY]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Factors contributing to the presence of significant stenosis, resulting in further testing following coronary CTA, were analyzed.

- **Anthropometric parameters**: Model 1 proved to be insufficient in the discrimination of those with obstructive coronary artery stenosis (AUC = 0.56 [0.54–0.58]).

- **Age, sex, and type of chest pain**: The addition of these factors (Model 2) resulted in significantly higher diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.74 [0.72–0.75]; p < 0.001). The score was 1000:326.75 (p < 0.001 for all).

Detailed results can be found in Supplementary Table 1.

### Coronary artery calcification in black women and white women [^111U4tLS]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Coronary calcification is a potent independent predictor of coronary risk. Sex-specific risk categories based on calcium scores have been established, but ethnic differences in coronary calcification have been little studied. This prospective cohort study compares coronary calcification, assessed by computed tomography, in postmenopausal black women and white women.

- **Methods and results**: Computed tomographic scans were performed on 128 black women and 733 white women without known coronary artery disease (mean age 63 ± 8 years). Although coronary risk factors were more prevalent among black women (P < 0.0001), total calcium scores were similar to those in white women. Using the Framingham algorithm, higher calcium scores were associated with a higher 10-year risk of myocardial infarction or coronary death. In multiple regression analysis, age was independently associated with higher calcium scores in both ethnic groups (P = 0.002 for black women, P < 0.0001 for white women). Diabetes mellitus and not exercising at least 3 times per week were independently associated with higher calcium scores in white women but not in black women. Educational level, body mass index, hormone replacement therapy, hysterectomy, dietary fat consumption, family history of premature coronary disease, hypertension, self-reported high cholesterol, and smoking were not independently associated with coronary calcium score in black women, white women, or the combined cohort; neither was ethnicity an independent predictor of coronary calcification.

The study objective was to evaluate the prognostic value and accuracy of a zero (normal) coronary artery calcium score (CACS) for identifying patients at an acceptable low risk for future cardiovascular events who might be safely discharged home from the emergency department (ED). The CACS is a well-established test for risk stratification in asymptomatic patients. Recent studies suggest that CACS may also accurately stratify stable patients presenting with acute chest pain to the ED, although many studies have been underpowered.

The methods involved searching multiple databases for longitudinal studies of CACS in symptomatic patients without known coronary artery disease, reporting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), including death and myocardial infarction. Pooled risk ratios, sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were analyzed.

Eight studies evaluated 3,556 patients, with a median follow-up of 10.5 months. The pooled prevalence of zero CACS was 60%. Patients with CACS = 0 had a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular events compared with those with CACS greater than 0: MACEs had a relative risk of 0.06 (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.11, I² = 0%); death/myocardial infarction had a relative risk of 0.19 (95% confidence interval 0.08 to 0.47, I² = 0%). The pooled event rates for CACS = 0 were MACEs at 0.8% per year and death/myocardial infarction at 0.5% per year, significantly lower than for CACS greater than 0, which had MACEs at 14.6% per year and death/myocardial infarction at 3.5% per year. Analysis of summary testing parameters showed a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of…

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^117BwzrY]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an independent predictor of coronary heart disease. We sought to combine information from the CAC score with conventional cardiac risk factors to produce post-test risk estimates and determine whether the score adds clinically useful information.

- **Methods**: We measured the independent cross-sectional associations between conventional cardiac risk factors and the CAC score among asymptomatic individuals referred for non-contrast electron beam computed tomography. Using the resulting multivariable models and published CAC score-specific relative risk estimates, we estimated post-test coronary heart disease risk in various scenarios.

- **Results**: Among 9,341 asymptomatic study participants (age 35–88 years, 40% female), we found that conventional coronary heart disease risk factors, including age, male sex, self-reported hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol, were independent predictors of the CAC score. We used the resulting multivariable models for predicting post-test risk in various scenarios. For example, our models predicted that a 60-year-old non-smoking, non-diabetic woman with hypertension and high cholesterol would have a 47% chance of having a CAC score of zero, reducing her 10-year risk estimate from 15% (per Framingham) to 6–9%. If her score were over 100 (a 17% chance), her risk estimate would be markedly higher (25–51% over 10 years). In low-risk scenarios, the CAC score is very likely to be zero or low, and unlikely to change management.

- **Conclusion**: Combining information from the CAC score with conventional risk factors provides valuable post-test risk estimates and may offer additional clinically useful information in managing coronary heart disease risk.

### Predictors of coronary artery calcium among 20–30-year-olds: The Coronary Artery Calcium Consortium [^115GNrCj]. Atherosclerosis (2020). Low credibility.

We sought to understand the risk factor correlates of very early coronary artery calcium (CAC) and the potential investigational value of CAC phenotyping in adults aged 20–30 years.

- **Methods**: We studied all participants aged 20–30 years at baseline (N = 373) in the Coronary Artery Calcium Consortium, a large multi-center cohort study of patients aged 18 years or older without known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) at baseline, referred for CAC scoring for clinical risk stratification. We described the prevalence of CAC in men and women, the frequency of risk factors by the presence of CAC (CAC = 0 vs CAC > 0), and assessed the association between traditional non-demographic CVD risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, family history of CHD, and diabetes) and prevalent CAC, using age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models.

- **Results**: The mean age of the study participants was 27.5 ± 2.4 years; 324 (86.9%) had CAC = 0, and 49 (13.1%) had CAC > 0. Among the 49 participants with CAC, 38 (77.6%) were men, and the median CAC score was low at 4.6. In age- and sex-adjusted models, there was a graded increase in the odds of CAC > 0 with an increasing traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor burden (p = 0.001 for linear trend). Participants with ≥ 3 traditional risk factors had a statistically significant higher odds of having prevalent CAC (OR 5.57, 95% CI; 1.82–17.03) compared to participants with no risk factors.

- **Conclusions**: Our study demonstrates the non-negligible prevalence of CAC among very high-risk young US adults.

### Predictors of coronary artery calcium and long-term risks of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke in young adults [^114u9diY]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

Multiple cardiovascular guidelines recommend the use of 10-year absolute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk estimates to guide treatment and the allocation of preventive therapies. Because these scores rely heavily on patient age, nearly all young adults (younger than 50 years) are estimated to have a low 10-year ASCVD risk, even those who have nonoptimal risk factors. Consequently, young adults often are not offered or do not adhere to preventive treatments despite the possibilities of subclinical atherosclerosis and elevated lifetime risk. The need for a clinical decision-making tool that identifies younger individuals at elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk has led to interest in coronary artery calcification (CAC) as a direct marker of coronary artery disease.

The 2019 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines for the primary prevention of ASCVD recommend CAC scoring for further risk assessment in borderline to intermediate-risk individuals — typically middle-aged adults — in whom management is uncertain. Although most studies of CAC have focused on the yield of testing middle to older-aged adults, the utility of CAC in younger populations is still not clear. The few studies in young adults examining the relationship between CAC and disease outcomes have been limited by small sample sizes, short duration of follow-up, or lack of cause-specific mortality, or were conducted in selected populations with a high prevalence of CVD risk factors. In response to increasing interest in CAC for the risk assessment of young adults, we sought to provide…

### Is calcium scoring of the coronary arteries necessary for proper management of asymptomatic subjects with classic risk factors [^115TjVQQ]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

In 2000, I wrote an editorial entitled "Detecting Coronary Calcium". For the past several years, there have been numerous publications on this subject. Recently, an article by Min et al. provided some important information about patients with a normal coronary calcium scan and the conversion from a zero calcium score to greater than zero.

### Coronary artery calcium screening: Current status and recommendations from the European Society of Cardiac Radiology and North American Society for Cardiovascular Imaging [^1112153R]. European Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Guidelines and literature on screening for coronary artery calcium for cardiac risk assessment are reviewed for both general and special populations. It is shown that for both general and special populations, a zero score excludes most clinically relevant coronary artery disease. The importance of standardization of coronary artery calcium measurements by multidetector CT is discussed.

### The evolving view of coronary artery calcium and cardiovascular disease risk [^1115UWtN]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Calcification of the coronary artery is a complex pathophysiologic process intimately associated with atherosclerosis. Extensive investigation has demonstrated the value of identifying and quantifying coronary artery calcium (CAC) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) prognostication. However, over the last several years, an increasing body of evidence has suggested that CAC has underappreciated aspects that modulate, and at times attenuate, future CVD risk.

The most commonly used measure of CAC, the Agatston unit, effectively models both higher density and higher area of CAC as risk factors for future CVD events. Recent findings from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) have challenged this assumption, demonstrating that higher density of CAC is protective for coronary heart disease and CVD events. Statins may be associated with an increase in CAC, an unexpected finding given their clear benefits in the prevention and treatment of CVD.

Studies utilizing intracoronary ultrasound and coronary computed tomography angiography have demonstrated that calcified atherosclerotic plaque — as compared with noncalcified or sparsely calcified plaque — is associated with fewer CVD events. These studies lend support to the often-asserted (but as yet unvalidated) view that calcification may play a role in plaque stabilization. Furthermore, vascular calcification, though a surrogate for atherosclerotic plaque burden, may also possess identifiable aspects that can refine CVD risk assessment.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^113Kibg7]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

First, we calculated the Framingham 10-year CHD risk estimate (and corresponding 1-year risk estimate, assuming an equal event rate each year) according to published models. Next, we calculated the probability, as described above, that an individual's CAC score would fall into each of the four standard CAC score categories: 0, 1–100, 101–400, and > 400. We obtained risk factor-adjusted relative risk (RR) estimates from a meta-analysis comparing the risk of a CHD event among persons with CAC scores of 1–100 (RR = 2.1), 101–400 (RR = 5.4), and > 400. The post-test CHD risk estimates for each CAC score category were then calculated algebraically by assuming that the overall 1-year CHD risk estimate represents an average of the 1-year risk estimates from the four CAC score categories. These were weighted by the probabilities that an individual's score would fall into each category. A spreadsheet that automates these calculations is attached.

### Derivation of a coronary age calculator using traditional risk factors and coronary artery calcium: The multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis [^113bJM6w]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

The global burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is high and continues to rise, making it the leading cause of death globally. Accurate risk prediction remains the cornerstone of decision-making in the primary prevention of CVD, although ease of communication and understanding of predicted risk is equally important. Despite this, the optimal method for communicating risk to individual patients remains unclear. The traditional method of expressing CVD risk as a probability of an event over the subsequent 10 years has important shortcomings. For example, poor understanding of this metric by patients may lead to inaccurate perception of susceptibility to CVD, which may impair patient motivation and ultimately inhibit the effectiveness of preventive care.

The concept of "risk age" has been proposed to facilitate risk communication to patients. Using this approach, which contrasts a patient's chronological age with their vascular age, patients are given a biological age equivalent to their estimated risk. For example, a 55-year-old man with several cardiovascular risk factors could be told that his coronary arteries are "as old as those of a 70-year-old healthy man". It has been proposed that this approach to risk communication may increase patient understanding of risk estimations and, therefore, adherence to recommended lifestyle changes and pharmacotherapies.

Previous methods of estimating risk age have, however, had some shortcomings that limit their utility in clinical practice.

### Coronary artery calcification score as tool for risk assessment among families with premature coronary artery disease [^1127NC7Q]. Atherosclerosis (2016). Low credibility.

There is ongoing discussion about incorporating a family history (FamHis) of premature coronary artery disease (CAD) in risk score algorithms. However, FamHis provides information on individual risk. The coronary artery calcification score (CACS) is a metric of atherosclerosis that may better determine the individual risk within families at high risk of premature CAD.

- **Methods**: In asymptomatic individuals (n = 704), we assessed the association between FamHis of CAD and elevated CACS. To evaluate the predictive value of CACS in individuals with a FamHis of CAD, we performed a post-hoc analysis on the St. Francis Heart Study (n = 834). We assessed, in a case-control design, the risk of future CAD in individuals with a FamHis of CAD and either CACS > 80th percentile or no CACS at all.

- **Results**: Individuals with a FamHis for CAD had an increased risk for elevated CACS (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.23; 95% CI 1.48–3.36; p < 0.05). For individuals with CACS > 80th percentile, a FamHis of CAD doubled the CAD event rate (positive FamHis 12.5% vs. negative FamHis 6.8%; adjusted HR 2.08; 95% CI 1.09–3.87; p < 0.05).

- **Conclusion**: CAC scoring leads to risk discrimination among those with a positive FamHis for premature CAD. These results support testing CAC score in asymptomatic individuals with a positive FamHis to identify a high-risk population.

### What does my patient's coronary artery calcium score mean? Combining information from the coronary artery calcium score with information from conventional risk factors to estimate coronary heart disease risk [^1118LpsV]. BMC Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The third and fourth clinical scenarios presented in Table 5 provide examples where the test is unlikely to change management. The 40-year-old woman who smokes, for example, has a very low pre-test 10-year CHD risk (3%). It is very likely her CAC score will be zero (89%) or less than 100 (10%), in which case her post-test 10-year CHD risk will still be low (≤ 5%) and her management would not change. The 80-year-old man with high cholesterol has a high pre-test 10-year CHD risk (26%) and a high probability of having a high CAC score (70% will have a score > 100), in which case his post-test 10-year CHD risk would remain over 20% and his management would have to remain aggressive. In these cases, and others in which the risk factor profile indicates very low or very high pre-test risk, the test is not likely to provide useful results, and the clinician might decide not to order the test. We have provided a simple spreadsheet (see Additional File 1) that may be used by readers of this article to replicate these analyses and apply our models to other clinical scenarios.

While others have proposed similar Bayesian approaches to the use of the CAC score for coronary risk prediction, ours has advantages. Previous approaches generally take into account the pre-test probability of coronary heart disease, but none consider the expected distribution of CAC scores in the tested population after adjustment for conventional CHD risk factors. Raggi et al. advocate use of an age- and sex-adjusted calcium score percentile, but this ignores both persons with zero scores and other variables.

### Coronary artery calcium scoring: an evidence-based guide for primary care physicians [^112NgB7R]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Primary care physicians often must decide whether statin therapy would be appropriate (in addition to lifestyle modification) for managing asymptomatic individuals with borderline or intermediate risk for developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), as assessed on the basis of traditional risk factors. In appropriate subjects, a simple, noninvasive measurement of coronary artery calcium can help clarify risk.

Coronary atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease, with atherosclerotic plaque formation involving intimal inflammation and repeated cycles of erosion and fibrosis, healing, and calcification. Atherosclerotic plaque formation represents the prognostic link between risk factors and future clinical events. The presence of coronary artery calcification is almost exclusively an indication of coronary artery disease, except in certain metabolic conditions. Coronary artery calcification can be detected and quantified in a matter of seconds by noncontrast electrocardiogram-gated low-dose X-ray computed tomography (coronary artery calcium scoring [CACS]).

Since the publication of the seminal work by Dr. Arthur Agatston in 1990, a wealth of CACS-based prognostic data has been reported. Recent guidelines from various professional societies conclude that CACS may be considered a tool for reclassifying risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in patients otherwise assessed to have intermediate risk, so as to more accurately inform decisions about possible statin therapy in addition to lifestyle modification as primary preventive therapy.

### Prevalence and clinical characteristics of symptomatic patients with obstructive coronary artery disease in the absence of coronary calcifications [^114A8Z3f]. Academic Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

The quantification of coronary calcification has established itself as a valid risk marker to predict cardiovascular events. However, data derived from cardiac multi-detector row computed tomography could demonstrate that the exclusion of coronary calcification is not synonymous with the exclusion of coronary artery disease (CAD). The aims of this retrospective analysis were to determine the prevalence of significant CAD in a symptomatic cohort with indications for invasive angiography but without coronary calcification (Agatston score 0) as assessed by multislice computed tomography, and to investigate whether there were any differences in terms of risk factors between patients with and without significant CAD.

Five hundred multislice computed tomographic scans (in 371 men and 129 women) were included in the analysis. Agatston scores were determined on native scans. All patients underwent coronary angiography to detect or rule out obstructive CAD. Patients with negative calcium scoring were selected and divided into two subgroups: those without obstructive CAD and those with obstructive CAD (luminal stenoses > 50%). These subgroups were characterized in terms of clinical characteristics (age and sex) and cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipoproteinemia, familial predisposition, smoking, and overweight).

Sixty-one of 500 patients (12.2%) had negative calcium scores (Agatston score 0). Sixteen of these patients (26.3%, or 3.2% of the total population) had obstructive CAD according to these criteria.

### Calcium scoring: A personalized probability assessment predicts the need for additional or alternative testing to coronary CT angiography [^115Javax]. European Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Coronary CT angiography (CTA) acts as a gatekeeper to rule out significant coronary artery stenosis due to its high sensitivity and negative predictive value. In the 2019 European Society of Cardiology guideline for the diagnosis and management of chronic coronary syndromes, coronary CTA has a Class I recommendation as the initial test for symptomatic patients in whom obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) cannot be clinically excluded.

However, in cases of irregular heart rate, significant obesity, or inadequate breath-hold, coronary CTA is not suggested since sufficient image quality (IQ) may not be reached (Class III recommendation). Exact cutoff values for clinical factors potentially prohibiting sufficient evaluation of CAD using coronary CTA are scarce. Furthermore, with an increasing likelihood of obstructive CAD, coronary CTA may not be the ideal choice due to the high pre-test probability of significant CAD. There is limited information regarding patient characteristics in whom alternative diagnostic tests should be applied instead of coronary CTA because of a high probability of significant stenosis or foreseeable insufficient IQ of CTA.

Coronary calcium score (CACS) correlates with the presence of obstructive CAD and may also identify extensive calcifications, which may further hamper CTA analysis due to partial volume effects and blooming artifacts. However, there is minimal data on whether calcium score values may predict inadequate IQ of coronary CTA.

Therefore, we aimed to assess whether anthropometrics and parameters of the Diamond and F…

### Diagnostic value of coronary artery calcium scoring in low-intermediate risk patients evaluated in the emergency department for acute coronary syndrome [^112xozLb]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Early and accurate triage of patients with possible ischemic chest pain remains challenging in the emergency department because risk stratification techniques have significant cost and limited availability. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of the coronary artery calcium score (CACS) for the detection of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in low- to intermediate-risk patients evaluated in the emergency department for suspected acute coronary syndromes. A total of 225 patients presenting to the emergency department with acute chest pain and Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) scores < 4 who underwent non-contrast- and contrast-enhanced coronary computed tomographic angiography were included. CACS was calculated from the noncontrast scan using the Agatston method.

The prevalence of obstructive CAD (defined from the contrast scan as ≥ 50% maximal reduction in luminal diameter in any segment) was 9% and increased significantly with higher scores (p < 0.01 for trend). CACS of 0 were observed in 133 patients (59%), of whom only 2 (1.5%) had obstructive CAD. The diagnostic accuracy of CACS to detect obstructive CAD was good, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.88 and a negative predictive value of 99% for a CACS of 0. In a multivariate model, CACS was independently associated with obstructive CAD (odds ratio 7.01, p = 0.02) and provided additional diagnostic value over traditional CAD risk factors.

In conclusion, CACS appears to be an effective initial tool for risk stratification of low- to intermediate-risk patients.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with diabetes [^112bW6Qt]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis involves understanding the role of coronary artery calcium score (CAC). Coronary arterial calcification is a significant aspect of atherosclerosis and occurs almost exclusively in atherosclerotic arteries, absent in normal vessel walls. Atherosclerotic plaque progresses through stages where instability and rupture can lead to calcification, thereby providing stability to unstable lesions.

The coronary artery calcium score (CAC) is measured using electron-beam (EBCT) and multi-detector (MDCT) computed tomography. It is highly correlated with the total coronary atherosclerotic burden and is an independent predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk and cardiovascular disease (CVD).

The MESA Study evaluated the predictive improvement of CHD and CVD incidents between six risk markers in 6814 patients, 1330 of whom were at intermediate risk according to the Framingham risk score (FRS) at baseline. After a median follow-up of 7.6 years, there were 94 CHD and 123 CVD events. The baseline accuracy ROC curve for CAC provided the highest increase in sensitivity and specificity to the FRS when compared to other markers. The CAC score is incrementally associated with higher event rates compared to a CAC zero score. A meta-analysis of four studies on asymptomatic subjects indicated a linear relationship between CAC and CHD events. The summary adjusted relative risk (RR) ratios for CAC scores ranging from 1–100 compared to CAC zero were 2.1 (95% CI 1.6–2.9). For CAC scores of 101–400 and greater than 400 compared to CAC zero, the RR ranged from 3.0 to 17.0.
