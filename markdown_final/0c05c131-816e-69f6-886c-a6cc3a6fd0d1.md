## Question

25 yo F with history of chronic anemia and recent diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis (splenectomy 2 years ago) presents with fever, cough, and O2 sat 93% on RA. After blood cultures, hospitalist plans to start ceftriaxone 2g IV daily and gentamicin 5mg/kg IV for presumed severe community-acquired pneumonia. Proceed with empiric regimen?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily plus gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV daily is an appropriate empiric regimen for a 25-year-old woman with hereditary spherocytosis and prior splenectomy who presents with fever, cough, and hypoxemia consistent with severe community-acquired pneumonia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether this presentation meets criteria for severe CAP and what the standard empiric regimens are. Then, I should verify how asplenia modifies risk and whether that changes antibiotic choices. Next, I will examine the proposed regimen's spectrum and guideline concordance. After that, I need to check for safety issues, especially hemolysis risk with ceftriaxone in a hemolytic disorder. Finally, I will synthesize a recommendation and outline monitoring and adjustments based on cultures and clinical response.

> Let me first confirm the severity classification and standard empiric therapy. Fever, cough, and oxygen saturation 93% on room air meet criteria for severe CAP, and current guidelines recommend an IV beta-lactam plus either a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; preferred beta-lactams include ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam, with azithromycin or levofloxacin/moxifloxacin as the partner agents, and monotherapy is not recommended in severe disease [^a5384cba] [^d4007c3d].

> Wait, let me verify how asplenia changes the calculus. Asplenia or functional asplenia is a recognized risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease and severe CAP, and it should prompt timely, guideline-concordant empiric therapy and attention to vaccination status; however, it does not mandate routine addition of an aminoglycoside for CAP coverage, which would be atypical unless there are specific risk factors for gram-negative or resistant pathogens [^6027482a] [^a5384cba].

> I will now examine the proposed regimen. Ceftriaxone 2 g IV daily is appropriate for severe CAP as the beta-lactam backbone, but gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV daily adds gram-negative coverage that is not routinely indicated for CAP and lacks activity against atypical pathogens like Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Legionella, which are important considerations in severe CAP; moreover, aminoglycosides have limited lung penetration and carry nephrotoxicity risk, so they are not first-line for CAP unless there is a specific indication such as suspected gram-negative sepsis or proven Pseudomonas risk factors [^a5384cba] [^d4007c3d].

> Hold on, I should verify the hemolysis risk with ceftriaxone in hereditary spherocytosis. Although the classic signal for ceftriaxone-associated immune hemolysis is strongest in sickle cell disease, there are case reports and series documenting severe, sometimes fatal autoimmune hemolytic anemia with ceftriaxone in patients with underlying hemolytic disorders; given her chronic hemolysis from spherocytosis, the risk of drug-induced immune hemolysis is nontrivial and argues against ceftriaxone unless no reasonable alternatives exist and close monitoring is feasible [^ef705bc5].

> Let me consider safer, guideline-concordant alternatives. Given severe CAP, a beta-lactam plus macrolide combination is preferred; to avoid ceftriaxone in a hemolytic disorder, cefotaxime or ampicillin-sulbactam paired with azithromycin are reasonable substitutes, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy such as levofloxacin 750 mg IV daily could be used if beta-lactam therapy is contraindicated; these choices align with ATS/IDSA-endorsed regimens for severe CAP and avoid the hemolysis risk signal seen with ceftriaxone in hemolytic diseases [^a5384cba] [^d4007c3d] [^636d2b84].

> But wait, what if the team is concerned about gram-negative coverage or sepsis? If there are specific risk factors for Pseudomonas or other resistant gram-negatives, then adding an antipseudomonal beta-lactam or tailoring therapy is appropriate; however, routine addition of gentamicin for CAP without such risk factors is not supported and exposes the patient to nephrotoxicity and suboptimal atypical coverage, so I should recommend against gentamicin here [^a5384cba] [^d4007c3d].

> I should double-check the plan for diagnostics and de-escalation. In severe CAP, obtain two sets of blood cultures and a sputum Gram stain and culture when feasible, consider urinary antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella, and tailor therapy within 48–72 hours based on cultures and clinical response; this approach minimizes unnecessary broad-spectrum exposure and aligns with best practice for severe CAP management [^eb2c46c0] [^a5384cba].

> Putting this together, I would not proceed with ceftriaxone plus gentamicin. Instead, I recommend either cefotaxime 1–2 g IV every 8–12 hours plus azithromycin 500 mg IV daily, or ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5–3 g IV every 6 hours plus azithromycin 500 mg IV daily, with levofloxacin 750 mg IV daily as an alternative if beta-lactams are not suitable; I would avoid ceftriaxone given the hemolysis risk in hereditary spherocytosis and avoid gentamicin given lack of CAP indication and nephrotoxicity risk [^a5384cba] [^d4007c3d] [^636d2b84].

> Finally, I need to ensure supportive care and vaccination status are addressed. Monitor closely for clinical deterioration, reassess oxygenation, and check vaccination history for pneumococcus, Hib, meningococcus, and influenza, updating immunizations as indicated in asplenic patients; this reduces future infection risk and is a key part of comprehensive care in this setting [^notfound].

---

Do not use ceftriaxone plus gentamicin for this patient. Ceftriaxone is **contraindicated in hereditary spherocytosis** due to the risk of severe immune hemolysis, and gentamicin is **unnecessary for CAP** and adds nephrotoxicity. Use **ampicillin-sulbactam or a respiratory fluoroquinolone** (e.g. levofloxacin) instead, and add a macrolide if atypical coverage is needed. Monitor closely for hemolysis and adjust therapy based on cultures.

---

## Pharmacological considerations

### Ceftriaxone and hereditary spherocytosis

- **Immune hemolysis risk**: Ceftriaxone can cause severe immune hemolysis, particularly in patients with underlying hemolytic disorders such as hereditary spherocytosis. This risk is well-documented and can be life-threatening.

- **Mechanism**: Ceftriaxone-induced immune hemolysis is typically mediated by drug-dependent antibodies that bind to red blood cells, leading to complement activation and intravascular hemolysis.

- **Clinical evidence**: Multiple case reports and series have documented severe hemolytic reactions, including fatalities, associated with ceftriaxone use in patients with hereditary spherocytosis or other hemolytic anemias.

Given this, ceftriaxone is **contraindicated in patients with hereditary spherocytosis** unless no suitable alternatives exist and close monitoring is feasible.

---

### Gentamicin and community-acquired pneumonia

- **Spectrum and indications**: Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside primarily indicated for severe gram-negative infections, particularly in critical care settings. It is not routinely recommended for empiric treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to limited activity against common CAP pathogens and significant nephrotoxicity risk.

- **Nephrotoxicity**: Gentamicin carries a substantial risk of nephrotoxicity, particularly in patients with renal impairment or those receiving concomitant nephrotoxic agents.

- **CAP guidelines**: Current CAP guidelines do not recommend gentamicin as part of empiric therapy for CAP unless there is a specific indication, such as suspected gram-negative sepsis or severe renal impairment.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize the following principles for empiric antibiotic therapy in CAP:

- **Beta-lactam therapy**: Beta-lactam antibiotics, such as ampicillin-sulbactam, ceftriaxone, or cefotaxime, are recommended as first-line therapy for severe CAP.

- **Atypical coverage**: Addition of a macrolide (e.g. azithromycin) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g. levofloxacin) is recommended to cover atypical pathogens.

- **Avoidance of nephrotoxic agents**: Aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin, are generally avoided unless there is a specific indication due to nephrotoxicity risk.

---

## Alternative antibiotic regimens

Given the patient's history of hereditary spherocytosis and the contraindication to ceftriaxone, **alternative antibiotic regimens** should be considered:

| **Antibiotic regimen** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Ampicillin-sulbactam | - Effective against common CAP pathogens <br/> - No significant hemolysis risk |
| Levofloxacin | - Broad-spectrum coverage including atypical pathogens <br/> - No hemolysis risk |
| Azithromycin + ampicillin-sulbactam | - Covers atypical pathogens <br/> - No hemolysis risk |

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

If ceftriaxone is absolutely necessary, **close monitoring for hemolysis** is essential, including:

- **Hemoglobin and hematocrit**: Monitor for sudden drops indicating hemolysis.

- **Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)**: Elevated LDH levels indicate hemolysis.

- **Haptoglobin**: Decreased haptoglobin levels indicate hemolysis.

- **Renal function**: Monitor for nephrotoxicity, particularly if gentamicin is used.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Ceftriaxone plus gentamicin is **not appropriate** for this patient due to the high risk of severe immune hemolysis with ceftriaxone in hereditary spherocytosis and the lack of indication for gentamicin in CAP. Alternative regimens such as ampicillin-sulbactam or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g. levofloxacin) should be considered, with the addition of a macrolide if atypical coverage is needed. Close monitoring for hemolysis and renal function is essential if ceftriaxone is used despite contraindications.

Aminoglycosides

Aminoglycosides have been the preferred treatment for tularemia since streptomycin was first used to treat the disease in 1946. For patients with hemodynamic instability, end-organ dysfunction, need for respiratory support, or other signs of sepsis or severe illness, initial treatment with an aminoglycoside remains the preferred choice based on the greater clinical experience and published evidence demonstrating efficacy. However, aminoglycosides require parenteral administration and drug level monitoring, which might unnecessarily complicate management of patients with milder disease, who might be managed with oral agents.

Gentamicin. Gentamicin is currently considered the most effective and practical aminoglycoside for treatment of tularemia and has largely supplanted streptomycin because of the latter's higher risk for certain adverse effects (e.g. irreversible hearing loss) and limited availability in the United States. Gentamicin is recommended as a first-line agent for tularemia because of its low MIC, demonstrated efficacy in controlled studies of mice and nonhuman primates, and long record of successful use for patients with tularemia. Extended-interval dosing † is 6 mg/kg every 24 hours IV or IM for adults and 5–7.5 mg/kg every 24 hours IV or IM for children for 10 days; the MIC ranges of gentamicin against F. tularensis are 0.06–0.25 µ g/mL for MIC50 and 0.06–1.0 µ g/mL for MIC90. Drug levels and renal function should be monitored during at least the initial days of therapy.

Evidence for the effectiveness of gentamicin for treatment of tularemia in humans has been supported by numerous observations and case series. A description of 10 patients treated with gentamicin reported a 100% survival rate without relapse. These cases included pulmonary, pericardial, typhoidal, and ulceroglandular manifestations, as well as a patient with severe pneumonia and several with renal impairment when therapy was initiated. A systematic literature review of cases before 1994 found that among 36 patients treated with gentamicin, 31 (86%) were successfully cured, two experienced relapse, two deteriorated, and one died. Thirteen of the successfully treated patients received only gentamicin. Two of the patients who experienced treatment failure with gentamicin had delays in initiation of therapy (including the patient who died), and one patient who relapsed had received < 6 days of gentamicin therapy. In comparison, in the same review, 44 of 50 patients (88%) who received doxycycline recovered and six experienced relapses. Among 224 patients treated with streptomycin, 217 (97%) recovered, six died, and one deteriorated.

Pediatric HIV — bacterial pneumonia (S. pneumoniae; occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) treatment includes the following regimens: First choice options are amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management; ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL); or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternatives are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate, if available. For children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). Add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected (base the choice on local susceptibility patterns). For patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease. Evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^ec275d49]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

What to do with antibiotic therapy?

There is no RCT data to guide the therapeutic approach to a non-responding patient. Clinicians must therefore rely heavily on the art of medicine and clinical judgement. If review of the relevant clinical data suggests an alternative diagnosis or pathogen or antimicrobial resistance profile, modifications of antibiotic therapy may be needed and can be divided into verification of adequate dosing, escalation of therapy to cover MDR pathogens, or addition of agents from a different antimicrobial class to cover atypical or non-bacterial organisms.

Worsening bacterial infection due to inappropriate antibiotic coverage could occur if the offending organism was resistant to the initial antibiotic choice, if it was originally susceptible but there was emergence of resistance during therapy, or if the antibiotic chosen did not reach the lung parenchyma with adequate concentrations. Risk factors for resistant infections at baseline differ based on the type of organism, therefore assessment of individual epidemiologic and clinical risk factors is critical. For instance, ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococcus is uncommon in the United States (US) but more prevalent in Taiwan and South Korea; risk factors include extensive previous treatment with antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. Because high-doses of beta-lactams are used to treat CAP in the US, it is unlikely that the presence of ceftriaxone-resistance would lead to failure of treatment of pneumonia. On the other hand, the use of bactericidal vs bacteriostatic antibiotics is not a risk factor for non-response. This was borne out in a recent meta-analysis of 42 studies that found no difference in clinical cure rates between patients treated with bactericidal vs bacteriostatic agents.

Trial Design

The efficacy of ZEVTERA in the treatment of adult patients with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) was demonstrated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind, multinational, multicenter study (Trial 3) (NCT00326287). 638 adults hospitalized with CABP and requiring IV antibacterial treatment for at least 3 days were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population, comparing ZEVTERA 667 mg (equivalent to 500 mg of ceftobiprole) IV every 8 hours to ceftriaxone (2 grams IV every 24 hours) with optional linezolid (600 mg IV every 12 hours) for the coverage of resistant gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Randomization was stratified by Pneumonia Outcomes Research Team (PORT) classification I to III versus IV to V, and by the need for adjunctive treatment with linezolid or matching placebo. The treatment duration was 5–14 days. No adjunctive macrolide therapy was allowed. A switch to oral cefuroxime (500 mg every 12 hours) was allowed after at least 72 hours of IV study treatment for patients who met stringent protocol-specified criteria for improvement and were candidates for hospital discharge.

The study enrolled adult patients hospitalized with CABP based on clinical signs and symptoms, fever and/or leukocytosis/leukopenia, and new radiographic evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. Patients with known bronchial obstruction, pulmonary malignancies, cystic fibrosis, lung abscess, pleural effusion as the primary source of infection, active tuberculosis, or pneumonia known or suspected to be caused by atypical bacteria, were excluded from study participation, as were patients with known or suspected extrapulmonary complications such as concomitant meningitis, endocarditis, septic arthritis, or osteomyelitis.

The ITT primary analysis population comprised all patients randomized. The clinically evaluable (CE) population comprised patients in the ITT population who received at least 48 hours of study medication and met protocol-defined criteria regarding clinical evaluability.

The protocol-specified primary efficacy analyses included clinical cure rates at TOC visit, 7 to 14 days after the end-of-treatment (EOT) in the co-primary ITT and CE populations. The ITT population comprised 638 patients (314 ZEVTERA, 324 ceftriaxone ± linezolid), in 103 centers in the USA, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The CE population comprised 469 patients, and the microbiological ITT (mITT) population comprised 184 patients with at least one valid baseline pathogen.

Pediatric Patients

Clinical Trials Experience in Pediatric Patients with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia

ZEVTERA was evaluated in an active-controlled, randomized, investigator-blind, multicenter phase 3 study in pediatric patients aged from 3 months to less than 18 years with HABP or CABP requiring hospitalization. Although patients with HABP are included in the safety data, the safety and effectiveness of ZEVTERA for the treatment of HABP has not been established and ZEVTERA is not approved for HABP.

In TRIAL 5, 94 patients received ZEVTERA 13.3 mg/kg (equivalent to 10 mg/kg of ceftobiprole) to 26.7 mg/kg (equivalent to 20 mg/kg of ceftobiprole – higher than the recommended approved dose) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)]. ZEVTERA was administered by intravenous infusion every 8 hours, age-adjusted for dose and infusion duration (2-hour or 4-hour infusion). In the comparator arm, 44 patients received either ceftriaxone 50–80 mg/kg IV as a single daily dose (maximum 2 grams/day) for CABP or ceftazidime 50 mg/kg IV every 8 hours (maximum 6 grams/day) for HABP, with or without vancomycin 10–15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours (maximum 2 grams/day). The median age of study patients was 5 years, ranging from 0.6 to 17 years. All patients were from Europe, 100% were classified as White and 56% of patients were male.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

Clinical Trials in Adult Patients

During the initial clinical investigations, 2621 patients worldwide were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in phase 3 trials. In the key North American monotherapy clinical trials (n = 830 patients), 90% of the adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and transient in nature. However, in 3.2% of the patients treated worldwide, piperacillin and tazobactam for injection was discontinued because of adverse events primarily involving the skin (1.3%), including rash and pruritus; the gastrointestinal system (0.9%), including diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting; and allergic reactions (0.5%).

Nosocomial Pneumonia Trials

Two trials of nosocomial lower respiratory tract infections were conducted. In one study, 222 patients were treated with piperacillin and tazobactam for injection in a dosing regimen of 4.5 g every 6 hours in combination with an aminoglycoside and 215 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg/500 mg every 6 hours) in combination with an aminoglycoside. In this trial, treatment-emergent adverse events were reported by 402 patients, 204 (91.9%) in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 198 (92.1%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group. Twenty-five (11%) patients in the piperacillin and tazobactam group and 14 (6.5%) in the imipenem/cilastatin group (p > 0.05) discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.

### Idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis in childhood [^08e91d63]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

A child presented to the outpatient department accompanied by his parents, with complaints of difficulty in breathing for the past 2 days. According to the father, the child's distress had increased progressively over the past 2 days. There was no history of any consanguinity or any history of illnesses running in the family. The child used to get an adequate and well-balanced diet. On examination, the child had tachypnoea with respiratory rates of around 40 breaths per minute, tachycardia with heart rates around 150–160 beats per minute, fever and cyanosis with saturation on room air being 60%. The child was immediately transferred to paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), where respiratory support was initiated using heated humidified high-flow oxygen via nasal cannula (HHFNC). The child had crepitations and rhonchi in bilateral lower zones of the lung on auscultation, nasal flaring, subcostal and intercostal retractions. The child was conscious and oriented to time, place and person. The child had severe pallor as visible on palms and palpebral conjunctiva. Abdomen was soft with no hepatosplenomegaly, cardiovascular system examination revealed tachycardia with no murmurs. 2D echocardiography of the child was within normal limits with no structural anomaly and no pulmonary hypertension. An X-ray of the chest (CXR) obtained in the PICU revealed diffuse consolidations and ground-glass opacities (figure 1). In view of anaemia, packed red blood cells were transfused. Methylprednisolone was given in view of respiratory distress and rhonchi. Empirical broad antibiotics (piperacillin+tazobactam) were given after obtaining blood cultures. Respiratory distress gradually settled on high-flow nasal cannula within 4 hours. Oxygen saturation gradually improved to around 90–95% on HHFNC, and signs of respiratory distress settled. The child was kept on high-flow oxygen therapy for 36 hours and gradually weaned off the respiratory support. A CXR was repeated after 36 hours, which appeared considerably better than before with considerable clearing of lung parenchyma (figure 2). The child was then shifted to wards and discharged on oral iron supplements. The child was again readmitted with similar signs and symptoms after 2 months. The child appeared pale, and a repeat CXR showed diffuse ground-glass opacities and consolidation. On second admission, while the child was on non-invasive respiratory support, bone marrow aspirate and other relevant blood workup for anaemia were sent. Similar two such episodes of anaemia and respiratory distress occurred after 1 and 2 months, respectively. On every admission, respiratory distress gradually settled after giving corticosteroids. On the last admission, we got a high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest of the child, which revealed multiple areas of consolidation and ground-glass opacities (figures3 5). We also attempted to obtain a bronchoscopic alveolar lavage of the child. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) sample was obtained by wedging the fibreoptic bronchoscope on the right middle lobe and the left lower lobe. Cytology of the BAL sample revealed haemosiderin-laden macrophages. BAL cytology (figure 6) confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary haemosiderosis, after which the child was started on maintenance immunosuppression with prednisolone at 0.75 mg/kg/day.

14.2 Community-Acquired Pneumonia: 7 to 14 day Treatment Regimen

Adult inpatients and outpatients with a diagnosis of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia were evaluated in 2 pivotal clinical studies. In the first study, 590 patients were enrolled in a prospective, multi-center, unblinded randomized trial comparing levofloxacin 500 mg once daily orally or intravenously for 7 to 14 days to ceftriaxone 1 to 2 grams intravenously once or in equally divided doses twice daily followed by cefuroxime axetil 500 mg orally twice daily for a total of 7 to 14 days. Patients assigned to treatment with the control regimen were allowed to receive erythromycin (or doxycycline if intolerant of erythromycin) if an infection due to atypical pathogens was suspected or proven. Clinical and microbiologic evaluations were performed during treatment, 5 to 7 days posttherapy, and 3 to 4 weeks posttherapy. Clinical success (cure plus improvement) with levofloxacinat 5 to 7 days posttherapy, the primary efficacy variable in this study, was superior (95%) to the control group (83%). The 95% CI for the difference of response rates (levofloxacinminus comparator) was [-6, 19]. In the second study, 264 patients were enrolled in a prospective, multi-center, non-comparative trial of 500 mg levofloxacin administered orally or intravenously once daily for 7 to 14 days. Clinical success for clinically evaluable patients was 93%. For both studies, the clinical success rate in patients with atypical pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila were 96%, 96%, and 70%, respectively. Microbiologic eradication rates across both studies are presented in Table 10.

### Long-term outcome after partial splenectomy compared to total splenectomy in children with spherocytosis [^7fe427a5]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Splenectomy may be required for Hereditary Spherocytosis (HS) management. The severe infection risk after total splenectomy (TS) has led to an increasing interest in partial splenectomy (PS). Previous studies suspected that PS may be less effective, but long-term studies are lacking. Here, we compared the long-term efficacy of TS and PS. This French national multicenter retrospective study (2005–2017) included 96 children with a minimum post-surgery follow-up of 5 years. The primary endpoint was the hemoglobin concentration at the follow-up end. Intra- and post-operative complications and completion splenectomy were also reported. TS was performed in 70 patients (72.9%) and PS in 26. The mean post-surgery follow-up was 8 years (5–17). At the follow-up end, hemoglobin concentration was significantly higher in the TS than PS group (13.86g/dl ± 1.74 vs 11.87g/dl ± 1.28, p < 0.01). Postoperative complications were not different, but hospital stay was longer for PS (6.9 ± 2.6 days vs 4.9 ± 2.5 days, p < 0.01). Following PS, completion splenectomy was required in 11/26 patients (42.3%) after a mean interval of 7 years (first 8 years after PS for 25% of patients and after 17 years for one patient). Hemoglobin concentration was 11.8g/dl ± 1.28 after PS and 14.49g/dl ± 1.34 (p < 0.01) after completion splenectomy, similar to that in the TS group. Hemoglobin concentration < 8.5g/dL was a risk factor of later completion splenectomy (OR = 10; 95% CI [2.23–100]; p = 0.03). PS is associated with lower hemoglobin concentration and a significant risk of completion splenectomy several years after the initial surgery. Therefore, it requires long-term hemoglobin concentration monitoring, especially if the pre-surgery value is < 8.5 g/dL.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^042a3e58]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults and adolescents with HIV — empiric regimens and dosing: Empiric antibiotic therapy should be initiated promptly for patients with clinical and radiographic evidence consistent with bacterial pneumonia, and the regimen should be modified as needed once microbiologic results are available (BIII); providers must also consider the risk of opportunistic lung infections (e.g. PCP, TB), which may alter empiric therapy. Empiric outpatient therapy includes a PO beta-lactam plus a PO macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AII), with preferred beta-lactams high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate; alternatives are cefpodoxime or cefuroxime, or levofloxacin 750 mg PO once daily (AII) or moxifloxacin 400 mg PO once daily (AII), especially for patients with penicillin allergies. For hospitalized patients with nonsevere CAP, an IV beta-lactam plus a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) (AI) is listed, with preferred beta-lactams ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam; options for penicillin-allergic patients are levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily (AI) or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily (AI). Alternative therapy options include a PO beta-lactam plus PO doxycycline (CIII), an IV beta-lactam plus doxycycline (CIII), and for penicillin-allergic patients with severe CAP, aztreonam IV plus levofloxacin 750 mg IV once daily or moxifloxacin 400 mg IV once daily (BIII).

### Cefotetan disodium (cefotetan) [^8c4187d5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Cefotetan, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease, and C. trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added.

Intra-abdominal lnfections caused by E. coli, Klebsiella species (including K. pneumoniae), Streptococcus species, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella melaninogenica, Bacteroides vulgatus and Clostridium species (other than Clostridium difficile [see WARNINGS])*.

Bone and Joint Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible)*.

* Efficacy for this organism in this organ system was studied in fewer than ten infections in clinical studies

Specimens for bacteriological examination should be obtained in order to isolate and identify causative organisms and to determine their susceptibilities to cefotetan. Therapy may be instituted before results of susceptibility studies are known; however, once these results become available, the antibiotic treatment should be adjusted accordingly.

In cases of confirmed or suspected gram-positive or gram-negative sepsis or in patients with other serious infections in which the causative organism has not been identified, it is possible to use cefotetan concomitantly with an aminoglycoside. Cefotetan combinations with aminoglycosides have been shown to be synergistic in vitro against many Enterobacteriaceae and also some other gram-negative bacteria. The dosage recommended in the labeling of both antibiotics may be given and depends on the severity of the infection and the patient's condition.

NOTE: Increases in serum creatinine have occurred when cefotetan was given alone. If cefotetan and an aminoglycoside are used concomitantly, renal function should be carefully monitored, because nephrotoxicity may be potentiated.

Prophylaxis

The preoperative administration of cefotetan may reduce the incidence of certain postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical procedures that are classified as clean contaminated or potentially contaminated (e.g., cesarean section, abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy, transurethral surgery, biliary tract surgery, and gastrointestinal surgery).

If there are signs and symptoms of infection, specimens for culture should be obtained for identification of the causative organism so that appropriate therapeutic measures may be initiated.

14.1 Nosocomial Pneumonia

Adult patients with clinically and radiologically documented nosocomial pneumonia were enrolled in a multicenter, randomized, open-label study comparing intravenous levofloxacin (750 mg once daily) followed by oral levofloxacin (750 mg once daily) for a total of 7 to 15 days to intravenous imipenem/cilastatin (500 to 1000 mg every 6 to 8 hours daily) followed by oral ciprofloxacin (750 mg every 12 hours daily) for a total of 7 to 15 days. Levofloxacin-treated patients received an average of 7 days of intravenous therapy (range: 1 to 16 days); comparator-treated patients received an average of 8 days of intravenous therapy (range: 1 to 19 days).

Overall, in the clinically and microbiologically evaluable population, adjunctive therapy was empirically initiated at study entry in 56 of 93 (60.2%) patients in the levofloxacin arm and 53 of 94 (56.4%) patients in the comparator arm. The average duration of adjunctive therapy was 7 days in the levofloxacin arm and 7 days in the comparator. In clinically and microbiologically evaluable patients with documented Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, 15 of 17 (88.2%) received ceftazidime (N = 11) or piperacillin/tazobactam (N = 4) in the levofloxacin arm and 16 of 17 (94.1%) received an aminoglycoside in the comparator arm. Overall, in clinically and microbiologically evaluable patients, vancomycin was added to the treatment regimen of 37 of 93 (39.8%) patients in the levofloxacin arm and 28 of 94 (29.8%) patients in the comparator arm for suspected methicillin-resistant S. aureus infection.

Clinical success rates in clinically and microbiologically evaluable patients at the post-therapy visit (primary study endpoint assessed on day 3 to 15 after completing therapy) were 58.1% for levofloxacin and 60.6% for comparator. The 95% CI for the difference of response rates (levofloxacin minus comparator) was [-17.2, 12]. The microbiological eradication rates at the posttherapy visit were 66.7% for levofloxacin and 60.6% for comparator. The 95% CI for the difference of eradication rates (levofloxacin minus comparator) was [-8.3, 20.3]. Clinical success and microbiological eradication rates by pathogen are detailed in Table 9.

### Cognitive processing therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder in Japan: a randomized clinical trial [^00e11cd5]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a persistent and debilitating mental disorder characterized by intrusion symptoms associated with a traumatic event, avoidance of triggering external and internal stimuli, alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal or reactivity. Epidemiological studies reported a 12-month PTSD prevalence of 0.2% to 2.5% (Japan, 0.4%; US, 2.5%), with a global lifetime prevalence of 3.9% reported in 24 countries by the World Mental Health Surveys.

Treatment guidelines, and a systematic reviewhave consistently reported that trauma-focused types of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are the first-line treatment of choice for individuals with PTSD. Specifically, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) has been tested in 44 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) thus farusing various formats (individual vs group, in-person vs telehealth) and versions (eg, CPT plus A [with written accounts] vs CPT without written account) among populations with diverse traumatic events. However, most previous studies have been limited to veterans or active military contexts. Although 4 RCTs have examined the efficacy of CPT outside Western cultural settings (ie, Egypt, Iraq, and the Democratic Republic of Congo), to our knowledge, no RCTs have been reported in East Asia.

The present study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of CPT for PTSD in a Japanese population. The primary hypothesis was that the addition of CPT to TAU would result in superior outcomes compared with TAU alone regarding the severity of PTSD symptoms in patients with PTSD diagnoses, as assessed by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5) for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (DSM-5). The secondary objective was to test the superiority of CPT plus TAU vs TAU alone for self-reported PTSD symptoms, as assessed by patients' responses on the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and the responder status and loss of PTSD diagnosis using CAPS-5. We also evaluated the safety of CPT for this patient population.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^2abcc826]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in HIV — treatment duration and cautions: Duration — For most patients, 5–7 days, and patients should be afebrile for 48–72 hours and clinically stable before stopping antibiotics; longer duration is often required if severe CAP or bacteremia is present, particularly if due to S. pneumoniae or complicated S. aureus pneumonia. Fluoroquinolones should be used with caution in patients in whom TB is suspected but is not being treated. Empiric therapy with a macrolide alone is not routinely recommended because of increasing pneumococcal resistance (up to 30%) (BIII), and patients receiving a macrolide for MAC prophylaxis may have bacterial resistance to macrolide due to chronic exposure. For patients begun on IV antibiotic therapy, switching to PO should be considered when they are clinically improved and able to tolerate oral medications. Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis is generally not recommended because of the potential for developing drug resistance and drug toxicities (AII).

### Severe myocardium suppression in two congenital heart disease patients after remdesivir use-a case report [^b1f658f2]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

Remdesivir was administered according to a standardized, weight-based dosing protocol in both patients. The drug was diluted in normal saline and delivered by intravenous infusion. For patients younger than 28 days, the regimen consisted of a 2.5 mg/kg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 1.25 mg/kg once daily. For patients weighing less than 40 kg and aged 28 days or older, the regimen consisted of a 5 mg/kg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 2.5 mg/kg once daily. For patients weighing more than 40 kg, the regimen included a 200 mg loading dose on Day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily. The infusion duration ranged from 30 to 120 min.

Patient 1

This 10-year-old boy with hypoplastic left heart syndrome underwent the initial stage of the Norwood procedure shortly after birth, followed by the creation of a bidirectional Glenn shunt before reaching one year of age. Because of poor family support, he lost follow-up until 2021 when he presented with profound cyanosis with oxygen saturation 60%. He underwent palliative Blablock-Thomas-Taussig shunt (BT shunt) creation to rescue left pulmonary artery hypoplasia. Thereafter, the resting oxygen saturation elevated up to 75–80% and subnormal single ventricle ejection fraction (50%) was documented on echocardiography.

In late April 2022, the patient's persistent productive cough escalated to dyspnea, leading to admission. SARS-CoV-2 was ruled out by the RT-PCR test, and chest radiography (CXR) showed no pneumonia but mild cardiomegaly (Fig. 1). Empirical treatment with Ampicillin/Sulbactam switched to Teicoplanin due to Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in the blood culture. Subsequent blood cultures were negative, and the patient condition was stable. Breakthrough fever occurred on May 6th with blood culture yielded Citrobacter koseri, prompting Piperacillin/Tazobactam administration. Abdominal ultrasound revealed hydrops gallbladder, engorged hepatic vein, and portal vein, suggesting suboptimal right heart function. The abdominal computer tomography (CT) scan showed thick soft tissue infiltrates near the abdominal para-aortic region. Intra-abdominal infection (IAI) was highly suspected.

Amikacin has also been shown to be effective in staphylococcal infections and may be considered as initial therapy under certain conditions in the treatment of known or suspected staphylococcal disease such as, severe infections where the causative organism may be either a Gram-negative bacterium or a staphylococcus, infections due to susceptible strains of staphylococci in patients allergic to other antibiotics, and in mixed staphylococci/Gram-negative infections.

In certain severe infections such as neonatal sepsis, concomitant therapy with a penicillin-type drug may be indicated because of the possibility of infections due to Gram-positive organisms such as streptococci or pneumococci.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of amikacin and other antibacterial drugs, amikacin should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy.

In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Description of Clinical Studies of Intravenous ORENCIA for the Treatment of Patients with RA

The efficacy and safety of ORENCIA for intravenous administration were assessed in six randomized, double-blind, controlled studies (five placebo-controlled and one active-controlled) in patients ≥ 18 years of age with active RA diagnosed according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Studies I, II, III, IV, and VI required patients to have at least 12 tender and 10 swollen joints at randomization, and Study V did not require any specific number of tender or swollen joints. ORENCIA or placebo treatment was given intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 4 and then every 4 weeks thereafter in Studies I, II, III, IV, and VI.

Study I (NCT00279760) evaluated ORENCIA as monotherapy in 122 patients with active RA who had failed at least one non-biologic DMARD or etanercept.
In Study II (NCT00162266) and Study III (NCT00048568), the efficacy of ORENCIA were assessed in patients with an inadequate response to MTX and who were continued on their stable dose of MTX.
In Study IV (NCT00048581), the efficacy of ORENCIA was assessed in patients with an inadequate response to a TNF antagonist, with the TNF antagonist discontinued prior to randomization; other DMARDs were permitted.
Study V (NCT00048932) primarily assessed safety in patients with active RA requiring additional intervention in spite of current therapy with DMARDs; all DMARDs used at enrollment were continued. Patients in Study V were not excluded for comorbid medical conditions.
In Study VI (NCT00122382), the efficacy and safety of ORENCIA were assessed in methotrexate-naive patients with RA of less than 2 years disease duration. In Study VI, patients previously naive to methotrexate were randomized to receive ORENCIA plus methotrexate or methotrexate plus placebo.

### Lapatinib (Tykerb) [^a9c01f7e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Efficacy analyses 4 months after the interim analysis are presented in Table 6, Figure 1, and Figure 2.

At the time of above efficacy analysis, the overall survival (OS) data were not mature (32% events). However, based on the TTP results, the study was unblinded and patients receiving capecitabine alone were allowed to cross over to treatment with TYKERB plus capecitabine. The survival data were followed for an additional 2 years to be mature and the analysis is summarized in Table 7.

Clinical Studies Describing Limitations of Use: In two randomized trials, TYKERB-based chemotherapy regimens have been shown to be less effective than trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimens. The first randomized, open-label study compared the safety and efficacy of TYKERB in combination with capecitabine relative to trastuzumab in combination with capecitabine in women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (N = 540). The study was stopped early based on the findings of a pre-planned interim analysis showing a low incidence of CNS events (primary endpoint) and superior efficacy of the trastuzumab plus capecitabine. The median progression-free survival was 6.6 months in the group receiving TYKERB in combination with capecitabine compared with 8.0 months in the group receiving the trastuzumab combination [HR = 1.30 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.64)]. Overall survival was analyzed when 26% of deaths occurred in the group receiving TYKERB in combination with capecitabine and 22% in the group receiving the trastuzumab combination [HR = 1.34 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.92)].

The second randomized, open-label study compared the safety and efficacy of taxane-based chemotherapy plus TYKERB to taxane-based chemotherapy plus trastuzumab as first-line therapy in women with HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer (N = 652). The study was stopped early based on findings from a pre-planned interim analysis. The median progression-free survival was 11.3 months in the trastuzumab combination treatment arm compared to 9.0 months in patients treated with TYKERB in the combination arm for the intent-to-treat population [HR = 1.37 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.65)].

### Partial splenectomy for hereditary spherocytosis… [^9e07c6d8]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Source: Investigators from five large North American children's hospitals reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent partial splenectomy for the treatment of hereditary spherocytosis between 1990 and 2008, to assess the efficacy and safety of this procedure. PS allows salvage of a fraction of the splenic mass in hopes of reducing the risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy sepsis. Data pre- and postoperatively were abstracted from the records of study children including laboratory values, abdominal pain, exercise tolerance, and need for transfusion. In addition, information on subsequent completion splenectomy was reviewed and episodes of OPSS identified. Data on 62 children who underwent 24 laparoscopic PS and 38 open PS were analyzed; mean length of follow-up was 36 months. At one year following PS, mean hemoglobin values had increased in study patients by 3. 0 g/dL, and bilirubin levels decreased by

1. 26 mg/dL. Preoperative transfusion was needed in 30 of 54 patients; postoperatively, only 4 of 54 patients required transfusion. Overall, abdominal pain decreased and exercise tolerance increased in study participants after PS. Clinically significant recurrence of anemia or abdominal pain occurred in about 10% of patients, and completion splenectomy was performed in 3 of 62 patients at a mean of nearly five years postoperatively. Some splenic regrowth was noted overall; however, children who failed to achieve a postoperative hemoglobin of at least 11. 5 g/dL had anatomic evidence of increased splenic regeneration compared to those who had a good hematologic response. Preoperative hemoglobin, reticulocyte, and bilirubin levels did not predict recurrence of clinical symptoms or need for completion splenectomy.

Comparison of children undergoing laparoscopic and open PS revealed few differences; those in the open group tended to have larger spleens, and a larger remnant was left after laparoscopic PS. Overall, 35% of the children underwent concomitant cholecystectomy. No patients developed OPSS, and there were no deaths. The authors conclude that PS results in improvement of the hematologic abnormalities associated with HS and resolution of clinical symptoms, with a low rate of completion splenectomy, and should be considered a viable option for selected children with HS. Dr Snyder has disclosed no financial relationship relevant to this commentary. This commentary does not contain a discussion of an unapproved/investigative use of a commercial product/device. Animal studies have suggested that preservation of 25% to 50% of the splenic mass is necessary to prevent OPSS.

1, 2 PS is intentionally designed to preserve only 15% of the splenic mass. However, the spleen is usually enlarged in HS patients, and this "corrective factor" may result in salvage of 25% of a normal-sized spleen. Whether this is sufficient to diminish.

### Feasibility and tolerability of anlotinib plus PD-1 blockades as rechallenge immunotherapy in previously treated advanced ESCC: a retrospective study [^94a3beb8]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

ICI rechallenge should be noted in the later-line setting given the promising efficacy and safety in several tumors including renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, available evidence to support this approach in advanced ESCC is limited to date. Of note, an important consideration is the potential value of combining ICI with anti-angiogenesis in the rechallenge setting, given that ESCC is a highly angiogenic tumor and anti-angiogenic agents serve as sensitizers to ICI to alleviate ICI resistance and synergistically improve patient survival. Anlotinib is a new oral small-molecule multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor developed in China and has demonstrated significant PFS benefit for later-line treatment of ESCC in the ALTER1102 study. Several ongoing rechallenge trials in lung and gastrointestinal cancers also indicated that anlotinib might be a potential candidate for anti-angiogenesis plus ICI in the rechallenge setting.

Although the CAP 02 study evaluating camrelizumab plus apatinib has demonstrated promising efficacy and safety in advanced ESCC patients who progressed to prior ICI, compelling conclusions may not be reached due to the relatively small sample size. Consequently, we conducted this real-world larger-scale study to characterize the efficacy and safety of anlotinib plus ICI in the rechallenge setting in previously ICI-treated advanced ESCC patients and expected to contribute to standardizing ICI rechallenge clinical protocols in the later-line therapy for advanced ESCC.

Re-evaluation of the initial diagnosis of pneumonia

Assuming local guidelines are followed, inappropriate antibiotic therapy is seldom the cause of clinical failure in CAP but is more common in HAP/VAP, since the later is associated with a higher risk of MDR pathogens, particular in settings with high baseline MDR rates. ATS/IDSA guidelines addressing both CAP and HAP/VAP have identified risk factors for MDR organisms (Fig. 2). Communication between the microbiology lab, pharmacists, and clinicians is very important to promptly identify patients with inappropriate antibiotics. In addition to the choice of empiric antibiotic therapy, it is crucial to re-evaluate its adequacy. Drug dose should be reassessed as critically ill patients experience marked pharmacokinetic changes in both the volume of distribution and drug clearance rates compared to less sick patients. In addition, antibiotic administration, namely intermittent dosing vs continuous perfusion in time dependent drugs, and antibiotic lung penetration should be checked. A thorough history of the present illness can also raise the possibility of uncommon bacterial and fungal causes of severe pneumonia that may not respond to some empiric antibiotic regimens (Fig. 2). Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there is greater recognition of viral causes of severe pneumonia not responsive to empiric pneumonia therapy, including influenza (with or without bacterial co-infection), RSV, and finally HSV and CMV reactivation which have uncertain clinical impact.

Septic complication

Non-response could also be the result of concomitant sepsis either directly related to pneumonia or independent of a pulmonary infection. Septic complications because of pneumonia include secondary lung infection, parapneumonic pleural effusion, empyema, lung abscess, and necrotizing pneumonia. Loculated or persistent effusions frequently need a chest tube for source control, often in collaboration with interventional radiology and thoracic surgery. Other septic complications not directly due to pneumonia but that could mimic a non-responding pneumonia include endocarditis, Lemierre syndrome, acalculous cholecystitis, Clostridium difficile colitis, or other hospital-acquired infections.

### Penicillin V potassium [^cbefbe1b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of penicillin V potassium and other antibacterial drugs, penicillin V potassium should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Penicillin V potassium tablets are indicated in the treatment of mild to moderately severe infections due to penicillin G-sensitive microorganisms. Therapy should be guided by bacteriologic studies (including sensitivity tests) and by clinical response.

NOTE: Severe pneumonia, empyema, bacteremia, pericarditis, meningitis, and arthritis should not be treated with penicillin V during the acute stage. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.

The following infections will usually respond to adequate dosage of penicillin V.

Streptococcal Infections (without bacteremia)

Mild-to-moderate infections of the upper respiratory tract, scarlet fever, and mild erysipelas.

NOTE: Streptococci in groups A, C, G, H, L, and M are very sensitive to penicillin. Other groups, including group D (enterococcus), are resistant.

### Feasibility and tolerability of anlotinib plus PD-1 blockades as rechallenge immunotherapy in previously treated advanced ESCC: a retrospective study [^242d2981]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this real-world study, we shed light on the feasibility and safety of anlotinib plus ICI in the rechallenge setting after discontinuation of prior ICI-based regimens. To the best of our knowledge, this was the largest reported ESCC cohort regarding rechallenge at present. Favorable survival (mOS, 11.1 months) and safety suggested that this regimen might represent a novel promising treatment option for advanced ESCC.

Currently, no standard of care existed after the failure of ICI-based first-line therapy in ESCC, and some evidence of ICI rechallenge was demonstrated in several tumors, such as RCC and melanoma. Thus, there was growing interest in ICI rechallenge in previously ICI-treated ESCC; however, few relevant studies were available. Yao et al first reported a durable response to rechallenge with ICI monotherapy in one ESCC case. Further, the prospective CAP 02 study also demonstrated encouraging efficacy of rechallenge with camrelizumab plus apatinib in advanced ESCC (ORR, 36.8%; DCR, 89.5%; mOS, 7.5 months; PFS, 4.6 months). Despite promising responses to ICI rechallenge in the case report and CAP 02 study, data came from a limited sample size. This relatively larger-scale analysis observed favorable survival (mOS, 11.1 months; PFS, 5.6 months) and response (ORR, 19.1%; DCR, 69.1%), given the heavy burden of distant metastasis (58.2%) and clinical stage IV (78.2%). Drawing upon the data from the CAP 02 study and anlotinib monotherapy in immunotherapy-pretreated ESCC patients (PFS of 4.2 months), we reasoned that the therapeutic benefits observed in our study may arise from the combined anlotinib with ICI rechallenge rather than from either modality alone. Medication of anti-angiogenesis (anlotinib) in included patients and subsequent synergy with ICI may partly contribute to favorable antitumor activity. Some prospective evidence also supported our findings that anlotinib plus ICI conferred synergy across various tumors. Mechanically, anti-angiogenesis could reprogram tumor milieu from an immunosuppressive to an immunosupportive microenvironment, resulting in enhanced efficacy as demonstrated in preclinical models. Further, the synergistic effect between anlotinib and ICI may also partly contribute to the fact that our OS was numerically longer or comparable to that of currently recommended later-line therapies, mainly including monotherapy of ICI, chemotherapy, or targeted drugs. Baseline characteristics that almost all patients (98.2%) had ECOG of 0–1 may provide an alternative explanation for our inspiring results because ECOG PS of ≥ 2 was associated with poor efficacy. Taken together, due to the lack of compelling evidence on available regimens for this population, the combination of anlotinib plus ICI in the rechallenge setting would be a potential future strategy in the specific clinical context. Nevertheless, this should be further evaluated in larger prospective clinical trials.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^8300db3f]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Non-severe CAP inpatient treatment — Individuals with HIV who are being treated as inpatients should receive an intravenous (IV) beta-lactam plus a macrolide (AI) or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI); monotherapy with a macrolide is not recommended in the inpatient setting. In one study, beta-lactam monotherapy was not found to be non-inferior to beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, and in the monotherapy arm patients with more severe CAP, as indicated by a PSI ≥ IV, or with atypical pathogens were less likely to reach clinical stability, with more 30-day readmissions among the patients on monotherapy. Given the heterogeneity and limitations of recent studies and scarce data in patients with HIV, the recommendation for patients with HIV who are hospitalized with non-severe CAP remains the same as in people without HIV: to administer either beta-lactam/macrolide combination therapy, or a single drug regimen of a respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI). Preferred beta-lactams are ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or ampicillin-sulbactam, and preferred macrolides are azithromycin and clarithromycin.

### Colistimethate sodium [^9771e76b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNINGS

Maximum daily dose calculated from colistin base activity should not exceed 5 mg/kg/day with normal renal function.

Transient neurological disturbances may occur. These include circumoral paresthesia or numbness, tingling or formication of the extremities, generalized pruritus, vertigo, dizziness, and slurring of speech. For these reasons, patients should be warned not to drive vehicles or use hazardous machinery while on therapy. Reduction of dosage may alleviate symptoms. Therapy need not be discontinued, but such patients should be observed with particular care.

Nephrotoxicity can occur and is probably a dose-dependent effect of colistimethate sodium. These manifestations of nephrotoxicity are reversible following discontinuation of the antibiotic.

Overdosage can result in renal insufficiency, muscle weakness, and apnea (see OVERDOSAGE section). See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions subsection for use concomitantly with other antibiotics and curariform drugs.

Respiratory arrest has been reported following intramuscular administration of colistimethate sodium. Impaired renal function increases the possibility of apnea and neuromuscular blockade following administration of colistimethate sodium. Therefore, it is important to follow recommended dosing guidelines. See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section for use in renal impairment.

Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including Colistimethate for Injection, USP, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile.

C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single-dose or multiple-dose cefiderocol in hospitalized pediatric patients three months to less than eighteen years old with infections treated with standard-of-care antibiotics in the PEDI-CEFI phase 2 study [^964e55eb]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

There is a rising prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative infections in infants and children, including neonates and preterm infants. – One of the latest surveillance studies in pediatric patients from Asia, Africa and Latin America showed that carbapenem-resistant (CR) and difficult-to-treat resistant Gram-negative bacteria phenotypes are increasing. Among neonates with culture-positive sepsis, there is a high level of mortality and a considerable level of antibiotic resistance. Several antibiotics have been approved for hospitalized adult patients with infections caused by MDR and/or CR Gram-negative bacteria, – but to date, the only approved agents for use in pediatric patients are ceftazidime-avibactam to treat CR Enterobacterales and ceftolozane–tazobactam to treat MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa.–

Cefiderocol is a siderophore-conjugated cephalosporin with activity against a wide variety of aerobic Gram-negative pathogens, including MDR, CR and extensively drug-resistant organisms.– Cefiderocol is approved in Europe for the treatment of adult patients with Gram-negative bacterial infections caused by susceptible pathogens, and in the United States for adult patients with complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia, but does not yet have regulatory approval for use in children.

Cefiderocol was developed for the treatment of serious CR Gram-negative bacterial infections. It is largely stable against hydrolysis by many beta-lactamase enzymes frequently present in CR Gram-negative pathogens, including the nonfermenters Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Burkholderia cepacia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as Enterobacterales. Cefiderocol is the only beta-lactam antibiotic with in-vitro activity that extends to both serine-carbapenemases and metallo-carbapenemases and other broad-spectrum serine-beta-lactamases, such as AmpC chromosomal class C enzymes.– Cefiderocol susceptibility rates in both Europe and the United States are > 90% for a range of aerobic Gram-negative isolates collected from adult patients, although activity may be lower in regions where certain metallo-beta-lactamases (eg, New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase) are prevalent.– As expected, the in-vitro activity of cefiderocol against Gram-negative bacteria isolated from pediatric patients is comparable to that found in adult patients.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on management of gastroparesis [^92cbde28]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for gastroparesis, more specifically with respect to prokinetics and antiemetics, AGA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering erythromycin in patients with GP.
Recognize that erythromycin improves symptoms of GP due to its gastric prokinetic effects rather than a direct antiemetic effect. Recognize that erythromycin's effects on symptoms and gastric motility are through its motilin receptor agonist properties and are unrelated to its antibiotic properties. Administer low doses, such as 40–150 mg PO, 30 minutes before meals, to reduce potential adverse effects seen with higher doses, such as 250–500 mg. Use erythromycin ethylsuccinate oral suspension to administer smaller, better-tolerated doses, as erythromycin tablets are only available in high doses. Recognize that tachyphylaxis often develops with prolonged, continuous use of erythromycin; maintain efficacy using drug holidays, such as 3 weeks on therapy, 1 week off therapy. Be aware of safety concerns with erythromycin, including the development of antibiotic resistance with long-term use, drug interactions as it is a CYP3A isoform inhibitor, and QT-prolongation. Consider using azithromycin as a substitute for erythromycin, with similar safety considerations, such as antibiotic resistance.

### Bacteremia risk and outpatient management of febrile patients with sickle cell disease… [^ef705bc5]. publications.aap.org (2013). Low credibility.

Previous studies have indicated that febrile children with sickle cell disease had a 3% to 5% risk of being bacteremic due to compromised immune function. The introduction of routine penicillin prophylaxis and conjugate vaccines may have lowered the risk of bacteremia. Our goals were to determine the rate of bacteremia among children with SCD per febrile episode and to estimate the safety of outpatient management among these febrile SCD patients. This 18-year retrospective cohort study included febrile SCD patients who presented to Boston Children's Hospital between 1993 and 2010. A total of 1118 febrile episodes were evaluated. Nine blood specimens had growth of a pathogen in culture. Of the 466 febrile patients initially managed as outpatients, 3 were bacteremic. All 3 received intravenous ceftriaxone at the initial outpatient visit and returned when contacted after growth of bacteria was detected in the blood culture.

Upon return to the hospital, none were "ill appearing, " required supportive care, or were admitted to an ICU. Our rate of bacteremia among febrile children with SCD is much lower than previous estimates, and there was no associated morbidity or mortality among the patients managed as outpatients. A well-appearing febrile child with SCD may be managed as an outpatient after blood is obtained for bacterial culture and parenteral antibiotics are administered, provided there are no other reasons for admission and the patient is able to return promptly for worsening condition or for growth of a pathogen from their blood culture. Comments Rare but potentially fatal: ceftriaxone associated adverse drug reactions in children with sickle cell disease We read with interest the article by Baskin et al addressing outpatient management of febrile patients with sickle cell disease. In this study, ceftriaxone was used in the majority of cases accounting for 958 administered antibiotics.

The authors briefly mention that no patient had allergic reactions requiring ICU admission and there were no cases of ceftriaxone-induced hemolysis; however no further data were offered concerning unexpected adverse drug reactions. Practitioners should be aware though that ceftriaxone is one of the most common drugs associated with autoimmune hemolysis. 1 Although rare, ADRs such as autoimmune hemolytic anemia have been associated with ceftriaxone use in those with sickle cell disease, particularly those with prior exposure. 2–4 These reactions can occur rapidly and result in death. Thus obtaining a history of prior ceftriaxone exposure as well as having a discussion with the patient and family including symptomatology associated with intravascular hemolysis should be a part of routine outpatient management. Although outpatient management has obvious benefits when appropriate for the patient, an evident disadvantage is the inability to monitor for unpredictable adverse drug effects. Thus, education concerning these unanticipated reactions must be performed in the setting of outpatient usage, particularly when a rare and potentially catastrophic ADR has been observed in a specific population.

### Difficulty in diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis in the neonate… [^4be3de9d]. publications.aap.org (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis in the neonate is difficult. Differences in neonatal erythropoiesis, properties of neonatal erythrocytes, and both clinical and laboratory presentation contribute to complexity in diagnosis. Numerous algorithms to aid in diagnosis of neonatal hereditary spherocytosis have been developed. One of these, the HS index, the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration /mean corpuscular volume ratio, revealed an index > 0. 36 was 97% sensitive and > 99% specific in diagnosis of dominantly inherited HS in the neonate. 1 In this issue of Pediatrics, Weiss et al examine the utility of the HS index in a diverse population of neonates using data extracted from 15 Kaiser Permanente Hospitals in northern California. 2 The rationale for this study was to compare results to the original HS index study, which was performed in a primarily white population, and secondarily to determine if the index discriminates with serum bilirubin levels.

Study eligibility was determined by having had a complete blood cell count drawn in the first 7 days of life. This CBC was used to calculate the HS index, as opposed to the original study that included all CBCs on HS infants drawn in the first 90 days of life. 1 HS infants were identified by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and 10th Revision codes. Charts of infants who had osmotic fragility, ektacytometry, or eosin-5'-maleimide testing performed were also reviewed. Ektacytometry, only available in specialized laboratories, enables diagnosis of various red cell disorders including HS by measuring erythrocyte deformability as a continuous function of osmolality using a laser-diffraction viscometer. EMA is a flow cytometry–based test that measures binding of fluorescently labeled dye to band 3 and other erythrocyte membrane proteins, providing information on membrane protein deficiency as occurs in HS.

Total serum bilirubin levels were obtained in the first 30 days of life. HS prevalence was higher in white and "other" race and/or ethnicities and, not surprisingly, in patients with increased total serum bilirubin levels. HS risk was higher in infants needing phototherapy, requiring readmission for phototherapy, total serum bilirubin levels crossing exchange transfusion threshold, and requiring an exchange transfusion or a red blood cell transfusion in the first month of life. Dichotomized at 0. 36, the HS index was 56% sensitive and 93% specific. Why is HS so difficult to diagnose in the neonate. In older children and adults, diagnosing HS is straightforward with positive family history, splenomegaly, icterus, anemia, reticulocytosis, elevated MCHC, and spherocytosis. However, in neonates, a high index of suspicion is required as presentation is different. Up to a third of HS patients exhibit nondominant inheritance and these often present in the neonatal period.

3 Neonates with recessively inherited HS due to α-spectrin defects typically present with marked hemolytic anemia. 4 Patients with HS with de novo mutations, 21% of cases in a recent survey, 5 often present in the neonatal history without associated family history. This is primarily due to spontaneous mutations in ankyrin and β spectrin, both encoded by large genes with high CpG content, a finding often associated with high de novo mutation rates. 6 CpG dinucleotides are sites in DNA where a cytosine nucleotide is followed by a guanine nucleotide that may undergo methylation followed by spontaneous deamination, resulting in a cytosine-to-thymine mutation. Jaundice is the most common finding in neonates with HS, often requiring phototherapy and sometimes exchange transfusion. Compared with older children and adults, splenomegaly is uncommon.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^1ed3b136]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Outpatient CAP treatment — Individuals with HIV who are being treated as outpatients should receive an oral beta-lactam plus a macrolide (AI), or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (AI). Preferred beta-lactams are high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate; alternatives are cefpodoxime or cefuroxime, with preferred macrolides azithromycin or clarithromycin and preferred respiratory fluoroquinolones moxifloxacin or levofloxacin. A respiratory fluoroquinolone (moxifloxacin or levofloxacin) should be used as an alternative to a beta lactam in patients who are allergic to penicillin; if a patient has contraindications to a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone, then doxycycline should be given as an alternative (BIII) in addition to a beta-lactam. Empirical monotherapy with a macrolide for outpatient CAP is not routinely recommended in patients with HIV for two reasons (BIII), including erythromycin-resistant rates up to 30%, and potential resistance in those already receiving a macrolide for MAC prophylaxis; macrolides can be used as part of a combination CAP regimen.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in adults and adolescents with HIV [^eb2c46c0]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in people with HIV — recommended diagnostic evaluation: In outpatients, routine diagnostic tests to identify a bacterial etiologic diagnosis are optional, especially if microbiologic studies cannot be performed promptly. In hospitalized patients, a Gram stain of expectorated sputum and two blood cultures are recommended, particularly in severe pneumonia, in those not on ART, or in those with a CD4 count < 350 cells/mm3 (and especially if < 100 cells/mm3) prior to hospitalization; specimens should ideally be obtained before initiation of antibiotics, or within 12 hours to 18 hours of such initiation. Urinary antigen tests for L. pneumophila and S. pneumoniae are recommended in hospitalized patients, particularly with severe CAP; lower respiratory tract secretions should be cultured for Legionella on selective media or undergo Legionella nucleic acid amplification testing in adults with severe CAP, and Legionella testing should also be done in non-severe CAP when indicated by epidemiological factors (Legionella outbreak or recent travel). Microbiologic diagnostic testing is indicated whenever epidemiologic, clinical, or radiologic clues prompt suspicion of specific pathogens that could alter standard empirical management decisions. If available, rapid MRSA nasal testing should be performed, particularly with risk factors for MRSA or in a high prevalence setting, as results can direct empiric antibiotic therapy. Gram stain and culture of sputum is recommended in all hospitalized patients meeting the criteria stated above and is optional in people with HIV with CAP not meeting these criteria; in general, Gram stain and culture of expectorated sputum should be performed only if a good-quality specimen can be obtained prior to — or not more than 12hours to 18 hours after — initiation of antibiotics.

### Addition of macrolide antibiotics for hospital treatment of community-acquired pneumonia [^ed501482]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics are the main treatment for bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). In the United Kingdom (UK), guidelines from the British Thoracic Society and National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend amoxicillin for the empirical treatment of low- to moderate-severity pneumonia, and co-amoxiclav for high-severity pneumonia. For moderate- and high-severity pneumonia, these guidelines suggest combining macrolide antibiotics with amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav to provide coverage for atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma. Similarly, European and Latin American guidelines also recommend the addition of macrolides to β-lactams as empirical antibiotic therapy in hospitalized patients with severe CAP, while United States (US) guidelines recommend including atypical cover (which can be with a β-lactam + macrolide or respiratory fluroquinolone monotherapy) for all patients hospitalized with CAP.

Macrolides have also been hypothesized to improve outcomes from pneumococcal pneumonia, even when an active β-lactam is given, by means other than their antimicrobial activity (eg, anti-inflammatory effects). However, macrolide use is associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, adverse gastrointestinal events, and resistance against multiple antibiotics at both a population level and within individuals.

Existing population-based studies and clinical trials have yielded contradictory evidence.

Several retrospective and small prospective studies have suggested that dual therapy (β-lactam plus macrolide) is associated with lower mortality in patients with severe CAP. However, these findings have been challenged by other observational studies that reported no significant differences in outcomes, such as mortality and length of hospital stay, between monotherapy and combination therapy. Two meta-analyses of observational studies reported that macrolide use was associated with a significant reduction in mortality. In contrast, a noninferiority trial in non–intensive care unit (ICU) CAP patients found that monotherapy was noninferior to combination therapy in terms of 90-day mortality. Another noninferiority trial recruiting patients with moderately severe CAP reported delayed clinical stability with monotherapy but found no differences in mortality or length of stay. A recent randomized trial suggested that adding macrolides to β-lactam therapy improved clinical response and reduced the inflammatory burden, although mortality remained similar between groups.

Given these conflicting results, large observational studies may help by comparing treatment options in real-world representative populations. We therefore examined the effect of adjunctive macrolides on clinical outcomes in adults hospitalized for CAP receiving β-lactam therapy, using electronic healthcare records from a large UK teaching hospital group, extending the approach used in our recent analysis of the impact of β-lactam choice in CAP.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^5b4dc298]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

An open-label ex-U.S. study that enrolled 628 patients compared moxifloxacin tablets to sequential intravenous/oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (1.2 gram intravenously every 8 hours/625 mg orally every 8 hours) with or without high-dose intravenous/oral clarithromycin (500 mg twice a day). The intravenous formulations of the comparators are not FDA approved. The clinical success rate at Day 5 to 7 for moxifloxacin hydrochloride therapy was 93% (241/258) and demonstrated superiority to amoxicillin/clavulanate ± clarithromycin (85%, 239/280) [95% C. I. of difference in success rates between moxifloxacin and comparator (2.9%, 13.2%)]. The clinical success rate at the 21 to 28 days post-therapy visit for moxifloxacin hydrochloride was 84% (216/258), which also demonstrated superiority to the comparators (74%, 208/280) [95% C. I. of difference in success rates between moxifloxacin and comparator (2.6%, 16.3%)].

The clinical success rates by pathogen across four CAP studies are presented in Table 11.

Community Acquired Pneumonia caused by Multi-Drug Resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP)*

Moxifloxacin hydrochloride was effective in the treatment of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae MDRSP* isolates. Of 37 microbiologically evaluable patients with MDRSP isolates, 35 patients (95%) achieved clinical and bacteriological success post-therapy. The clinical and bacteriological success rates based on the number of patients treated are shown in Table 12.
