## Question

Is dual antiplatelet therapy as good for stroke prevention as an coagulation is

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is as good as anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts where DAPT and anticoagulation are indicated. Then, I should verify the comparative efficacy of DAPT versus anticoagulation in cardioembolic stroke, especially atrial fibrillation. Next, I will examine the evidence for DAPT in non-cardioembolic stroke and clarify when, if ever, DAPT is appropriate. After that, I need to check the safety profiles and bleeding risks to weigh net clinical benefit. Finally, I will synthesize guideline-based recommendations and provide a clear bottom line with caveats for special scenarios like intracranial atherosclerosis and cervical artery dissection [^111qnZ4p] [^114ffYj3].

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts because the answer hinges on stroke mechanism. Anticoagulation is indicated for cardioembolic stroke, most commonly due to atrial fibrillation, where red thrombi form in low-shear environments and require inhibition of the coagulation cascade, whereas DAPT is considered in non-cardioembolic atherothrombotic stroke where platelet-driven white thrombi predominate; conflating these settings leads to incorrect comparisons, so I need to keep them separate in my reasoning [^1165ZssL] [^112KubzT].

> Now, I will examine cardioembolic stroke prevention, especially atrial fibrillation. Wait, let me verify the head-to-head evidence: ACTIVE W showed warfarin was clearly superior to clopidogrel plus aspirin for preventing vascular events in AF, establishing that anticoagulation beats DAPT for stroke prevention in this population; ACTIVE A confirmed that even when warfarin is unsuitable, adding clopidogrel to aspirin only modestly helps and increases bleeding, reinforcing that DAPT is not a substitute for anticoagulation in AF [^114e5mbU] [^115KHjE1]. I should also confirm contemporary guidance: AHA/ASA recommends anticoagulation for AF-related stroke prevention when not contraindicated, underscoring that DAPT is not equivalent or preferred in this setting [^1157zA9R].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to check whether any AF trials suggest DAPT could rival anticoagulation. The RE-DUAL PCI program and subsequent randomized trials addressed AF patients after PCI and consistently showed that dual antithrombotic therapy (OAC plus a single P2Y12 inhibitor) reduces bleeding compared with triple therapy and is noninferior for ischemic outcomes, but this does not demonstrate equivalence of DAPT to anticoagulation; rather, it shows how to safely combine OAC with limited antiplatelet therapy in coronary disease, which is a different question altogether [^1172YZJd] [^114M2bXY].

> Next, I should review non-cardioembolic stroke, where antiplatelet therapy is standard. I will now examine whether DAPT improves outcomes over single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) and, if so, in whom and for how long. High-quality evidence shows that short-course DAPT (about 21–30 days, ideally started within 24 hours) reduces early recurrent ischemic stroke after minor non-disabling stroke or high-risk TIA, but this benefit comes with increased major bleeding, and extending DAPT beyond 90 days increases hemorrhage without further ischemic benefit; thus, DAPT is not broadly "better" than SAPT for long-term secondary prevention in non-cardioembolic stroke [^113pVt5V] [^116DNKSm] [^1147yeq5].

> Let me consider special non-cardioembolic scenarios where DAPT is sometimes favored. For symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease, guidelines suggest considering short-term DAPT over SAPT in the acute phase, but this is a targeted strategy and does not generalize to all non-cardioembolic strokes; moreover, it still requires careful bleeding risk assessment and timely de-escalation to SAPT [^111qnZ4p] [^113ztms3]. For cervical artery dissection, updated meta-analytic data suggest anticoagulation reduces ischemic stroke more than antiplatelet therapy but increases major bleeding, so the choice should be individualized rather than assuming DAPT equivalence to anticoagulation [^114ffYj3].

> I should double-check the safety balance because net clinical benefit often hinges on bleeding. Across trials and meta-analyses, short-term DAPT after minor stroke/TIA yields a meaningful absolute reduction in early ischemic recurrence but increases major bleeding, with the bleeding signal becoming more pronounced with longer durations; this is why guidelines restrict DAPT to brief courses and advise against prolonged or triple antiplatelet therapy outside specific coronary indications [^113pVt5V] [^116eTtqE] [^112z4qET].

> But wait, what if someone proposes DAPT as a "safer" alternative to anticoagulation in AF because of bleeding concerns? I need to ensure I correct that misconception. ACTIVE A shows that clopidogrel plus aspirin reduces stroke only modestly versus aspirin alone in AF and increases major bleeding, including intracranial hemorrhage; thus, DAPT is both less effective than anticoagulation and not meaningfully safer, so it should not be used as a substitute for anticoagulation in AF when anticoagulation is feasible [^115KHjE1].

> Next, I should review guideline synthesis to anchor practice. AHA/ASA recommends anticoagulation for AF-related stroke prevention and supports short-course DAPT only for carefully selected patients with minor non-cardioembolic stroke or high-risk TIA, followed by transition to SAPT; continuous DAPT beyond 90 days is discouraged due to excess bleeding, and combining antiplatelet therapy with anticoagulation is generally not indicated unless there is a separate coronary indication, in which case minimized-intensity strategies are preferred [^1157zA9R] [^111NF3pH] [^116eTtqE] [^114KQVee].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. No, DAPT is not as good as anticoagulation for stroke prevention in cardioembolic stroke due to atrial fibrillation; anticoagulation is superior and should be first-line when not contraindicated. In non-cardioembolic stroke, short-term DAPT can be superior to SAPT for early recurrence prevention after minor stroke or high-risk TIA, but this is a time-limited, context-specific strategy and does not translate into long-term superiority; prolonged DAPT increases bleeding without added ischemic benefit, so SAPT remains the standard for chronic secondary prevention outside special scenarios [^115KHjE1] [^113pVt5V] [^1147yeq5].

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is **not as effective as anticoagulation** for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation or other cardioembolic sources, where anticoagulation is the standard of care [^115KHjE1] [^1157zA9R]. DAPT is **superior to single antiplatelet therapy** for early secondary prevention after minor non-cardioembolic stroke or high-risk TIA, but only for short-term use (21–30 days) due to increased bleeding risk [^111NF3pH] [^114pzjup]. For long-term stroke prevention, anticoagulation remains superior in cardioembolic disease, whereas single antiplatelet therapy is preferred for non-cardioembolic stroke [^1165ZssL] [^114KQVee].

## Mechanisms of action and clinical indications

### Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT)

- **Mechanism**: DAPT combines aspirin (COX-1 inhibition) with a P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) to block platelet activation and aggregation, reducing thrombotic events in atherothrombotic disease [^1137Rvr9].

- **Indications**: Short-term DAPT (21–30 days) is recommended after minor non-cardioembolic stroke or high-risk TIA to reduce early recurrence, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy [^111NF3pH] [^114pzjup].

- **Limitations**: DAPT increases bleeding risk, especially intracranial hemorrhage, and is not recommended for long-term use or in cardioembolic stroke [^113pVt5V] [^112z4qET].

---

### Anticoagulation therapy

Anticoagulation inhibits **factors Xa and IIa**, preventing fibrin formation and red thrombus — the hallmark of cardioembolic stroke — and is indicated for atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, and venous thromboembolism [^1144UzVu] [^112KubzT] [^1146tD6x]. It is the cornerstone for cardioembolic stroke prevention, with warfarin and DOACs (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) providing superior efficacy to antiplatelet therapy in atrial fibrillation [^115KHjE1] [^114M2bXY].

---

## Comparative efficacy in stroke prevention

### Cardioembolic stroke (atrial fibrillation)

In cardioembolic stroke due to atrial fibrillation, **anticoagulation is superior** — warfarin and DOACs reduce stroke risk by ~60% vs placebo and ~40% vs aspirin, and are superior to DAPT (ACTIVE W) [^115KHjE1] [^114e5mbU]. DAPT is **inferior** — clopidogrel plus aspirin reduces stroke risk by only ~28% vs aspirin alone and increases bleeding, so it is not recommended when anticoagulation is indicated [^115KHjE1] [^114B7Nqn].

---

### Non-cardioembolic stroke (atherothrombotic)

In non-cardioembolic stroke, **short-term DAPT** (21–30 days) after minor stroke or high-risk TIA reduces early recurrence vs aspirin alone, but increases bleeding; therefore, it is not recommended beyond 30 days [^111auBQ5] [^115zv25U]. Single antiplatelet therapy is used for **long-term prevention** because DAPT beyond 30 days does not reduce ischemic events and increases major bleeding [^116Ue9iq] [^113xQd6n].

## Safety profiles and bleeding risks

| **Attribute** | **Dual antiplatelet therapy (dapt)** | **Anticoagulation therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Bleeding risk | Higher major bleeding, especially ICH, particularly with prolonged use [^113pVt5V] [^112z4qET] | Higher major bleeding than antiplatelets, but ICH risk varies by agent (lower with DOACs vs warfarin) [^114ffYj3] [^112a2BWD] |
| Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) | Increased risk, especially with prolonged DAPT [^112LmZoq] | Increased risk, but lower with DOACs than warfarin [^1157zA9R] |
| Clinical considerations | Limit use to 21–30 days post-minor stroke/TIA; avoid in high bleeding risk [^111auBQ5] [^114pzjup] | Use in cardioembolic stroke; monitor INR with warfarin; DOACs preferred in many patients [^1157zA9R] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Cardioembolic stroke**: Anticoagulation is first-line; DAPT is not recommended when anticoagulation is indicated [^1157zA9R].

- **Non-cardioembolic stroke**: Short-term DAPT (21–30 days) after minor stroke or high-risk TIA, then transition to single antiplatelet therapy [^111auBQ5] [^1164WDRJ] [^111NF3pH].

- **Long-term prevention**: Single antiplatelet therapy is preferred; prolonged DAPT is discouraged due to bleeding risk [^113pVt5V] [^112z4qET].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing therapy choice

- **Stroke etiology**: Cardioembolic vs non-cardioembolic dictates anticoagulation vs antiplatelet therapy [^1165ZssL].

- **Bleeding risk**: High bleeding risk favors single antiplatelet therapy or careful anticoagulant selection (e.g. DOACs) [^notfound].

- **Comorbidities**: Atrial fibrillation, mechanical valves, or venous thromboembolism favor anticoagulation [^1146tD6x].

- **Age and renal function**: Influence anticoagulant choice and dosing, especially for DOACs [^notfound].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Stroke subtype** | **Dual antiplatelet therapy (dapt)** | **Anticoagulation therapy** |
|-|-|-|
| Cardioembolic (AF) | Inferior; not recommended | Superior; first-line |
| Non-cardioembolic (atherothrombotic) | Short-term (21–30 days) superior to aspirin alone; then single antiplatelet therapy | Not indicated for long-term prevention |
| Bleeding risk | Higher, especially with prolonged use | Higher, but lower ICH risk with DOACs |
| Clinical recommendation | Short-term use only; not for cardioembolic stroke | First-line for cardioembolic stroke; not for non-cardioembolic long-term |

---

Dual antiplatelet therapy is **not as effective as anticoagulation** for stroke prevention in cardioembolic disease, particularly atrial fibrillation, where anticoagulation is superior. DAPT has a limited role in short-term secondary prevention after minor non-cardioembolic stroke or high-risk TIA, after which single antiplatelet therapy is preferred for long-term management.

Dual versus single antiplatelet therapy (DAPT vs SAPT) for ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) — systematic review and meta-analysis methods: the clinical question asked "In patients with an ischemic stroke or TIA, what are the benefits and risks of DAPT compared to SAPT within 5 years for prevention of recurrent stroke?" The literature search covered English publications from December 1999 to December 5, 2019. Inclusion criteria were phase III or IV randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of DAPT compared with SAPT that enrolled at least 100 subjects with TIA or ischemic stroke, and antiplatelet agents administered intravenously, not approved in the United States, or with other hypothesized modes of action (e.g., dipyridamole, cilostazol) were excluded. Title/abstract and full-text screening were performed independently by 2 evidence review committee (ERC) members with disagreements resolved by an ERC chair. Risk of bias was assessed using the Revised Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool v2.0, applied independently by 2 ERC members. Data were abstracted independently by 2 ERC members, capturing efficacy and safety outcomes including recurrent ischemic stroke (primary outcome), intracranial hemorrhage, all recurrent strokes, myocardial infarction, major adverse cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, vascular death, and major bleeding. Prespecified subpopulations included randomization within 72 hours of stroke/TIA onset and other clinical strata. Trials were categorized post hoc into short-duration (≤ 90 days) and long-duration (> 90 days) studies, with short-duration trials randomly assigning subjects within 7 days after stroke/TIA. Summary treatment effects were estimated using random-effects meta-analyses.

### Dilemmas in secondary stroke prevention [^117Qip22]. Stroke (2025). Medium credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention encompasses many approaches, including antithrombotic therapy, risk factor management, and a healthy lifestyle. Recommendations are typically based on the results of randomized clinical trials that provide evidence of benefit. However, in some situations, clinicians extrapolate the results of clinical trials into everyday practice, or trials have not provided sufficient information to make treatment decisions. This review will discuss 4 scenarios: dual-antiplatelet therapy, the perils of combining antiplatelet and anticoagulation, indications for statin therapy, and therapeutic considerations for patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

### Benefits and risks of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a systematic review for the 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack [^1147yeq5]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) after high-risk transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke — timing and duration — shows that when initiated soon after high-risk TIA or minor stroke and continued for 21 to 90 days, DAPT is more effective than SAPT for reducing recurrent ischemic stroke, and although pooled bleeding with early DAPT was not statistically higher, POINT showed a statistically significant higher risk of major bleeding, so the risk of bleeding should be considered and weighed against the potential benefits when initiated early after onset. When initiated within 1 to 2 months of stroke or TIA and continued for 2 to 3 years, DAPT is not associated with a lower risk of ischemic stroke but is associated with more bleeding events and therefore is not recommended in this setting. However, uncertainty surrounding these conclusions must be recognized given that few trials were identified in the systematic review and included in the meta-analyses.

### Antithrombotic therapy for primary and secondary prevention of ischemic stroke: JACC State-of-the-art review [^1165ZssL]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Stroke is a devastating condition with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Antithrombotic therapy plays a crucial role in both primary and secondary prevention of stroke events. Single or dual antiplatelet therapy is generally preferred in cases of large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel disease, whereas anticoagulation is recommended in conditions of blood stasis or hypercoagulable states that mostly result in red thrombi. However, the benefit of antithrombotic therapies must be weighed against the increased risk of bleeding, which can pose significant challenges in the pharmacological management of this condition. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the currently available evidence on antithrombotic therapy for ischemic stroke and outlines an updated therapeutic algorithm to support physicians in tailoring the strategy to the individual patient and the underlying mechanism of stroke.

### Secondary prevention of stroke and transient ischemic attack: is more platelet inhibition the answer? [^115CSEkX]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recurrent cerebrovascular events constitute an estimated 200,000 of the 700,000 strokes reported annually in the United States, which makes secondary stroke prevention an important goal in the management of disease among patients who have experienced stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Methods and Results

Various pharmacological approaches have been advocated, but the relative efficacy and safety of these regimens has remained the subject of much debate. The results of recent clinical trials on the use of antiplatelet therapy suggest that patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack may constitute a population distinct from patients with coronary or peripheral vascular disease. This may be caused, in part, by the differing etiologies of stroke and the increased vulnerability of cerebral vessels to bleeding. Indeed, dual antiplatelet therapy, which has been found to be beneficial for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary interventions, does not confer secondary stroke protection. The emerging paradigm is that some level of platelet inhibition is required for secondary stroke protection; a level beyond which increased risk of bleeding arises.

Conclusions

Because the vast majority of patients with ischemic stroke have recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack, rather than myocardial infarction, as their next event, antiplatelet therapies for these patients should be administered according to what has been shown to be efficacious for secondary stroke protection rather than for myocardial protection. Combination therapies, which provide optimal platelet inhibition as well as vascular protection, may offer the best strategy for secondary stroke protection.

### Benefits and risks of dual versus single antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a systematic review for the 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack [^116DNKSm]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Short-duration dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) meta-analysis — across three trials with a 90-day time point — found that compared with single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT), DAPT reduced recurrent ischemic stroke by 90 days (pooled RR of 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55–0.83], I2 = 37.1%), reduced total recurrent stroke (pooled RR of 0.69 [95% CI, 0.56–0.85], I2 = 41.5%), and reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; pooled RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.64–0.92], I2 = 45.5%). There was no difference between antiplatelet regimens for intracerebral hemorrhage, myocardial infarction, all-cause mortality, vascular death, or major bleeding (pooled RR of 1.88 [95% CI, 0.93–3.83], I2 = 8.9%). Results were similar when excluding one high–risk-of-bias trial, and both retained trials enrolled within 12 to 24 hours of symptom onset.

Antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention — long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) vs single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT): For long-term secondary stroke prevention, DAPT was not superior to SAPT for the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke but was associated with a significantly increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and major bleeding; the 2 long-duration trials enrolled either exclusively patients with lacunar stroke or patients with prior stroke or TIA who had at least 1 additional vascular risk factor, and results may not generalize to a broader stroke population.

Dual versus single antiplatelet therapy — meta-analysis methods grouped trials by "similar durations of treatment (≤ 90 days, > 90 days)" and outcome timing "(at 90 days for short-duration trials and longer-term outcomes for long-duration trials)". For each randomized controlled trial, unadjusted relative risk of ischemic stroke and secondary outcomes was calculated, sensitivity analyses "excluded any trial that had a high risk of bias", heterogeneity was quantified with the I^2 index using thresholds "25% often considered low; 50% moderate; and 75% high", statistical significance was set at "P < 0.05", and random-effects models by DerSimonian and Laird were implemented in Stata "version 16.0"; "The protocol for this meta-analysis was not registered".

Short-duration trials — five randomized trials "tested randomly allocated treatments for 14 to 90 days", with enrollment timing such that "participants were enrolled within 12 hours to 7 days after stroke/TIA". The number of trials included in the meta-analyses was smaller because "The number of trials included in the systematic review (n = 5) was greater than the number of trials included in the meta-analyses (n = 3) because 2 trials did not report outcomes at required time points". In terms of efficacy signal, "The risk of recurrent ischemic stroke was significantly lower in the DAPT than in the SAPT groups in the 2 larger trials"

AHA/ASA secondary stroke prevention guideline — top take-home messages emphasize tailoring strategies to stroke subtype and comprehensive risk reduction. Specific recommendations "depend on the ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack subtype", with dedicated diagnostic workup to define etiology and identify treatment targets. Vascular risk factor control "remains extremely important", including diabetes, smoking cessation, lipids, and "especially hypertension", with "Intensive medical management… usually best" and individualized goals. Lifestyle measures are highlighted: "Lifestyle factors, including healthy diet and physical activity, are important for preventing a second stroke", and "Low-salt and Mediterranean diets are recommended for stroke risk reduction"; patients "should be encouraged to perform physical activity in a supervised and safe manner". Effective behavior change "requires more than just simple advice", and programs using theoretical models, proven techniques, and multidisciplinary support "are needed". Antithrombotic therapy is broadly endorsed: "Antithrombotic therapy, including antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, is recommended for nearly all patients without contraindications", while combination therapy is generally discouraged: "the combination of antiplatelets and anticoagulation is typically not indicated", and "Dual antiplatelet therapy is not recommended long term".

Long-duration dual antiplatelet therapy trials — two randomized trials — tested treatments for an average of 18 to 40 months, with participants randomized in MATCH (mean time to randomization, 26.5 days) and SPS3 (median time to randomization, 62 days), assigned to clopidogrel plus aspirin or SAPT for at least 18 months. Neither trial showed benefit of long-duration DAPT compared with SAPT for recurrent ischemic stroke, and major hemorrhages were significantly higher in the DAPT group.

### Combining antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies [^1153MYZ5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is the cornerstone for both primary and secondary prevention therapies for ischemic events resulting from coronary atherosclerotic disease. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus a thienopyridine, usually clopidogrel) has assumed a central role in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes and after coronary stent deployment. In addition to antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulant therapy might be indicated for stroke prevention in a variety of conditions that include atrial fibrillation, profound left ventricular dysfunction, and after mechanical prosthetic heart valve replacement. For this reason, the use of triple antithrombotic therapy (a dual antiplatelet regimen plus warfarin) is expected to become more prominent, given an aging patient population. But although triple therapy can prevent both thromboembolism and stent thrombosis, it is also associated with significant bleeding hazards. Furthermore, when bleeding events do occur, the challenge of balancing the risk of stent thrombosis or stroke and the need for hemostasis requires considerable expertise. It is both prudent and timely to review treatment strategies that employ combinations of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapies as well as strategies aimed at reducing bleeding risk in patients treated with these therapies.

Antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention — short-duration dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) vs single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with early initiation: In 3 trials with early initiation (< 1 week) and short-term treatment duration (< 90 days), DAPT was superior to SAPT for prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke, any recurrent stroke, and MACE in people with minor stroke or high-risk TIA who were at low risk of bleeding; however, a meta-analysis of 2 trials found a pooled increase in risk of 88% for major bleeding with DAPT compared to SAPT, with a wide confidence interval from a reduction of 7% to an increase of 283%. Trial-specific bleeding results included increased major bleeding with DAPT in POINT (RR, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.10–4.86]) whereas CHANCE did not (RR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.25–4.00]); CHANCE classified very few bleeding events as severe, 4 in each arm, despite 20 ICH in the DAPT and 16 ICH in the SAPT groups. Thus, use of DAPT in the early setting after high-risk TIA or minor ischemic stroke should take into consideration the potential for an increased risk of bleeding.

Stroke (2019). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to patients with AF, anticoagulation therapy, AHA/ASA 2019 guidelines recommend to insufficient evidence to support adding antiplatelet therapy to OACs for purposes of reducing the risk of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with a history of ischemic stroke, AF, and coronary artery disease. Consider initiating dual antiplatelet/oral anticoagulation in patients with unstable angina and coronary artery stenting.

AHA/ASA systematic review — dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) for secondary ischemic stroke prevention found in short-duration treatment (≤ 90 days) among trials enrolling mostly patients with minor stroke or high risk transient ischemic attack that DAPT, compared with SAPT, was associated with a lower 90-day risk of recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.55–0.83], I2 = 37.0%) without a significant increase in major bleeding (pooled RR, 1.88 [95% CI, 0.93–3.83], I2 = 8.9%). In long-duration trials (> 90 days; mean treatment duration, 18–40 months), DAPT was not associated with a significant reduction in recurrent ischemic stroke (pooled RR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.79–1.02], I2 = 1.4%) but was associated with a higher risk of major bleeding (pooled RR, 2.42 [95% CI, 1.37–4.30], I2 = 75.5%). The authors conclude that DAPT was more effective than SAPT when initiated early after the onset of minor stroke/high-risk transient ischemic attack with treatment duration < 90 days, whereas when treatment was initiated later and lasted longer DAPT was not more effective than SAPT and increased the risk of bleeding.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy versus aspirin in patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115zv25U]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Antiplatelet therapy is key for preventing thrombotic events after transient ischemic attack or ischemic stroke. Although the role of aspirin is well established, there is emerging evidence for the role of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in preventing recurrent stroke.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and study-level meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials comparing outcomes of early initiation of short-term DAPT (aspirin+P2Y12 inhibitor for up to 3 months) versus aspirin alone in patients with acute stroke or transient ischemic attack. Primary efficacy outcome was risk of recurrent stroke and primary safety outcome was incidence of major bleeding. Secondary outcomes studied were risk of any ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events, and all-cause death. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and CIs were calculated using a random-effects model.

Results

Four trials with a total of 21459 patients were included. As compared to aspirin alone, DAPT had a lower risk of recurrent stroke (RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.68–0.83]; P < 0.001; I2 = 0%) but a higher risk of major bleeding events (RR, 2.22 [95% CI, 1.14–4.34], P = 0.02, I2 = 46.5%). Patients receiving DAPT had a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (RR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.69–0.84], P < 0.001, I2 = 0%) and recurrent ischemic events (RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.67–0.82], P < 0.001, I2 = 0%).

Conclusions

As compared to aspirin alone, short-term DAPT within 24 hours of high-risk transient ischemic attack or mild-moderate ischemic stroke reduces the risk of recurrent stroke at the expense of higher risk of major bleeding.

### European Stroke Organisation expedited recommendation for the use of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy early after minor stroke and high-risk TIA [^111XAKGD]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prevention of early recurrent ischaemic stroke remains a priority in people with TIA or ischaemic stroke. A number of trials have recently been completed assessing the efficacy of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy early after minor or moderate stroke and high-risk TIA.

The role of dual antiplatelet treatment will be considered in both the European Stroke Organisation's guidelines for management of TIA and guidelines for secondary prevention of ischaemic stroke, yet their use is rapidly increasing. Therefore, in advance of their publication, we present an Expedited Recommendation for use of dual antiplatelet therapy early after minor ischaemic stroke and TIA on behalf of the ESO Guideline Board.

We considered evidence for use of DAPT early after minor or moderate ischaemic stroke and high-risk TIA. We considered DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin separately from DAPT with ticagrelor and aspirin.

Meta-analysis scope and limitations for DAPT versus SAPT indicate that conclusions for prespecified subpopulations could not be drawn because randomization-respecting subgroup data were unavailable; fewer trials were included than in other meta-analyses; trials with additional stroke-prevention mechanisms (eg, cilostazol, dipyridamole) were excluded to isolate antiplatelet effects; strengths included an ERC with no industry relationships, a prespecified plan, focus on drugs with only antiplatelet effects, and large trials; and limitations included a limited number of eligible studies, different aspirin doses and different drugs used for the second arm, heterogeneity in timing of treatment initiation, study samples and outcome collection, low power to identify heterogeneity, and small differences in definitions of MACE, major bleeding, and ICH across trials.

### Dual-pathway inhibition for secondary and tertiary antithrombotic prevention in cardiovascular disease [^1144UzVu]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Advances in antiplatelet therapies for patients with cardiovascular disease have improved patient outcomes over time, but the challenge of balancing the risks of ischaemia and bleeding remains substantial. Moreover, many patients with cardiovascular disease have a residual risk of ischaemic events despite receiving antiplatelet therapy. Therefore, novel strategies are needed to prevent clinical events through mechanisms beyond platelet inhibition and with an acceptable associated risk of bleeding. The advent of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, which attenuate fibrin formation by selective inhibition of factor Xa or thrombin, has renewed the interest in dual-pathway inhibition strategies that combine an antiplatelet agent with an anticoagulant drug. In this Review, we highlight the emerging pharmacological rationale and clinical development of dual-pathway inhibition strategies for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with different manifestations of cardiovascular disease, such as coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral artery disease.

### New oral anticoagulants in addition to single or dual antiplatelet therapy after an acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111cn3Jo]. European Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Despite contemporary evidence-based care, – including revascularization and dual antiplatelet therapy, patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) remain at risk of recurrent ischaemic events. Oral vitamin K antagonists have been shown to prevent recurrent ischaemic events after ACS, both as mono-therapy and in combination with aspirin, but substantially increase bleeding and are cumbersome to use because of multiple interactions with food and drugs, and the need for frequent laboratory monitoring. Evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of the combination of dual antiplatelet therapy and old oral anticoagulants, i.e. vitamin K antagonists, is limited but registry data indicate a high risk of major bleeding.

New oral anticoagulants offer advantages to warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. – Their potential as antithrombotic therapy after ACSs has been investigated during the last years. The first experience in this setting used an oral direct thrombin inhibitor, ximelagatran, later withdrawn from the market because of liver toxicity, and showed a reduction in the composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke when added to aspirin for 6 months after an ACS. Another oral direct thrombin inhibitor, dabigatran, and three novel oral direct factor Xa inhibitors — apixaban, rivaroxaban, and darexaban — added to single and/or dual antiplatelet therapy have recently been evaluated in phase II trials in ACS patients. – All phase II trials have shown a definite increase in the incidence of bleeding with the combination of oral anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, but were under-powered for the evaluation of efficacy. The phase III study with apixabanin high-risk ACS patients, in doses shown to be effective for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, was terminated prematurely due to increased bleeding without evidence for efficacy. The phase III study with rivaroxaban, in doses lower than evaluated for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, showed significant reductions in the composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke overall and at each dose and reductions in mortality, but also an increased rate of major bleeding. Given the consistent increases in bleeding and the less consistent reduction in ischaemic events, the overall benefit–risk profile of adding new oral anticoagulants to antiplatelet treatment after an ACS is unknown.

We hypothesized that the addition of a novel oral anticoagulant to antiplatelet therapy after an ACS would decrease subsequent major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) but increase bleeding; that these effects would vary by the number of concomitant antiplatelet drugs; and that the effects on bleeding would be inversely related to the effects on MACEs.

Five years after the results of CHANCE were published, POINT (Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke), a large double-blind RCT aiming to test the dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin worldwide, has recently published its results. Therefore, in order to fully explore the efficacy and safety of early dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention, we updated the previous systematic review and meta-analysis of dual versus mono antiplatelet therapy for patients with acute non-cardioembolic IS or TIA within 3 days of symptom onset.

### Contemporary antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention: a narrative review of current literature and guidelines [^116Ue9iq]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Antiplatelet therapy is one of the mainstays for secondary stroke prevention. This narrative review aimed to highlight the current evidence and recommendations of antiplatelet therapy for stroke prevention.

We conducted advanced literature search for antiplatelet therapy. Landmark studies and randomised controlled trials evaluating antiplatelet therapy for secondary stroke prevention are reviewed. Results from Cochrane systematic review, pooled data analysis and meta-analysis are discussed.

Single-antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) with aspirin, aspirin/extended-release dipyridamole or clopidogrel reduces the risk of recurrent ischaemic stroke in patients with non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA). Dual-antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel or ticagrelor for 21–30 days is more effective than SAPT in patients with minor acute noncardioembolic ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA. Prolonged use of DAPT is associated with higher risk of haemorrhage without reduction in stroke recurrence than SAPT. Compared with placebo, aspirin reduces the relative risk of recurrent stroke by approximately 22%. Aspirin/dipyridamole and cilostazol are superior to aspirin but associated with significant side effects. Cilostazol or ticagrelor might be more effective than aspirin or clopidogrel in patients with intracranial stenosis.

SAPT is indicated for secondary stroke prevention in patients with non-cardioembolic ischaemic stroke or TIA. DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel or ticagrelor for 21–30 days followed by SAPT is recommended for patients with minor acute noncardioembolic stroke or high-risk TIA. Selection of appropriate antiplatelet therapy should also be based on compliance, drug tolerance or resistance.

There remains a paucity of data to inform primary prevention of stroke in people with APS; further clarification is needed on whether direct oral anticoagulants (all or some) are less effective than warfarin to reduce the risk of stroke in this population and on the role of dual antiplatelets in APS, with reports suggesting a possible preventive role or in addition to anticoagulation.

A number of trials have recently been completed assessing the efficacy of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) versus single antiplatelet therapy early after minor or moderate stroke or high-risk TIA. We present an Expedited Recommendation for use of dual antiplatelet therapy early after ischaemic stroke and TIA on behalf of the ESO Guideline Board. We make a strong recommendation based on high quality of evidence for use of 21-days of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel in people with a non-cardioembolic minor ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA in the past 24hours. We make a weak recommendation based on moderate quality evidence for 30-days of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and ticagrelor in people with non-cardioembolic mild to moderate ischaemic stroke or high-risk TIA in the past 24hours.

Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

3 DISCUSSION

In patients with AF undergoing PCI, the issue of how to balance the need for multiple antithrombotic drugs for prevention of thrombosis against the high risk of bleeding has remained a conundrum for clinicians for the past decade. A recent registry analysis 35 as well as a survey 23 found that physician practices vary widely regarding the perceived optimal antithrombotic strategy.

A wide spectrum of strategies can be considered for use in this population (Figure 3). With many different P2Y 12 inhibitors available in current practice, and 4 NOACs, some with different doses, more than 25 possible drug combinations are available. In addition, different durations of antiplatelet therapy can be used, leading to hundreds of possible treatment strategies. Although this variety offers great options for patients and physicians, very few data support any of them other than the standard triple antithrombotic therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and warfarin. As noted above, antiplatelet monotherapy is not sufficient for stroke prevention, nor is dual antiplatelet therapy alone (although this has not been tested with the more potent drugs). On the other end of the spectrum, use of triple antithrombotic therapy for 1 year has an unacceptable increased risk of bleeding. 13, 20, 36

Figure 3
Options for antithrombotic regimens in patients with AF undergoing PCI. Additional nuances of these strategies could be applied by changing the duration of antiplatelet therapy. Abbreviations: AF, atrial fibrillation; NOAC, non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant; PCI, percutaneous coronary intervention.

The RE‐DUAL PCI trial aims to study several new strategies for antithrombotic treatment in these patients, and 3 regimens across the spectrum of intensity have been selected. The 2 dual antithrombotic therapy regimens will include a NOAC — dabigatran etexilate — at both of the doses shown to be effective and approved (worldwide). These doses of dabigatran offer a sufficient level of anticoagulation, providing a similar (110 mg) or superior (150 mg) effect to warfarin for stroke prevention. 16 RE‐DUAL PCI will not seek to re‐prove the efficacy of dabigatran for stroke prevention, but rather will look at the overall balance of safety and efficacy as part of the dual antithrombotic strategy.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^116c2hck]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Knowledge gaps and future research — dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) has uncertain optimal duration and hemorrhage tradeoffs; most trials used aspirin and clopidogrel for 21 to 90 days, and whether the duration should be 21 days, 90 days, or some other amount of time is not fully established, and the exact duration at which hemorrhage risk outweighs stroke-prevention benefit is unknown. Older patients and those with more severe stroke appear to be at higher risk of ICH with DAPT. Triple antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel, and dipyridamole in TARDIS, compared with standard antiplatelet therapy, found no difference in stroke outcomes and a significantly increased risk of bleeding with triple therapy. There may be other non–stroke-related indications for DAPT beyond 90 days after stroke, but these indications should be clarified to ensure that DAPT is not continued indefinitely beyond the clinically recommended time frame.

### Indications for dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel: evidence-based recommendations for use [^114B7Nqn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature assessing dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel and subsequently provide evidence-based recommendations for appropriate indications and length of therapy.

Data Sources

An English-language MEDLINE search (1950-December 2007) was conducted using the search terms antiplatelet, aspirin, thienopyridine, and clopidogrel to identify articles assessing dual antiplatelet therapy. Evaluation of references from identified trials for possible inclusion was also conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All studies that assessed treatment with the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel for any indication were included.

Data Synthesis

Aspirin and clopidogrel have complementary mechanisms of action to inhibit platelet function. Indications that have been studied include coronary artery disease (CAD), atherosclerotic ischemic stroke, and atrial fibrillation. This combination has been beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with or without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and in PCI patients without an acute event. There is a small but significant risk for increased bleeding with dual antiplatelet therapy for these indications. When used in patients with a history of atherosclerotic ischemic stroke or for prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, this combination has been shown to increase bleeding, providing no clinical benefit, and to increase outcomes including stroke, myocardial infarction, and death, respectively.

Conclusions

There is evidence to support use of aspirin in combination with clopidogrel for patients presenting with all ACS types, as well as for patients presenting with PCI for any indication. The treatment duration varies, but patients who have received stenting should receive at least 1 year of combination therapy. There is no evidence to support this combination for primary prevention of CAD or atherosclerotic ischemic events, secondary prevention of stable CAD, or prevention of cardioembolic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. The possible benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy also must be weighed against the risk of bleeding.

### Current treatments in neurology: stroke [^112w5bJB]. Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

There have been major advances in stroke treatment based on robust evidence from large clinical trials. This review covers both acute treatment and secondary prevention. Thrombolysis is now established as a therapy for ischaemic stroke presenting within 3 hours, and the possibility of extending the time window and refining the selection of suitable patients, is being addressed in further trials. Anticoagulants are of proven benefit in cardioembolic stroke, and particularly atrial fibrillation. For prevention of other stroke subtypes antiplatelet agents appear to have a better risk-benefit ratio. Evidence for the use of dual antiplatelet therapy, including the recent MATCH study, are discussed. Carotid endarterectomy is of proven benefit in patients with > 70% symptomatic stenosis. Recent analysis has emphasised the importance of operating as soon after symptom onset as possible. Operating on asymptomatic carotid stenosis remains controversial; even after the recent Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial which showed that by operating on 32 people one disabling stroke or death could be prevented over a 5 years period.

### Triple therapy in hospitalized patients: facts and controversies [^116G916a]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The use of triple therapy (warfarin plus dual antiplatelet therapy) has increased in recent years due to an aging population with a higher risk for atrial fibrillation, as well as the increased use of coronary stents for acute coronary syndromes. Triple therapy confers a higher bleeding risk than either warfarin or dual antiplatelet therapy alone. However, warfarin alone is inadequate for patients with indications for triple therapy because of an unacceptable risk of stent thrombosis, and dual antiplatelet therapy is inferior to warfarin for the prevention of ischemic strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation, mechanical valves, or intraventricular thrombosis. Hospitalists face the challenge of balancing the aforementioned risks; the optimal management of these patients requires knowledge of the relevant literature and expertise. In this paper, we review the current literature on antiplatelet and anticoagulant combinations in patients with atrial fibrillation and coronary stents in order to improve adherence to published guidelines and to reduce the risk of bleeding.

### Risk-benefit profile of long-term dual-versus single-antiplatelet therapy among patients with ischemic stroke: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Y2jRj]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Dual-antiplatelet regimens for prevention of recurrent stroke promote antithrombotic effects but may increase the risk for hemorrhage.

Purpose

To qualitatively and quantitatively examine the risk for recurrent stroke and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) linked to long-term dual- and single-antiplatelet therapy among patients with ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through March 2013 without language restrictions.

Study Selection

The search identified 7 randomized, controlled trials that involved a total of 39,574 participants and reported recurrent stroke and ICH as outcome measures.

Data Extraction

All data from eligible studies were independently abstracted by 2 investigators according to a standard protocol.

Data Synthesis

Recurrent stroke risk did not differ between patients receiving dual-antiplatelet therapy and those receiving aspirin monotherapy (relative risk [RR], 0.89 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.01]) or clopidogrel monotherapy (RR, 1.01 [CI, 0.93 to 1.08]). Risk for ICH did not differ between patients receiving dual-antiplatelet therapy and those receiving aspirin monotherapy (RR, 0.99 [CI, 0.70 to 1.42]) but was greater among patients receiving dual-antiplatelet therapy than among those receiving clopidogrel monotherapy (RR, 1.46 [CI, 1.17 to 1.82]).

Limitation

Agents used in dual- and single-antiplatelet therapies varied across trials, and the relatively modest number of trials limited subgroup analysis.

Conclusion

Compared with monotherapy, dual-antiplatelet therapy lasting more than 1 year after an index ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack is not associated with a greater reduction in overall recurrent stroke risk. However, long-term dual-antiplatelet therapy is linked to higher risk for ICH than clopidogrel monotherapy in this patient population.

### Applying contemporary antithrombotic therapy in the secondary prevention of chronic atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^115YdJmo]. American Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

For 4 decades, antithrombotic therapy with aspirin has been a cornerstone of secondary prevention for patients with chronic atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Unfortunately, despite the use of evidence-based therapies, patients with ASCVD continue to have recurrent major adverse cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction, and stroke-at a rate of approximately 2%-4% per year. To combat this continuing risk, several recent trials have evaluated the efficacy and safety of more intensive antithrombotic strategies through prolonged dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), combining a P2Y12 receptor antagonists and low-dose aspirin, or alternatively applying a dual pathway inhibition approach, combining low-dose non-vitamin K antagonist anticoagulant and low-dose aspirin. Both combination strategies have been shown to reduce recurrent ischemic events but at the cost of increased bleeding events. The clinical application of these antithrombotic strategies requires clinicians to assess and balance the risk of recurrent ischemic and bleeding events in an individual patient. Furthermore, clinicians may also need to adapt their antithrombotic strategies to achieve best patient outcomes, as ASCVD is a progressive disease and the risks of cardiovascular ischemic and bleeding events may shift over time. This state-of-the-art article reviews evidence from the trials and provides a practical approach to the application of DAPT and dual pathway antithrombotic therapy in the long-term management of patients with chronic ASCVD.

### Dual (anticoagulant plus single antiplatelet) vs triple (anticoagulant plus dual antiplatelet) antithrombotic therapy-"Real world" experience [^116zCquk]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia that increases in prevalence with advancing age and in patients with coronary artery disease, revascularization, particularly with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), is also common. Both disease states have thrombosis as a core pathophysiologic process which requires treatment - low sheer stress thrombi in AF and intracoronary high sheer stress thrombi in PCI. For the 10–20% of patients who have both AF and undergo PCI, preventing thrombotic complications will require inhibition of both processes requiring simultaneous use of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. There is a broad experience of combining oral anticoagulation therapy, used to prevent stroke and systemic embolization, in AF with dual antiplatelet therapy, used to prevent stent thrombosis and thrombotic coronary events. This "triple antithrombotic therapy" (TT) has been evaluated through many observation studies, both small and large. TT has more frequently been associated with a significant increase in bleeding events with non-significant reduction in thrombotic events. Current guidelines recommend shorter duration of TT, especially in patients with high risk of bleeding.

Secondary stroke prevention — single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT) when dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) criteria are not met is supported as follows: For those who do not meet DAPT clinical criteria, SAPT is recommended, and comparative trials report mixed advantages among agents; for example, ProFESS found no difference for aspirin–dipyridamole versus clopidogrel, ESPRIT/ESPS2 suggested aspirin–dipyridamole may be slightly more effective than aspirin alone and that aspirin is more effective than placebo, and CAPRIE found fewer events with clopidogrel versus aspirin overall without stroke-subgroup benefit. In lacunar stroke, a pooled analysis suggested evaluated antiplatelets were similarly effective versus placebo. Aspirin dosing may be guided by weight-based data from primary prevention randomized controlled trials (RCTs) — aspirin 75–100 mg for patients weighing < 70 kg and higher doses for those > 70 kg — though similar studies have not been performed for secondary stroke prevention.

### Analysis of prescriptions for dual antiplatelet therapy after acute ischemic stroke [^117PsrSh]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Study Population

This cohort study was a retrospective analysis of patients admitted for acute ischemic stroke and prescribed antiplatelet therapy at discharge from participating GWTG-Stroke hospitals in the US after the release of the 2019 AHA/ASA guidelines in October 2019and before the publication of the THALES (Ticagrelor and Aspirin for Prevention of Stroke and Death) clinical trialin June 2020. Patients hospitalized for elective carotid intervention only, such as carotid endarterectomy or stent, and patients presenting with TIA were not included. Additional details about inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Figure 1. In brief, we excluded patients with indications for anticoagulant therapy, such as those with atrial fibrillation or a prosthetic cardiac valve, those who received anticoagulant therapy before their stroke, and those who received a prescription for an anticoagulant at discharge. We further excluded patients who received thrombolytic or endovascular therapy because these therapies were part of the CHANCEand POINTexclusion criteria and patients who were missing information on NIHSS score and the type of antiplatelet therapy prescribed at discharge.

Study Population

DAPT indicates dual antiplatelet therapy; GWTG-Stroke, Get With The Guidelines–Stroke program; and NIHSS, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.

Antiplatelet agents were categorized into 5 groups: (1) aspirin alone; (2) clopidogrel alone; (3) DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel; (4) aspirin and dipyridamole; and (5) other antiplatelet agents, such as ticlopidine, prasugrel, or ticagrelor, either alone or in combination with aspirin. Although DAPT technically refers to a combination of any 2 antiplatelet agents, for the purposes of the current study, DAPT denoted the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel. Ticlopidine is rarely used in current clinical practice owing to a higher risk of severe adverse effects, and prasugrel is contraindicated in patients with stroke. Although the 2021 AHA/ASA secondary prevention guidelinesissued a new class 2b (weak recommendation), level of evidence B-R (moderate-quality evidence from ≥ 1 RCT or meta-analyses of moderate-quality RCTs), recommendation for ticagrelor plus aspirin for patients with minor to moderate stroke (NIHSS score ≤ 5) after the publication of the THALES clinical trial, ticagrelor alone and ticagrelor plus aspirin were not commonly used during our study period. Therefore, these antiplatelet agents were grouped together in the other antiplatelet or combination therapy category.

Established CAD — dual antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel plus aspirin) vs aspirin alone — only one large-scale RCT, the CHARISMA trial, followed 15,603 patients for a mean of 28 months and failed to demonstrate or exclude an effect of dual therapy on total mortality or nonfatal MI; dual antiplatelet therapy was associated with a possible reduction in nonfatal stroke and a possible increase in nonfatal extracranial bleeding, with the quality of evidence rated moderate due to imprecise effect estimates.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113djaSV]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Antiphospholipid syndrome — Evidence and testing considerations for secondary stroke prevention: In a WARSS (Warfarin-Aspirin Recurrent Stroke Study) subgroup, investigators found no differential stroke risk reduction in people with a 1-time positive antiphospholipid antibody with warfarin (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.75–1.31]) or aspirin (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.70–1.28]; treatment-by-antiphospholipid interaction, P = 0.91), and therefore aspirin is more preferable than warfarin because of the lower risk of bleeding with aspirin. Approximately 13% of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome have stroke as the initial clinical manifestation of the disease. In patients with cryptogenic stroke and a history of thrombosis or rheumatological disease, it would seem reasonable to consider testing for antiphospholipid antibodies, whereas in older populations with increasing frequency of vascular risk factors, there is no evidence supporting the systematic testing for antiphospholipid antibodies. Although no trials of antithrombotic intervention have been performed exclusively in stroke patients, the available evidence favors anticoagulation with VKA compared with aspirin to reduce recurrent arterial thromboses; an INR with a target range of 2 to 3 is preferable over an INR with a target range > 3, and when anticoagulation has been tested against aspirin, an INR of 2 to 3 is a typical range to be used as a comparison arm. Limited evidence also notes that in a small (N = 20) RCT comparing a single-antiplatelet arm versus a triple-therapy arm (dual antiplatelets plus anticoagulation), participants with single antiplatelets had a higher risk of recurrent stroke (log-rank test, P = 0.026) with similar rates of hemorrhage during a mean follow-up of 3.9 years, and the clinical consensus favors using only anticoagulation.

### Atherothrombosis and the role of antiplatelet therapy [^114R38CV]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2011). Low credibility.

Atherothrombosis remains a major global public health problem. Chronic atherosclerotic disease is often clinically silent and coexists across vascular beds, but when complicated by thrombosis can result in acute coronary syndrome, stroke, transient ischaemic attack and critical limb ischaemia. Platelets play a role in the development of chronic atherosclerotic disease and are a key mediator of clinical events in atherothrombosis. Numerous trials have examined the role of antiplatelet agents in primary and secondary prevention and several new antiplatelet drugs are under development. In secondary prevention, there is evidence of clear benefit of single and in some cases dual antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of recurrent cerebro-vascular complications. Dual antiplatelet therapy has emerged as the standard of care in acute coronary syndromes, with aspirin typically being used in combination with clopidogrel or one of the newer more potent antiplatelet agents. Conversely, in chronic stable coronary disease, no benefit has yet been convincingly demonstrated from dual antiplatelet therapy. In cerebro-vascular disease, aspirin monotherapy remains the cornerstone of prevention of recurrent events, with clopidogrel or the combination of aspirin and dipyridamole being only modestly more efficacious. In primary prevention, the evidence for the routine use of aspirin or any other antiplatelet agent is mixed and suggests this should only be considered on an individual basis in high-risk groups where the thrombotic risk outweighs the risk of major bleeding complications.

### Cardioembolic stroke: everything has changed [^112KubzT]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Importance of anticoagulation for cardioembolic stroke

In considering prevention of cardioembolic stroke, it is crucial to understand that antiplatelet agents are not anticoagulants. Antiplatelet agents prevent formation of white thrombus (platelet aggregates that form in the setting of fast flow, in arteries and perhaps on heart valves). The kind of thrombus that forms in the setting of stasis, such as in the left atrial appendage in atrial fibrillation, in ventricular dyskinesia and in deep veins (leading to paradoxical embolism), is called red thrombus. It results from polymerisation of fibrin, formation of a mesh of long fibrin strands similar to cotton wool, with entrapped red blood cells. To prevent formation of red thrombus it is necessary to use anticoagulants. This is why antiplatelet agents are much less effective than anticoagulants in preventing stroke from atrial fibrillation.

Many physicians are reluctant to prescribe anticoagulants, based on bad experiences with warfarin. Haemorrhage rates are much higher in the real world than in clinical trials, and haemorrhages tend to occur early after initiation of warfarin. Gomes et al reported that among patients with a high risk of stroke from atrial fibrillation, more than 16% had a haemorrhage within 30 days of initiating warfarin. This is a serious problem; many studies report that more than half of patients who should be anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation do not receive anticoagulants at all. A higher proportion is not effectively anticoagulated: Gladstone et al reported that among patients with atrial fibrillation and first-ever stroke, after excluding patients with known contraindications to anticoagulation (not to antiplatelet therapy), only 10% were adequately anticoagulated. Some physicians, thinking that antiplatelet therapy is safer than anticoagulation, may consider dual antiplatelet therapy for patients who are reluctant to take warfarin, or in whom it is thought that warfarin is not safe. That approach does not work; Connolly et al reported that adding clopidogrel to aspirin reduced stroke from atrial fibrillation by only 0.67%.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy versus oral anticoagulation plus dual antiplatelet therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation and low-to-moderate thromboembolic risk undergoing coronary stenting: design of the MUSICA-2 randomized trial [^114y3b98]. American Heart Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is the recommended therapy for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) because it reduces the risk of stroke and other thromboembolic events. Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) is required after percutaneous coronary intervention and stenting (PCI-S). In patients with AF requiring PCI-S, the association of DAPT and OAC carries an increased risk of bleeding, whereas OAC therapy or DAPT alone may not protect against the risk of developing new ischemic or thromboembolic events.

Objective

The MUSICA-2 study will test the hypothesis that DAPT compared with triple therapy (TT) in patients with nonvalvular AF at low-to-moderate risk of stroke (CHADS2 score ≤ 2) after PCI-S reduces the risk of bleeding and is not inferior to TT for preventing thromboembolic complications.

Design

The MUSICA-2 is a multicenter, open-label randomized trial that will compare TT with DAPT in patients with AF and CHADS2 score ≤ 2 undergoing PCI-S. The primary end point is the incidence of stroke or any systemic embolism or major adverse cardiac events: death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, or target vessel revascularization at 1 year of PCI-S. The secondary end point is the combination of any cardiovascular event with major or minor bleeding at 1 year of PCI-S. The calculated sample size is 304 patients.

Conclusions

The MUSICA-2 will attempt to determine the most effective and safe treatment in patients with nonvalvular AF and CHADS2 score ≤ 2 after PCI-S. Restricting TT for AF patients at high risk for stroke may reduce the incidence of bleeding without increasing the risk of thromboembolic complications.

### Dual or mono antiplatelet therapy for patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1132zNu9]. Stroke (2012). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Antiplatelets are recommended for patients with acute noncardioembolic stroke or transient ischemic attack. We compared the safety and efficacy of dual versus mono antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.

Methods

Completed randomized controlled trials of dual versus mono antiplatelet therapy in patients with acute (≤ 3 days) ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack were identified using electronic bibliographic searches. The primary outcome was recurrent stroke (ischemic, hemorrhagic, unknown; fatal, nonfatal). Comparison of binary outcomes between treatment groups was analyzed with random effect models and described using risk ratios (95% CI).

Results

Twelve completed randomized trials involving 3766 patients were included. In comparison with mono antiplatelet therapy, dual therapy (aspirin+dipyridamole and aspirin+clopidogrel) significantly reduced stroke recurrence, dual 58 (3.3%) versus mono 91 (5.0%; risk ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49–0.93); composite vascular event (stroke, myocardial infarction, vascular death), dual 74 (4.4%) versus mono 106 (6%; risk ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.56–0.99); and the combination of stroke, transient ischemic attack, acute coronary syndrome, and all death, dual 100 (1.7%) versus mono 136 (9.1%; risk ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.56–0.91); dual therapy was also associated with a nonsignificant trend to increase major bleeding, dual 15 (0.9%) versus mono 6 (0.4%; risk ratio, 2.09; 95% CI, 0.86–5.06).

Conclusions

Dual antiplatelet therapy appears to be safe and effective in reducing stroke recurrence and combined vascular events in patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack as compared with mono therapy. These results need to be tested in prospective studies.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^112nDtHH]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without stent — comparative evidence and evidence gaps: Warfarin plus aspirin is associated with a significant reduction in risk of subsequent myocardial infarction and stroke vs aspirin alone after ACS, with MI relative risk 0.69 (95% CI, 0.54–0.88) and stroke relative risk 0.56 (95% CI, 0.39–0.82); point estimates are greater than those seen with clopidogrel plus aspirin vs aspirin alone (relative risk, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.89; and 0.86; 95% CI, 0.63–1.18 in CURE). There are no RCTs comparing warfarin plus single antiplatelet therapy to dual antiplatelet therapy, and no studies comparing warfarin plus aspirin to triple therapy in AF with recent ACS; triple therapy may not be associated with net clinical benefit compared with dual antiplatelet therapy unless patients are at substantially high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2 score of ≥ 2), and use would be appropriate only if the risk reduction in MI and stroke achieved by adding the second antiplatelet agent is greater than the increase in bleeding risk.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1157zA9R]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Secondary stroke prevention — AHA/ASA key points 6–10 state that atrial fibrillation remains a common and high-risk condition for second ischemic stroke, and anticoagulation is usually recommended if the patient has no contraindications; heart rhythm monitoring for occult atrial fibrillation is usually recommended if no other cause of stroke is discovered. Extracranial carotid artery disease is an important and treatable cause of stroke, and patients with severe stenosis ipsilateral to a nondisabling stroke or transient ischemic attack who are candidates for intervention should have the stenosis fixed, likely relatively early after their ischemic stroke; the choice between carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting should be driven by specific patient comorbidities and features of their vascular anatomy. Patients with severe intracranial stenosis in the vascular territory of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack should not receive angioplasty and stenting as a first-line therapy for preventing recurrence, and aggressive medical management of risk factors and short-term dual antiplatelet therapy are preferred. For selected patients with patent foramen ovale, it is now considered reasonable to percutaneously close patent foramen ovale in patients who meet each of the following criteria: age 18–60 years, nonlacunar stroke, no other identified cause, and high risk patent foramen ovale features. Patients with embolic stroke of uncertain source should not be treated empirically with anticoagulants or ticagrelor because it was found to be of no benefit.

### Antithrombotic therapy for stroke prevention in patients with ischemic stroke with aspirin treatment failure [^115VyidM]. Stroke (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Many older patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke were already taking aspirin before admission. However, the management strategy for patients with aspirin treatment failure has not been fully established.

Methods

We used data from the American Heart Association Get With The Guidelines Stroke Registry to describe discharge antithrombotic treatment patterns among Medicare beneficiaries with ischemic stroke who were taking aspirin before their stroke and were discharged alive from 1734 hospitals in the United States between October 2012 and December 2017.

Results

Of 261634 ischemic stroke survivors, 100016 (38.2%) were taking aspirin monotherapy before stroke. Among them, 44.4% of patients remained on aspirin monotherapy at discharge (20.9% 81 mg, 18.2% 325 mg, 5.3% other or unknown dose). The next most common therapy choice was dual antiplatelet therapy (24.6%), followed by clopidogrel monotherapy (17.8%). The remaining 13.2% of patients were discharged on either aspirin/dipyridamole, warfarin, or nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants with or without antiplatelet, or no antithrombotic therapy at all.

Conclusions

Nearly half of patients with ischemic stroke while on preventive therapy with aspirin are discharged on aspirin monotherapy without changing antithrombotic class, while the other half are discharged on clopidogrel monotherapy, dual antiplatelet therapy, or other less common agents. These findings emphasize the need for future research to identify best management strategies for this very common and complex clinical scenario.

### Are drug eluting stents worth triple therapy? [^1145B1cr]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately 8% patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention are on anticoagulation, which creates difficult choices regarding stent type and antiplatelet use. 1 Drug eluting stents (DES) are usually preferred over bare metal stents (BMS) because of less restenosis and fewer repeat revascularization procedures. However, DES require a longer duration of dual antiplatelet therapy to minimize the chance of stent thrombosis. Typically, this is 6 months of dual antiplatelet therapy for DES compared with 1 month for BMS in patients with stable ischemic heart disease. 2 In a patient already on anticoagulation, adding dual antiplatelet therapy (now triple therapy) poses a significant risk of bleeding: a 2‐ to 3‐fold increase per recent studies. 2 The need for triple therapy can be reduced by using a BMS, but is the decreased risk of bleeding worth the increased restenosis risk?

Ideally, we would know the benefits and risks of double versus triple therapy, different durations of each strategy, DES versus BMS, and the various permutations. Current European guidelines recommend only 1 month of triple therapy following a DES in those at high risk for bleeding, whereas North American guidelines suggest that triple therapy can be stopped after 3 months; with a switch to dual therapy, this is only a IIb recommendation. 2 However, this is only a IIb recommendation indicating it "may be considered" instead of using the usual 6 months of DAPT. These recommendations are supported, in part, by the ISAR‐TRIPLE (Intracoronary Stenting and Antithrombotic Regimen‐Testing of a 6‐Week Versus a 6‐Month Clopidogrel Treatment Regimen in Patients with Concomitant Aspirin and Oral Anticoagulant Therapy Following Drug‐Eluting Stenting) study, which compared 6 weeks to 6 months of clopidogrel on top of warfarin and aspirin for those undergoing DES implantation. 3 Among 614 patients, the primary end point of death, myocardial infarction (MI), stent, thrombosis, stroke, or major bleeding at 9 months was slightly, but not significantly, higher in those treated with the shorter 6‐weeks of clopidogrel (9.8% versus 8.8%, P = 0.63). 3 The secondary end point of Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction major bleeding was also slightly, but not significantly, higher in the shorter triple therapy duration arm (5.3% versus 4.0%; P = 0.44). Although seemingly small, an absolute 1% difference in death would be important to exclude, arguing for confirmatory studies. The benefits and harms of 1 month of triple therapy as recommended by the European guidelines versus 3 months as suggested by the North American guidelines are even less clear.

### 2021 guideline for the prevention of stroke in patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1141ZsjY]. Stroke (2021). High credibility.

Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) patients — ischemic stroke prevention and antithrombotic regimen: thromboembolic complications can occur at any point after implantation, including the immediate postoperative period and long-term follow-up, and suboptimal anticoagulation regimens (supratherapeutic or subtherapeutic INR and no aspirin use) have been associated with increased ischemic stroke risk. In this setting, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) compared with acetylsalicylic acid alone in addition to warfarin does not appear to reduce ischemic stroke rates, and the combination of warfarin and aspirin is the preferred regimen to prevent recurrent ischemic stroke.

### Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of dual antiplatelet therapy with or without warfarin in patients with a clinical indication for DAPT and chronic anticoagulation: a meta-analysis of observational studies [^113Wyo2d]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and triple therapy (TT, dual antiplatelet plus warfarin) in patients with myocardial infarction (MI) or PCI with stenting (PCI-S) who also require chronic oral anticoagulation.

Background

Recommendations for the optimal antiplatelet/anticoagulant treatment regimen for patients undergoing PCI-S or MI who also require oral anticoagulation are largely based on evidence from observational studies and expert opinions.

Methods

A systematic search was performed for studies comparing TT vs. DAPT in patients post PCI-S or MI and requiring chronic anticoagulation. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were ischemic stroke, major bleeding, MI, and stent thrombosis. Pooled relative risks (RR) were calculated using random effects model.

Results

A total of 17 studies were included, with 14,921 patients [TT: 5,819(39%) and DAPT: 9,102(61%)] and a mean follow-up of 1.6 years. The majority of patients required oral anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation. Compared to DAPT, patients treated with TT had no significant difference in all-cause mortality [RR: 0.81, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61–1.08, P = 0.15], MI [RR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.51–1.06, P = 0.10], and stent thrombosis [RR 0.67, 95% CI: 0.35–1.30, P = 0.24]. Patients treated with TT had significantly increased risk of major bleeding [RR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.03–1.39, P = 0.02], whereas the risk for ischemic stroke was significantly lower [RR 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38–0.92, P = 0.02].

Conclusions

All-cause mortality appears similar in patients treated with TT or DAPT although TT was associated with higher rates of major bleeding and a lower risk for ischemic stroke. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

### Meta-analysis of usefulness of antiplatelet therapy in ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack [^111egGZi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The efficacy of early administration of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for secondary prevention after acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is uncertain. This systematic review and meta-analysis compares the safety and efficacy of early administration (< 24 hours) of DAPT (using either clopidogrel or ticagrelor with aspirin) versus single antiplatelet therapy (SAPT; aspirin alone) in acute non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA, incorporating data from large randomized controlled trials. Published trials fulfilling our criteria were identified from an electronic search of MEDLINE, with key words including: "clopidogrel or ticagrelor", "aspirin", "ischemic stroke", "transient ischemic attack", and "randomized controlled trial". Included were 3 randomized controlled trials of 21,067 patients assessing early administration (< 24 hours from symptom onset) of DAPT versus SAPT in non-cardioembolic acute ischemic stroke or TIA. Our efficacy outcomes were ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality. Our safety outcome was severe bleeding. We performed a meta-analysis to pool results with a hierarchical Bayesian random-effects model. Dual antiplatelet therapy significantly reduced the risk of ischemic stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.54, 0.97), while increasing the risk of severe bleeding (HR, 2.48; 95% CrI: 1.07, 5.26). There was a non-significant numerical trend toward increased mortality with DAPT (HR, 1.29; 95% CrI: 0.73, 2.23). These observations were robust under the sensitivity analysis. In the present systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, DAPT reduced the risk of ischemic stroke at the cost of an increase in severe bleeding. Additional trials examining the ideal timing of DAPT administration are needed to thoroughly investigate the role, if any, of routine DAPT in patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA.

### Anticoagulation versus antiplatelets in spontaneous cervical artery dissection: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114ffYj3]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

It is uncertain whether antiplatelets or anticoagulants are more effective in preventing early recurrent stroke in patients with cervical artery dissection. Following the publication of the observational Antithrombotic for STOP-CAD (Stroke Prevention in Cervical Artery Dissection) study, which has more than doubled available data, we performed an updated systematic review and meta-analysis comparing antiplatelets versus anticoagulation in cervical artery dissection.

Methods

The systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023468063). We searched 5 databases using a combination of keywords that encompass different antiplatelets and anticoagulants, as well as cervical artery dissection. We included relevant randomized trials and included observational studies of dissection unrelated to major trauma. Where studies were sufficiently similar, we performed meta-analyses for efficacy (ischemic stroke) and safety (major hemorrhage, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and death) outcomes using relative risks.

Results

We identified 11 studies (2 randomized trials and 9 observational studies) that met the inclusion criteria. These included 5039 patients (30% [1512] treated with anticoagulation and 70% [3527]) treated with antiplatelets]. In meta-analysis, anticoagulation was associated with a lower ischemic stroke risk (relative risk, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.43 to 0.94]; P = 0.02; I² = 0%) but higher major bleeding risk (relative risk, 2.25 [95% CI, 1.07 to 4.72]; P = 0.03, I² = 0%). The risks of death and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage were similar between the 2 treatments. Effect sizes were larger in randomized trials. There are insufficient data on the efficacy and safety of dual antiplatelet therapy or direct oral anticoagulants.

Conclusions

In this study of patients with cervical artery dissection, anticoagulation was superior to antiplatelet therapy in reducing ischemic stroke but carried a higher major bleeding risk. This argues for an individualized therapeutic approach incorporating the net clinical benefit of ischemic stroke reduction and bleeding risks. Large randomized clinical trials are required to clarify optimal antithrombotic strategies for management of cervical artery dissection.

### Antiplatelet use in ischemic stroke [^114ZAZ9c]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

A literature review of antiplatelet agents for primary and secondary stroke prevention, including mechanism of action, cost, and reasons for lack of benefit.

Data Sources

Articles were gathered from MEDLINE, Cochrane Reviews, and PubMed databases (1980–2021). Abstracts from scientific meetings were considered. Search terms included ischemic stroke, aspirin, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, ticagrelor, cilostazol, prasugrel, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language original and review articles were evaluated. Guidelines from multiple countries were reviewed. Articles were evaluated independently by 2 authors.

Data Synthesis

An abundance of evidence supports aspirin and clopidogrel use for secondary stroke prevention. In the acute phase (first 21 days postinitial stroke), these medications have higher efficacy for preventing further stroke when combined, but long-term combination therapy is associated with higher hemorrhage rates. Antiplatelet treatment failure is influenced by poor adherence and genetic polymorphisms. Antiplatelet agents such as cilostazol may provide extra benefit over clopidogrel and aspirin, in certain racial groups, but further research in more diverse ethnic populations is needed.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

This review presents the data available on the use of different antiplatelet agents poststroke. Dual therapy, recurrence after initiation of secondary preventative therapy, and areas for future research are discussed.

Conclusions

Although good evidence exists for the use of certain antiplatelet agents postischemic stroke, there are considerable opportunities for future research to investigate personalized therapies. These include screening patients for platelet polymorphisms that confer antiplatelet resistance and for randomized trials including more racially diverse populations.

### Patent foramen ovale closure, antiplatelet therapy or anticoagulation therapy alone for management of cryptogenic stroke? A clinical practice guideline [^112q6amV]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The largest challenge in making our recommendation was the low quality evidence for the comparisons that included anticoagulants. We summarised all the highest quality available evidence separately for antiplatelet therapy and anticoagulants because the evidence suggests it is likely their effectiveness and adverse effects differ, and clinicians and patients should be aware of these likely differences. Our panel believes that the mechanism of benefit with PFO closure is prevention of venous clots crossing the PFO. Anticoagulants are likely to be substantially more effective in preventing such clots from initially arising than antiplatelet agents.

### Acute dual antiplatelet therapy for minor ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack [^114TLsLY]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Recent trials

In the past five years, trials on acute antiplatelet treatment have focused on evaluating the efficacy and safety of more intensive treatment to prevent recurrent stroke after minor ischaemic stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack. These include dual therapy versus monotherapy, triple versus dual antiplatelet treatment, and a potentially more potent agent (ticagrelor) compared with aspirin alone (table 2). The findings of these studies have greatly advanced the antiplatelet strategy for secondary prevention of stroke in patients with minor ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack.

Table 2
Recent trials in antiplatelet therapy for stroke

Treatment population for DAPT

Patients who have a minor stroke or a transient ischaemic attack are at high risk of developing thrombosis and having ischaemic brain damage that could increase their risk of bleeding. More intensive antiplatelet therapy could be effective and safe in these patients. The CHANCE and POINT trials compared the efficacy and safety of DAPT with clopidogrel plus aspirin against aspirin alone in patients with minor stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) ≤ 3) or high risk transient ischaemic attack (ABCD2 score ≥ 4). The primary results from CHANCEand secondary analysis from POINTshow that up to 21 days of dual antiplatelet therapy were both effective and safe (table 2), indicating that patients with minor stroke or high risk transient ischaemic attack are suitable for dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin.

Time window of starting antiplatelet therapy

Approximately 75–80% of recurrent strokes occur in the first two weeks after onset of the index stroke or transient ischaemic attack. Almost all guidelines recommend that antiplatelet therapy be given as soon as possible after the diagnosis of an ischaemic event. Five of the recent trials included patients that started treatment within 24 hours (table 2). Exploratory analysis of the TARDIS trial showed that intensive triple antiplatelet therapy could significantly reduce recurrence after mild stroke or transient ischaemic attack, or minor stroke alone, if started within 24 hours, but not if started after 24 hours (PM Bath, personal communication). This further supports the consensus that antiplatelet therapy should be given as soon as possible within 24 hours.

### Antiplatelet treatment for prevention of cerebrovascular events in patients with vascular diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116ptg4j]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The efficacy and safety of different antiplatelet regimes for prevention of stroke in patients at high risk were investigated in a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Twenty-two studies comprising 173 371 patients were included.

Results

In the overall population, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel in comparison to aspirin monotherapy reduced the relative risk of total stroke by 20% (risk ratio [RR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.73–0.88; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 28%) and of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack by 23% (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.69–0.85; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 18%) without increasing the risk of intracranial hemorrhage. In the secondary prevention cohort, DAPT with aspirin and clopidogrel also reduced the relative risk of total stroke by 24% as compared with aspirin alone (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68–0.86; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 0%). DAPT with prasugrel or ticagrelor and aspirin versus DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin was not associated with a risk reduction of stroke.

Conclusions

DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin compared with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of total and ischemic stroke in the overall cohort consisting of patients with cardiovascular disease without increase in intracranial hemorrhage, as well as decreases the risk of a recurrent total stroke in patients with a previous stroke/transient ischemic attack. Our meta-analysis suggests that DAPT including low-dose aspirin (75–100 mg) and clopidogrel (75 mg) should be further investigated as a strategy to reduce recurrent strokes.

### Dual antiplatelet therapy after minor strokes or high-risk TIA: evidence from the Austrian stroke registry [^113x3iBy]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide representing a significant burden on healthcare systems. In recent years, dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) has emerged as a potential strategy to improve outcomes in patients with non‐cardioembolic strokes or high‐risk TIAs. DAPT typically includes the combination of aspirin with a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor (clopidogrel or ticagrelor). In Austria, a standard DAPT regimen includes 100 mg of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 75 mg of clopidogrel (loading dose: 250–300 mg ASA and 300 mg clopidogrel) for 21 days. Following the initial randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrating a significant reduction in the recurrence of vascular events short‐term DAPT has been implemented as a secondary prevention strategy for non‐cardioembolic strokes or high‐risk TIAs for a duration of 3–4 weeks in clinical routine. Only a substudy of the CHANCE trial reported significant benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) on functional outcomes. However, data on the effects of DAPT on functional outcome after ischemic stroke in a real‐life setting are scarce.

The aim of the current study was therefore to investigate the effects of DAPT on functional outcome in patients with non‐cardioembolic strokes or high‐risk TIAs in a real‐life setting.

Section 8: intervention on aetiology and pathogenesis

This chapter classifies ischaemic stroke by causes. It mainly enumerates atherosclerosis of large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolic stroke, cerebral small vessel disease and other special causes. It is suggested that corresponding disease management and intervention measures should be taken for ischaemic stroke with different causes. Taking corresponding disease management and intervention measures for ischaemic stroke with different causes is helpful to improve the prognosis.

Large artery atherosclerotic stroke

Antithrombotic therapy

Recommendations

For patients with symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis, antiplatelet therapy should be started as soon as possible and used for long term. The alternative antiplatelet drugs are aspirin, clopidogrel and cilostazol (class I, level of evidence A).
For minor patients with stroke with high-risk intracranial artery stenosis (70%–99%), it is recommended to take single antiplatelet therapy after 90 days of dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel). And dual antiplatelet therapy combined with stent therapy in 90 days is not recommended (class III, level of evidence B).
For patients with stroke with intracranial arterial stenosis, aspirin plus clopidogrel is recommended to reduce the risk of early stroke recurrence caused by thromboembolism. One week later, the risk is reassessed for the purpose of determining whether to continue the combined treatment. The duration of dual antiplatelet therapy can last for 3 months after the onset of the disease. Routine anticoagulant therapy is not recommended for secondary prevention (class I, level of evidence A).

Surgical intervention: combined with intracranial and extracranial macrovascular stenosis and haemodynamic mechanism.

Recommendations

When clinical indicators or brain imaging demonstrate that the core of small infarction and at-risk area (penumbra) are caused by insufficient blood flow due to severe stenosis or occlusion of the carotid artery, or acute neurological impairment after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with suspected acute thrombosis at the site of operation, the effectiveness of emergency CEA has not been confirmed (class II, level of evidence B).
The effectiveness of emergency CEA has not been proven in patients with unstable neurological status (such as progressive stroke) (class II, level of evidence B).

### Comparison of dual antiplatelet therapies for minor, nondisabling, acute ischemic stroke: a Bayesian network meta-analysis [^1137Rvr9]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) appears to be an effective treatment option for minor (nondisabling) acute ischemic stroke. This conclusion is based on trials that include both transient ischemic attack (TIA) and minor stroke; however, these 2 conditions may differ.

Objective

To compare DAPT regimens specifically for minor stroke.

Data Sources

PubMed was searched for randomized clinical trials published up to November 4, 2023. Search terms strategy included TIA, transient ischemic attack, minor stroke, or moderate stroke, with the filter randomized controlled trial. Unpublished data on minor stroke were sourced from authors and/or institutions.

Study Selection

Trials testing DAPT within the first 24 hours of a minor stroke (defined as a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≤ 5) were included by consensus. Of 1508 studies screened, 6 (0.3%) initially met inclusion criteria and were reviewed.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

The study was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines by multiple observers. Bayesian fixed-effect network meta-analysis was conducted. Secondary analysis performed for high-risk TIA alone.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Treatments were ranked using a probability measure called surface under the cumulative rank curve (SUCRA). The primary outcome was subsequent ischemic stroke at 90 days. Secondary outcomes included major hemorrhage, mortality, and hemorrhagic stroke. The number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) were obtained.

Results

Five trials were included that described 28 148 patients, of whom 22 203 (78.9%) had a minor stroke. Of these, 13 995 (63.0%) were in DAPT groups and 8208 (37.0%) in aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) groups. Aspirin and ticagrelor had a 94% probability of being the superior treatment for minor stroke (SUCRA, 0.94) for the primary outcome. Both aspirin and ticagrelor (NNT, 40; 95% CI, 31–64) and aspirin and clopidogrel (NNT, 58; 95% CI, 39–136) were superior to aspirin alone in the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke at 90 days. Both treatments had higher rates of major hemorrhage than aspirin alone (NNH for aspirin and ticagrelor, 284; 95% CI, 108–1715 vs NNH for aspirin and clopidogrel, 330; 95% CI, 118–3430), but neither had increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke or death. For high-risk TIA, ticagrelor and aspirin had a 60% probability (SUCRA, 0.60) and clopidogrel and aspirin had a 40% probability (SUCRA 0.40) of being a superior treatment; neither was optimum, but both were superior to aspirin alone for the primary outcome.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that DAPT with aspirin and ticagrelor has higher probability of being the superior treatment among patients with minor stroke when presence of CYP2C19 loss-of-function alleles has not been excluded. For patients with TIA, the superiority of aspirin and ticagrelor vs aspirin and clopidogrel was not demonstrated.

### Combination antiplatelet therapy in patients with peripheral arterial disease: is the best therapy aspirin, clopidogrel, or both? [^1138VqMJ]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are at increased risk of atherothrombotic events. Antiplatelet therapy and risk-factor modification represent the basis of treatment to prevent the ischemic events associated with PAD. The efficacy of aspirin in the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction and stroke has been demonstrated in a large number of trials. More recently, however, the clinical benefit of clopidogrel compared with aspirin in patients with PAD was confirmed. Many clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of combination antiplatelet therapy in the prevention of recurrent ischemic events in patients with atherosclerotic vascular diseases. Although the results of these studies appear promising, the benefits resulting from dual antiplatelet therapy are counterbalanced by a significant increase in bleeding. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal antiplatelet therapy in the management and prevention of PAD.

### Antiplatelet therapy in acute mild-moderate ischemic stroke (ATAMIS): a parallel, randomised, open-label, multicentre, prospective study [^114pF4oo]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

At present, thrombolysis and antiplatelets are both considered effective treatment methods for acute ischaemic stroke. Due to limitations in time window, only a minority of patients can receive thrombolysis therapy, whereas most patients need to receive antiplatelet therapy to prevent the progression and recurrence of stroke. Studies have found that antiplatelet therapy is superior to anticoagulant therapy in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Therefore, the latest guidelines recommend to give priority to treatment with aspirin alone to patients with acute ischaemic stroke who have not received thrombolysis treatment. In the last decade, it is noteworthy that several studies have reported that compared with aspirin monotherapy, clopidogrel plus aspirin treatment may be more effective for some patients. Especially, the CHANCE trial has shown that compared with aspirin monotherapy, clopidogrel plus aspirin treatment could reduce the risk of recurrent stroke in patients with transient ischaemic attack (TIA) (ABCD 2 ≥ 4) or minor ischaemic stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score of ≤ 3) within 24 hours of symptom onset. The most recent POINT trial has reported that in patients with minor ischaemic stroke (NIHSS ≤ 3) or high-risk TIA (ABCD 2 ≥ 4), those who received a combination of clopidogrel and aspirin had a lower risk of major ischaemic events but a higher risk of major haemorrhage at 90 days than those who received aspirin alone. Besides, dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin has received much attention in recent years.

In clinical practice, besides TIA and minor ischaemic stroke (NIHSS ≤ 3), patients with acute mild-moderate ischaemic stroke (4 ≤ NIHSS ≤ 10) still need aggressive intervention to prevent deterioration and recurrence of stroke. Acute ischaemic stroke within 48 hours of symptom onset is prone to deterioration, and about 50% of deterioration has occurred within the time window. For these patients, aspirin monotherapy is still recommended by the guidelines. The FASTER trial has reported that there was a possible signal, but with no clear evidence, to show that dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin might be more suitable for the above population than aspirin monotherapy. Our recent single-centre study has also found that in patients with acute mild-moderate ischaemic stroke (NIHSS ≤ 7) within 48 hours of symptom onset, dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin may be superior to aspirin monotherapy. Nevertheless, dual-scale clinical trial is still needed to determine the efficacy and safety of clopidogrel plus aspirin therapy versus aspirin monotherapy in the population.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to initiate early dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin plus clopidogrel), ideally within 12–24 hours of symptom onset and at least within 7 days of onset and continued for 21–90 days, followed by single antiplatelet therapy, to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients with a recent minor (NIHSS score ≤ 3) non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke or high-risk TIA (ABCD² score ≥ 4).

### Dual antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease [^1146tD6x]. Open Heart (2017). Low credibility.

Patients requiring long-term oral anticoagulant therapy

Approximately 6–8% of patients undergoing PCI have a concomitant indication for long-term OAC with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or a non-VKA oral anticoagulant (NOAC) for conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), left ventricular thrombus, mechanical valve prosthesis or venous thromboembolism. Current evidence to guide the management of patients undergoing PCI and requiring long-term OAC practice remains limited. Compared with VKA alone, dual therapy (clopidogrel and VKA) and triple therapy (VKA and DAPT with a P2Y 12 receptor inhibitor) in patients with AF following MI or PCI have been shown to increase the risk of major fatal and non-fatal bleeding. Omission of aspirin while maintaining P2Y 12 receptor antagonist has been evaluated in the What is the Optimal antiplatElet and anticoagulant therapy in patients with OAC and coronary StenTing (WOEST) trial, an open-label, multicentre RCT including 573 patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy (AF or flutter 69%) and candidates for PCI (DES 65%) for stable CAD or ACS (25%–30%), who were assigned to clopidogrel alone (dual therapy) or clopidogrel plus aspirin (triple therapy) for 1 month after BMS and 1 year after DES. The rates of the primary safety outcome (any bleeding episode) at 1 year were significantly reduced in the dual therapy arm, as compared with the triple therapy arm (19.4% vs 44.4%, HR 0.36, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.50, p < 0.0001), mainly driven by significant reductions in non-intracranial bleedings. Despite being small and underpowered for hard clinical outcomes, the trial showed a significant reduction of the secondary composite ischaemic endpoint (death, MI, stroke, TVR or ST) in the dual therapy group (11.1% vs 17.6%, HR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.94, p = 0.025) as compared with patients on triple therapy. These data suggest the potential superiority of dual antithrombotic therapy with regard to occurrence of major bleedings compared with triple therapy among patients undergoing PCI and who are candidates for long-term OAC, without evidence of increased risk of thrombotic events by omission of aspirin.

### The role of triple antithrombotic therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention [^114M2bXY]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin plus clopidogrel forms the backbone of secondary prevention in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) or who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), but in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), oral anticoagulation (OAC) is superior to antiplatelet therapy for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism. Patients with AF who undergo PCI or have an ACS event therefore have an indication for both OAC and DAPT, so-called triple antithrombotic therapy. However, observational analyses have shown that the annual rate of major bleeding on triple therapy exceeds 10%. For this reason, five major randomized clinical trials have compared double antithrombotic therapy with OAC and a P2Y 12 inhibitor versus triple therapy in patients with AF who underwent PCI or had an ACS event. Each of the trials showed that double antithrombotic therapy reduced the rate of major and clinically relevant non-major bleeding compared with triple therapy and was non-inferior for prevention of ischemic events, including cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. In the one trial that directly compared warfarin with a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant (NOAC), apixaban reduced the rate of major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding compared with warfarin and was non-inferior with respect to prevention of ischemic events. As a result of these trials, consensus guidelines recommend that patients with AF who undergo PCI or have an ACS event should be treated with triple antithrombotic therapy (OAC + P2Y 12 inhibitor + aspirin) for 7 days or less, followed by double antithrombotic therapy (OAC + P2Y 12 inhibitor) for 6 to 12 months.

### Baseline stroke risk and efficacy of dual-antiplatelet therapy: a post hoc analysis of the POINT trial [^111DLVi4]. Stroke (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

High-risk transient ischemic attacks and minor ischemic strokes are followed by a variable risk of ischemic stroke. We aimed to determine how baseline stroke risk modified the efficacy of clopidogrel-aspirin (referred to here as dual-antiplatelet therapy [DAPT]) for transient ischemic attack and minor ischemic stroke.

Methods

We performed an unplanned secondary analysis of the POINT trial (Platelet-Oriented Inhibition in New Transient Ischemic Attack and Minor Ischemic Stroke). We first evaluated the associations of the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc and stroke prognosis instrument II (SPI-II) scores with the risk of incident ischemic stroke and major hemorrhage (intracranial hemorrhage or major systemic hemorrhage). We then tested for heterogeneity of the relative and absolute treatment effect of DAPT relative to aspirin across low- and high-risk patient subgroups.

Results

A total of 4841 trial participants were included in this analysis, with 2400 participants assigned to treatment with short-term DAPT and 2430 participants to treatment with aspirin and placebo. The dichotomized SPI-II score, but not the CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc score (P = 0.18), was associated with the risk of incident ischemic stroke. A high-risk SPI-II score (> 3) was associated with greater risk of incident ischemic stroke (hazard ratio of incident ischemic stroke relative to low-risk SPI-II score of 1.84 [95% CI, 1.44–2.35]; P < 0.001) and numerically greater risk of major hemorrhage though not meeting statistical significance (hazard ratio, 1.80 [95% CI, 0.90–3.57]; P = 0.10). The relative risk reduction with DAPT was similar across SPI-II strata (P interaction = 0.31). The absolute risk reduction for ischemic stroke with DAPT compared with aspirin was nearly 4-fold higher (2.80% versus 0.76%; number needed to treat, 31 versus 131) in the high-risk SPI-II stratum relative to the low-risk stratum. The absolute risk increase for major hemorrhage with DAPT compared with aspirin was 3-fold higher (0.84% versus 0.30%; number needed to harm, 119 versus 331) in the high-risk SPI-II stratum relative to the low-risk stratum.

Conclusions

Stratification by baseline stroke risk identifies a patient subgroup that derives greater absolute benefit from treatment with DAPT.

Low-dose factor Xa inhibitor on top of antiplatelet therapy

Factor Xa inhibitors and other anticoagulants ultimately inhibit the formation or activation of thrombin, which plays a crucial role in both coagulation and platelet activation and may offer a synergistic benefit when added to antiplatelet therapy. A strong asset of dual-pathway inhibition is that anticoagulants, like factor Xa-inhibitors, modulate a number of inflammatory pathways which may reduce their contribution to atherogenesis. Oral anticoagulants have been shown to mitigate the risk of arterial thrombotic events, but because DAPT was superior to aspirin and warfarin in preventing stent thrombosis, the latter strategy was abandoned in favour of DAPT following PCI. However, recently reported studies investigating (low-dose) non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (Supplementary material online, Table S4) have renewed interest in combining lower anticoagulant doses with antiplatelet therapy.

In the placebo-controlled ATLAS ACS 2-TIMI 51 trial, low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) reduced the incidence of cardiovascular death, MI, and stroke in ACS patients mostly treated with aspirin and clopidogrel, at the expense of increased bleeding. Subsequently, in the COMPASS trial, low-dose rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily) on top of aspirin as compared to aspirin alone was associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke in patients with CCS and peripheral artery disease at moderate-high risk of ischaemic events. In high-risk subgroups (e.g. patients with diabetes, moderate chronic kidney disease, and current smokers), low-dose rivaroxaban was associated with even greater absolute risk reductions. Unfortunately, pre-specified significance thresholds for cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were not met and patients on low-dose rivaroxaban on top of aspirin had more major (though not-fatal) bleeding events. Interestingly, low-dose rivaroxaban and aspirin as compared to aspirin alone significantly reduced the rate of stroke by 42% (driven by a 49% relative reduction in ischaemic stroke partially offset by a numeric increase in haemorrhagic stroke), making low-dose rivaroxaban plus aspirin an important new option for stroke prevention in patients with atherosclerosis.

### Design and rationale of the RE-DUAL PCI trial: a prospective, randomized, phase 3b study comparing the safety and efficacy of dual antithrombotic therapy with dabigatran etexilate versus warfarin triple therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting [^113UXLDD]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Antithrombotic management of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) undergoing coronary stenting is complicated by the need for anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention and dual antiplatelet therapy for prevention of stent thrombosis and coronary events. Triple antithrombotic therapy, typically comprising warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel, is associated with a high risk of bleeding. A modest-sized trial of oral anticoagulation with warfarin and clopidogrel without aspirin showed improvements in both bleeding and thrombotic events compared with triple therapy, but large trials are lacking. The RE-DUAL PCI trial (NCT 02164864) is a phase 3b, a strategy of prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint trial. The main objective is to evaluate dual antithrombotic therapy with dabigatran etexilate (110 or 150mg twice daily) and a P2Y12 inhibtor (either clopidogrel or ticagrelor) compared with triple antithrombotic therapy with warfarin, a P2Y12 inhibtor (either clopidogrel or ticagrelor, and low-dose aspirin (for 1 or 3 months, depending on stent type) in nonvalvular AF patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting. The primary endpoint is time to first International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis major bleeding event or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding event. Secondary endpoints are the composite of all cause death or thrombotic events (myocardial infarction, or stroke/systemic embolism) and unplanned revascularization; death or thrombotic events; individual outcome events; death, myocardial infarction, or stroke; and unplanned revascularization. A hierarchical procedure for multiple testing will be used. The plan is to randomize∼2500 patients at approximately 550 centers worldwide to try to identify new treatment strategies for this patient population.

### Design and rationale of the RE-DUAL PCI trial: a prospective, randomized, phase 3b study comparing the safety and efficacy of dual antithrombotic therapy with dabigatran etexilate versus warfarin triple therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting [^112a2BWD]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Many patients with AF also have ischemic heart disease, 9 and most guidelines have, until recently, recommended triple antithrombotic therapy, comprising an anticoagulant plus dual antiplatelet therapy for such patients undergoing PCI. Not surprisingly, these potent regimens are associated with very high rates of major bleeding. Several large registries reported that the risk of major bleeding with triple antithrombotic therapy is 3‐fold to 4‐fold higher than with OAC alone or single antiplatelet therapy. 10, 11, 12, 13 In addition, major bleeding is associated with an up to 5‐fold increased risk of death following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). 14, 15 As such, the search is underway for better treatment strategies that improve safety while preserving efficacy.

Two new promising approaches have emerged. First, non‐VKA oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have been developed, the first being dabigatran etexilate. This oral direct thrombin inhibitor was tested in patients with nonvalvular AF in the Randomized Evaluation of Long‐term Anticoagulation Therapy (RE‐LY) trial. 16 RE‐LY was a prospective, randomized, open‐label (double‐blind for the 2 dabigatran etexilate arms and open‐label for warfarin), blinded‐endpoint trial and involved 18 113 patients. Dabigatran 150 mg twice daily, when compared with warfarin, resulted in a lower rate of stroke or systemic embolism (1.12% vs 1.72%, respectively) and a similar rate of major bleeding events (3.40% vs 3.61%, respectively); dabigatran 110 mg twice daily resulted in similar rates of stroke or systemic embolism (1.54% vs 1.72%, respectively) and a lower rate of major bleeding events (2.92% vs 3.61%, respectively). Both doses of dabigatran reduced the risk of hemorrhagic stroke (150 mg, 0.10%; 110 mg, 0.12%; warfarin, 0.38%), whereas the 150‐mg dose reduced the risk of ischemic stroke. 17 These benefits of dabigatran over warfarin were unchanged irrespective of whether patients had no concomitant antiplatelet therapy or if they had a single or even dual antiplatelet therapy (Figure 1). 18 As such, the direct comparison of dabigatran vs warfarin has been made. There is, however, a need for prospective data on the use of dabigatran as part of an antithrombotic strategy in a stented population as compared with warfarin‐antiplatelet strategies, which have been evolving.

Discussion

The major finding of this updated meta‐analysis indicated that triple therapy could reduce ischemic stroke with increased major bleeding risk compared with dual therapy for patients taking OAC after PCI. Subgroup analyses revealed that the combination of OAC plus clopidogrel has at least similar efficacy and safety outcomes compared with triple therapy. There was no evident benefit for adding aspirin to the OAC plus clopidogrel regimen, which challenges current guidelines that prefer triple therapy for these specific patients.

Determining the most effective antithrombotic regimens for patients with OAC and coronary intervention can be challenging, and several meta‐analyses 8, 9 and expert consensus satetments 10, 11 demonstrated that "triple is better" for these patients, mostly due to the decrease of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events compared with the DAPT regimen. So far, there has been sufficient evidence to support the indispensability of OAC among patients with AF. Traditionally, OAC could reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism by about 60% compared with placebo, 28, 29 and by about 40% compared with aspirin. 30 Data from the Atrial Fibrillation Clopidogrel Trial With Irbesartan for Prevention of Vascular Events (ACTIVE W) study showed that OAC was superior to clopidogrel plus aspirin for prevention of vascular events in patients with AF, and withholding OAC in patients with AF led to an increased rate of stroke. 1 The reason might be that the type of thrombosis in AF is abundant in fibrin, and platelet activation is not the predominant pathway in the pathogenesis of stroke in AF, in which OAC could be more effective than antiplatelet alone. Overall, the current data indicated that triple therapy has the superior effect for stroke prevention in comparison with an antiplatelet regimen, due to the powerful antithrombotic effect of OAC.

Stable CAD

Aspirin remains the cornerstone for secondary prevention of patients with stable CAD, irrespective of the management strategy. In a large meta-analysis including 16 secondary prevention trials and 17 000 high-risk patients, low-dose aspirin (75–150 mg/day) was associated with a 20% relative risk reduction in MACE (cardiovascular (CV) death or non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI)) (rate ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.88), a 31% relative risk reduction in MI (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.80) and a 22% relative risk reduction in ischaemic stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.99), at the expense of an increased risk of haemorrhagic stroke (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.90) and major extracranial bleeding (RR 2.69, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.76). Aspirin marginally reduced CV mortality (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.00, p = 0.06), resulting in a 10% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.99, p = 0.02). At variance of the antiplatelet effects, the gastrointestinal side effects of aspirin increase at higher doses. The optimal risk:benefit ratio appears to be achieved with an aspirin dosage of 75–150 mg daily.

### Trends in dual antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel and outcomes in ischemic stroke patients noneligible for POINT / CHANCE trial treatment [^115VkVeV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study, based on a large stroke population from a multicenter stroke registry, demonstrated a marked increase in the use of DAPT‐AC among stroke patients who are ineligible for DAPT clinical trials, coinciding at the time of publication of the CHANCE trial in 2013 and continuing to the present. The secondary prevention effects in patients with ischemic stroke seem to be gradually improving, possibly due to the enhancement of risk factor control. Further research is needed to investigate whether the DAPT‐AC use is associated with an incremental improvement in risk‐adjusted annual rates of early vascular events in patients with nonminor stroke and patients with presentation beyond 24 hours.

Regarding medical management for acute ischemic stroke, more specifically with respect to antiplatelet therapy, AHA/ASA 2021 guidelines recommend to consider initiating dual antiplatelet therapy with ticagrelor plus aspirin for 30 days to reduce the risk of 30-day recurrent stroke in patients with the following, recognizing that it also may increase the risk of serious bleeding events, including Intracerebral hemorrhage:

- recent (< 24 hours) minor-to-moderate stroke (NIHSS score ≤ 5)

- high-risk TIA (ABCD² score ≥ 6)

- symptomatic intracranial or extracranial ≥ 30% stenosis of an artery that could account for the event.

### Design and rationale of the RE-DUAL PCI trial: a prospective, randomized, phase 3b study comparing the safety and efficacy of dual antithrombotic therapy with dabigatran etexilate versus warfarin triple therapy in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting [^1128Jmkf]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Antithrombotic management of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing coronary stenting is complicated by the need for anticoagulant therapy for stroke prevention and dual antiplatelet therapy for prevention of stent thrombosis and coronary events. Triple antithrombotic therapy, typically comprising warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel, is associated with a high risk of bleeding. A modest‐sized trial of oral anticoagulation with warfarin and clopidogrel without aspirin showed improvements in both bleeding and thrombotic events compared with triple therapy, but large trials are lacking. Thetrial (02164864) is a phase 3b, a strategy of prospective, randomized, open‐label, blinded‐endpoint trial. The main objective is to evaluate dual antithrombotic therapy with dabigatran etexilate (110 or 150 mg twice daily) and a P2Y12 inhibitor (either clopidogrel or ticagrelor) compared with triple antithrombotic therapy with warfarin, a P2Y12 inhibitor (either clopidogrel or ticagrelor, and low‐dose aspirin (for 1 or 3 months, depending on stent type) in nonvalvularpatients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting. The primary endpoint is time to first International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis major bleeding event or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding event. Secondary endpoints are the composite of all cause death or thrombotic events (myocardial infarction, or stroke/systemic embolism) and unplanned revascularization; death or thrombotic events; individual outcome events; death, myocardial infarction, or stroke; and unplanned revascularization. A hierarchical procedure for multiple testing will be used. The plan is to randomize ∼ 2500 patients at approximately 550 centers worldwide to try to identify new treatment strategies for this patient population.

Warfarin added to antiplatelet therapy after large anterior myocardial infarction (MI) — modeled risks and benefits are as follows: Given the estimated 10% associated risk of embolic stroke, there is 1.5% risk of stroke at 3 months without warfarin therapy. In patients with large anterior MI but no initial thrombus who receive warfarin in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy, estimates indicate seven fewer nonfatal strokes and 15 more extracranial nonfatal bleeds per 1,000 treated. For those with demonstrated left ventricular (LV) thrombus, the addition of warfarin to antiplatelet therapy would be expected to result in 44 fewer nonfatal strokes and 15 more extracranial nonfatal bleeds per 1,000 treated. The addition of warfarin to dual antiplatelet therapy following MI may result in an absolute decrease of 11 MIs per 1,000 patients treated.

Therefore, for every 30 patients treated with ticagrelor plus aspirin, one would experience a haemorrhagic event, compared with those on clopidogrel plus aspirin. Furthermore, for every 68 patients on ticagrelor plus aspirin, one recurrent stroke would be prevented.

AHA/ASA 2021 — left atrial appendage closure in nonvalvular AF after stroke: The left atrial appendage is the thrombus location 90% of the time; the Watchman device occludes the appendage and is the only device with US Food and Drug Administration approval for left atrial appendage closure. Current practice uses short-term oral anticoagulation for 1.5 months after Watchman placement followed by 4.5 months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), and in patients at high bleeding risk from oral anticoagulation, appendage closure can reduce long-term bleeding with an ischemic stroke risk comparable to vitamin K antagonist (VKA) anticoagulation.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with acute coronary syndrome (no stent) — For patients with AF at intermediate to high risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2, score of 1 or greater) who experience an acute coronary syndrome and do not undergo intracoronary stent placement, we suggest for the first 12 months, adjusted-dose VKA therapy (INR 2.0–3.0) plus single antiplatelet therapy rather than dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin and clopidogrel) or triple therapy (eg, warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel) (Grade 2C). After the first 12 months, antithrombotic therapy is suggested as for patients with AF and stable coronary artery disease (see section 3.1). For patients with AF at low risk of stroke (eg, CHADS2, score of 0), we suggest dual antiplatelet therapy (eg, aspirin and clopidogrel) rather than adjusted-dose VKA therapy (INR 2.0–3.0) plus single antiplatelet therapy or triple therapy (eg, warfarin, aspirin, and clopidogrel) (Grade 2C), with remarks that some patients prioritizing stroke reduction may choose adjusted-dose VKA therapy plus single antiplatelet therapy rather than dual antiplatelet therapy and that bleeding risk and additional non-CHADS2 risk factors may influence this choice.
