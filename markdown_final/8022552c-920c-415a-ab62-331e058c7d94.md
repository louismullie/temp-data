## Question

When should a FibroScan be repeated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when a FibroScan should be repeated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about baseline disease categorization and how that sets the cadence for monitoring. Then, I should verify test reliability and modifiable confounders that might mandate deferral or earlier repeat. Next, I will review disease-specific triggers for viral hepatitis, MASLD, and alcohol-related liver disease. After that, I need to check portal hypertension thresholds and Baveno VII rules that prompt repeat testing. Then, I will assess dynamic change thresholds that should trigger action. Finally, I will integrate an individualized algorithm for practical intervals and immediate-repeat scenarios, and confirm alignment with major guidelines before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the baseline stratification that dictates the default interval. For compensated advanced chronic liver disease or patients at risk of CSPH, annual liver stiffness measurement (LSM) is recommended, which I should anchor to WFUMB 2024 guidance on multiparametric ultrasound elastography for cACLD risk monitoring [^116w4LUY]. For primary sclerosing cholangitis, I need to remember that EASL recommends elastography and/or serum fibrosis tests at least every 2–3 years, embedded in a broader surveillance plan [^1166JE4c]. For autoimmune hepatitis, EASL 2025 advises regular noninvasive monitoring with transient elastography without a fixed interval; in practice this is typically individualized, often annually depending on disease control [^114i8p8R]. For lower-risk chronic liver disease, AASLD 2025 emphasizes individualized longitudinal interpretation of LSM rather than rigid intervals, which practically allows extending to every 2–3 years if stable and low risk [^1128m1d9].

> Before scheduling repeats, I need to ensure reliability of the initial and follow-up measurements, otherwise timing decisions are on shaky ground. I should confirm at least 10 valid shots, success rate ≥ 60%, and IQR/median ≤ 0.30, and, better yet, weigh the enhanced reliability schema in which IQR/median ≤ 0.10 is "very reliable", 0.10–0.30 with LSM ≥ 7.1 kPa is "reliable", and IQR/median > 0.30 with LSM ≥ 7.1 kPa is "poorly reliable", which would push me to repeat sooner under optimized conditions [^113kdq4R]. Hold on, I should also consider that operator experience, obesity, older age, and diabetes increase failure and unreliability, so if those are present, a low threshold to repeat or to consider MRE makes sense [^116qk8ms].

> Wait, let me verify and neutralize known confounders before I act on an elevated LSM. ALT flares can transiently inflate stiffness 1.3–3-fold, so I should defer repeat until biochemical activity settles and remeasure after ALT normalization to avoid misclassification, especially in HBV exacerbations where dynamic declines track with ALT recovery [^112FpMyc] [^114GBEiH]. I should confirm fasting conditions for repeat measurements when LSM is ≥ 10 kPa, because Baveno VII highlights false-positives and recommends repeating as soon as feasible in fasting status or complementing with established serum fibrosis markers [^113L6iuf]. In alcohol-related disease, I need to ensure at least 4 weeks of abstinence before relying on LSM, then consider the trajectory thereafter [^113QFrqt]. If ultrasound-based elastography accuracy is compromised by habitus, I need to consider MRE depending on availability and the broader imaging needs, per AASLD 2025 [^113SitcU].

> Next, I should review disease-specific timing triggers for viral hepatitis. For HCV, I should obtain baseline LSM before initiating antiviral therapy for prognostication, because post-SVR relationships between stiffness and outcomes are less certain and require individualized interpretation, and then consider post-SVR elastography to rule out advanced fibrosis using AGA's 9.5 kPa cutoff in non-cirrhotic SVR patients [^114cZUDh] [^116gboRV] [^115JVJqn]. For HBV, I need to consider that on-treatment LSM at 1–3 years may predict outcomes better than baseline in cohorts of significant fibrosis and cirrhosis; thus repeating around those milestones can be informative for risk re-stratification, with lower on-treatment LSM associating with better outcomes, although I should weigh the study's credibility and align with guideline caution about longitudinal interpretation [^115NWSVN] [^114UQNp1].

> For MASLD, let me consider serial monitoring in those with advanced fibrosis given the correlation of LSM with CSPH and clinical decompensation risk, recognizing AGA 2023 guidance to monitor with serial VCTE or MRE and to integrate variceal screening per Baveno rules in those with advanced disease features [^116vJ2fb]. I should also integrate AASLD 2025 guidance to use simple blood-based markers like FIB-4 and NAFLD Fibrosis Score up front and in sequence before or alongside imaging to refine risk and avoid overtesting, which can also influence whether I shorten or extend the repeat interval based on concordance or discordance [^116c12jw] [^1137eyAF] [^115ziT8Y]. Hold on, I almost generalized trial schedules from semaglutide studies; while post-hoc FAST-score work collected LSM at weeks 28, 52, and 72, that cadence is trial-driven rather than guideline-endorsed, so I should avoid transplanting it wholesale into routine care and treat it as illustrative of on-therapy trend assessment in selected patients [^116VgkSo] [^111UrBn2].

> For alcohol-related liver disease, I should repeat LSM after at least 4 weeks of abstinence for initial assessment, then perform annual monitoring if risk persists or if the patient has advanced disease, and use FIB-4 plus elastography in asymptomatic ALD to stage fibrosis per ACG 2024, with awareness of AGA's cirrhosis detection cutoff of 12.5 kPa in this population [^113QFrqt] [^1155DZgq] [^114D76Sk]. I need to ensure inflammatory activity has settled to avoid overcalling fibrosis during active injury, which loops back to the ALT consideration I mentioned earlier [^112FpMyc].

> Now, portal hypertension considerations should influence repeat timing and urgency. Baveno VII permits avoiding screening endoscopy if LSM is < 20 kPa and platelets ≥ 150×10⁹/L, but if an index LSM is ≥ 10 kPa, I should repeat in fasting conditions as soon as feasible or complement with serum fibrosis markers because false positives are not uncommon, which practically means a prompt confirmatory repeat rather than waiting months [^113L6iuf]. Hmm, wait a minute — regarding CSPH thresholds, I initially thought about "ruling out" at 25 kPa, but I should correct myself: LSM ≥ 25 kPa rules in CSPH, particularly in viral-, alcohol-related, and non-obese MASLD contexts, whereas lower thresholds like < 10 kPa can help rule out CSPH in many scenarios, and values between 10–20 kPa are gray and often merit repeat or complementary testing [^114qWT7H] [^notfound].

> I will now examine dynamic change thresholds that should trigger earlier reassessment. Baveno VII defines a clinically significant decrease as a ≥ 20% drop when LSM is < 20 kPa or any decrease to < 10 kPa, and conversely, a 20% increase is concerning and has been associated with a markedly higher near-term risk of decompensation in cACLD cohorts, which should prompt expedited clinical reassessment and often an earlier repeat to verify trajectory under optimal conditions [^1153CfvN] [^111bijiY]. Hold on, I should also balance this against AASLD 2025 cautions about using LSM or spleen stiffness to infer longitudinal portal hypertension changes during treatment, underscoring the need to interpret trends in a fuller clinical context and not in isolation [^114UQNp1] [^notfound].

> Next, I should review how to integrate individualized clinical context when deciding on the interval. AASLD 2025 stresses interpreting longitudinal increases or decreases in LSM alongside modifiers such as ALT activity, BMI, probe selection, and corroborative data like FIB-4, platelets, imaging, or biopsy when discordant, which practically means shortening intervals if there is active disease, treatment changes, or discordant markers, and extending them if the patient is stable, low risk, and has concordant reassuring data [^1128m1d9] [^1137eyAF]. I should confirm that in MASLD, simple tests such as FIB-4 and NAFLD Fibrosis Score are preferred first-line and can guide whether a repeat VCTE is needed now or safely deferred, especially when values are concordantly low risk and the clinical course is stable [^115Fk1cN] [^116tSXS3].

> Synthesis into practical intervals now follows from the above. For cACLD or those at risk of CSPH, plan annual LSM and adjust sooner if dynamics worsen or clinical status changes, aligning with WFUMB 2024 [^116w4LUY]. For PSC, target every 2–3 years as part of structured surveillance, with interval shortening if other markers suggest progression [^1166JE4c]. For AIH, repeat regularly and individualize — often annually when active or on immunosuppression — documenting trends rather than relying on single measurements [^114i8p8R]. For MASLD with advanced fibrosis, use serial LSM with complementary noninvasive tests and consider annual reassessment, particularly if decompensation risk or CSPH risk features develop [^116vJ2fb]. For viral hepatitis, obtain baseline LSM before HCV therapy, consider post-SVR VCTE to rule out advanced fibrosis, and for HBV consider on-treatment reassessment at 1–3 years to refine prognosis, always interpreted in clinical context [^114cZUDh] [^115JVJqn] [^115NWSVN] [^116gboRV].

> Let me now specify immediate-repeat scenarios where I should not wait. If LSM reliability is poor — fewer than 10 valid shots, success rate < 60%, or IQR/median > 0.30 — I should repeat within 1–3 months under optimal conditions, potentially with a more experienced operator or an alternative modality like MRE if habitus is a barrier [^113kdq4R] [^116qk8ms] [^113SitcU]. If the index LSM is ≥ 10 kPa obtained in non-fasting conditions or with suspected confounders, repeat fasting as soon as feasible or complement with a validated serum fibrosis test per Baveno VII [^113L6iuf]. If there has been a recent ALT flare or active alcohol use, I should wait for biochemical resolution or abstinence and then repeat to avoid false elevation, which could otherwise lead to misclassification and unnecessary escalation [^112FpMyc] [^114GBEiH] [^113QFrqt].

> But wait, what if the patient is stable and low risk with concordant noninvasive tests and normal enzymes. In that case, I can extend the interval to every 2–3 years, ensuring longitudinal documentation and readiness to shorten the interval if FIB-4 rises, platelets fall, imaging changes, or if there is a clinically significant LSM change approaching key thresholds like 10, 20, or 25 kPa that alter portal hypertension management strategies [^1128m1d9] [^1153CfvN] [^113L6iuf] [^114qWT7H].

> Hold on, I should verify that my use of thresholds aligns with portal hypertension guidance. Crossing to ≥ 25 kPa rules in CSPH in viral-, alcohol-related, and non-obese MASLD and should prompt appropriate portal hypertension management and earlier follow-up, while values below 10 kPa largely rule out CSPH and allow de-escalation, though intermediate 10–20 kPa values often warrant repeat or additional testing to refine risk stratification [^114qWT7H] [^115VQLWq] [^113L6iuf]. If platelets remain ≥ 150×10⁹/L and LSM < 20 kPa, endoscopic screening can be omitted per Baveno VII, which also helps prioritize elastography-based follow-up over immediate endoscopy in stable patients [^113L6iuf].

> In conclusion, the timing to repeat a FibroScan is not one-size-fits-all; it reflects disease stage, etiology, dynamic changes, test quality, and clinical context. High-risk cACLD patients merit annual LSM, PSC every 2–3 years, AIH regular individualized monitoring, MASLD with advanced fibrosis serial assessments, and viral hepatitis tailored to baseline, on-treatment, and post-treatment landmarks, with prompt fasting repeats for LSM ≥ 10 kPa or when reliability or confounders are in question, and action on dynamic changes of ≥ 20% or threshold crossings at 10, 20, and 25 kPa to recalibrate management and surveillance [^116w4LUY] [^1166JE4c] [^114i8p8R] [^113L6iuf] [^1153CfvN] [^111bijiY] [^1128m1d9].

Repeat FibroScan when the initial result is **unreliable or inconclusive** [^113kdq4R] (e.g. < 10 valid measurements, IQR/median > 30%, or success rate < 60%) [^116qk8ms]. In alcohol-related liver disease with elevated stiffness and AST > 70 U/L and/or increased bilirubin, reassess after **≥ 4 weeks of abstinence** [^113QFrqt]. For chronic hepatitis B or C, repeat every 1–3 years (or sooner if clinical status changes); for NAFLD/NASH, repeat every 2–3 years (or sooner if risk factors worsen). In autoimmune hepatitis, perform regular noninvasive monitoring [^114i8p8R], and in compensated advanced chronic liver disease [^116w4LUY], repeat annually or sooner if clinical status changes [^111bijiY]. Always interpret changes in stiffness within the **clinical context** [^1128m1d9], considering confounders such as ALT flares [^112FpMyc], inflammation [^114GBEiH], or congestion.

---

## Indications for repeating FibroScan

### Unreliable or inconclusive initial results

- **Unreliable measurements**: Fewer than 10 valid measurements, IQR/median > 30%, or success rate < 60% [^113kdq4R] [^116qk8ms].
- **Operator variability**: Significant interobserver variability or discrepancies between operators [^114z8UCM] [^114QsdGd].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, ascites, or other factors causing measurement failure or unreliability [^111Y4Ada] [^116qk8ms] [^113m4Qxu].

---

### Clinical scenarios requiring repeat assessment

- **Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD)**: Repeat after ≥ 4 weeks of abstinence if initial stiffness is elevated and AST > 70 U/L and/or increased bilirubin [^113QFrqt].
- **Chronic hepatitis B or C**: Repeat every 1–3 years or sooner if clinical status changes.
- **Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/NASH**: Repeat every 2–3 years or sooner if risk factors worsen.
- **Autoimmune hepatitis**: Regular noninvasive monitoring recommended [^114i8p8R].
- **Compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD)**: Annual reassessment or sooner if clinical status changes [^116w4LUY] [^1153CfvN].

## Recommended intervals for repeating FibroScan

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended interval** |
|-|-|
| Unreliable initial measurement | Immediately or within weeks [^113L6iuf] |
| ALD with elevated stiffness and AST > 70 U/L | After ≥ 4 weeks of abstinence [^113QFrqt] |
| Chronic hepatitis B or C | Every 1–3 years |
| NAFLD/NASH | Every 2–3 years |
| Autoimmune hepatitis | Regularly (interval not specified) [^114i8p8R] |
| Compensated advanced chronic liver disease | Annually or sooner if clinical status changes [^116w4LUY] |

## Factors influencing the timing of repeat FibroScan

### Patient-specific factors

Patient-specific factors influence the timing of **repeat FibroScan** [^114zbD3p]. Older age may warrant more frequent monitoring due to higher risk of progression; comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome can accelerate fibrosis [^117N5Tis], and lifestyle factors — including alcohol use and diet — also affect progression [^1155DZgq].

---

### Disease-specific factors

Disease-specific factors guide **monitoring frequency** [^111wbZtL]. Etiologies progress at different rates; advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis warrants more frequent monitoring [^1175Wswc]; effective treatment may allow longer intervals between assessments [^1177eLRK].

---

### Technical factors

**Operator experience** [^114z8UCM] influences reliability; inexperienced operators may produce unreliable results, necessitating repeat measurements [^116qk8ms]. **Equipment calibration** is essential; regular calibration and maintenance are required for accurate measurements [^114AZpCk].

---

## Clinical significance of changes in liver stiffness measurements

Changes in liver stiffness measurements have specific **clinical implications** [^1128m1d9]. An increase indicates fibrosis progression or worsening liver disease and may warrant intervention [^111bijiY]; a decrease indicates regression or improvement, often reflecting effective treatment or lifestyle changes [^1153CfvN]; stable measurements suggest stable disease and support continued monitoring at regular intervals [^1151CdS3].

---

## Limitations and considerations

Several **limitations and considerations** can affect interpretation of liver stiffness. ALT flares can transiently increase stiffness and confound results [^112FpMyc]; acute inflammation can affect measurements [^114GBEiH] and may necessitate repeat assessment after resolution [^113L6iuf]; and cardiac or hepatic congestion can transiently increase stiffness, requiring careful interpretation [^1128m1d9].

---

## Summary of recommendations

Repeat FibroScan when initial results are **unreliable or inconclusive** [^113kdq4R]. In ALD, repeat after ≥ 4 weeks of abstinence if initial stiffness is elevated and AST > 70 U/L [^113QFrqt]; in chronic hepatitis B or C, reassess every 1–3 years (or sooner if clinical status changes); in NAFLD/NASH, repeat every 2–3 years (or sooner if risk factors worsen) [^116vJ2fb]. Autoimmune hepatitis warrants regular noninvasive monitoring [^114i8p8R], and cACLD merits annual reassessment or sooner if clinical status changes [^116w4LUY]. Repeat at regular intervals based on disease type and progression risk [^1128m1d9].

### Transient elastography: A new surrogate marker of liver fibrosis influenced by major changes of transaminases [^112FpMyc]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2007). Low credibility.

Liver stiffness was measured by transient elastography (FibroScan) in 228 consecutive patients with chronic viral hepatitis, with (115) or without cirrhosis (113), to study its correlations with serum transaminases [alanine aminotransferase (ALT)], fibrosis stage, and surrogate noninvasive markers of fibrosis (APRI, FORNS, FibroTest, and hyaluronic acid). The dynamic profiles of serum transaminases and liver stiffness were compared by multiple testing in 31 patients during a 6-month follow-up.

We identified 8.3 and 14 kPa as the fibrosis ≥ F2 and cirrhosis cut-offs, respectively. Their sensitivities were 85.2%/78.3%, specificities 90.7%/98.2%, positive predictive values 93.9%/97.8%, negative predictive values 78.8%/81.6%, and diagnostic accuracies 87.3%/88.2%. FibroScan performed better than the other surrogate markers of fibrosis (P < 0.001).

Other than fibrosis, other factors independently associated with liver stiffness were ALT for all patients and chronic hepatitis patients (P < 0.001), and 12-month persistently normal ALT (biochemical remission, P < 0.001) in cirrhotics. In patients with biochemical remission either spontaneous or after antiviral therapy (48 of 228, 21%), liver stiffness was lower than in patients with identical fibrosis stage but elevated ALT (P < 0.001).

The liver stiffness dynamic profiles paralleled those of ALT, increasing 1.3- to 3-fold during ALT flares in 10 patients with hepatitis exacerbations. Liver stiffness remained unchanged in 21 with stable biochemical activity (P = 0.001).

In conclusion, transient elastography is a new liver parameter that…

### Determination of reliability criteria for liver stiffness evaluation by transient elastography [^113kdq4R]. Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Liver stiffness evaluation (LSE) is usually considered reliable when it fulfills all the following criteria: ≥ 10 valid measurements, ≥ 60% success rate, and interquartile range/median ratio (IQR/M) ≤ 0.30. However, such reliable LSE have not been shown to be more accurate than unreliable LSE. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the relevance of the usual definition for LSE reliability and to improve reliability by using diagnostic accuracy as a primary outcome in a large population.

A total of 1,165 patients with chronic liver disease from 19 French centers were included. All patients underwent liver biopsy and LSE. According to the usual definition, 75.7% of LSE were reliable. However, these reliable LSE were not significantly more accurate than unreliable LSE, with 85.8% versus 81.5% well-classified patients for the diagnosis of cirrhosis (P = 0.082).

In multivariate analyses with different diagnostic targets:

- **Independent predictors of fibrosis staging**: LSE median and IQR/M, with no significant influence of ≥ 10 valid measurements or LSE success rate.

These two reliability criteria determined three LSE groups:

- **Very reliable**: IQR/M ≤ 0.10
- **Reliable**: 0.10 < IQR/M ≤ 0.30 with LSE median ≥ 7.1 kPa
- **Poorly reliable**: IQR/M > 0.30 with LSE median ≥ 7.1 kPa

The rates of well-classified patients for the diagnosis of cirrhosis were 90.4%, 85.8%, and 69.5% for the "very reliable", "reliable", and "poorly reliable" groups, respectively (P < 0.001). According to these new reliability criteria, 9.1% of LSE were poorly reliable (versus 24.3% unreliable LSE with the usual definition, P < 0.001), and 74.3% were reliable.

### Pitfalls of liver stiffness measurement: A 5-year prospective study of 13,369 examinations [^116qk8ms]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) based on transient elastography (TE, FibroScan) is gaining in popularity for the noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis. However, LSM has limitations, which have not yet been thoroughly evaluated. We prospectively investigated the frequency and determinants of LSM failure and unreliable results over a 5-year period, based on 13,369 examinations (134,239 shots).

LSM failure was defined as zero valid shots, and unreliable examinations were defined as fewer than 10 valid shots, an interquartile range (IQR)/LSM greater than 30%, or a success rate less than 60%. LSM failure occurred in 3.1% of all examinations (4% at the first examination [n = 7261]) and was independently associated with:

- **Body mass index (BMI) greater than 30 kg/m²**: Odds ratio [OR], 7.5; 95% confidence interval, 5.6–10.2; P = 0.0001.
- **Operator experience fewer than 500 examinations**: OR 2.5 [1.6–4.0]; P = 0.0001.
- **Age greater than 52 years**: OR 2.3 [1.6–3.2]; P = 0.0001.
- **Type 2 diabetes**: OR 1.6 [1.1–2.2]; P = 0.009.

Unreliable results were obtained in a further 15.8% of cases (17% at the first examination) and were independently associated with:

- **BMI greater than 30 kg/m²**: OR 3.3 [2.8–4.0]; P = 0.0001.
- **Operator experience fewer than 500 examinations**: OR 3.1 [2.4–3.9]; P = 0.0001.
- **Age greater than 52 years**: OR 1.8 [1.6–2.1]; P = 0.0001.
- **Female sex**: OR 1.4 [1.2–1.6], P = 0.0001.
- **Hypertension**: OR 1.3 [1.1–1.5]; P = 0.003.
- **Type 2 diabetes**: OR 1.2 [1.0–1.5]; P = 0.05.

When metabolic syndrome and waist circumference were analyzed, results were consistent.

### Using FibroScan to assess for the development of liver fibrosis in patients with arthritis on methotrexate: A single-center experience [^114yQvdg]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Methotrexate (MTX) is often the primary medication to treat various rheumatic diseases (RDs) because of its low cost and its demonstrated efficacy in controlling disease activity. However, a concern has been the potential for hepatic fibrosis associated with long-term MTX usage. This study investigated the association between cumulative MTX intake and the development of liver fibrosis by utilizing noninvasive transient elastography (FibroScan).

All patients with inflammatory arthritis treated with MTX were offered screening with FibroScan. A certified technician measured liver stiffness after patients adhered to a fast. Relevant clinical information was obtained by patient survey and medical records review. The population was divided into quartiles based on participants' cumulative dosage of MTX.

Five hundred twenty patients with RD were included in this study. The prevalence of stages F3 or F4 liver fibrosis was 13.3% in the control group and 12.7% in the entire sample. Compared with subgroup 1 (control with cumulative MTX exposure of ≤ 499 mg), MTX subgroups 2 to 4 were not significantly correlated with higher FibroScan scores (P = 0.82, 0.59, and 0.18, respectively). In multivariable linear regression analysis, statistically significant factors for liver stiffness were BMI, waist circumference, male sex, and age.

No significant correlation between the cumulative MTX dosage and liver stiffness, even at high MTX doses, was observed. The analyses showed significant correlations between the FibroScan score and BMI. These findings were consistent across the sample.

### Non-invasive evaluation of liver fibrosis using transient elastography [^113m4Qxu]. Journal of Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

Transient elastography (TE, FibroScan) is a novel non-invasive method proposed for assessing hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases by measuring liver stiffness. TE is a rapid and user-friendly technique that can be easily performed at the bedside or in the outpatient clinic, providing immediate results and good reproducibility.

Limitations include failure in around 5% of cases, mainly in obese patients. So far, TE has been mostly validated in chronic hepatitis C, demonstrating diagnostic performance equivalent to that of serum markers for diagnosing significant fibrosis. Combining TE with serum markers increases diagnostic accuracy; as a result, liver biopsy could be avoided for the initial assessment in most patients with chronic hepatitis C. This strategy warrants further evaluation in other etiological types of chronic liver diseases.

TE appears to be an excellent tool for early detection of cirrhosis and may have prognostic value in this setting. As TE has excellent patient acceptance, it could be useful for monitoring fibrosis progression and regression in individual cases, but more data are awaited for this application. Guidelines are needed for the use of TE in clinical practice.

### Sampling variability of transient elastography according to probe location [^113CpYtX]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The heterogeneity of fibrosis throughout the liver has been reported. However, the need for several measurements when using transient elastography was not thoroughly investigated. The aim was to determine whether the measurement of liver stiffness varies according to the probe location.

- **Methods**: Six hundred and twenty-five consecutive patients with chronic liver diseases referred for transient elastography were enrolled. All patients underwent successive liver stiffness measurements at three different sites. Representative measurements were acquisitions with a success rate greater than 60% and an interquartile range lower than 30% of the median.

- **Results**: The sample included 371 eligible patients with three representative measurements. Comparing the three successive measurements categorized to fibrosis stages F0-F4, 68.2% of patients had agreement between all three sites. Discordance of one stage was noted in 28.3% of the patients, in 7% for two stages, and in 1.4% for three stages. The κ for comparing the maximal versus the minimal results was 0.43. There was no significant difference in the characteristics of patients with discordance and patients without discordance, including age, sex, waist circumference, BMI, and etiology of liver disease. The stage of fibrosis was associated with discordance between measurements (P < 0.001), demonstrating a low discordance rate in patients with stages F0-F1 or F4 and a high discordance rate in patients with stages F2 and F3.

- **Conclusion**: Sampling variability according to probe location is observed in transient elastography.

### Diagnostic accuracy and prognostic significance of blood fibrosis tests and liver stiffness measurement by FibroScan in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^1165DBXe]. Journal of Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

NAFLD is highly prevalent, but only a small subset of patients develop advanced liver fibrosis with impaired liver-related prognosis. We aimed to compare blood fibrosis tests and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by FibroScan for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and the evaluation of prognosis in NAFLD.

- **Methods**: Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated in a cross-sectional study including 452 NAFLD patients with liver biopsy (NASH-CRN fibrosis stage), LSM, and eight blood fibrosis tests: BARD, NAFLD fibrosis score, FibroMeter(NAFLD), aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), FIB-4, FibroTest, Hepascore, and FibroMeter(V2G). Prognostic accuracy was assessed in a longitudinal study including 360 NAFLD patients.

- **Results**: LSM and FibroMeter(V2G) were the two best-performing tests in the cross-sectional study. AUROCs for advanced fibrosis (F3/4) were 0.831 ± 0.019 and 0.817 ± 0.020, respectively (p ≤ 0.041 vs. other tests). Rates of patients with ⩾90% negative/positive predictive values for F3/4 were 56.4% and 46.7% (p < 0.001 vs. other tests). Obuchowski indexes were 0.834 ± 0.014 and 0.798 ± 0.016 (p ≤ 0.036 vs. other tests). Two fibrosis classifications were developed to estimate the histological fibrosis stage from LSM or FibroMeter(V2G) results without liver biopsy, with diagnostic accuracy of 80.8% vs. 77.4% (p = 0.190). Kaplan-Meier curves in the longitudinal study showed that both classifications categorised NAFLD patients into subgroups with significantly different prognoses (p < 0.001): the higher the class of the fibrosis classification, the more severe the prognosis.

### Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis [^112VC96b]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The presence and degree of hepatic fibrosis are crucial in therapeutic decision-making and predicting clinical outcomes. Currently, the role of liver biopsy as the standard reference for assessing liver fibrosis is being challenged due to several drawbacks, such as invasiveness, sampling error, and inter-/intraobserver variability. In parallel, the non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis has grown significantly, with a wide spectrum of non-invasive methods developed, ranging from serum assays to imaging techniques. Some validated methods, like the Fibrotest/Fibrosure and transient elastography in Europe, are gaining prominence in routine clinical practice, especially in chronic hepatitis C. Large-scale validation is awaited for other chronic liver diseases. However, non-invasive tests detecting significant fibrosis and cirrhosis, the two major clinical endpoints, are not yet at a performance level suitable for routine diagnostic use, and there is still no perfect surrogate or method capable of completely replacing an optimal liver biopsy. This article aims to review non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis assessment and their prospective rational use in clinical practice.

Despite the widespread prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, there remains significant diagnostic uncertainty regarding noninvasive tests for detecting those with more advanced disease. Numerous predictive models have been developed, many of which incorporate age as a covariate. Index derivation studies typically have not included young adults or the elderly, and the predictive utility of these models may not be equivalent across the age spectrum. New cutoffs for advanced fibrosis in individuals over 65 have been proposed and validated in a recent study, but they will require external validation.

### Estimating chronic hepatitis C prognosis using transient elastography-based liver stiffness: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KKDA6]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is a leading cause of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. The level of fibrosis is traditionally established by histology, and prognosis is estimated using fibrosis progression rates (FPRs), which measure the annual probability of progressing across histological stages. However, newer noninvasive alternatives, such as transient elastography (TE), are quickly replacing biopsy. TE quantifies fibrosis by measuring liver stiffness (LSM).

The purpose of this study was to estimate prognosis in treatment-naïve CHC patients using TE-based liver stiffness progression rates (LSPR) as an alternative to FPRs and to compare the consistency between LSPRs and FPRs. A systematic literature search was performed using multiple databases from January 1990 to February 2016. LSPRs were calculated using either a direct method (considering the difference in serial LSMs and time elapsed) or an indirect method based on a single LSM and the estimated duration of infection, which were then pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. For validation purposes, FPRs were also estimated. Heterogeneity was explored through random-effects meta-regression.

Twenty-seven studies reporting on 39 groups of patients (N = 5874) were identified, with 35 groups allowing for indirect and 8 for direct estimation of LSPR. The majority of patients (~58%) were HIV/HCV-coinfected. The estimated time-to-cirrhosis based on TE versus biopsy was 39 and 38 years, respectively. In univariate meta-regressions, male sex and HIV status were positively associated with LSPRs, while age at assessment was negatively associated. Noninvasive prognosis of CHC using TE can provide valuable clinical insights.

### Comparison of nine blood tests and transient elastography for liver fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C: the ANRS HCEP-23 study [^116rqCcw]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). High credibility.

Blood tests and transient elastography (Fibroscan™) have been developed as alternatives to liver biopsy. This ANRS HCEP-23 study compared the diagnostic accuracy of nine blood tests and transient elastography (Fibroscan™) to assess liver fibrosis, versus liver biopsy, in untreated patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC).

- **Methods**: This was a multicentre prospective independent study conducted in 19 French University hospitals. It included consecutive adult patients undergoing simultaneous liver biopsy, biochemical blood tests (performed in a centralized laboratory), and Fibroscan™. Two experienced pathologists independently reviewed the liver biopsies, with a mean length of 25 ± 8.4 mm. Performance was assessed using ROC curves corrected by Obuchowski's method.

- **Results**: Fibroscan™ was not interpretable in 113 (22%) patients. In the 382 patients having both blood tests and interpretable Fibroscan™, Fibroscan™ performed similarly to the best blood tests for diagnosing significant fibrosis and cirrhosis. Obuchowski's measure showed Fibrometer® (0.86), Fibrotest® (0.84), Hepascore® (0.84), and interpretable Fibroscan™ (0.84) to be the most accurate tests. The combination of Fibrotest®, Fibrometer®, or Hepascore® with Fibroscan™ or Apri increased the percentage of well-classified patients from 70–73% to 80–83% for significant fibrosis, although for cirrhosis, this combination offered no improvement. For the 436 patients having all the blood tests, AUROC's ranged from 0.82 (Fibrometer®) to 0.75 (Hyaluronate) for significant fibrosis, and from 0.89 (Fibrometer® and Hepascore®) to 0.83 (FIB-4) for cirrhosis.

### A noninvasive indicator for the diagnosis of early hepatitis B virus-related liver fibrosis [^117JdgYW]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Low credibility.

Liver stiffness measurement (LSM) detected by FibroScan, combined with biochemical indexes, has demonstrated potential value in assessing the pathological degrees of liver fibrosis. We aimed to investigate a noninvasive method for diagnosing hepatitis B virus-related liver fibrosis.

In total, 307 patients who underwent liver biopsy and LSM measurement were included. Inflammation grades and fibrosis stages were evaluated according to the METAVIR scoring system. We conducted Spearman's rank correlation analysis, logistic regression analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to assess the factors' roles in inflammation grades and fibrosis stages.

Spearman's rank correlation analysis revealed that LSM, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and the AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) were positively correlated with inflammation grades and histologic fibrosis stages. Conversely, platelets showed a negative correlation, and the AST-to-ALT ratio was not related. Logistic regression analysis indicated that LSM and APRI were risk factors for inflammation grades. Notably, LSM was identified as the independent risk factor for fibrosis stages.

ROC curve analysis identified LSM cutoff values and areas under the curve for diagnosing fibrosis scores: 6.95 and 0.804, respectively, for significant fibrosis (F ≥ F2); 10.35 and 0.856, respectively, for severe fibrosis (F ≥ F3); and 11.35 and 0.897, respectively, for cirrhosis (F = F4). Considering ALT as a confounding factor, ROC analysis was repeated in patients with normal and elevated ALT levels.

### Discordance in fibrosis staging between liver biopsy and transient elastography using the FibroScan XL probe [^111Y4Ada]. Journal of Hepatology (2012). Low credibility.

The FibroScan XL probe facilitates liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (TE) in obese patients, yet factors affecting its accuracy have not been described. Our objectives were to examine the prevalence, risk factors, and causes of discordance between fibrosis estimated by the FibroScan XL probe and biopsy.

- **Methods**: Two hundred and ten patients with chronic liver disease (45% viral hepatitis and 55% nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)) and a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 28 kg/m² underwent liver biopsy and TE with the FibroScan XL probe. Predictors of discordance ≥ 2 fibrosis stages between measures, which occurred in 11% of patients (n = 24), were identified by comparing patient, TE, and biopsy characteristics of discordant and non-discordant cases.

- **Results**: Fibrosis estimated by the FibroScan XL probe was greater than biopsy in 75% (18 out of 24) of discordant cases. Although biopsy quality was not associated with discordance, discordant cases were less likely to have ≥ 10 valid shots (75% vs. 97%; p = 0.001), a success rate ≥ 60% (67% vs. 95%; p < 0.0005), and an interquartile range over median liver stiffness (IQR/M) < 21% (37% vs. 57%; p = 0.07) than non-discordant cases. However, only increased BMI (odds ratio [OR] 1.09 per kg/m²; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.18; p = 0.04) was independently associated with discordance; liver stiffness was of borderline significance (OR 1.73 per log₁₀-transformed value; 95% CI 0.95–3.18; p = 0.08). Discordance was 4- to 5-fold more frequent among patients with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m²: 32% vs. 8%).

### Evaluation of liver fibrosis: "Something old, something new… " [^114w7jNf]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical research aims to gradually increase the diagnostic ability of non-invasive methods for assessing fibrosis. Castera et al. proposed an algorithm for decision-making based on the combination of TE and Fibrotest® to accurately evaluate fibrosis and cirrhosis. Using this algorithm for diagnosing significant liver fibrosis in patients with CHC, a large number of biopsies (approximately 75%) can be avoided. The combination of a serum-based test with an imaging technique is another step in the ongoing effort to improve the accuracy of non-invasive techniques. Although the use of these algorithms requires advanced computerized systems, they still remain a promising tool in clinical practice.

### Dynamics in liver stiffness measurements predict outcomes in advanced chronic liver disease [^111bijiY]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) provide an opportunity to monitor liver disease progression and regression noninvasively. We aimed to determine the prognostic relevance of LSM dynamics over time for liver-related events and death in patients with chronic liver disease.

- **Methods**: Patients with chronic liver disease who underwent two or more reliable LSMs at least 180 days apart were included in this retrospective cohort study. They were stratified at baseline as nonadvanced chronic liver disease (non-ACLD, BL-LSM < 10 kPa), compensated ACLD (cACLD, BL-LSM ≥ 10 kPa), and decompensated ACLD. Data on all consecutive LSMs and clinical outcomes were collected.

- **Results**: There were 2508 patients with 8561 reliable LSMs (3 per patient; interquartile range, 2–4): 1647 (65.7%) with non-ACLD, 757 (30.2%) with cACLD, and 104 (4.1%) with decompensated ACLD. Seven non-ACLD patients (0.4%) and 83 patients with cACLD (10.9%) developed hepatic decompensation (median follow-up, 71 months). A 20% increase in LSM at any time was associated with an approximately 50% increased risk of hepatic decompensation (hazard ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.41–1.79; P < .001) and liver-related death (hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.28–1.68; P < .001) in patients with cACLD. LSM dynamics yielded a high accuracy to predict hepatic decompensation in the following 12 months (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve = 0.933). The performance of LSM dynamics was numerically better than dynamics in Fibrosis-4 score (0.873) and Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (0.835).

### Clinically significant fibrosis is associated with longitudinal increases in fibrosis-4 and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis scores [^112Y5cAX]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

There is limited knowledge regarding the longitudinal utility of biomarkers of fibrosis, such as the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score (NFS) or the fibrosis-4 score (FIB-4). We examined longitudinal changes in the NFS and the FIB-4 score in patients with NAFLD, with and without clinically significant fibrosis (CSF).

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective study of 230 patients with NAFLD, collecting clinical and laboratory records to calculate NFS and FIB-4 scores at 6-month intervals for 5 years before hepatology assessment of fibrosis. Linear mixed models with random intercept and slope, adjusted for age at baseline, were used to assess the progression of NFS and log-transformed FIB-4 scores over time in subjects with and without CSF, determined by liver stiffness measurements of 8.2 kPa or greater.

- **Results**: Patients had a median of 11 (minimum 10; maximum 11) retrospective observations over a median time period of 5 years (minimum 4.5 years; maximum 5 years). Of patients with low baseline NFS and FIB-4 scores, 31.11% and 37.76%, respectively, had CSF at the time of hepatology assessment. There was a correlation between NFS and log₁₀ FIB-4 over time (repeated measure r = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.52–0.59). The rate of increase in NFS and log₁₀ FIB-4 was significantly higher in patients with than without CSF (both P < .001). Predicted NFS increased by 0.17 and 0.06 units per year in subjects with and without CSF, respectively. Predicted log₁₀ FIB-4 score increased by 0.032 and 0.0003 units per year in subjects with and without CSF.

### Early on-treatment LSM reliably predicts liver-related events in CHB patients with significant fibrosis and cirrhosis [^115NWSVN]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

Evidence comparing longitudinal liver stiffness measurements (LSM) dynamics to on-treatment LSM for predicting clinical outcomes in patients receiving etiology therapy is limited.

This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of on-treatment LSM in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) receiving antiviral therapy. Patients with CHB and significant fibrosis or cirrhosis were included in this prospective cohort. Liver-related events (LREs) were defined as hepatic decompensations, liver transplantation, or liver-related death. The association between LREs and baseline, on-treatment, and dynamic changes in LSM were analyzed.

A total of 1116 patients with CHB, including 875 (78.4%) diagnosed with cirrhosis, were followed for a median of 7.5 (2.5–9.5) years. On-treatment LSM was the most reliable predictor of 3- and 5-year outcomes (AUROC: 0.72–0.78) after 1–3 years of antiviral therapy, outperforming baseline LSM (AUROC: 0.59–0.65) and LSM changes (AUROC: 0.42–0.65). Patients with LSM < 10 kPa at 1, 2, or 3 years of antiviral therapy have a much lower risk of LREs, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of 2.2%, 2.6%, and 2.7%, respectively. This finding held true in the cirrhosis subgroup, in the validation cohort, and for predicting decompensations alone. Notably, patients with on-treatment LSM < 10 kPa showed better restoration of lobular architecture assessed by liver biopsies.

On-treatment LSM measured 1 to 3 years after antiviral therapy offers superior predictive accuracy for LREs compared to baseline or LSM changes, with LSM < 10 kPa predicting favorable outcomes.

### Prothrombin index decrease: A useful and reliable marker of extensive fibrosis [^115wSJ4G]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Non-invasive serum markers of extensive liver fibrosis are required in clinical practice for several reasons: (1) although histological analysis is considered the gold standard for diagnosing extensive fibrosis and cirrhosis, the rate of false-negative results is approximately 15–20%; (2) liver biopsy is an invasive procedure with a 1/10,000 mortality rate, even though occurrences of death are exceptional in patients with diffuse liver disease; (3) patients with chronic viral hepatitis must undergo multiple liver biopsies during follow-up to assess the progression of tissue injury. In this leading article, we briefly overview the recent progress in non-invasive serum markers for predicting the extent of liver fibrosis. Among these serum markers, we focused on the prothrombin index, which seems to be a reliable and cost-effective marker for diagnosing extensive fibrosis.

### Advances and challenges in the management of advanced fibrosis in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [^113x8obp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Detection of fibrosis among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis

As stated above, NASH is the progressive form of NAFLD, and individuals with advanced fibrosis are at a greater risk for adverse outcomes in the long term. Although the gold standard for diagnosing NASH and staging fibrosis is through histological evaluation by a liver biopsy, research has focused on developing non-invasive assessments of fibrosis, either via imaging techniques or serum biomarkers and the panels utilizing those biomarkers.

- **Imaging**: Traditional imaging modalities like ultrasound, computerized tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have been used for diagnosing NAFLD. However, these modalities are unable to diagnose NASH or stage hepatic fibrosis. On the other hand, several new technologies have assessed tissue stiffness as a surrogate of hepatic fibrosis. In this context, transient elastography (TE), a non-invasive method that measures liver stiffness, has been shown to estimate hepatic fibrosis. Another method is acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI), which integrates elastography and conventional B-mode ultrasonography. Different from TE, ARFI targets a slightly larger region of interest in the liver parenchyma. Different studies have shown an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) between 0.86 and 0.94 for mild to moderate fibrosis (F1 and F2), and 0.90–0.98 for advanced fibrosis (F3 and above). While these two modalities focus on a relatively small part of the liver, another technology, magnetic resonance elastography (MRE),…

### Guidelines on the management of abnormal liver blood tests [^117J7mYC]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

- **Recommendation 9**: Harmful drinkers should undergo risk stratification with clinical assessment and Fibroscan/ARFI elastography. Adults should be referred to secondary care if there is evidence of advanced liver disease (features of cirrhosis or portal hypertension on imaging or from blood tests) and/or Fibroscan reading is > 16 kPa (if available).

Patients flagged up with the AUDIT-C but drinking > 100 g alcohol/week (or biochemical evidence of liver injury with a gamma-GT or ALT > 100 U/L) should be considered for an assessment of liver fibrosis, similar to the higher-risk group.

- **Research recommendation 2**: Further evidence is required to establish the most cost-effective approach to identify patients with ARLD and NAFLD at risk of having advanced liver fibrosis.

### Noninvasive measures of liver fibrosis [^116cCegg]. Hepatology (2006). Low credibility.

As novel therapies for liver fibrosis evolve, non-invasive measurement of liver fibrosis will be required to help manage patients with chronic liver disease. Although liver biopsy is the time-honored gold standard for measurement of liver fibrosis, it is poorly suited to frequent monitoring because of its expense and morbidity, and its accuracy suffers from sampling variation. Currently, serum markers and imaging methods are available and increasingly in use as alternatives to biopsy. However, many questions remain about their indications, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness, and more investigation is required before they are put into widespread use. The development of safe, inexpensive, and reliable noninvasive fibrosis measurement tools remains a research priority in clinical hepatology.

### Fibroscan-aspartate aminotransferase (FAST) score for monitoring histological improvement in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis activity during semaglutide treatment: Post-hoc analysis of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial [^116VgkSo]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Detailed information on the design of the trial has been published previously (Appendix pg 4). Briefly, eligible patients had biopsy-confirmed NASH, F1–3, NAS ≥ 4, body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m², and glycated haemoglobin ≤ 10%. Patients were randomised to receive semaglutide at doses of 0.1 mg, 0.2 mg, 0.4 mg, or placebo, given once daily in a 3:1 ratio of semaglutide to placebo at each dose level. Titration started at a dose of 0.05 mg and was escalated in 4-week increments to the randomised dose. Treatment continued for 72 weeks, followed by a 7-week follow-up period. The primary endpoint was NASH resolution with no worsening of liver fibrosis.

The original study was approved by an independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each site. Informed consent was obtained from every participant before any trial-related activities took place, including activities to determine suitability for the trial.

- **FAST measurements**: AST, LSM, and CAP (if available) were determined at baseline and at weeks 28, 52, and 72 of treatment. For FibroScan, centres were required to apply quality criteria comprising an interquartile range/median ratio less than 30%, with at least 10 measurements performed. The results of these quality assessments were not available for this analysis, and so no data were excluded on this basis. Liver biopsy was performed at baseline and week 72. Other parameters were also recorded at baseline and during treatment.

- **Post-hoc analyses**: The main objective of these post-hoc analyses was to compare changes in FAST score from baseline to week 72 with histological improvements.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatitis C virus infection, more specifically with respect to the evaluation for liver fibrosis, AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend interpreting a longitudinal decrease or increase in liver stiffness within an individualized clinical context. This should consider the effect of noninvasive liver disease assessment modifiers and other supportive evidence of an improving or worsening clinical course.

### Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis [^117BFVne]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The presence and degree of hepatic fibrosis are crucial for making therapeutic decisions and predicting clinical outcomes. Currently, the role of liver biopsy as the standard reference for assessing liver fibrosis has been challenged due to its drawbacks, such as invasiveness, sampling error, and inter-/intraobserver variability. In response to these challenges, non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis has grown significantly in recent years. A wide spectrum of non-invasive methods, ranging from serum assays to imaging techniques, has been developed.

Some validated methods, such as the Fibrotest/Fibrosure and transient elastography in Europe, are gaining a growing role in routine clinical practice, especially in chronic hepatitis C. Large-scale validation is awaited in the setting of other chronic liver diseases. However, non-invasive tests used to detect significant fibrosis and cirrhosis — the two major clinical endpoints — are not yet performing at a level suitable for routine diagnostic tests. There is still no perfect surrogate method capable of completely replacing an optimal liver biopsy.

This article reviews non-invasive tests for the assessment of liver fibrosis and explores the perspectives for their rational use in clinical practice.

### Interobserver discrepancy in liver fibrosis using transient elastography [^114z8UCM]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2012). Low credibility.

Transient elastography is a useful method to assess liver fibrosis, but uncertainties still exist regarding the reliability and reproducibility of the technique. We aimed to improve knowledge on interobserver variability with the procedure and tried to find factors associated with such variability. This was a cross-sectional study comparing the results of transient elastography performed by two different operators, with one test conducted immediately after the other. We assessed both results using correlation tests and either repeated parametric or nonparametric tests, as needed. A multivariate analysis was also conducted to identify factors associated with discrepancies in the results obtained by the two operators.

We included a total of 333 pairs of transient elastography tests, belonging to 274 different patients. Of these, 325 pairs of tests (97.6%) were valid. The results of the first and second tests were, respectively, a median (and interquartile range) of 6.2 (4.6–10.6) kPa and 6.0 (4.4–10.1) kPa (P = 0.012), with a mean ± standard deviation of log₁₀ of direct measurement 0.892 ± 0.316 and 0.871 ± 0.324 (P = 0.001). In 87 pairs of tests (26.7%), a discrepancy of at least 2 kPa was found between both results, and in 15 pairs of tests (4.6%), a discrepancy of at least 10 kPa was found. Discordance of at least one stage between both measurements was noted in 74 pairs of tests (22.8%). An association was found between higher stiffness and discrepancy between both operators (P < 0.001). Although transient elastography is a very convenient test to assess liver fibrosis in clinical practice, interobserver variability remains a challenge.

### Fibroscan (vibration-controlled transient elastography): Where does it stand in the United States practice [^114AZpCk]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

With widespread screening and increasingly effective treatments for patients with viral hepatitis, as well as the increasing prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the population presenting to the care of gastroenterologists and hepatologists is certain to increase. Assessment of advanced liver disease is traditionally invasive and expensive. Vibration-controlled transient elastography, commonly delivered by the FibroScan device, is an option recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the noninvasive assessment of liver disease at the point of care. Herein, we review the promise and pitfalls of vibration-controlled transient elastography, with the aim of providing clinicians with a framework to interpret its results and apply this technology to the changing needs of our patients.

### Elastography for the diagnosis of severity of fibrosis in chronic liver disease: a meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy [^116PJxsP]. Journal of Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Aims: Transient elastography is a non-invasive method for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis, developed as an alternative to liver biopsy. We studied the performance of elastography for the diagnosis of fibrosis using meta-analysis.

Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCI, Cochrane Library, conference abstracts books, and article references were searched. We included studies using biopsy as a reference standard, with the data necessary to calculate the true and false positive, true and false negative diagnostic results of elastography for a fibrosis stage. A 3-month maximum interval between tests was allowed. The quality of the studies was rated with the QUADAS tool.

Results: We identified 40 eligible studies. Summary sensitivity and specificity were 0.79 (95% CI 0.74–0.82) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.72–0.83) for F2 stage and 0.83 (95% CI 0.79–0.86) and 0.89 (95% CI 0.87–0.91) for cirrhosis. After an elastography result at or over the threshold value for F2 or cirrhosis ("positive" result), the corresponding post-test probability for their presence (if pre-test probability was 50%) was 78% and 88% respectively, while, if values were below these thresholds ("negative" result), the post-test probability was 21% and 16%, respectively. No optimal stiffness cut-offs for individual fibrosis stages were validated in independent cohorts, and cut-offs had a wide range and overlap within and between stages.

Conclusions: Elastography theoretically has good sensitivity and specificity for cirrhosis (and less for lesser degrees of fibrosis); however, it should be cautiously applied to everyday clinical practice.

### Fibroscan-aspartate aminotransferase (FAST) score for monitoring histological improvement in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis activity during semaglutide treatment: Post-hoc analysis of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial [^111UrBn2]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Currently, assessment of candidate pharmacotherapies in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) involves invasive liver biopsy. Non-invasive scores, such as the FibroScan-aspartate aminotransferase (FAST) score, are used to identify candidates for therapy, but their ability to assess disease progression or treatment effect is unknown. We aimed to assess the association between FAST score and histological endpoints.

- **Methods**: We conducted a post-hoc analysis using data from a prior randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial at 143 sites across 16 countries. Patients (aged 18–75 years) with biopsy-confirmed NASH, fibrosis stage 1–3, and a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Activity Score (NAS) ≥ 4 were enrolled between January 2017 and September 2018, and randomly assigned to receive once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg or placebo for 72 weeks. A subgroup analysis of patients with FAST score and histological data in the pooled semaglutide treatment and placebo arms at baseline and week 72 was performed. The original trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02970942.

- **Findings**: A total of 122 patients were included in this post-hoc analysis (93 received semaglutide and 29 received placebo). FAST score reduction was associated with achieving the primary endpoint of NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis in the pooled semaglutide group (area under the receiver operating curve 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58, 0.81). Mean FAST score reduction from baseline to week 72 was greatest in patients who met the…

### Baveno VII - Renewing consensus in portal hypertension [^113L6iuf]. Journal of Hepatology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for portal hypertension, specifically concerning liver elastography follow-up, Baveno VII 2022 guidelines recommend repeating an index liver stiffness measurement ≥ 10 kPa in fasting conditions as soon as feasible. Alternatively, this can be complemented with an established serum marker of fibrosis (FIB-4 ≥ 2.67, enhanced liver fibrosis test ≥ 9.8, FibroTest ≥ 0.58 for alcohol-related/viral liver disease, or FibroTest ≥ 0.48 for MASLD) since transient elastography can lead to false-positive results.

With respect to diagnostic investigations for portal hypertension, particularly concerning liver elastography, the WFUMB 2024 guidelines suggest recognizing the predictive values of vibration-controlled transient elastography liver stiffness measurements. The guidance for different situations is as follows:

- **Situation**: 25 kPa

### Evidence of NAFLD progression from steatosis to fibrosing-steatohepatitis using paired biopsies: Implications for prognosis and clinical management [^117N5Tis]. Journal of Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

There remains uncertainty about the natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The spectrum of NAFLD includes non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL; steatosis without hepatocellular injury) and steatohepatitis (NASH; steatosis with hepatocyte ballooning degeneration ± fibrosis). Our aim was to assess the histological severity of NAFLD in a cohort with serial biopsy data, and determine factors predicting progression.

- **Methods**: Patients with two liver biopsies more than a year apart were identified. Clinical and laboratory data were collected from the time of liver biopsy.

- **Results**: 108 patients had serial biopsies (median interval 6.6 years, range 1.3–22.6). 81 (75%) patients had NASH and 27 had NAFL. Overall, 45 (42%) patients had fibrosis progression, 43 (40%) had no change in fibrosis, while 20 (18%) had fibrosis regression. Importantly, no significant difference in the proportion exhibiting fibrosis progression was found between those with NAFL or NASH at index biopsy (37% vs. 43%, p = 0.65). Progression to NASH was seen in 44% of patients with baseline NAFL. Of 10 patients with NAFL who had fibrosis progression, 3 progressed by 1 stage, 5 by 2 stages, and 2 by 3 stages; all had NASH on follow-up biopsy. Of concern, 6 of 27 (22%) patients with baseline NAFL reached stage 3 fibrosis at follow-up biopsy. Among the patients with NAFL, 80% of those having fibrosis progression were diabetic at the follow-up liver biopsy compared with 25% of non-progressors (p = 0.005).

- **Conclusions**: Contrary to dogma, this study suggests that steatosis can progress in a significant number of cases.

### Ultrasound-based transient elastography for the detection of hepatic fibrosis: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^111wbZtL]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2007). Low credibility.

Ultrasound-based transient elastography is a promising noninvasive alternative to liver biopsy for detecting hepatic fibrosis. However, its overall test performance in various settings remains unknown. The aims of this study were to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy studies comparing ultrasound-based transient elastography with liver biopsy for hepatic fibrosis.

- **Methods**: Electronic and manual bibliographic searches to identify potential studies were performed. Selection of studies was based on reported accuracy of ultrasound-based transient elastography compared with liver biopsy. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Meta-analysis combined the sensitivities, specificities, and likelihood ratios of individual studies. The extent and reasons for heterogeneity were assessed.

- **Results**: Nine studies in full publication were identified. For patients with stage IV fibrosis (cirrhosis), the pooled estimates for sensitivity were 87% (95% confidence interval, 84%-90%), specificity 91% (95% CI, 89%-92%), positive likelihood ratio 11.7 (95% CI, 7.9–17.1), and negative likelihood ratio 0.14 (95% CI, 0.10–0.20). Among seven investigations reporting patients with stages II-IV fibrosis, the pooled estimates for sensitivity were 70% (95% CI, 67%-73%), specificity 84% (95% CI, 80%-88%), positive likelihood ratio 4.2 (95% CI, 2.4–7.2), and negative likelihood ratio 0.31 (95% CI, 0.23–0.43). Diagnostic threshold (or cut-off value) bias was identified as an important cause of heterogeneity for pooled results in both patients.

### Performance of transient elastography for the staging of liver fibrosis: a meta-analysis [^115mUgnG]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Transient elastography has been studied in a multitude of liver diseases for the staging of liver fibrosis with variable results. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the overall performance of transient elastography for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and to analyze factors influencing the diagnostic accuracy.

- **Methods**: Literature databases and international conference abstracts were searched. Inclusion criteria were as follows: evaluation of transient elastography, liver biopsy as reference, and assessment of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model for the AUROC, summary receiver operating curve techniques, as well as meta-regression approaches.

- **Results**: Fifty studies were included in the analysis. The mean AUROC for the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and cirrhosis were 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.86), 0.89 (95% CI, 0.88–0.91), and 0.94 (95% CI, 0.93–0.95), respectively. For the diagnosis of significant fibrosis, a significant reduction of heterogeneity of the AUROC was found when differentiating between the underlying liver diseases (P < .001). Other factors influencing the AUROC were the scoring system used and the country in which the study was performed. Age, body mass index, and biopsy quality did not have a significant effect on the AUROC.

- **Conclusions**: Transient elastography can be performed with excellent diagnostic accuracy and is independent of the underlying liver disease for the diagnosis of cirrhosis. However, for the assessment of significant fibrosis, certain factors such as the scoring system used and the country of the study can influence the diagnostic accuracy.

### Dynamic evaluation of liver stiffness measurement to improve diagnostic accuracy of liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B acute exacerbation [^114GBEiH]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2011). Low credibility.

To investigate the dynamic changes of liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by FibroScan® and improve its diagnostic accuracy, we studied patients with chronic hepatitis B undergoing acute exacerbation. Eighty-nine treatment-naïve patients were enrolled, and FibroScan® was performed every 7–10 days during hospitalization and every 1–3 months for follow-up. Hematology and liver functions were tested in parallel. Liver biopsies were conducted in 23 patients. A total of 282 LSMs were performed.

- **Correlation with ALT and bilirubin**: LSM was positively correlated with both alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (r = 0.321, P < 0.01) and total bilirubin (r = 0.413, P < 0.01). In patients showing high LSMs during admission (≥ 18.2 kPa), only 5 were diagnosed with cirrhosis by histopathology or ultrasonography. As ALT normalized, LSMs remained over 12.0 kPa in all these 5 patients. However, in 18 other patients without cirrhosis at baseline, LSMs still remained above 12.0 kPa in 10 patients and decreased to below 12.0 kPa in the other 8 patients. LSMs decreased in parallel with ALT and bilirubin normalization.

- **Diagnostic implications**: LSM performed after ALT and bilirubin normalization may improve the accuracy in diagnosing cirrhosis in patients with exacerbations of hepatitis B.

### AASLD practice guideline on imaging-based noninvasive liver disease assessment of hepatic fibrosis and steatosis [^114cZUDh]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hepatitis C virus infection, particularly in evaluating liver fibrosis, the AASLD 2025 guidelines recommend using liver stiffness measurements obtained before initiating antiviral therapy. This is considered the most accurate longitudinal noninvasive parameter for assessing liver disease and prognostication effects. This recommendation is due to the limited evidence available linking liver stiffness measurements with clinical outcomes once viral suppression or eradication is achieved in patients treated for HCV infection.

### Assessment of biopsy-proven liver fibrosis by two-dimensional shear wave elastography: An individual patient data-based meta-analysis [^116MbF2F]. Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic liver diseases can cause sustained or intermittent inflammation of the liver associated with a healing process, leading to progressive fibrosis and finally to cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis are at risk of developing complications, including esophageal varices, ascites, liver failure, encephalopathy, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Accurate assessment of the severity of liver fibrosis and a reliable diagnosis of cirrhosis are important steps for the management of patients with chronic liver diseases as they provide information that guides therapeutic decisions.

For decades, liver biopsy has been used as the reference standard for staging liver fibrosis. However, liver biopsy is an invasive method associated with patient discomfort, cost, and rarely, serious complications. In addition, its accuracy is limited due to intraobserver and interobserver variability and sampling error. In recent years, research has focused on the evaluation of noninvasive methods for the assessment of liver fibrosis. The most intensively evaluated noninvasive method is the measurement of liver stiffness, mainly with ultrasound-based shear wave elastography. Different shear wave–based elastographic methods are available, including transient elastography (TE), point shear wave elastography, and two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE).

The most extensively evaluated elastographic method for liver stiffness is TE (FibroScan; Echosens, Paris, France). It was the first on the market and has good diagnostic accuracy for at least significant liver fibrosis.

### Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis [^114zbD3p]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Detection and quantification of hepatic fibrosis represent a longstanding challenge in hepatology. Currently, the accurate assessment of liver fibrosis has become increasingly important to make therapeutic decisions, determine prognosis, and follow up on disease progression. Hepatic fibrogenesis is a dynamic process reflecting an imbalanced extracellular matrix turnover. Therefore, evaluating the evolution of fibrosis over time may be more important than a "once only" diagnosis. Recent evidence suggests that liver fibrosis can be reversible, further emphasizing the importance of monitoring fibrosis over time rather than simply diagnosing its presence and staging its severity.

Accurate, reproducible, and easily applied methods are thus required for the assessment of hepatic fibrosis. The present article reviews the non-invasive means for assessing liver fibrosis and the existing evidence of their clinical validation in different settings of chronic liver disease. Clinical needs and realistic endpoints are taken into account. Furthermore, critical issues regarding the evaluation of performance and validation of any new surrogates, as well as future perspectives for their clinical applicability, are discussed.

### Fibroscan-AST (FAST) score for the non-invasive identification of patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis with significant activity and fibrosis: A prospective derivation and global validation study [^114FMpbf]. The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2020). Low credibility.

This study provides a solution to better identify patients who might be candidates for clinical trials or treatments as they become available. There is a high screen failure rate at liver biopsy due to the absence of such tools. This score will reduce the number of patients undergoing unnecessary liver biopsies.

The results of this study have the potential to assist clinicians and investigators in decision-making, optimizing patient selection for clinical trials or access to emerging therapies, and streamlining the need for liver biopsies among patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in clinical care. This could possibly lead to a reduction in the number of required biopsies. Future research should focus on studying the performance of the FAST (Fibroscan-AST) score in primary care.

Currently, identification of patients with active NASH and significant fibrosis can be achieved using non-invasive markers that risk-stratify liver fibrosis or require percutaneous liver biopsy. The use of non-invasive markers includes algorithms, serum biomarkers, and imaging modalities, but does not determine the presence or degree of inflammatory liver injury. The presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and more profound liver cell injury, as determined by measures of steatosis (lobular inflammation and ballooning), are crucial drivers of liver fibrosis development in patients with NAFLD and are important in risk stratification.

We present a prespecified secondary analysis of a previously published study, with results indicating the efficacy of the FAST score in this context.

### Non-invasive assessment of liver fibrosis [^111zZMfD]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Transient elastography (TE) (Fibroscan ®, Echosens ®, Paris, France) is one of the most widely used noninvasive methods in Europe for both chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and other liver diseases. Briefly, vibrations of mild amplitude and low frequency are transmitted by the transducer, inducing an elastic shear wave that propagates within the liver. Pulse-echo ultrasonic acquisitions follow the shear wave to measure its speed, which is directly related to the tissue stiffness (the harder the tissue, the faster the shear propagates). Results are expressed in kilopascals (Kpa) and correspond to the median value of ten validated measurements ranging from 2.5 to 75 Kpa, with 5.5 Kpa reported to define normality.

The volume of liver tissue evaluated by TE approximates a cylinder of 4×1 cm, which is at least 100 times larger than a liver biopsy. Moreover, TE is painless, rapid (less than 5 minutes), and thus highly acceptable for patients. The diagnostic performance of TE has been widely addressed. The diagnostic accuracy of TE for cirrhosis is good, with pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity approaching 90%. However, for the detection of significant fibrosis, the diagnostic value of TE is substantially lower, with pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity ranging from 70–80%.

In a recent meta-analysis on TE, 40 studies were included after applying strict inclusion criteria: use of liver biopsy as the reference standard, time interval between TE and liver biopsy of less than 3 months, and adequate methodological quality.

### Prospective screening for significant liver fibrosis by fibrosis-4 in primary care patients without known liver disease [^111mp9Qe]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

The first two studies on screening for significant liver fibrosis in general practice were conducted by measuring liver stiffness using transient elastography. The liver elasticity threshold used in these two studies was 7 kPa. These studies demonstrated a prevalence of 17% of significant fibrosis in subjects who consulted in general practice. However, screening for hepatic fibrosis by measuring hepatic elasticity in subjects who consult a GP is difficult to achieve in general practice in France. Therefore, we employed the simplest and most widely used fibrosis blood test, the FIB-4 Fibrosis Score, to prospectively define the prevalence of significant fibrosis in a population of 2121 consecutive subjects consulting a GP with no previously known hepatic disease.

Most other studies in general practice have considered a higher threshold of fibrosis, referred to as advanced fibrosis, to distinguish patients who need referral to specialists from those who could continue to be followed in general practice. Some have proposed an algorithm using FIB-4 and then a specialized enhanced liver fibrosis test in FIB-4-positive subjects to refine the search for subjects with advanced fibrosis. This succession of tests is costly and difficult to implement in general practice.

We based our study on FIB-4 by taking a blood sample for NFS and Fibrometer tests. Using the recommended FIB-4 thresholds based on age, we observed a rate of significant fibrosis of 19.1%, which is close to the one reported with transient elastography. Comparable rates were observed with the NFS, which is more complex.

### Improvement of liver fibrosis after long-term antiviral therapy assessed by Fibroscan in chronic hepatitis B patients with advanced fibrosis [^1177eLRK]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Performing repeated liver biopsies to assess the improvement of liver fibrosis is impractical. This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the improvement of liver fibrosis during antiviral treatment by serial liver stiffness (LS) measurement using Fibroscan in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients with advanced fibrosis.

Nucleos(t)ide analog-naive CHB patients with advanced fibrosis in histological findings (stage ≥ F3), high viral load (hepatitis B virus DNA ≥ 2,000 IU/ml), and normal liver enzyme levels (< 2 × upper normal limit) before starting antiviral treatment were included in this study. LS measurement was performed at baseline and annually for five years during antiviral treatment. Five-year fibrosis improvement was defined as LS value < 7.2 kPa (< F3) at year five.

The mean LS value of 120 patients significantly decreased over time (14.5 kPa at baseline; 11.3 kPa at year one; 9.6 kPa at year two; 9.3 kPa at year three; 8.6 kPa at year four; and 8.3 kPa at year five). Multivariate analysis showed that baseline LS value was the only predictor of five-year fibrosis improvement (odds ratio, 0.907; 95% confidence interval, 0.838–0.980; P = 0.014). Patients with low baseline LS values (< 12.0 kPa) had a greater probability of experiencing significant fibrosis improvement than those with high baseline LS values (≥ 12.0 kPa) (81.5% vs. 29.0%, P < 0.001).

In CHB patients with advanced fibrosis receiving antiviral treatment, annual LS measurement revealed that fibrosis improvement slows but continues during treatment. A low LS value (< 12.0 kPa) at baseline was a significant predictor of fibrosis improvement over time.

### Comparing serial and current liver stiffness measurements to predict decompensation in compensated advanced chronic liver disease patients [^1151CdS3]. Hepatology (2025). Low credibility.

The utility of serial liver stiffness measurements (LSM) to predict decompensation in patients with compensated advanced chronic liver disease (cACLD) remains unclear. We aimed to validate whether comparing serial LSM is superior to using the LSM to predict liver-related events (LRE) in patients with cACLD.

- **Approach and results**: In this retrospective analysis of an international registry, patients with cACLD and serial LSM were followed up until index LRE. We compared the performance of both the dynamic LSM changes and the LSM in predicting LRE using Cox regression analysis, considering time zero of follow-up as the date of the latest liver stiffness measurement. Overall, 480 patients with cACLD with serial LSM were included from 5 countries. The most common etiology of cACLD was viral (53%) and MASLD (34%). Over a median follow-up of 68 (IQR: 45–92) months, 32% experienced a LSM decrease to levels below 10 kPa (resolved cACLD) and 5.8% experienced LRE. Resolved cACLD patients were more likely to be non-diabetic and had better liver function. While a higher value of the LSM was associated with higher LREs, LSM changes over time (LSM slope) were not associated with LRE. In multivariable Cox regression, neither the prior LSM nor the LSM slope added predictive value to the latest liver stiffness measurement.

- **Conclusions**: Once the LSM is known, previous LSM values do not add to the prediction of LREs in patients with cACLD.

### Significant variations in elastometry measurements made within short-term in patients with chronic liver diseases [^114QsdGd]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2015). Low credibility.

Transient elastometry is a noninvasive procedure used to measure fibrosis when patients are diagnosed with liver disease; it might be used to monitor changes over time. We investigated whether there are short-term variations in stiffness measurements that are not attributable to changes in fibrosis by studying patients with stable liver disease.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of 531 paired liver stiffness measurements made by Fibroscan when the study began (LSM1) and at follow-up (LSM2). These measurements were taken more than 1 day and less than 1 year apart from 432 stable (considering body mass index, waist circumference, and alcohol consumption), untreated, immunocompetent patients with chronic liver disease (from January 2006 through March 2009). Variations between the first and follow-up measurements were expressed as absolute differences (LSM2-LSM1, kPa), relative changes ([LSM2-LSM1]/LSM1×100), or as changes in fibrosis stage.

- **Results**: There was a > 20% variation in 49.7%, > 30% in 34.3%, and > 50% in 12.2% of paired measurements; this variation was constant across the spectrum of LSM1 values. The variations produced a 1-fibrosis stage difference in 31.5% of pairs and a ≥ 2-stage difference in 9.8% of pairs. Patients with LSM1 > 7 kPa had an increased probability of having a different stage of fibrosis at LSM2 compared with patients with LSM1 < 7 kPa. Factors associated with variation included measurements made by two different operators or at least one non-senior operator, ratios of interquartile range to median values, significant fibrosis (≥ 7 kPa) at LSM1, baseline body mass index, or a two-fold difference.
