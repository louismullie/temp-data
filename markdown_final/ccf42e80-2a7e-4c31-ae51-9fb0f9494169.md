## Question

Care plan for itp

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a step-by-step care plan for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding secondary causes. Then, I should classify disease phase and assess bleeding risk. Next, I will determine the care setting and whether to observe or treat. After that, I will outline first-line therapies for adults and children, followed by second-line options and how to choose among them. Finally, I need to address special scenarios, monitoring and safety, and patient education and shared decision-making, while double-checking where the evidence is strong versus conditional and where practice diverges from guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude secondary causes, because ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion and missing secondary etiologies can alter management substantially. I should verify that the thrombocytopenia is isolated, review the smear to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia and other hematologic disorders, and screen for HIV and hepatitis C, with additional testing guided by history and exam, including consideration of H. pylori in selected adults; I need to ensure I do not over-order bone marrow biopsy, which is not routinely required in typical presentations, especially in younger patients with isolated thrombocytopenia and no atypical features [^112zaWuA].

> Next, I should review disease phase and bleeding severity to frame decisions. ITP is categorized as newly diagnosed, persistent (3–12 months), or chronic (> 12 months), and treatment thresholds hinge on bleeding phenotype rather than platelet count alone; I should double-check that I am using WHO bleeding grades consistently and documenting health-related quality of life (HRQoL) impacts, because fatigue, anxiety, and activity restriction often drive therapy choices even when bleeding is minimal [^116EAqos] [^115ejBWh].

> Now, I need to determine the care setting. For adults with newly diagnosed ITP and platelets less than 20 × 10⁹/L, I should consider admission given bleeding risk and diagnostic uncertainty; wait, let me verify the nuance — ASH suggests admission for newly diagnosed adults with very low counts, but for established ITP with counts less than 20 × 10⁹/L, outpatient management with close follow-up is reasonable if reliable and safe. For children, outpatient management is generally preferred even with counts less than 20 × 10⁹/L if there is no or only mild skin bleeding and reliable follow-up, with admission reserved for diagnostic uncertainty, social barriers, or significant comorbidities. I should confirm expedited hematology follow-up within 24–72 hours for all new diagnoses and after discharge [^115dTSBE] [^1117SQQf] [^114Lnky9] [^116RC8aK] [^1131n9qF] [^113Y6GCz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treating everyone with low platelets; I should verify when observation is appropriate. In adults with newly diagnosed ITP and platelets 30 × 10⁹/L or higher who are asymptomatic or have only minor mucocutaneous bleeding, ASH recommends observation rather than corticosteroids, with individualized exceptions for older age, comorbidities, anticoagulant use, or upcoming procedures. In children with no or minor bleeding, observation is strongly favored over any initial pharmacotherapy, given high spontaneous remission rates and the risks of overtreatment [^112JyWuG] [^114zcwBo] [^116MmeKR].

> For adults who warrant treatment, I will now examine first-line options. A short course of corticosteroids is standard, and I should confirm the duration cap at 6 weeks total including taper to mitigate toxicity; prednisone 0.5–2 mg/kg/day or pulse dexamethasone 40 mg/day for 4 days are acceptable regimens, with the choice individualized. If a rapid rise is needed, I should add IVIG 1 g/kg once, repeating if necessary, and consider anti-D in appropriate Rh-positive patients; I need to ensure I am not substituting anti-D for IVIG when crossmatching or hemolysis risks exist [^115hdFPa] [^113pekJ4] [^112zaWuA].

> But wait, what if someone proposes rituximab up front with steroids to improve remission rates? I should double-check guideline positioning. ASH suggests corticosteroids alone rather than adding rituximab initially, though three RCTs show higher durable response with combination therapy; the panel rated certainty as very low and emphasized cost, infusion-related reactions, and delayed hypogammaglobulinemia risks, so if a patient prioritizes durable remission and accepts risks, combination therapy can be considered after shared decision-making [^116iafon] [^111WjZ1a] [^111pHQ8d].

> For children who need treatment beyond observation, I need to ensure I choose the least toxic, shortest-duration option. Short-course prednisone 2–4 mg/kg/day for 5–7 days is preferred over dexamethasone pulses, and I should avoid courses longer than 7 days; for non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding or diminished HRQoL, corticosteroids are favored over IVIG or anti-D given cost, infusion risks, and feasibility, while still reserving IVIG or anti-D for specific contexts or contraindications to steroids [^116FjgdF] [^112i42d8] [^112JwNFP] [^113XhQNn].

> Next, I should review second-line therapy selection for adults with ITP lasting 3 months or more who are steroid-dependent or unresponsive. ASH suggests a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) such as eltrombopag or romiplostim rather than rituximab, and suggests rituximab rather than splenectomy when choosing between those two, with splenectomy still an option but generally deferred for at least 12 months when possible. I need to check patient preferences for daily oral therapy versus weekly injections, cost and access, and the desire to avoid surgery or long-term medication, as these strongly shape the choice among TPO-RA, rituximab, and splenectomy [^116uRCBq] [^1166CpZe] [^114fgo7k] [^113nSxXt].

> Let me consider the evidence-to-decision details for TPO-RAs versus rituximab. The panel favored TPO-RAs for their predictable platelet increases and favorable safety profile, while acknowledging that durable off-treatment responses are less common and cost can be prohibitive; approximately one-third of patients can maintain platelets above 50 × 10⁹/L off therapy for 24 weeks, which I should discuss transparently during counseling. Rituximab offers a chance of durable remission but carries risks of hypogammaglobulinemia and infusion reactions, and responses may wane over time [^116uRCBq] [^116YAmms].

> For children requiring second-line therapy, I should confirm that TPO-RAs are preferred over rituximab or splenectomy, with rituximab considered before splenectomy given operative and long-term infection risks. I need to ensure vaccination updates and peri-splenectomy infection prophylaxis counseling if splenectomy is ever pursued, and I should revisit the possibility of spontaneous remission before committing to irreversible options [^11751gt9] [^115rpAVv] [^114o7PVs].

> I will now examine special scenarios. In life-threatening bleeding, I should act immediately with high-dose corticosteroids, IVIG 1 g/kg with potential repeat dosing, and transfuse platelets despite autoantibodies to temporize bleeding, while arranging urgent hematology input and ICU-level care as needed. I should not delay therapy while confirming the diagnosis if bleeding is ongoing. For refractory disease after failure or intolerance of standard options, fostamatinib is an approved third-line SYK inhibitor, and combination strategies such as TPO-RA plus rituximab or other immunosuppressants may be considered in expert centers, recognizing limited comparative evidence and the need to balance additive toxicities [^116qorcN] [^114dntzB] [^116iGLHN].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. I need to ensure frequent platelet counts early after initiation or changes in therapy, assess for corticosteroid adverse effects at each visit, and monitor for thrombosis with TPO-RAs, especially at higher platelet counts or in patients with vascular risk factors. I should confirm that patients on TPO-RAs have periodic liver function testing for eltrombopag and watch for cataracts, bone loss, and neuropsychiatric effects with prolonged steroids; shared decision-making should be revisited regularly as disease phase and patient preferences evolve [^116EAqos] [^113nSxXt].

> Finally, I need to ensure robust patient education and shared decision-making. I should explain that the goal is a safe platelet count to prevent bleeding, not necessarily normalization, and discuss the risks and benefits of each option, including financial toxicity, route of administration, and time to response. I should provide written action plans for bleeding, fever after rituximab or splenectomy, and when to seek urgent care, and I must document values and preferences using decision aids where appropriate, given the predominance of conditional recommendations in ITP guidelines [^116EAqos] [^112MtzJA].

A care plan for ITP should be **individualized** and **risk-based**, balancing bleeding risk, platelet count, and patient preferences [^113nSxXt]. For adults with newly diagnosed ITP, use **short-course corticosteroids** (≤ 6 weeks) [^113pekJ4] if platelets are < 30 × 10⁹/L or there is bleeding; observe if ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L without bleeding [^11459Ux2]. For children, **observe unless there is moderate bleeding or quality-of-life impact** [^116MmeKR]; use corticosteroids or IVIG if treatment is needed [^112JwNFP]. Second-line options include TPO-RAs, rituximab, or splenectomy [^115CFrjP], chosen via shared decision-making [^116uRCBq]. Monitor platelets regularly, assess bleeding, and adjust therapy to maintain a safe count (typically ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L) while minimizing treatment toxicity [^113Jvz93].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

- **Confirm isolated thrombocytopenia**: Platelet count < 100 × 10⁹/L without other cytopenias or systemic illness [^116s8z4q].

- **Exclude secondary causes**: HIV, hepatitis C, autoimmune disorders, medications, malignancy [^notfound].

- **Bone marrow examination**: Not routine unless atypical features or age > 60 years [^notfound].

- **Baseline assessment**: Document bleeding history, comorbidities, medications, and patient preferences [^notfound].

## Initial management (newly diagnosed ITP)

### Adults

| **Platelet count** | **Bleeding symptoms** | **Recommended management** |
|-|-|-|
| ≥ 30 × 10⁹/L | None or minor | Observation [^112JyWuG] |
| < 30 × 10⁹/L | None or minor | Short-course corticosteroids (≤ 6 weeks) [^113pekJ4] |
| Any | Moderate/severe or life-threatening | - Corticosteroids <br/> - IVIG <br/> - Anti-D (if Rh-positive) [^112zaWuA] |

---

### Children

- **Observation**: Preferred for no or minor bleeding, regardless of platelet count [^116MmeKR].

- **Corticosteroids or IVIG**: For moderate bleeding or quality-of-life impact [^112JwNFP].

- **Avoid prolonged steroids**: Limit to ≤ 7 days in children [^112i42d8].

---

## Second-line therapies (persistent/chronic ITP or steroid dependence)

- **Thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs)**: Eltrombopag or romiplostim; preferred for many adults and children [^116uRCBq].

- **Rituximab**: Alternative to TPO-RAs; consider for patients preferring time-limited therapy [^113nSxXt].

- **Splenectomy**: Reserved for refractory cases; delay ≥ 12 months if possible [^1163M3EX].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Platelet counts**: Frequent initially, then every 3–6 months once stable.

- **Bleeding assessment**: At each visit.

- **Treatment side effects**: Monitor for corticosteroid toxicity, thrombosis (TPO-RAs), infections (rituximab, splenectomy) [^11459Ux2].

- **Patient education**: Teach bleeding precautions, medication adherence, and when to seek care [^114o7PVs].

---

## Patient education and support

Patient education should cover **bleeding precautions** — avoiding contact sports, using soft toothbrushes, and promptly reporting bleeding — and emphasize **medication adherence** to prescribed regimens with awareness of side effects. Support groups and counseling should be offered to address quality-of-life and mental health concerns [^notfound].

---

## Special considerations

- **Pregnancy**: Avoid splenectomy; prefer IVIG or corticosteroids [^notfound].

- **COVID-19**: Vaccinate per guidelines; adjust therapy if infected [^notfound].

- **Refractory ITP**: Consider fostamatinib, combination therapies, or clinical trials [^114dntzB].

---

A comprehensive ITP care plan integrates **individualized treatment**, regular monitoring, and patient education to balance bleeding risk, platelet count, and quality of life.

### How I treat refractory immune thrombocytopenia [^116iGLHN]. Blood (2016). Low credibility.

This article summarizes our approach to the management of children and adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) who do not respond to, cannot tolerate, or are unwilling to undergo splenectomy. We begin with a critical reassessment of the diagnosis and a deliberate attempt to exclude nonautoimmune causes of thrombocytopenia and secondary ITP. For patients in whom the diagnosis is affirmed, we consider observation without treatment. Observation is appropriate for most asymptomatic patients with a platelet count of 20 to 30 × 10⁹/L or higher. We use a tiered approach to treat patients who require therapy to increase the platelet count. Tier 1 options (rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists, low-dose corticosteroids) have a relatively favorable therapeutic index. We exhaust all Tier 1 options before proceeding to Tier 2, which comprises a host of immunosuppressive agents with relatively lower response rates and/or greater toxicity. We often prescribe Tier 2 drugs not alone but in combination with a Tier 1 or a second Tier 2 drug with a different mechanism of action. We reserve Tier 3 strategies, which are of uncertain benefit and/or high toxicity with little supporting evidence, for the rare patient with serious bleeding who does not respond to Tier 1 and Tier 2 therapies.

### Management of patients with refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura [^113rBENh]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2006). Low credibility.

In immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), thrombocytopenia is a result of both increased platelet destruction and insufficient platelet production. In adults, the course is commonly chronic, but most patients never experience serious bleeding even with severe thrombocytopenia. In case series of consecutive adult patients identified at the time of diagnosis, the frequency of death from bleeding is low, < 1%. The goal of treatment is only to prevent bleeding, not to correct the platelet count to normal. All current treatments are designed to diminish the increased platelet destruction, either by immunosuppression or splenectomy. The frequency of death from complications of treatment is similar to the frequency of death from bleeding. Perhaps because of increasing recognition of both the infrequent occurrence of serious bleeding and the risks of immunosuppressive treatment and splenectomy, data from case series across the past 30 years suggest a trend toward less therapy and fewer splenectomies among patients with ITP. However treatment is necessary for patients with severe and symptomatic thrombocytopenia. Splenectomy remains the most effective treatment for ITP, with two-thirds of patients achieving durable complete remissions. Immunosuppressive agents, including rituximab and combinations of agents, may be less effective than splenectomy in achieving complete remissions and the remissions may also be less durable. New agents for patients with ITP are currently in development that enhance platelet production, rather than diminish platelet destruction. In preliminary reports, these agents have been effective in maintaining safe platelet counts in patients with chronic ITP that was refractory to splenectomy and other treatments.

### Current management of immune thrombocytopenia [^115pP14b]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2013). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune-mediated condition that results from antibody-mediated destruction of platelets and impaired megakaryocyte platelet production. ITP patients exhibit severe thrombocytopenia and are at risk for significant hemorrhage. Few randomized trials exist to guide management of patients with ITP. Ultimately, each patient requires an individualized treatment plan that takes into consideration the platelet count, bleeding symptoms, health-related quality of life, and medication side effects. This article provides an up-to-date review of management strategies drawing on links between the expanding amounts of clinical trial data and associated biology studies to enhance understanding of the disease heterogeneity with regard to the complex pathogenesis and response to treatment.

### Evidence-based management of immune thrombocytopenia: ASH guideline update [^114oNRqY]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

In 1996 and 2011, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) supported efforts to create guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). These guidelines used different approaches to arrive at recommendations for testing and treatment. Despite differences in methodology, in both cases there was a paucity of randomized trials to inform recommendations. As data on the diagnosis and management of ITP expands, the ASH Committee on Quality is dedicated to maintaining updated guidelines representing recent evidence and guideline methodology. Here, we will review the updated ASH guidelines on ITP with a focus on recommendations with new understanding and future research to close knowledge gaps.

ASH 2019 ITP — Recommendation 1a on initial management: In adults with newly diagnosed ITP and a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the panel "suggests corticosteroids rather than management with observation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯)". The evidence review "included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that had internal comparators", and due to scarcity also "included all single-arm prospective studies of ≥ 50 adults with newly diagnosed ITP" and, for observation, "retrospective studies of ≥ 50 adults". No direct comparative studies were found: "We found no studies that directly compared corticosteroids vs management with observation in adult patients with ITP with a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L", though "We found 5 RCTs… and 2 prospective studies" of corticosteroids. Reported outcomes included "Four studies reported data on response within 7 days; 6 studies reported on remission; 3 studies reported on major bleeding; 4 studies reported on mortality; 0 studies reported on overall HRQoL", and "There were no studies in ITP patients with platelet counts of < 30 × 10⁹/L who were managed with observation alone". Consequently, "The relative effects were not estimable from the data because of a lack of direct comparisons".

Conclusions

The 2019 ASH guidelines on the management of ITP continue to be relevant and important, including recommendations related to second-line therapy for adults. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to justify a revision of the entire guideline at this time. We also recognize, however, that the 2019 recommendations on second-line therapy for adults were the result of paired comparisons of splenectomy, rituximab, and the TPO-RAs, and were based on a heterogeneous patient population. This resulted in discordant recommendations. Therefore, we recommend that a focused revision on second-line therapy for adults be conducted. We appreciate that due to the absence of comparative randomized trials and the lack of reporting on prioritized patient–related outcomes, recommendations on second-line therapy will likely remain highly dependent on patient values and preferences even with additional clinical trials. Preference for agents may also change with the prioritization of different outcomes and clinical contexts, such as the desire to avoid immunosuppression in the era of COVID-19. The updated search conducted here also identified alternate methodological approaches that would allow comparisons across several treatment strategies. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) approach also outlines a methodology for multiple comparisons that applies the evidence to the decision framework. Use of these methods and refinement of the population of interest may clarify the existing recommendations. This would also provide the opportunity to be inclusive of avatrombopag and fostamatinib, discussed above, as well as novel agents currently in clinical trial development. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. This update will involve the selection of a guideline panel, determination of appropriate questions, conduct of relevant literature searches, application of GRADE methodology, and publication of final recommendations. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

ASH 2019 guidelines for ITP — recommendation question scope: Table 1 frames clinical questions across adult and pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), including thresholds for initiating therapy or hospital admission, choice and dosing of corticosteroids, and comparisons among rituximab, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), anti–D immunoglobulin, and splenectomy. Examples include adults with platelet count " < 30 × 10⁹/L" regarding "corticosteroids or observation", adults with platelet count " < 20 × 10⁹/L" regarding "outpatient or be admitted to the hospital", initial therapy comparing "prednisone (0.5–2 mg/kg/d)" vs "dexamethasone (40 mg/d × 4 d)", pediatric steroid duration "longer than 7 d vs 7 d or shorter", pediatric first-line use of "IVIG or anti–D immunoglobulin", and second-line adult considerations such as "splenectomy or… a TPO-RA" and "rituximab… for initial therapy".

Grading of recommendations — interpretation of strong versus conditional: The strength of a recommendation is expressed as either strong ("the guideline panel recommends… ") or conditional ("the guideline panel suggests… ") and has defined interpretations. For patients, strong means most individuals would want the recommended course of action and only a small proportion would not, whereas conditional means the majority would want the suggested course of action but many would not and decision aids may be useful. For clinicians, strong means most individuals should follow the recommended course of action, while conditional indicates different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and clinicians must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences.

Children with newly diagnosed ITP — corticosteroid duration and choice/dose for non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding or diminished health-related quality of life (HRQoL): The panel recommends against courses of corticosteroids longer than 7 days and in favor of courses 7 days or shorter (strong recommendation). For drug choice and dosing, the panel suggests prednisone (2–4 mg/kg per day; maximum, 120 mg per day; for 5–7 days) rather than dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg per day; maximum, 40 mg per day for 4 days) (conditional recommendation).

### Care planning… [^1117rfsE]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Although there is limited evidence for specific treatments of cognitive impairment in the post-ICU setting, patients should be screened for cognitive impairment and, when present, evaluated for underlying reversible causes, such as depression, nutritional deficiencies, and metabolic disorders. 20–22 Exercise, mental activity, and optimizing cardiovascular risk factors may be beneficial.
22. POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER Among patients treated in the ICU, 7% to greater than 20% experience PTSD 12 months after discharge. 5, 23 Patients should be screened for PTSD using a standardized tool, such as the Primary Care PTSD Screen. 5, 24, 25 Review of an ICU diary during the convalescence period has been shown to reduce the risk of PTSD.
26.

29 Family physicians should determine the indication, appropriateness, and duration for new medications prescribed at discharge. In one study, there were differences between medications prescribed at ICU discharge and medications documented in the outpatient setting in more than 40% of cases. 30 Older patients may be prescribed potentially inappropriate medications in the ICU, and these medications are often continued at discharge. 31 Medications for chronic conditions that were discontinued at discharge should be assessed and reinitiated only if appropriate. Care Planning Compared with the general population, patients treated in the ICU have increased rates of mortality up to 10 years after discharge. 1 During post-ICU follow-up, family physicians should address patients' health care goals and end-of-life wishes and identify proxy health care decision-makers.

Patient preferences regarding code status, artificial feeding, mechanical ventilation, and future ICU admission should be discussed. Tools such as the Serious Illness Conversation Guide can help facilitate these conversations. NURSING HOME CARE Advance directives should be reviewed before transferring nursing home residents with suspected COVID-19 to the hospital for higher levels of care. Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 should be discharged to a nursing home or group care facility only if personal protective equipment is available and the patient can be isolated from other residents. Care facilities should implement screening protocols for staff and enhanced infection control policies.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^112JwNFP]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Recommendation 18 — children with newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or diminished health-related quality of life (HRQoL): In children with newly diagnosed ITP who have non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or diminished HRQoL, the ASH guideline panel suggests corticosteroids rather than IVIG (conditional recommendation based on low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕⊕◯◯). This recommendation assumes that a short course of corticosteroids is being used for treatment and is reserved only for children with non-major mucosal bleeding. The panel did not prioritize any harms a priori and therefore the undesirable effects were determined to be unknown; IVIG is associated with a black box warning for associated thrombosis and renal failure, and IVIG has high costs compared with a short course of corticosteroids with administration often requiring inpatient admission.

### International Consensus Report on the investigation and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia [^116bvYQZ]. Blood (2010). Low credibility.

Previously published guidelines for the diagnosis and management of primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) require updating largely due to the introduction of new classes of therapeutic agents, and a greater understanding of the disease pathophysiology. However, treatment-related decisions still remain principally dependent on clinical expertise or patient preference rather than high-quality clinical trial evidence. This consensus document aims to report on new data and provide consensus-based recommendations relating to diagnosis and treatment of ITP in adults, in children, and during pregnancy. The inclusion of summary tables within this document, supported by information tables in the online appendices, is intended to aid in clinical decision making.

### Newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenic purpura in childhood: successful implementation of a limited intervention strategy in the setting of pediatric emergency care [^111QUFSc]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura is a bleeding disorder for which management remains mainly guided by platelet counts. Pediatric hematologists and emergency physicians collaborated to set up a limited intervention strategy, focusing on clinical bleeding severity irrespective of platelet counts, starting in the emergency room. We report how this strategy was safely applied for 106 consecutive children admitted for newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenic purpura.

### Initial management of immune thrombocytopenic purpura in adults: a randomized controlled trial comparing intermittent anti-D with routine care [^11343RaK]. American Journal of Hematology (2003). Low credibility.

We conducted a randomized clinical trial in adults with a new diagnosis of ITP and a platelet count < 30000/muL to test the hypothesis that initial intermittent treatment with anti-D may avoid or defer the need for splenectomy when compared to current routine care (glucocorticoid treatment, followed by splenectomy). Splenectomy was to be performed in the anti-D group if patients failed to respond to three consecutive anti-D treatments given within 10 days. The incidences of splenectomy were 14 of 37 (38%) in the routine care group and 14 of 33 (42%) in the anti-D group (absolute risk reduction = 4.6% in favor of the routine care group, 95% CI, -18.4 to 27.6%). However, splenectomy was performed prematurely, not according to the protocol, in 11 of 14 patients in the anti-D group. The median time to splenectomy was 36 days (range, 9–78) in the routine care group and 112 days (range, 19–558) in the anti-D group (P = 0.045 at 100 days after randomization, P = 0.840 at 1 year after randomization, using log-rank analysis). Patients in the anti-D group were treated with prednisone for fewer days (70 days) compared to the routine care group (112 days, P = 0.01). No major bleeding events occurred. In this study, initial treatment of patients with intermittent anti-D initially deferred splenectomy. Whether our aggressive regimen of anti-D could have prevented splenectomy if it had been adhered to in all patients remains uncertain. However, compliance with this anti-D regimen was not feasible for many patients and/or their physicians.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — 2018 European joint working group (JWG) guidance and second-line differences: The JWG recommended corticosteroids for adults with ITP who have no or mild bleeding (World Health Organization [WHO] 0-II) and platelet counts below 20 × 10⁹/L to 30 × 10⁹/L, with observation for patients with platelet count values above 20 × 10⁹/L to 30 × 10⁹/L; prolonged corticosteroid use is discouraged, and the JWG guidelines did not discuss the addition of rituximab to corticosteroid treatment in newly diagnosed adults. For second-line management, the JWG guidelines place a priority on thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) as second-line treatment with rituximab being considered a third-line agent reserved for patients who have failed a TPO-RA, and splenectomy is primarily reserved for patients with ITP for > 12 months' duration or major bleeding (WHO III, IV); the ASH guidelines herein also include a remark that splenectomy should be delayed until 12 months when possible. In children, the JWG advises that a low platelet count alone is not sufficient to start treatment in newly diagnosed ITP and that the majority with no or only mild bleeding do not require treatment; they acknowledge no standard treatment of chronic ITP with referral to a specialist center recommended, and suggest that splenectomy be avoided in children and reserved as a last option in those that are refractory.

American Society of Hematology guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia — research priorities emphasize that the panel was able to make a strong recommendation for approximately one-fifth (5/21) of the prioritized questions and recommend methodological directions for future evidence generation. The panel recommends that collaborative cohort studies (retrospective and prospective), registries, and other observational studies addressing these issues could contribute much to improve the current levels of evidence and are likely more feasible than RCTs. These studies should apply standard dosing regimens and definitions, consistently report on patient-reported outcomes including HRQoL and side effects, and report long-term follow-up data. The panel also recommends ongoing collaborative engagement of patients to best understand how to apply these guidelines within the context of shared decision-making. Lastly, the panel recognizes that many of the management options covered in these recommendations are unavailable in certain countries; therefore global cost-effective strategies should also be assessed.

### Immune thrombocytopenia – what are the new treatment options? [^116PWJFY]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a minor disease for many patients; however, the natural history is variable and unpredictable. Many patients who are in otherwise good health can be left untreated, especially if their platelet counts are close to 20 × 10⁹/l. The overall mortality rate for ITP is < 1%, and the morbidity and mortality associated with treatment can be worse than the disease.

Areas Covered

ITP is not purely due to platelet destruction and in a significant proportion platelet production is sub-optimal; the review will cover the newer developments with the thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPOrAs) of which two agents, romiplostim and eltrombopag, are now licensed and these will be placed in context to conventional treatment.

Expert Opinion

There is an increasing understanding of the natural history of ITP and an increasing evidence-based approach to the disease and its management. Treatment should be aimed at the patient with a bleeding risk and should minimise the risk of adverse effects while maximising the chances of response. Few, if any, treatments are curative and treatment strategies need to be designed in ITP that manage patients with what can be a life-long condition with periodic relapses.

### Second-line therapies in immune thrombocytopenia [^111eGF6X]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2016). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a rare, acquired autoimmune condition characterized by a low platelet count and an increased risk of bleeding. Although many children and adults with ITP will not need therapy beyond historic first-line treatments of observation, steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and anti-D globulin, others will have an indication for second-line treatment. Selecting a second-line therapy depends on the reason for treatment, which can vary from bleeding to implications for health-related quality of life (HRQoL) to likelihood of remission and patient preference with regard to adverse effects, route of administration, and cost. Published studies of these treatments are limited by lack of comparative trials, in addition to inconsistent outcome measures, definitions, and efficacy endpoints. This article provides an up-to-date comparison of the second-line treatments, highlighting important outcome measures including bleeding, HRQoL, fatigue, and platelet counts, which influence treatment selection in a shared decision-making model.

There is currently no consensus on how best to manage refractory immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). In part, this reflects the need for individualized treatment due to the wide spectrum of patients' requirements and responsiveness to therapies. The objective of this review is to provide a clinically useful guide to current management strategies. This article suggests investigations to identify factors that may exacerbate thrombocytopenia and underlie poor therapeutic responses, and highlights emerging therapies, including the thrombopoietic agents, which are anticipated to dramatically alter the natural history of "refractory" ITP. Morbidity, mortality and heath-related quality of life are also discussed.

### Immune thrombocytopenia [^113Jvz93]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by autoimmune-mediated platelet destruction and impairment of thrombopoiesis. ITP may occur in the absence of an evident predisposing etiology (primary ITP) or secondary to a growing list of associated conditions (secondary ITP), and must be differentiated from other causes of thrombocytopenia. This review focuses on primary ITP in adults. The traditional goal of therapy in this population is to achieve a hemostatic platelet count of 30 × 10⁹/L or above for most patients while minimizing treatment-related morbidity. This approach has been called into question by the recent advent of well-tolerated and effective agents for the management of ITP, including pulse-dose dexamethasone, rituximab, and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists. Recent studies suggest the potential for aggressive therapy at the time of diagnosis to alter the natural history of ITP and point to the importance of quality-of-life considerations in therapeutic decision making.

Background

Despite an increase in the number of therapies available to treat patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), there are minimal data from randomized trials to assist physicians with the management of patients.

Objective

These evidence-based guidelines of the American Society of Hematology (ASH) are intended to support patients, clinicians, and other health care professionals in their decisions about the management of ITP.

Methods

In 2015, ASH formed a multidisciplinary guideline panel that included 8 adult clinical experts, 5 pediatric clinical experts, 2 methodologists with expertise in ITP, and 2 patient representatives. The panel was balanced to minimize potential bias from conflicts of interest. The panel reviewed the ASH 2011 guideline recommendations and prioritized questions. The panel used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach, including evidence-to-decision frameworks, to appraise evidence (up to May 2017) and formulate recommendations.

Results

The panel agreed on 21 recommendations covering management of ITP in adults and children with newly diagnosed, persistent, and chronic disease refractory to first-line therapy who have non-life-threatening bleeding. Management approaches included: observation, corticosteroids, IV immunoglobulin, anti-D immunoglobulin, rituximab, splenectomy, and thrombopoietin receptor agonists.

Conclusions

There was a lack of evidence to support strong recommendations for various management approaches. In general, strategies that avoided medication side effects were favored. A large focus was placed on shared decision-making, especially with regard to second-line therapy. Future research should apply standard corticosteroid-dosing regimens, report patient-reported outcomes, and include cost-analysis evaluations.

### Coding and billing rules in 2016: out with the old, in with the new… [^111ySJty]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Advance care planning CPT established two new codes in 2015 to describe advance care planning services that are being paid by Medicare beginning in January 2016: 99497, "Advance care planning including the explanation and discussion of advance directives such as standard forms, by the physician or other qualified health professional; first 30 minutes, face-to-face with the patient, family member, and/or surrogate, ". +99498, "each additional 30 minutes. " You can use these codes to report the face-to-face service, regardless whether the visit includes completing the relevant legal forms. CPT describes an advance directive as "a document appointing an agent and/or recording the wishes of a patient pertaining to his/her medical treatment at a future time should he/she lack decisional capacity at that time.

" Some examples of these forms are a health care proxy, durable power of attorney for health care, living will, and medical orders for life-sustaining treatment. CMS offers the following example of how a physician might provide and bill for advance care planning: A physician sees a 68-year-old male with heart failure and diabetes who takes multiple medications. She provides evaluation and management of these two diseases, including adjusting medications as appropriate. In addition to discussing the patient's short-term treatment options, the physician learns of the patient's interest in discussing long-term treatment options and planning. The patient inquires about the possibility of a heart transplant if his congestive heart failure worsens. The physician and patient also discuss advance care planning for care and treatment if he suffers a health event that adversely affects his decision-making capacity.

In this example, the physician would report a standard E/M code and one or both of the advanced care planning codes, depending on the duration of the service. The physician would not count the time spent on the E/M portion of the visit toward the time used to code 99497 and 99498; per CPT, no active management of the problem or problems is undertaken during the time period for which these two codes are reported. Note that the advance care planning service described in the example above would not necessarily have to occur on the same day as an E/M service. Advance care planning can be billed as a stand-alone service.

### Health following recovery from immune thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: the patient's perspective [^114mrKiL]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, patients described that iTTP was a life-changing event and they often did not return to previous functioning but instead learned to function with life-changing residual impacts of the disease. Therefore, there is a necessity for a paradigm shift in the care of patients with iTTP from acute management to that of a multidisciplinary comprehensive care model. The best model of comprehensive care in rare blood disorders would include physicians, specialized nursing, physical therapy, social work, and pharmacy, to ensure full wrap-around care of the individual. The development of a tailored comprehensive care model for iTTP is essential to improve the care of these patients in remission. As a first step in that direction, it is important to begin to incorporate standardized assessments of these symptoms during remission using valid, reliable patient-reported outcome measures. Future prospective studies should focus on identifying if these residual symptoms are a result of surviving or treatments related to an iTTP diagnosis.

### Expert statement on the ICU management of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [^116CGTkW]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is fatal in 90% of patients if left untreated and must be diagnosed early to optimize patient outcomes. However, the very low incidence of TTP is an obstacle to the development of evidence-based clinical practice recommendations, and the very wide variability in survival rates across centers may be partly ascribable to differences in management strategies due to insufficient guidance. We therefore developed an expert statement to provide trustworthy guidance about the management of critically ill patients with TTP. As strong evidence was difficult to find in the literature, consensus building among experts could not be reported for most of the items. This expert statement is timely given the recent advances in the treatment of TTP, such as the use of rituximab and of the recently licensed drug caplacizumab, whose benefits will be maximized if the other components of the management strategy follow a standardized pattern. Finally, unanswered questions are identified as topics of future research on TTP.

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: challenges and best practices [^111QfxZL]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is characterized by a reduction in platelet count that may be associated with severe bleeding in some patients. 1 The disease may have a substantial impact on the patient's quality of life, resulting, at least in part, from significant treatment burden. Indeed, health‐related quality of life for patients with ITP may be worse than that of patients with many other chronic conditions, including hypertension and arthritis. 2

First‐line treatments for ITP include corticosteroids (prednisone, dexamethasone), intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), and anti‐D (Rh0) immunoglobulin. 3 These therapies are used as upfront treatment in newly diagnosed patients and also as rescue therapies in patients with established ITP, with the goal of rapidly elevating platelet counts and preventing or controlling bleeding events. 4 While corticosteroids and immunoglobulins produce an initial response in most patients (60%‐70% and 90%, respectively), the response is usually transient (< 6 months and 2–4 weeks, respectively) and the medications must be readministered if the patient's platelet count does not stabilize. 5 Repeated or prolonged administration of first‐line therapies is typically not suitable due to significant adverse effects (eg, osteoporosis, diabetes, cataracts, weight gain, infections) with corticosteroids and high cost, inconvenience of frequent infusions, and debilitating post‐infusion headache with immunoglobulins. 4, 6, 7

Spontaneous remissions in patients who have never received treatment are uncommon in adults with ITP (9%). In many patients, the disease becomes persistent (3–12 months duration) or chronic (> 12 months duration), and second‐line treatment may be needed. 3, 8, 9

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) second-line therapy — choice between a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA) and rituximab in adults with ITP lasting ≥ 3 months who are corticosteroid-dependent or have no response to corticosteroids: the ASH guideline panel suggests a TPO-RA rather than rituximab (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯). Remarks state that treatment choice should be individualized, that patient education and shared decision-making are encouraged, that splenectomy should be delayed for at least 1 year after diagnosis when possible, and that patient preferences may favor different options (avoiding long-term medication vs avoiding surgery; prioritizing durable response).

Rituximab plus corticosteroids — initial therapy in newly diagnosed adult immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) was examined in 3 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with moderate desirable effects showing higher durable response (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.34–2.16) and remission (RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.00–2.52), no difference in 1-month response, prevention of major bleeding or mortality, no data regarding HRQoL, and increased upfront drug cost ($31 266 for 4 weekly doses); the guideline panel determined that there is very-low-certainty evidence for use of corticosteroids alone rather than in combination with rituximab in newly diagnosed patients.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^113pekJ4]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) corticosteroid duration — adults: The guideline panel recommends against a prolonged course (> 6 weeks including treatment and taper) of prednisone and in favor of a short course (≤ 6 weeks) as initial treatment, issuing a strong recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence. Evidence review found no usable comparative ITP data because no studies had data on short courses of prednisone. Based on clinical experience, the panel agreed there was likely trivial benefit in continuing corticosteroids beyond 6 weeks; for the majority of patients, a visit 6 weeks after starting corticosteroids should determine remission versus need for additional therapy, and for patients who require additional therapy, consideration of alternative therapy is preferred over ongoing exposure to corticosteroids. The panel also agreed the risk of harm was large with courses > 6 weeks and acknowledged that 6 weeks is not evidence based but represents a reasonable duration to permit a standard maximum 21 days of treatment plus taper.

### Insights on treatment of adult ITP: algorithm for management and role of multimodal therapy [^114dntzB]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

The management of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is continuously evolving with the development and introduction of newer therapies and a better understanding of the disease. Corticosteroids still represent the cornerstone of first-line treatment. Patients who fail to achieve remission with a short course of corticosteroids require subsequent therapy. Most guidelines recommend starting with either a thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RA), rituximab, or fostamatinib since these agents have been investigated in randomized trials and have well-characterized efficacy and safety profiles. Patients' involvement to reach a shared decision regarding choice of therapy is essential as these treatments have different modes of administration and mechanisms of action. Less than 10% will fail to respond to and/or be intolerant of multiple second-line therapeutic options and thus be considered to have refractory ITP and require a third-line therapeutic option. Such patients may require drugs with different targets or a combination of drugs with different mechanisms of action. Combining a TPO-RA and an immunomodulatory agent may be an appropriate approach at this stage. Many studies have been conducted during the last 2 decades investigating the efficacy and safety of combinations strategies for first and later lines of therapies. Yet none of these are recommended by current guidelines or have gained wide acceptance and consensus.

### Immune thrombocytopenia guidelines get an annual checkup [^113Wo5F1]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Blood Advances, Neunert et alreport on their systematic review of the literature performed to determine the need to revise or update the 2019 American Society of Hematology guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). In this field with multiple novel therapies on the horizon and many new publications reporting on potential important mechanisms of disease and targets for therapy, the group looked to reassess the validity of the provided guidance. The findings indicate that although new evidence has emerged, it is insufficient to dramatically change the current guidelines or justify a full guideline revision. This article discusses the results of the literature review and the recommendations for changes to the guideline, especially suggesting clarification of second-line therapies in adults with ITP and updates to several other recommendations.

One of the major criticisms of the 2019 guidelines has been that clinicians are rarely in the position of deciding only between 2 treatments that is thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist (RA) or splenectomy/rituximab or TPO RA, but the available methodology at the time did not have viable way to compare more treatment options. Since then, new methodologies have been developed, and a focused update to allow for updated guidance is proposed in this review, based on the available literature. Most of the other updates, based on a total of 54 studies, are not going to change the take home points of the original 2019 guidelines.

### The 2022 review of the 2019 American Society of Hematology guidelines on immune thrombocytopenia [^1119essR]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. We describe here the results of a review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision. An updated Medline and Embase search applied the same search terms as in the 2019 ASH guidelines, limited to systematic reviews and clinical trials, from May 2017 to July 2022. There were 193 studies identified, 102 underwent abstract reviews, and 54 full reviews. Each study was assessed based on relevance to the previous recommendation with regard to the population, prioritized outcomes, new outcomes, and study design. Reviewers assessed if the data would change the strength or the directionality of the existing recommendation or merit development of a new recommendation. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — inpatient versus outpatient management with platelet count < 20 × 10^9/L: In adults with newly diagnosed ITP and a platelet count of < 20 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel suggests admission to the hospital rather than management as an outpatient (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯). In adults with an established diagnosis of ITP and a platelet count of < 20 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the ASH guideline panel suggests outpatient management rather than hospital admission (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯). Remarks specify that patients with social concerns, uncertainty about the diagnosis, significant comorbidities with risk of bleeding, and more significant mucosal bleeding may benefit from admission to the hospital; patients not admitted to the hospital should receive education and expedited follow-up with a hematologist, and the need for admission is also highly variable across the range of platelet counts represented (0 to 20 × 10^9/L).

### Diagnosis and classification of immune-mediated thrombocytopenia [^115DBSVH]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia, or ITP, has been recognized as a clinical entity for centuries, and the importance of humoral mechanisms in the pathophysiology of ITP has been recognized for decades. Despite the long history of the syndrome, progress in understanding its epidemiology and management has been hindered by inconsistencies in nomenclature and classification schema together with the inherent heterogeneity in characteristics of global populations and ITP-associated disorders. In the past decade, great strides have been made in devising a common language for caregivers and investigators alike through standardization definitions and outcome measures, while new tools have become available for management of its clinical manifestations. In 2009, an International Working Group presented proposed standards for definitions, classification criteria, and outcome measures. The American Society of Hematology adopted these standards in 2011, including them in that body's guideline for immune thrombocytopenia. Despite the progress made so far, 20th century interventions such as corticosteroids and IVIg remain the mainstay of therapy. However, advances in treatment have led to the introduction of targeted therapies for select patients with chronic disease. In this paper, we review aspects of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of ITP and discuss the recent changes in guidelines for nomenclature, diagnosis, and treatment.

### Splenectomy for immune thrombocytopenic purpura: surgery for the 21st century [^111oY26v]. American Journal of Hematology (2008). Low credibility.

Although immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is the most common autoimmune hematological disorder, there is still controversy regarding the optimal management of this condition. Medical therapy may cure a proportion of patients with ITP but there are still a significant number of these individuals who are at risk for bleeding events. Surgery has become the least popular therapeutic option for ITP as other medical therapies have become available that attempt to avoid splenectomy and its morbidity. However, the clinical response to these therapies has not been overwhelming based on the fairly small number of trials conducted to date. With current minimally invasive surgical techniques, splenectomy should be again regarded as a viable therapeutic option in patients with ITP. The laparoscopic approach avoids much of the morbidity and complications seen with the conventional open surgical approach and studies have demonstrated similar, if not better, outcomes. In addition, the risk of infection following splenectomy is not as high as may be suspected, particularly with current vaccination regiments. It should be a priority for both the hematology and medical community to advocate for clinical trials to rationally study alternatives to splenectomy. In the interim, laparoscopic splenectomy should be considered as an additional front line therapeutic option in ITP patients.

### State of the art-how I manage immune thrombocytopenia [^116pGhdm]. British Journal of Haematology (2017). Low credibility.

The management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is rapidly evolving. Over the last 15 years, a number of novel treatments have improved practice, with many steroid-sparing agents and a reduction in the progression to splenectomy. Although this has improved clinical care, many therapeutic challenges remain. There is no diagnostic test, no biomarkers to direct treatment and few comparative studies to help management decisions. Development of up to date guidelines is difficult with little high-grade evidence. First line treatment continues to be steroids and intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) although both are often poorly tolerated and not curative. Common second line treatments include rituximab, immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, and the thrombopoietin receptor agonists romiplostim and eltrombopag. There are no comparative studies to decide between these agents and treatment is generally individualized, depending on comorbidity. Use of splenectomy has declined and is generally reserved for patients with chronic disease, although the exact position of splenectomy is subject to debate. Further understanding of the cause of disease in individual patients may help guide treatment. Randomized controlled studies of common treatments and novel treatments for refractory patients are urgently needed.

### The American Society of Hematology 2011 evidence-based practice guideline for immune thrombocytopenia [^114ffMQp]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is commonly encountered in clinical practice. In 1996 the American Society of Hematology published a landmark guidance paper designed to assist clinicians in the management of this disorder. Since 1996 there have been numerous advances in the management of both adult and pediatric ITP. These changes mandated an update in the guidelines. This guideline uses a rigorous, evidence-based approach to the location, interpretation, and presentation of the available evidence. We have endeavored to identify, abstract, and present all available methodologically rigorous data informing the treatment of ITP. We provide evidence-based treatment recommendations using the GRADE system in those areas in which such evidence exists. We do not provide evidence in those areas in which evidence is lacking, or is of lower quality — interested readers are referred to a number of recent, consensus-based recommendations for expert opinion in these clinical areas. Our review identified the need for additional studies in many key areas of the therapy of ITP such as comparative studies of "front-line" therapy for ITP, the management of serious bleeding in patients with ITP, and studies that will provide guidance about which therapy should be used as salvage therapy for patients after failure of a first-line intervention.

### Utilization of an ITP quality improvement pathway improves adherence to management guidelines [^113zg6WR]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Despite availability of epidemiologic studies and national guidelines for the management of newly diagnosed pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), practice variation exists among and within hematology practices. We previously described the development of an ITP pathway guiding management based on bleeding symptoms. Over an 8-year period, integration of this iterative ITP pathway into management of newly diagnosed ITP increased observation rates in children with no or mild bleeding symptoms and improved consistency of laboratory evaluation and treatment strategies without increasing adverse outcomes. This quality improvement initiative has been sustainable, acceptable to providers, and increased adherence to guidelines.

ASH 2019 immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — interpretation of strong vs conditional recommendations is summarized across stakeholders as follows: For patients, "Most individuals in this situation would want the recommended course of action, and only a small proportion would not", whereas under conditional recommendations "The majority of individuals in this situation would want the suggested course of action, but many would not; decision aids may be useful in helping patients to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For clinicians, strong recommendations state "Most individuals should follow the recommended course of action; formal decision aids are not likely to be needed to help individual patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences", while conditional recommendations advise "Recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and that you must help each patient arrive at a management decision consistent with the patient's values and preferences; decision aids may be useful in helping individuals to make decisions consistent with their individual risks, values, and preferences". For policy-makers, strong recommendations indicate "The recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations; adherence to this recommendation according to the guideline could be used as a quality criterion or performance indicator", whereas conditional recommendations note "Policy-making will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders; performance measures should assess whether decision-making is appropriate". For researchers, strong recommendations are "supported by credible research or other convincing judgments that make additional research unlikely to alter the recommendation", and conditional recommendations state "The recommendation is likely to be strengthened (for future updates or adaptation) by additional research; an evaluation of the conditions and criteria (and the related judgments, research evidence, and additional considerations) that determined the conditional (rather than the strong) recommendation will help identify possible research gaps".

### Transitioning patients with immune thrombocytopenia to second-line therapy: challenges and best practices [^111TE1pw]. American Journal of Hematology (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with ITP experience a high burden of disease, and it is important to offer management options that will improve quality of life. When possible, treatment options that are compatible with the personal preferences and lifestyle of the patient should be offered. Oral treatments taken once a day may be preferred by some patients, but others may favor injections that are administered less frequently. For patients who want to minimize their medication and monitoring needs, splenectomy may be the most desirable option.

An in‐depth understanding of second‐line treatment options will help optimize management of ITP and patient outcomes by ensuring the best use of available therapeutic options.

### Clinical updates in adult immune thrombocytopenia [^1172mBD5]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs in 2 to 4/100000 adults and results in variable bleeding symptoms and thrombocytopenia. In the last decade, changes in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder have led to the publication of new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ITP and standards for terminology. Current evidence supports alternatives to splenectomy for second-line management of patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding. Long-term follow-up data suggest both efficacy and safety, in particular, for the thrombopoietin receptor agonists and the occurrence of late remissions. Follow-up of patients who have undergone splenectomy for ITP reveals significant potential risks that should be discussed with patients and may influence clinician and patient choice of second-line therapy. Novel therapeutics are in development to address ongoing treatment gaps.

### Traditional and new approaches to the management of immune thrombocytopenia: issues of when and who to treat [^111cexsD]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnosis and management of chronic ITP requires experience and the appropriate use of the laboratory despite the absence of a diagnostic test for ITP. Consideration of secondary ITP is important because identification of immunodeficiency infections or of lymphoproliferative disorders would change the management approach to a given patient. The development of newer therapies such as rituximab and the thrombopoietic agents has had a major impact on the management of ITP. In the future, combinations of agents may be a critical approach although the schedule and dosing remains difficult to establish. Finally, current studies to augment therapy in newly diagnosed ITP patients to prevent chronic disease may lessen the number of patients in chronic disease category.

### A review of the management of childhood immune thrombocytopenia: how can we provide an evidence-based approach? [^111fZnqi]. British Journal of Haematology (2014). Low credibility.

Most children with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) have transiently low platelet counts and do not suffer from bleeding. Treatments with steroids, immunosuppression or splenectomy are not thought to be curative and may create more problems than the low platelet count. Consequently, many children do not receive treatment unless there is bleeding. However, although registry data looks promising, this approach outcome is not consistent between countries, or even between centres in the same country, leading to confusion for both physicians and families. Reaching a consensus for the management of paediatric ITP is further complicated by the lack of a diagnostic test and by the heterogeneity of the disease; for example, although most children remain relatively asymptomatic and go into an early remission, some patients have significant bleeding and others do not go into spontaneous remission. This review assesses the available evidence to guide physicians and families on making management decisions, showing the wide range of treatment choices, and the different approaches between countries and considers methods by which further information could be acquired to provide a more stratified approach to management.

### How to manage ITP with life-threatening bleeding [^116qorcN]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

While immune thrombocytopenia often presents with mild bleeding manifestations or surprising findings of thrombocytopenia on routine complete blood counts in patients without symptoms, some patients can present with new thrombocytopenia and life-threatening bleeding. Emergent assessment and treatment are needed to prevent substantial morbidity and even mortality. These patients present to the emergency room with bleeding, and hematologists are subsequently consulted. Understanding the approach to making the diagnosis and excluding other life-threatening illnesses is essential, as is rapid initiation of treatment in the bleeding patient even when the diagnosis of immune- mediated thrombocytopenia is tentative. Using a case-based format, we review how to approach and treat patients presenting with new thrombocytopenia and bleeding.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) second-line selection — evidence-to-decision considerations and conditional recommendations — states that TPO-RAs are more expensive than splenectomy or rituximab, equity and feasibility may be reduced with TPO-RAs and rituximab due to availability and coverage limits, and administration differs between romiplostim and eltrombopag. The panel acknowledged that there is no single second-line treatment that is optimal and that treatment should be individualized. For patients with ITP of < 12 months' duration, it may be preferable to delay splenectomy when possible, and when choosing between TPO-RAs and rituximab the panel made a conditional recommendation in favor of TPO-RAs; rituximab might be preferable for those prioritizing avoidance of long-term treatment or who cannot afford TPO-RAs. For adults who have had ITP for > 12 months, splenectomy, TPO-RAs, and rituximab were considered viable options, and the panel made a conditional recommendation in favor of rituximab over splenectomy because of the operative risks and irreversible nature of splenectomy with attendant long-term risks.

### When is the use of intravenous immunoglobulin appropriate in immune thrombocytopenia? [^116s8z4q]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an auto‐immune disorder characterized by an isolated thrombocytopenia (platelets < 100 × 10⁹/L) in the absence of other aetiologies. The main issue at the heart of ITP patient management is an increased bleeding risk, which guides treatment indications. Corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) are the cornerstone of first‐line treatment in ITP. There is a consensus in international guidelines that IVIg should be reserved for the most severe forms and in preparation for surgery in patients resistant to corticosteroids. It has been shown that in emergency situations with a platelet count < 20 × 10⁹/L, response to IVIg is faster, more important and more frequent than that obtained with corticosteroids. However, even if all guidelines clearly place IVIg as the reference treatment in severe ITP, there are no clear recommendations as to its indications and the assessment of bleeding severity is most often left to the discretion of the physician, with no consensual bleeding score. A widely accepted and validated bleeding measurement tool specific to adult ITP is lacking, with the literature identifying at least 12 different definitions of 'severe bleeding'. Hence, the classification of bleeding severity in patients with ITP remains unstandardized and is a challenge.

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: can we change outcomes? [^115cE4iR]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, prevention of bleeding, and inducing remission. Current standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable. This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

2 SECOND‐LINE TREATMENT OPTIONS

Second‐line or maintenance therapy in persistent or chronic ITP (hereafter referred to as ITP) aims to establish a durable platelet response and to minimize bleeding events with a treatment that is safe, tolerable, and convenient for long‐term management. Splenectomy, thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO‐RAs), and rituximab are the standard second‐line treatment options in current use. 3, 4 Before initiation of a second‐line therapy, it is advisable to confirm the diagnosis of primary ITP by excluding potential non‐immune causes of thrombocytopenia as well as causes of secondary ITP if these have not been previously ruled out.

Children with newly diagnosed ITP — non–life-threatening mucosal bleeding and/or diminished HRQoL: The panel suggests corticosteroids rather than anti-D immunoglobulin (conditional recommendation), suggests either anti-D immunoglobulin or IVIG (conditional recommendation), and suggests corticosteroids rather than IVIG (conditional recommendation). Remarks specify that these recommendations assume corticosteroid dosing as outlined in recommendations 14 and 15, are reserved only for children with nonminor mucosal bleeding, and for the latter recommendation assume that short course corticosteroids is being used for treatment as recommended in recommendation 14.

Abstract

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. We describe here the results of a review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision. An updated Medline and Embase search applied the same search terms as in the 2019 ASH guidelines, limited to systematic reviews and clinical trials, from May 2017 to July 2022. There were 193 studies identified, 102 underwent abstract reviews, and 54 full reviews. Each study was assessed based on relevance to the previous recommendation with regard to the population, prioritized outcomes, new outcomes, and study design. Reviewers assessed if the data would change the strength or the directionality of the existing recommendation or merit development of a new recommendation. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.
