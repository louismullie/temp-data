## Question

When to check renal function after starting acei

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to monitor renal function after starting an ACE inhibitor, with risk stratification, timing, interpretation of creatinine and potassium changes, perioperative considerations, and action thresholds. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the baseline assessment before initiation. Then, I should set the timing for the first and subsequent monitoring visits based on patient risk. Next, I will interpret allowable creatinine changes versus signals that warrant dose adjustment or discontinuation. After that, I need to outline potassium monitoring and management. I will then address perioperative handling and sick-day rules. Finally, I should integrate continuation strategies in advanced CKD, documentation, and patient education with references to KDIGO and ADA guidance.

> Let me first confirm the baseline assessment elements before initiating an ACE inhibitor. I need to check a serum creatinine, calculate eGFR using a validated equation such as CKD-EPI, and measure serum potassium; I should document blood pressure, volume status, and concomitant nephrotoxic or potassium-raising drugs, as these will influence both monitoring frequency and risk of hyperkalemia or AKI after initiation [^117BPkL1] [^113jWG18] [^112n2bJP].

> Next, I should review the timing for the first post-initiation laboratory check. For standard-risk patients, I will recheck blood pressure, creatinine/eGFR, and potassium within 2–4 weeks of starting or increasing the ACE inhibitor dose, aligning with KDIGO 2024 recommendations; for high-risk patients (CKD, diabetes, heart failure, elderly, high-dose diuretic use), I should shorten the interval to 1–2 weeks based on diabetes guidance and clinical risk, then repeat after each dose change in the same time windows [^117QJepm] [^1111qm9T] [^112jdk9x].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about creatinine rises; I need to interpret changes methodically. A modest, early "hemodynamic dip" in eGFR/creatinine is expected with ACE inhibition and can portend long-term renal benefit, but the key threshold is that if serum creatinine increases by more than 30% within 4 weeks of initiation or dose increase, I should evaluate and consider dose reduction or discontinuation; otherwise, continue and titrate to the maximally tolerated dose, monitoring closely for symptomatic hypotension or hyperkalemia [^113LV5s7] [^111jWzdo] [^114LBRqk] [^111jWzdo] [^115VhSvD].

> Wait, let me verify my recollection about ADA wording on "mild-to-moderate" creatinine increases; I initially thought ADA endorsed continuing therapy even when creatinine increases are ≥ 30%, but that cannot be right. I should double-check: KDIGO advises reconsidering therapy if the creatinine rise exceeds 30% within 4 weeks, so "mild-to-moderate" must refer to smaller, acceptable increases below that threshold; I will correct my earlier thought and align continuation with increases less than about 30% while investigating any larger rise promptly [^112jdk9x] [^116EehxT].

> Let me consider the evidence around the early eGFR "dip", because it helps me counsel patients and avoid premature cessation. Post hoc trial analyses show that an acute eGFR fall with losartan was associated with slower subsequent decline, and early eGFR decrements with enalapril did not worsen long-term slopes; mixed data from ONTARGET/TRANSCEND suggest that early GFR changes are common and only weakly predictive of outcomes, so I should balance this with clinical context rather than react reflexively to small early changes [^113ipBKS] [^116Ye5pr] [^111jeT4V].

> I should confirm potassium monitoring because hyperkalemia is a principal safety concern. I will measure potassium at baseline and at the 1–2 or 2–4 week follow-up depending on risk, repeating after dose escalations; if potassium is elevated and not controlled with measures such as adjusting concomitant potassium-raising drugs or diuretics, dietary interventions, and other potassium-lowering strategies, I should consider dose reduction or discontinuation of the ACE inhibitor consistent with KDIGO guidance and product labeling cautioning hyperkalemia risk with RAAS blockade, particularly in CKD and heart failure [^111jWzdo] [^113jWG18] [^112n2bJP].

> Let me think about titration strategy and continuation, because maximizing benefit depends on reaching an effective dose. I will titrate the ACE inhibitor toward the highest approved, tolerated dose with repeat checks of creatinine/eGFR, potassium, and blood pressure after each increment; in advanced CKD, I should generally continue ACE inhibition unless there is refractory hyperkalemia, symptomatic hypotension, or an excessive creatinine rise, noting that STOP-ACEi did not show benefit from stopping RAAS blockade in progressive advanced CKD, supporting cautious continuation with close monitoring [^115VhSvD] [^111jWzdo] [^117Cjtr6].

> Next, I should review perioperative considerations. Because continuation of ACEi/ARB perioperatively is associated with more intraoperative hypotension and slightly higher AKI risk, withholding before major non-cardiac surgery is reasonable; whichever strategy is chosen, I need to check creatinine and potassium within the first 48 hours postoperatively in patients at risk and recheck before restarting ACE inhibition if held, recognizing that some postoperative "functional" creatinine rises may not reflect structural injury [^116gwfGh] [^1148PT1T] [^112dK8BW].

> But wait, what if the patient develops an intercurrent illness? I need to ensure "sick-day" rules are in place for patients at risk (especially with diabetes and CKD), advising temporary holding of ACE inhibitors during acute volume depletion (vomiting, diarrhea, poor intake) with prompt assessment and follow-up labs, since AKI risk rises during such episodes and monitoring frequency should be individualized to the clinical course [^1111qm9T] [^114Z4qvR] [^114nqdGk].

> I will now examine what to do when creatinine rises more than 30% or potassium meaningfully increases. First, I should double-check for reversible contributors such as volume depletion, NSAIDs, dual RAAS blockade, recent diuretic intensification, or renovascular disease; correcting these and re-measuring often clarifies whether the signal is hemodynamic and reversible versus an indication to lower the dose or stop therapy, as severe renovascular disease can precipitate profound GFR drops on RAAS blockade [^111jWzdo] [^116fN4cF] [^112n2bJP].

> Hold on, I should verify that I am not underestimating risk in smaller creatinine rises. Observational data demonstrate a graded association between even 10–29% creatinine increases and adverse outcomes, so while guideline thresholds guide discontinuation decisions, any upward change should prompt closer follow-up and broader risk management rather than complacency, especially in the first year after initiation [^111mkq3i] [^114UVwm5].

> Next, I should review documentation and cadence of ongoing monitoring. After stability is established following the initial 1–2 or 2–4 week check, I will re-evaluate creatinine/eGFR, potassium, and blood pressure after any dose change and periodically thereafter according to CKD stage and clinical stability, individualizing the frequency in higher-risk scenarios or after new exposures that increase AKI risk, consistent with KDIGO principles for individualized monitoring and the initial post-initiation window [^117QJepm] [^114Z4qvR].

> Let me reconsider patient education and co-medications to reduce the risk of AKI and hyperkalemia. I should counsel patients to avoid NSAIDs, maintain adequate hydration, and review potassium supplements or potassium-sparing agents like spironolactone that may compound hyperkalemia risk with RAAS blockade, adjusting the regimen as needed and checking labs sooner if changes are made or symptoms arise [^112n2bJP] [^116LxTm8].

> Finally, I should confirm alignment with disease-specific indications and benefits so I do not underuse ACE inhibition. For CKD with albuminuria and for diabetes with albuminuria, initiating and up-titrating ACE inhibitors is guideline-recommended to slow kidney disease progression and reduce cardiovascular events; therefore, my monitoring strategy is designed to safely deliver those benefits while promptly managing adverse changes in creatinine and potassium rather than prematurely stopping effective therapy [^117HpBwC] [^112GvUmE] [^112jdk9x].

Check renal function (serum creatinine/eGFR and potassium) **within 2–4 weeks** after starting or increasing an ACE inhibitor, per KDIGO 2024 [^117QJepm]. For high-risk patients (CKD, diabetes, heart failure, elderly, or on diuretics/NSAIDs), check **within 1 week** [^113jWG18] and monitor more frequently [^1111qm9T] [^1148PT1T]. Continue ACEi unless **creatinine rises > 30%** or **potassium > 5.5 mmol/L**; if so, reassess, adjust dose, or stop therapy [^113LV5s7]. Routine monitoring is essential to detect early AKI [^114nqdGk] or hyperkalemia [^114LBRqk] and guide safe titration [^112n2bJP].

---

## Recommended timing for renal function monitoring

- **Initial monitoring**: KDIGO 2024 recommends checking serum creatinine, eGFR, and potassium within 2–4 weeks of starting or increasing an ACEi, tailored to baseline GFR and potassium [^117QJepm] [^111MKuJi].

- **High-risk patients**: For CKD, diabetes, heart failure, elderly, or those on diuretics/NSAIDs, check within 1 week [^1111qm9T] and monitor more frequently [^114LBRqk] [^1148PT1T].

- **Subsequent monitoring**: After the initial check, monitor every 3–6 months, or more often if CKD progresses or hyperkalemia develops.

---

## Clinical rationale for monitoring renal function

- **Acute kidney injury (AKI)**: ACEis can cause functional AKI, especially in CKD, heart failure, or volume depletion [^112dK8BW] [^114nqdGk].

- **Hyperkalemia**: ACEis can raise potassium, particularly in CKD or with potassium-sparing drugs [^114LBRqk] [^112n2bJP].

- **Long-term renal protection**: Early detection of AKI or hyperkalemia allows timely adjustment, preserving renal function and enabling continued ACEi benefit [^113diAfM] [^114jRQLg].

---

## Clinical thresholds for action

Serum creatinine increase **> 30% within 4 weeks** should prompt reassessment and consideration of dose reduction or discontinuation; otherwise, continue the ACEi [^113LV5s7] [^111jWzdo] [^1135A6Tu]. Hyperkalemia (** > 5.5 mmol/L**) warrants reducing or stopping the ACEi and treating the hyperkalemia.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing monitoring frequency

- **Baseline renal function**: Lower eGFR requires closer monitoring [^117QJepm].

- **Comorbidities**: CKD, diabetes, heart failure, and hypertension increase risk and warrant more frequent checks [^111chWTX].

- **Concurrent medications**: Diuretics, NSAIDs, and potassium-sparing agents increase risk of AKI or hyperkalemia, necessitating closer monitoring [^116LxTm8] [^112dK8BW].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Patient population** | **Initial monitoring** | **Subsequent monitoring** |
|-|-|-|
| General population | 2–4 weeks after initiation [^117QJepm] | Every 3–6 months |
| High-risk patients (CKD, diabetes, heart failure, elderly, diuretics/NSAIDs) | Within 1 week after initiation [^1111qm9T] | - More frequent <br/> - Individualized [^1148PT1T] |
| Creatinine increase > 30% or potassium > 5.5 mmol/L | Immediate reassessment [^113LV5s7] | Adjust dose or discontinue [^111jWzdo] |

---

Renal function should be checked **within 2–4 weeks** [^117QJepm] after starting or increasing an ACEi, with earlier and more frequent monitoring in high-risk patients [^1111qm9T]. This approach facilitates early detection of AKI [^114nqdGk] and hyperkalemia [^114LBRqk], enabling safe titration and continued ACEi benefit [^113diAfM].

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: The Stockholm Creatinine Measurements (SCREAM) project [^113jWG18]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

Angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE‐I) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have demonstrated efficacy in reducing blood pressure and proteinuria, slowing the progression of kidney disease, and improving outcomes for patients with heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and post‐myocardial infarction. However, these medications have also been associated with adverse events, including hyperkalemia. Although adverse events can occur at any level of kidney function, the risk is thought to be greatest in those with chronic kidney disease and congestive heart failure. Thus, concern for adverse effects may lead to underutilization in the subgroups of patients who are expected to derive the greatest benefit.

Clinical detection of hyperkalemia requires laboratory evaluation, and close laboratory monitoring is recommended during ACE‐inhibitor or ARB use. The 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline on chronic kidney disease evaluation and management recommends assessing glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and potassium within one week after initiating or increasing the dose of an ACE‐I or ARB, regardless of baseline potassium level. The 2004 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) suggests a more detailed algorithm: monitor laboratory values within the first four weeks after initiation or dose change for high‐risk patients (defined as having systolic blood pressure ≥ 4.5 mmol/L, or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min per 1.73 m²) and within four to twelve weeks for all others.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, particularly in patients with diabetes mellitus, the DC 2018 guidelines recommend assessing serum creatinine and potassium levels at baseline and within 1–2 weeks of initiation or titration of therapy. This assessment should also occur during times of acute illness for patients with diabetes on ACE inhibitors or direct renin inhibitors. It is advised to provide a "sick-day" medication list to adult patients with diabetes and CKD, outlining which medications should be held during times of acute illness.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for preserving residual kidney function in peritoneal dialysis patients [^112meSD2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEis) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are widely used in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, yet controversy exists about their impact on residual kidney function.

- **Objectives**: This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEis and ARBs for preserving residual kidney function in PD patients.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane Renal Group's specialised register, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE (OvidSP interface), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and other resources were searched by applying a prespecified comprehensive search strategy. Date of last search: 01 May 2014.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing ACEis or ARBs with placebo, other antihypertensive drugs, or each other in PD patients were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Screening, selection, data extraction, and quality assessments for each retrieved article were carried out by two authors using standardised forms. Authors were contacted when published data were incomplete. Statistical analyses were performed using the random effects model, and results expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Heterogeneity among studies was explored using the Cochran Q statistic and the I² test, subgroup analyses, and random effects meta-regression.

- **Main results**: Six open-label studies (257 patients) were identified. One study compared ACEi with other antihypertensive drugs, and three compared ARBs with other treatments.

### Evaluation of the stopping angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor compared to angiotensin receptor blocker (STOP ACEi trial) in advanced and progressive chronic kidney disease [^117Cjtr6]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

In the STOP-ACEi trial, the outcome was similar whether or not renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) were discontinued. We now investigate whether the effect of withdrawing angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) differed. In this open label trial, patients with estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) under 30 ml/min per 1.73 m² and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) were randomized to stop or continue RASi. The primary outcome was eGFR at three years. The composite of kidney failure, over 50% fall in eGFR, or kidney replacement therapy (KRT) was also assessed.

Of the patients randomized, 99 stopped and 123 continued ACEi, while 104 stopped and 77 continued ARB at baseline. At three years, the eGFR was similar whether or not patients were withdrawn from ACEi or from ARB. Kidney failure or initiation of KRT occurred in 65% of those stopping and 54% continuing ACEi (hazard ratio if stopped, 1.52; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.07 to 2.16) and in 60% on an ARB regardless of randomized group (hazard ratio if stopped, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.81).

Kidney failure/initiation of KRT with over 50% decline in eGFR occurred in 71% of those stopping and 59% continuing ACEi (relative risk if stopped, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.41) and in 65% stopping and 69% continuing ARB (relative risk if stopped, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.16). Thus, neither discontinuing ACEi nor ARB slowed the rate of decline in eGFR. Although discontinuation of ACEi appeared to have more unfavorable effects on kidney outcomes than stopping ARB, the trial was neither designed nor powered to definitively determine the superiority of continuing versus stopping these medications.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist therapy is associated with prolonged patient and graft survival after renal transplantation [^115PM2Ms]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) are known to reduce cardiovascular deaths in the general population, but data for renal transplant recipients remain elusive. Similarly, while ACEI/ARB have been shown to reduce proteinuria, data on graft survival are lacking. Therefore, a retrospective open cohort study was conducted involving 2031 patients who received their first renal allograft at the Medical University of Vienna between 1990 and 2003 and survived at least 3 months. Patient and graft survival were compared between patients with versus without ACEI and/or ARB therapy. Data were analyzed with and without propensity score models for ACEI/ARB therapy. Medication and comorbidities were analyzed as time-dependent variables in the Cox regression analyses.

- **Survival rates**: Ten-year survival rates were 74% in the ACEI/ARB group but only 53% in the no ACEI/ARB group (P < 0.001).
- **Mortality hazard ratio**: The hazard ratio (HR) of ACEI/ARB use for mortality was 0.57 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 to 0.81) compared with non-use.
- **Graft survival rate**: Ten-year actual graft survival rate was 59% in ACEI/ARB patients but only 41% in non-users (P = 0.002).
- **Graft failure hazard ratio**: The HR of actual graft failure for ACEI/ARB recipients was 0.55 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.70) compared with non-users. The HR of functional graft survival was 0.56 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.78).
- **Functional graft survival rates**: Ten-year unadjusted functional graft survival rates were 76% among ACEI/ARB patients and 71% in no ACEI/ARB recipients (P = 0.57).

In summary, the use of ACEI/ARB therapy was associated with longer patient and graft survival after renal transplantation. More frequent use of these medications may be beneficial in this patient population.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^112GvUmE]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

The KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend initiating a renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor, such as an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who have diabetes and exhibit moderately to severely increased albuminuria (stages G1-G4, A2-A3).

### Association of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use with outcomes after acute kidney injury [^114jRQLg]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at an increased long-term risk of death. Effective strategies that improve long-term outcomes in patients with AKI are unknown. This study evaluates whether the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) after hospital discharge is associated with better outcomes in patients with AKI.

This retrospective cohort study utilized data from the Alberta Kidney Disease Network population database. It included 46,253 adults, aged 18 years or older, who experienced an episode of AKI during hospitalization between July 1, 2008, and March 31, 2015, in Alberta, Canada. All participants who survived to hospital discharge were followed up for a minimum of two years.

- **Exposures**: Use of an ACEI or ARB within six months after hospital discharge.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was mortality; secondary outcomes included hospitalization for a renal cause, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and a composite outcome of ESRD or sustained doubling of serum creatinine concentration. An AKI was defined as a 50% increase between prehospital and peak in-hospital serum creatinine concentrations. Propensity scores were used to construct a matched-pairs cohort of patients who did and did not have a prescription for an ACEI or ARB within six months after hospital discharge.

- **Results**: The study evaluated 46,253 adults (mean [SD] age, 68.6 [16.4] years; 24,436 [52.8%] male). Within six months of discharge, 22,193 (48.0%) of the participants were prescribed an ACEI or ARB.

### The association of withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers on acute kidney injury after non-cardiac surgery [^116gwfGh]. Anaesthesia (2024). Low credibility.

Withholding or continuing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers peri-operatively in non-cardiac surgery remains controversial, as they may result in intra-operative hypotension and postoperative organ damage.

- **Methods**: We included patients prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers who underwent surgical procedures lasting more than one hour under general or spinal anaesthesia from January 2012 to June 2022 in a single center. We categorized patients based on whether these drugs were withheld for 24 hours before surgery. We evaluated the association of withholding these drugs before non-cardiac surgery with creatinine concentrations that increased by ≥ 26.4 μmol.l-1 in the first 48 postoperative hours (acute kidney injury). We also analyzed changes in creatinine concentrations and estimated glomerular filtration rates.

- **Results**: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin 2 receptor blockers were withheld in 24,285 of 32,933 (74%) patients and continued in 8,648 (26%) patients. We used propensity scores for drug discontinuation to match 8,631 patient pairs who either continued or stopped these drugs; acute kidney injury was recorded for 1,791 (21%) patients who continued these drugs versus 1,587 (18%) who did not, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.16 (95% CI, 1.08–1.25), p < 0.001. Intra-operative hypotension was recorded for 3,892 (45%) patients who continued the drugs compared to 3,373 (39%) patients who did not, with an OR of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.21–1.36), p < 0.001. Continuing drugs was independently associated with a mean increase in creatinine of 2.2 μmol.l-1.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^112jdk9x]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic nephropathy, specifically in relation to RAAS inhibitors such as ACEis/ARBs, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend initiating either an ACEi or an ARB. This is suggested for nonpregnant patients with diabetes and hypertension who have moderately increased albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio 30–299 mg/g creatinine) and/or an eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m². These medications should be administered at the maximally tolerated dose to prevent the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular events.

### Stopping renin-angiotensin system blockers after acute kidney injury and risk of adverse outcomes: Parallel population-based cohort studies in English and Swedish routine care [^1179HHvk]. BMC Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

A lack of information about measures of creatinine in the hospital meant that we could not grade the severity of AKI according to the KDIGO criteria; however, a sensitivity analysis excluding people who required dialysis during their baseline admission did not alter our results. We were also unable to ascertain whether the cause of AKI or misclassification of participants who actually had progressive chronic kidney disease influenced our results. We chose a priori not to adjust for creatinine or potassium levels after discharge in our analysis, as we thought this would be differentially missing for the sickest people who were readmitted before they could have outpatient blood tests, and blood test results may be on the causal pathway of the decision to restart ACEI/ARB. However, where available to clinicians, levels of kidney function and potassium are likely to influence practice in routine care.

In defining ACEI/ARB exposure, we did not have data for in-hospital treatment or discharge prescribing. We chose our 30-day post-discharge period to define exposure using primary care prescriptions partly because participants in England would have been likely to receive medication 'to take away' from the hospital. Therefore, people classified as 'continuers' in our analysis could experience a range of treatment patterns, such as continuing ACEI/ARB without a break and stopping the drugs for a period but receiving a prescription within 30 days post-AKI discharge. It is also possible that people did not take the medication as prescribed or that they were given specific instructions about whether to do so.

### Change of renal function after short-term use of cardioprotective agents in patients with type 2 diabetes is not accurately assessed by the change of estimated glomerular filtration rate: an observational study [^1166U5uR]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2022). Low credibility.

We focused exclusively on patients with T2D in the early stage of their disease, prior to macroalbuminuria or CKD stage 3 or higher, as it is important for clinicians and family doctors to detect early and reliably a change in renal function in daily clinical practice. Hence, the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the routinely used estimating equation CKD-EPI to detect short-term changes of renal function after pharmacological intervention with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin-receptor blocker, gliptin, or sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor.

### An acute fall in estimated glomerular filtration rate during treatment with losartan predicts a slower decrease in long-term renal function [^113ipBKS]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Intervention in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is associated with slowing the progressive loss of renal function. During the initiation of therapy, however, there may be an acute fall in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). We tested whether this initial fall in GFR reflects a renal hemodynamic effect and whether this might result in a slower decline in long-term renal function.

We performed a post hoc analysis of the Reduction of Endpoints in Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus with the Angiotensin II Antagonist Losartan (RENAAL) trial. Patients assigned to losartan had a significantly greater acute fall in estimated GFR (eGFR) during the first three months compared to patients assigned to placebo, but a significantly slower long-term mean decline of eGFR thereafter. A large interindividual difference, however, was noticed in the acute eGFR change.

When patients were divided into tertiles of initial fall in eGFR, the long-term eGFR slope calculated from baseline was significantly higher in patients with an initial fall compared to those with an initial rise. When eGFR decline was calculated from three months to the final visit, excluding the initial effect, patients with a large initial fall in eGFR had a significantly lower long-term eGFR slope compared to those with a moderate fall or rise. This relationship was independent of other risk markers or changes in risk markers for the progression of renal disease, such as blood pressure and albuminuria. Thus, the greater the acute fall in eGFR during losartan treatment, the slower the rate of long-term eGFR decline.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early (stage 1 to 3) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^112i7NXE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition resulting from kidney damage. Early recognition of CKD is increasing due to widespread laboratory estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, heightened clinical awareness, and the international adoption of the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) classification. Early recognition and management afford the opportunity not only to prepare for progressive kidney impairment and impending renal replacement therapy but also to intervene to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Although beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on renal outcomes and survival in people with varying severities of renal impairment have been reported, their effectiveness in people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain.

- **Objectives**: This review aimed to evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB, or both, in managing people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD without diabetes mellitus.

- **Search strategy**: In March 2010, we searched The Cochrane Library, including The Cochrane Renal Group's specialized register and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and EMBASE.

### Association of albuminuria levels with the prescription of renin-angiotensin system blockade [^11296y51]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

Multiple clinical guidelines recommend an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) in patients with elevated albuminuria, which can be measured through urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), protein-to-creatinine ratio, or dipstick. However, how albuminuria test results relate to the prescription of ACE inhibitor/ARB is uncertain. We identified individuals with an ACR measurement between January 1, 2004, and June 30, 2018, and no contraindications or allergy to ACE inhibitor/ARB.

We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses to evaluate the association between ACR level and prescription of ACE inhibitor/ARB within 6 months after the test. We applied similar methods to investigate the association of protein-to-creatinine ratio and dipstick measurement results with the prescription of ACE inhibitor/ARB. Among 67,237 individuals with an ACR measurement, 47.7% were already taking an ACE inhibitor or ARB at the time of the first ACR measurement.

Among the 35,138 individuals who were not on ACE inhibitor/ARB, those with higher ACR levels were more likely to be prescribed ACE inhibitor/ARB in the following 6 months, with steep increases in prescriptions until ACR 300 mg/g, after which the association plateaued. The majority (80.9%) of ACE inhibitor/ARB prescriptions were made by family medicine and internal medicine. A similar pattern held in the cohorts tested by protein-to-creatinine ratio and dipstick measurement.

Our study provides evidence that albuminuria test results change patient care, suggesting that adherence to albuminuria guidelines is critical.

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^1177Gtno]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). High credibility.

Following informed consent and completion of the baseline assessments, participants will be randomized into the trial in a 1:1 ratio to either continue with their ACEi and/or ARB treatment (control arm) or to discontinue their ACEi and/or ARB treatment (experimental arm). Randomization will be provided by a computer-generated program at the Clinical Trials Unit, using a minimization algorithm to ensure balance between the arms with regard to important clinical variables. The minimization variables will be diabetes (Type I diabetes, Type II diabetes, or non-diabetic), BP {mean arterial pressure [MAP] measured as [(2 × diastolic) + systolic]/3; < 100 or ≥ 100}, age (< 65 or ≥ 65 years), proteinuria (protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) < 100 or ≥ 100) and eGFR (< 15 or ≥ 15 mL/min).

- **Study treatment: Active treatment (experimental)**: All ACEi and/or ARB treatment will be discontinued. In order to compensate for the loss of antihypertensive activity, additional antihypertensive treatment will be commenced to keep BP within recommended guidelines. Any antihypertensive agents used in routine clinical practice are permitted to control BP throughout the trial, excluding ACEi or ARBs. The choice of antihypertensive will depend on other treatment being taken by the participant and will be at the discretion of the responsible clinician, except as a last resort.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: Cohort study [^1135A6Tu]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Patients' characteristics

Among 303,451 patients who started ACEI/ARB treatment during 1997–2014, 122,363 (40%) had both baseline and follow-up creatinine monitoring and were included in the study. Among these, 2078 (1.7%) had an increase in creatinine of 30% or more (median age 68 years) and 120,285 (98.3%) had an increase of less than 30% (median age 63 years). More detailed categorization showed that the creatinine increase was less than 10% for 102,445 (83.7%) patients, 10–19% for 14,301 (11.7%) patients, 20–29% for 3539 (2.9%) patients, 30–39% for 1099 (0.9%) patients, and 40% or more for 979 (0.8%) patients.

### Effect of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and other antihypertensive drugs on renal outcomes: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^113diAfM]. The Lancet (2005). Low credibility.

A consensus has emerged that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) have specific renoprotective effects. Guidelines specify that these are the drugs of choice for the treatment of hypertension in patients with renal disease. We sought to determine to what extent this consensus is supported by the available evidence.

- **Methods**: Electronic databases were searched up to January 2005 for randomized trials assessing antihypertensive drugs and progression of renal disease. Effects on primary discrete endpoints (doubling of creatinine and end-stage renal disease) and secondary continuous markers of renal outcomes (creatinine, albuminuria, and glomerular filtration rate) were calculated with random-effect models. The effects of ACE inhibitors or ARBs in placebo-controlled trials were compared with the effects seen in trials that used an active comparator drug.

- **Findings**: Comparisons of ACE inhibitors or ARBs with other antihypertensive drugs yielded a relative risk of 0.71 (95% CI 0.49–1.04) for doubling of creatinine and a small benefit on end-stage renal disease (relative risk 0.87, 0.75–0.99). Analyses of the results by study size showed a smaller benefit in large studies. In patients with diabetic nephropathy, no benefit was seen in comparative trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs on the doubling of creatinine (1.09, 0.55–2.15), end-stage renal disease (0.89, 0.74–1.07), glomerular filtration rate, or creatinine amounts. Placebo-controlled trials of ACE inhibitors or ARBs showed greater benefits than comparative trials.

### Effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on cardiovascular events and residual renal function in dialysis patients: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^113MdVQp]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular events (CVEs) are the leading causes of death among dialysis patients, with mortality rates 7 to 30 times higher than in the general population. Observational studies in dialysis patients at the time of writing have reported an association between the progressive loss of residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increased mortality; however, causality has not been established concerning dialysis patient survival and residual renal function (RRF). Treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) has provided significant cardiovascular protection and preserved RRF for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. Unfortunately, most trials excluded patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving maintenance dialysis. Thus, the beneficial effects of ACEIs/ARBs on CVEs and RRF in dialysis patients remain uncertain. Some large-scale trials tested the effects of ACEI/ARB therapy in dialysis patients and provided inconsistent results, leading to much uncertainty regarding the protective effects of this agent.

We, therefore, undertook a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of ACEIs and ARBs on cardiovascular events and the decline in residual renal function in patients receiving dialysis.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: Cohort study [^114UVwm5]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

We found that patients in routine clinical care who started treatment with ACEI/ARB and whose creatinine concentration had increased by 30% or more at their first follow-up monitoring visit were at increased risk for adverse cardiac outcomes and death compared with patients with more stable creatinine values. Our study thus confirms data from clinical trials in a real-world clinical setting. Moreover, we established that risks were also substantially increased for end-stage renal disease. In general, risks were highest in the first year after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment but were sustained up to 10 years later for end-stage renal disease, myocardial infarction, and death. Importantly, we showed a "dose-response" relation between the level of increase in creatinine values and risk of adverse outcomes, indicating that all increases below 30% cannot be viewed as safe. Our results were consistent across calendar periods and patient subgroups in a range of sensitivity analyses.

It is not clear whether increases in creatinine values after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment are due to pathophysiological processes representing a biomarker of increased risk or whether a direct causal relation exists between reduced renal function and adverse outcomes. These results therefore identify a group of patients at high risk but do not necessarily support discontinuation of ACEI/ARBs.

### The assessment of renal function in relation to the use of drugs in elderly in nursing homes; a cohort study [^112mL6GW]. BMC Geriatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are used for the treatment of congestive heart failure, hypertension, secondary prevention after myocardial infarction, and for slowing the progression of renal disease. Hyperkalemia does not usually occur in renocompetent patients but can be common in patients with renal impairment, diabetes, and those taking medications that interfere with renal potassium secretion. Therefore, potassium levels should be monitored carefully in patients at risk. There is no specific creatinine level that is an absolute contraindication to ACEI therapy. However, it is recommended to titrate the dosage slowly when initiating treatment, and the target dosage may have to be reduced. An initial increase of 20 percent in serum creatinine levels is common, but it is not an indication for discontinuing the medication. The same cautions apply when prescribing angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) as ACEI.

Digoxin is used as symptomatic treatment in subjects with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Morbidity associated with the use of digoxin is common due to its narrow therapeutic index. The toxicity of digoxin is dose-dependent and is often the result of alterations in renal function. In patients with renal impairment, digoxin therapy is associated with an increased risk of cardiac dysrhythmias. For this reason, it is recommended to reduce the dose in these patients, and the serum concentration must be monitored carefully.

There is not much research on the population of frail elderly in nursing homes, although these patients often have bo

### Comparative effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers on blood pressure and the kidney [^115FpGnT]. The American Journal of Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Many clinicians are uncomfortable about using angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers (AT(1)-blockers) to treat patients with renal disease because of concerns about increasing serum creatinine levels. However, the benefits of these medications, particularly their efficacy in slowing the progression of renal disease, outweigh such concerns. ACE inhibitors are effective in patients with type 1 diabetes and renal disease, as well as in those with nondiabetic renal disease and proteinuria > 0.5 g/d. AT(1)-blockers slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Although these classes of medications should not be used in patients with severe renal insufficiency (e.g. glomerular filtration rate < 20 mL/min), they may be beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency. Nonetheless, caution should be exercised in those with a glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min, and serum creatinine and potassium levels should be checked approximately 1 week after starting treatment. There is also evidence suggesting that these medications lead to greater reductions in blood pressure and proteinuria when used in combination than when alone. The purpose of this paper is to review the mechanisms of action of these two classes of medication, as well as the experimental and clinical evidence that they slow the progression of renal disease.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2025 [^116nxhEz]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetic nephropathy, particularly in relation to RAAS inhibitors and ACEis/ARBs, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend continuing renin-angiotensin system blockade for mild-to-moderate increases in serum creatinine (≥ 30%) in patients who show no signs of extracellular fluid volume depletion.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: cohort study [^115bTM7k]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Many post hoc analyses of clinical trials have examined the prognostic significance of a deterioration in renal function after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment. In clinical trials of patients with heart failure, deterioration in renal function after starting ACEI/ARB treatment is commonly found. Although this deterioration is associated with a poorer prognosis compared with patients with preserved renal function, the overall benefits of ACEI/ARB treatment compared with placebo remain for cardiovascular outcomes and mortality. Our study does not undermine that evidence but flags that the risk-benefit ratio may differ among patients with marked changes in creatinine concentrations. This is particularly the case for other prescribing indications for which the clinical trial evidence is less clear.

The recommendation in many international guidelines to stop ACEI/ARB treatment if creatinine rises by 30% or more after initiation is founded on a single review of 12 clinical trials of ACEI/ARB treatment for diabetes and heart failure. Studies included in this review evaluated the progression of renal disease among patients with pre-existing renal impairment. Of these studies, only six were double-blinded and included a total of 1,102 participants. These trials were published during 1993–97 and may not relate to patients receiving contemporary routine clinical care. The methods that define a cut-off level of creatinine increase at 30% for cessation are not clearly presented. In addition, the results provided by these studies are not supported by later trials.

### Jadenu [^1114qiQr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Evaluate renal glomerular and tubular function before initiating therapy or increasing the dose. Use prediction equations validated for use in adult and pediatric patients to estimate GFR. Obtain serum electrolytes and urinalysis in all patients to evaluate renal tubular function [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.2)].

Monitor all patients for changes in eGFR and for renal tubular toxicity weekly during the first month after initiation or modification of therapy and at least monthly thereafter. Dose reduction or interruption may be considered if abnormalities occur in levels of markers of renal tubular function and/or as clinically indicated. Monitor serum ferritin monthly to evaluate for overchelation. Use the minimum dose to establish and maintain a low iron burden. Monitor renal function more frequently in patients with preexisting renal disease or decreased renal function.

In pediatric patients, interrupt Jadenu during acute illnesses, which can cause volume depletion such as vomiting, diarrhea, or prolonged decreased oral intake, and monitor renal function more frequently. Promptly correct fluid deficits to prevent renal injury. Resume therapy as appropriate, based on assessments of renal function, when oral intake and volume status are normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: National guidance [^116fN4cF]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Changes in kidney function after initiation of drug treatment

A decline in renal function is commonly seen in patients when they start an ACEI, ARB, or sacubitril/valsartan and is usually modest. This decline is attributable to the loss of renal efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction and an acute decrease in intraglomerular pressure, with a subsequent fall in GFR. Renal function may actually improve; in the Cooperative North Scandinavian Enalapril Survival Study (CONSENSUS), although the average increase in creatinine was 44 µmol/L at 2 weeks, in nearly a quarter of patients, creatinine declined. RAAS inhibitors can decrease the rate at which renal function subsequently declines, despite an apparent initial worsening.

The deterioration in renal function may also indicate hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis or intrarenal vascular disease. For a small proportion of patients, particularly those with bilateral renovascular disease, initiation of ACEI/ARB can result in substantial and irreversible declines in renal function or life-threatening hyperkalemia. In those rare cases with a profound decline in GFR post-RAAS inhibitor, renal artery stenosis should be actively sought, with the decision on revascularization made on an individual patient basis.

Important questions are: (1) whether there is a level of decline in renal function related to ACEI/ARB initiation beyond which the risk of continuing treatment outweighs the benefits, and (2) whether the risk-benefit balance depends on the indication for treatment.

One of the pitfalls in caring for patients with heart failure is premature withdrawal of treatment due to concern over changes in renal function, potentially compromising cardiovascular outcomes.

### Acute change in glomerular filtration rate with inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system does not predict subsequent renal and cardiovascular outcomes [^111jeT4V]. Kidney International (2017). Low credibility.

Initiation of blockade of the renin-angiotensin system may cause an acute decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR); the prognostic significance of this is unknown. We performed a post hoc analysis of patients with, or at risk for, vascular disease in two randomized controlled trials: Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) and the Telmisartan Randomized AssessmeNt Study in ACE iNtolerant participants with cardiovascular Disease (TRANSCEND). The median follow-up was 56 months.

In 9,340 patients new to renin-angiotensin system blockade, who were then randomized to renin-angiotensin system blockade, a fall in GFR of 15% or more at 2 weeks after starting was seen in 1,480 participants (16%), with persistence at 8 weeks in 700 (7%). Both acute increases and decreases in GFR after initiation of renin-angiotensin system blockade were associated with tendencies, mostly not statistically significant, to increased risk of cardiovascular outcomes, which occurred in 1,280 participants, and of microalbuminuria, which occurred in 864. Analyses of creatinine-based outcomes suggested regression to the mean.

In more than 3,000 patients randomized in TRANSCEND to telmisartan or placebo, no interaction was observed between acute change in GFR and renal or cardiovascular benefit from telmisartan. Thus, both increases and decreases in GFR on initiation of renin-angiotensin system blockade are common and may be weakly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and renal outcomes.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers in myocardial infarction patients with renal dysfunction [^114U9nux]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on whether angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) should be used for secondary prevention in all or only in high-risk patients after an acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

- **Objectives**: This study sought to investigate whether ACEI/ARB treatment after AMI is associated with better outcomes across different risk profiles, including the entire spectrum of estimated glomerular filtration rates.

- **Methods**: This study evaluated discharge and continuous follow-up data on ACEI/ARB use among AMI survivors (2006 to 2009) included in a large Swedish registry. The association between ACEI/ARB treatment and outcomes (mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and acute kidney injury [AKI]) was studied using Cox proportional hazards models (intention-to-treat and as treated).

- **Results**: In total, 45,697 patients (71%) were treated with ACEI/ARB. The 3-year mortality was 19.8% (17.4% of ACEI/ARB users and 25.4% of nonusers). In adjusted analysis, significantly better survival was observed for patients treated with ACEI/ARB (3-year hazard ratio: 0.80; 95% confidence interval: 0.77 to 0.83). The survival benefit was consistent through all kidney function strata, including dialysis patients. Overall, those treated with ACEI/ARB also had a lower 3-year risk for myocardial infarction (hazard ratio: 0.91; 95% confidence interval: 0.87 to 0.95), whereas treatment had no significant effect on stroke risk. The crude risk for AKI was generally low (2.5% and 2.0% for treated and non-treated, respectively) and similar across estimated glomerular filtration rates.

### Trends in kidney function outcomes following RAAS inhibition in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^116Ye5pr]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are beneficial in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). We sought to describe longitudinal trends in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in HFrEF and how ACE-inhibitor therapy influences these changes.

- **Study design**: Post hoc analysis of trial data.

- **Settings & participants**: Symptomatic (Treatment Trial, n = 2,423) and asymptomatic (Prevention Trial, n = 4,094) patients from the Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction (SOLVD).

- **Exposure**: Enalapril versus placebo.

- **Outcomes**: Early and long-term eGFR slope (i.e. within and after the first 6 weeks) and 4 kidney endpoints: (1) serum creatinine level increase by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL, (2) > 30% eGFR decline, (3) > 40% eGFR decline, and (4) incident eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

- **Analytical approach**: Shared parameter models, multivariable Cox regression models.

Baseline mean eGFR was lower in the Treatment Trial than in the Prevention Trial, 69.5 ± 19.8 (SD) versus 76.2 ± 18.6 mL/min/1.73 m². Following randomization, an early eGFR decline occurred in the enalapril group; however, slopes during the median 3-year follow-up were not statistically different by randomization arm in either the Treatment Trial (-0.84 in enalapril vs. -1.36 mL/min/1.73 m² per year in placebo; P = 0.08) or Prevention Trial (-1.27 in enalapril vs. -1.36 mL/min/1.73 m² per year in placebo; P = 0.7). Random assignment to enalapril treatment increased the risk for all 4 outcomes in the Treatment Trial in the first 6-week period (HRs were 1.48 [95% CI, 1.10–1.99] for creatinine increase by ≥ 0.3 mg/dL).

### Efficacy of ACE-inhibitor therapy on renal disease in glycogen storage disease type 1: A multicentre retrospective study [^114FLKpP]. Clinical Endocrinology (2005). Low credibility.

The efficacy of ACE inhibitors in decreasing microalbuminuria and proteinuria has been reported in some patients with glycogen storage disease type 1 (GSD1); however, no case-control study has ever been published.

- **Aim**: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of ACE inhibitors in reducing glomerular hyperfiltration, microalbuminuria, and proteinuria, and in delaying the progression of renal damage.

- **Patients and methods**: Ninety-five patients (median age at the time of the study: 14.5 years) were enrolled from nine Italian referral centers for metabolic diseases. A retrospective study with a 10-year follow-up was conducted to compare the evolution of these parameters in patients treated with ACE inhibitors against those not treated.

- **Results**: A significant and progressive decrease in glomerular filtration rate was observed in patients treated with ACE inhibitors compared to those who were not (P < 0.05). No difference was observed for microalbuminuria and proteinuria between the two groups. Moreover, the ACE inhibitors significantly delayed the progression from glomerular hyperfiltration to microalbuminuria, but not from microalbuminuria to proteinuria.

- **Conclusions**: The results of the present study underline the importance of a strict follow-up of renal function in GSD1 patients. Detection of glomerular hyperfiltration suggests the early initiation of ACE inhibitor treatment to delay the progression of renal damage. A randomized prospective study is needed to establish the real effectiveness of this approach.

### Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in advanced chronic kidney disease: How low can the kidney function go [^112toQD1]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to present the available data on the risks and benefits of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) usage in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Recent findings indicate that ACEi/ARB use is well established as beneficial in patients with mild-to-moderate CKD, particularly in those with proteinuria. The majority of available data includes patients with diabetes mellitus. However, data pertaining to individuals with advanced CKD are limited, and there is conflicting information. Moreover, the definition of advanced CKD varies across clinical trials.

On the basis of our literature review, evidence suggests continuing ACEi/ARB therapy in patients with advanced CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate, eGFR, less than 15 ml/min/1.73 m²) unless hyperkalemia ensues and is unresponsive to therapy, hypotension develops, or there is an unusually rapid worsening of eGFR (not the usual progressive decline). These patients should be monitored closely. There is insufficient data to support the initiation of ACEi/ARB therapy de novo in patients with advanced CKD (eGFR less than 15 ml/min/1.73 m²). If renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade is initiated de novo in this subgroup, we recommend close monitoring.

### Controversies in acute kidney injury: Conclusions from a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^112gvZAp]. Kidney International (2020). Low credibility.

It remains unclear how to best determine baseline kidney function. What constitutes a baseline serum creatinine level is controversial and inconsistently defined. Ideally, prior serum creatinine or GFR measurements should be widely available through electronic medical records. However, this is not standard practice in many parts of the world. Prior measurements of serum creatinine or GFR may further elucidate the risk of AKI in patients considered at high risk due to either comorbidity or an intervention.

There is controversy about whether an acute decrease in serum creatinine level indicates AKI that has already occurred, and more research is needed in this area. For example, small declines in serum creatinine level should be interpreted with caution because they may result from acute changes in creatinine production or volume of distribution. After a timed insult, such as coronary angiography, elective surgery, or nephrotoxic drug exposure, serum creatinine levels should be measured at an appropriate time to allow AKI to manifest. After AKI onset, serum creatinine levels should be measured during follow-up as necessary for clinical management and care transitions (e.g. transfer to and from intensive care) and for determining changes in AKI staging and classification (AKI vs. AKD), including the onset of CKD at 90 days.

How urine output should be evaluated is also an area needing further investigation to avoid variability in reporting AKI incidence (i.e. use of actual or ideal body weight, strict time period vs. time-averaged values). Future guidelines should address these issues to improve diagnostic consistency and patient outcomes.

### Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers for adults with early (stage 1 to 3) non-diabetic chronic kidney disease [^116uCvV1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a long-term condition that occurs as a result of damage to the kidneys. Early recognition of CKD is becoming increasingly common due to widespread laboratory-estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reporting, increased clinical awareness, and international adoption of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classifications. Early recognition and management of CKD afford the opportunity to prepare for progressive kidney impairment, impending kidney replacement therapy, and interventions to reduce the risk of progression and cardiovascular disease.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are two classes of antihypertensive drugs that act on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Beneficial effects of ACEi and ARB on kidney outcomes and survival in people with a wide range of severity of kidney impairment have been reported; however, their effectiveness in the subgroup of people with early CKD (stage 1 to 3) is less certain. This is an update of a review that was last published in 2011.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the benefits and harms of ACEi and ARB or both in the management of people with early (stage 1 to 3) CKD who do not have diabetes mellitus (DM).

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies up to 6 July 2023 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and conference proceedings.

### Enalaprilat [^1165Jcif]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The usual dose of 1.25 mg of enalaprilat every six hours is recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance > 30 mL/min (serum creatinine of up to approximately 3 mg/dL). For patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min (serum creatinine ≥ 3 mg/dL), the initial dose is 0.625 mg (see WARNINGS). If, after one hour, there is an inadequate clinical response, the 0.625 mg dose may be repeated. Additional doses of 1.25 mg may be administered at six-hour intervals.

- **Patients at risk of excessive hypotension**: Hypertensive patients at risk of excessive hypotension include those with the following conditions or characteristics: heart failure, hyponatremia, high-dose diuretic therapy, recent intensive diuresis or increase in diuretic dose, renal dialysis, or severe volume and/or salt depletion of any etiology (see WARNINGS). Single doses of enalaprilat as low as 0.2 mg have produced excessive hypotension in normotensive patients with these diagnoses. Because of the potential for an extreme hypotensive response in these patients, therapy should be started under very close medical supervision. The starting dose should be no greater than the prescribed amount.

- **For conversion from intravenous to oral therapy**: The recommended initial dose of tablets VASOTEC (enalapril maleate) is 5 mg once a day for patients with creatinine clearance > 30 mL/min and 2.5 mg once daily for patients with creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min. Dosage should then be adjusted according to blood pressure response.

For information on dialysis patients, refer to the section on patients at risk of excessive hypotension.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^115YuZ9N]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of chronic kidney disease, specifically in the context of RAAS inhibitors such as ACEis/ARBs, the KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend initiating renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors (ACEi or ARB) in patients with CKD and moderately-to-severely increased albuminuria (G1-G4, A2-A3) who have diabetes.

### ACE inhibitors to prevent end-stage renal disease: When to start and why possibly never to stop: A post hoc analysis of the REIN trial results. Ramipril efficacy in nephropathy [^116anLuG]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

In this post hoc secondary analysis of the Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy (REIN) trial, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition risk/benefit profile was assessed in 322 patients with nondiabetic, proteinuric chronic nephropathies and different degrees of renal insufficiency. The rate of GFR decline (Delta GFR) and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during ramipril or non-ACE inhibitor treatment were compared within three tertiles of basal GFR. Delta GFR was comparable in the three tertiles, whereas the incidence of ESRD was higher in the lowest tertile than in the middle and highest tertiles.

Ramipril decreased Delta GFR by 22%, 22%, and 35%, and the incidence of ESRD by 33% (P < 0.05), 37%, and 100% (P < 0.01) in the lowest, middle, and highest tertiles, respectively. Delta GFR reduction was predicted by basal systolic (P < 0.0001), diastolic (P = 0.02), and mean (P < 0.001) BP and proteinuria (P < 0.0001) but not by basal GFR (P = 0.12). ESRD risk reduction was predicted by basal proteinuria (P < 0.01) and GFR (P < 0.0001) and was strongly dependent on treatment duration (P < 0.0001).

Adverse events were comparable among the three tertiles and within each tertile in the two treatment groups. Thus, disease progression and response to ACE inhibition do not depend on the severity of renal insufficiency. The risk of ESRD and the absolute number of events saved by ACE inhibition is highest in patients with the lowest GFR. However, renoprotection is maximized when ACE inhibition is started earlier and when long-lasting treatment may result in GFR stabilization.

### Atacand [^112n2bJP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

- **Impaired renal function**: Monitor renal function periodically in patients treated with Atacand. Changes in renal function, including acute renal failure, can be caused by drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. Patients whose renal function may depend, in part, on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system (e.g. patients with renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, severe heart failure, or volume depletion) may be at particular risk of developing oliguria, progressive azotemia, or acute renal failure when treated with Atacand. Consider withholding or discontinuing therapy in patients who develop a clinically significant decrease in renal function while on Atacand.

	- In the CHARM program (heart failure patients), the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g. creatinine increase) was 12.5% in patients treated with Atacand versus 6.3% in patients treated with placebo. The incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g. creatinine increase) leading to drug discontinuation in Atacand-treated patients was 6.3% compared with 2.9% in placebo-treated patients. In the CHARM-Added program, where candesartan or placebo was given in addition to ACE inhibitors, the incidence of abnormal renal function (e.g. creatinine increase) was 15% in patients treated with Atacand versus 9% in patients treated with placebo [see Drug Interactions (7.3)].

- **Hyperkalemia**: Drugs that inhibit the renin-angiotensin system can cause hyperkalemia. Concomitant use of Atacand with drugs that increase potassium levels may increase the risk of hyperkalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

### Add-on angiotensin receptor blocker in patients who have proteinuric chronic kidney diseases and are treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [^116KE6Ji]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

The benefit of the add-on angiotensin II receptor blocker candesartan to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the inhibition of progression of nephropathy in hypertensive patients with nondiabetic renal disease, compared with monotherapy with ACE inhibitors, remains controversial. All patients were previously treated with ACE inhibitors. Urinary protein excretion of patients exceeded 1.0 g/d despite treatment with ACE inhibitors.

Ninety hypertensive patients with chronic renal insufficiency were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received an ACE inhibitor plus candesartan (2 to 12 mg/d), and a control group received only an ACE inhibitor. The target blood pressure was ≤ 130/80 mmHg. The primary outcome was the change in serum creatinine and the reduction of proteinuria. The mean duration of follow-up was 3.1 ± 0.4 years. At years 2 and 3, systolic and diastolic blood pressure were reduced from 140 ± 3/84 ± 2 to 129 ± 1/78 ± 2 mmHg (candesartan group) and from 135 ± 2/85 ± 2 to 130 ± 2/80 ± 2 mmHg (ACE inhibitors group). In both groups, both systolic and diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly from the beginning to the end of the study (P < 0.01).

The serum creatinine concentration increased from 3.02 ± 0.27 to 3.38 ± 0.49 mg/dl (candesartan plus ACE inhibitor group) versus 3.00 ± 0.37 to 4.48 ± 0.57 mg/dl (ACE inhibitor group; P < 0.01) at year 3. Although the level of proteinuria significantly declined in each group (P < 0.05), the degree of reduction in proteinuria was greater in the candesartan group than in the ACE inhibitors group (P < 0.01).

### Adverse events after initiating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker therapy in individuals with heart failure and multimorbidity [^1119z5yG]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines recommend routine kidney function and serum potassium testing within 30 days of initiating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) therapy. However, evidence is lacking on whether routine follow-up testing reduces therapy-related adverse events in adults with heart failure and if multimorbidity influences the association between laboratory testing and these adverse events.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among adults with heart failure from four US integrated healthcare delivery systems. Multimorbidity was defined using counts of chronic conditions. Patients with outpatient serum creatinine and potassium tests in the 30 days after starting ACEI or ARB therapy were matched 1:1 to patients without follow-up tests. We evaluated the association of follow-up testing with 30-day all-cause mortality and hospitalization with acute kidney injury or hyperkalemia using Cox regression.

- **Results**: We identified 3629 matched adults with heart failure initiating ACEI or ARB therapy between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2012. Follow-up testing was not significantly associated with 30-day all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14; 1.39) and hospitalization with hyperkalemia (aHR 0.73, 95% CI 0.33; 1.61). However, follow-up testing was significantly associated with hospitalization with acute kidney injury (aHR 1.40, 95% CI 1.01; 1.94). Interaction between multimorbidity burden and follow-up testing was not statistically significant.

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: The STOP-ACEi trial [^112U8U2v]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). Low credibility.

Blood pressure (BP) control and the reduction of urinary protein excretion using agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system are the mainstay of therapy for chronic kidney disease (CKD). Research has confirmed the benefits in mild CKD, but data on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) use in advanced CKD are lacking. In the STOP-ACEi trial, we aim to confirm preliminary findings that suggest withdrawal of ACEi/ARB treatment can stabilize or even improve renal function in patients with advanced progressive CKD.

### Early rapid decline in kidney function as a beneficial sign after starting antihypertensive medication [^111gF8qq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

On the other hand, the alternative for endovascular procedures in renovascular hypertension, medical therapy alone, conveys a suspicious risk of temporary renal function deterioration as well, as many physicians have noticed in their practice and studies have revealed [10, 11]. This is true not only in situations where systemic or isolated glomerular hypovolemia and hypoperfusion is present, such as with infectious diarrhea, reduced drinking volume, bleeding, and resulting full-blown acute kidney failure.

The randomized ADVANCE (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified-Release Controlled Evaluation) trial investigated the effect of starting perindopril-indapamide (an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor with thiazide) or placebo in kidney-stable patients on the occurrence of major macrovascular events, new or worsening nephropathy, and all-cause mortality. Interestingly, although an initial GFR decrease was associated with greater risk of cardiovascular endpoints, the frequency of nephropathy was not higher in patients in whom the study medication was continued, despite an early GFR decrease [12, 13]. The study authors argued that "while initial short-term increases in serum creatinine beyond 30% (and indeed even 20%) are associated with a less favorable prognosis, continuation of ACE [angiotensin-converting enzyme] inhibitor-based therapy in those who experience these levels of increase may be beneficial and reduce the long-term risk of major clinical outcomes".

### Multicentre randomized controlled trial of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker withdrawal in advanced renal disease: the STOP-ACEi trial [^113SNcaS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2016). High credibility.

The study investigates whether discontinuing ACE inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or their combination in patients with advanced (Stage 4 or 5) progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects the stabilization or improvement of renal function over a three-year follow-up period. This approach is compared with the strategy of continuing ACEi and/or ARB, provided that good blood pressure (BP) control is maintained using other agents.

### Change in renal function associated with drug treatment in heart failure: National guidance [^111chWTX]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Changes in kidney function during acute illness are common, regardless of whether patients are treated with RAAS inhibitors. The incidence of AKI ranges from 7% to 18% among hospitalized patients. AKI is a powerful risk marker for poor outcomes and is strongly associated with an increased risk of subsequent admission for heart failure. Renal function often does not return to baseline levels in survivors of AKI, especially in those with pre-existing CKD.

The incidence of AKI, as defined by hospital coding, is rising rapidly. This may reflect a genuine increase or simply greater awareness. Conditions associated with the development of AKI, such as diabetes and CKD, are also common indications for RAAS inhibitors. Thus, AKI in association with RAAS blockade is a common clinical scenario. However, it is not clear that ACEI/ARB therapy alone is associated with a substantially increased risk of AKI.

When AKI is associated with overt hypovolemia, hypotension, or sepsis, it is critical that prompt correction of these abnormalities is undertaken to improve outcomes. However, including patients with HFrEF in treatment algorithms for AKI reflexively is dangerous. Administering crystalloids to patients who are already fluid overloaded defies common sense. There is no good evidence that temporarily ceasing RAAS therapy given for HFrEF during hospitalization or perioperatively reduces rates of AKI. Among patients hospitalized with AKI, treatment with ACEI or ARB is associated with a lower risk of death.

### Standards of care in diabetes — 2024 [^1161iYyS]. Diabetes Care (2024). High credibility.

For patients with diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, the ADA 2024 guidelines recommend initiating either an ACE inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). This is to prevent the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular events in nonpregnant patients with diabetes and hypertension. It is particularly advised for those with moderately increased albuminuria, characterized by a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio of 30–299 mg/g creatinine, or severely increased albuminuria, defined as a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine, and/or an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Aldactone [^116LxTm8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**:
	- **Hyperkalemia**: Monitor serum potassium within one week of initiation and regularly thereafter [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. ALDACTONE can cause hyperkalemia, with increased risk due to impaired renal function or concomitant potassium supplementation, potassium-containing salt substitutes, or drugs that increase potassium, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. If hyperkalemia occurs, decrease the dose or discontinue ALDACTONE and treat hyperkalemia.

	- **Hypotension and worsening renal function**: Excessive diuresis may lead to symptomatic dehydration, hypotension, and worsening renal function, particularly in salt-depleted patients or those taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Worsening renal function can also occur with concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and NSAIDs). Monitor volume status and renal function periodically.

	- **Electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities**: Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose periodically.

	- **Gynecomastia**: ALDACTONE can cause gynecomastia.

Regarding medical management for diabetic nephropathy, particularly concerning RAAS inhibitors such as ACEi/ARBs, the ADA 2025 guidelines recommend initiating either an ACEi or an ARB in nonpregnant patients with diabetes and hypertension. This intervention should be implemented when there is severely increased albuminuria (urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 300 mg/g creatinine) and/or an eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². The medication should be increased to the maximally tolerated dose to prevent the progression of kidney disease and reduce cardiovascular events.

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: Cohort study [^113tVgEZ]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

In routine primary care, most patients starting treatment with an ACEI/ARB experience only minor changes in renal function. However, increases in creatinine concentrations of more than 10% after starting ACEI/ARB treatment affect over 15% of patients and have significant implications. This study shows that creatinine increases after the initiation of ACEI/ARB treatment are associated with cardiorenal risks in a "dose-response" relationship, without a clear cut-off at 30% as previously suggested.

Further investigation is required to determine whether ACEI/ARB-associated changes in renal function reveal underlying pathophysiology or directly lead to adverse outcomes by causing permanent renal impairment in some patients. A better understanding of the overall risk-benefit ratio of continuing treatment despite kidney function loss for varying prescribing indications is essential. Notably, patients with substantial creatinine increases after beginning ACEI/ARB treatment should be recognized as a very high-risk group that requires close ongoing monitoring.

A review of the risks and potential benefits of continuing drug treatment for each patient's specific prescribing indication is needed.

### Initial estimated glomerular filtration rate decline and long-term renal function during intensive antihypertensive therapy: A post hoc analysis of the SPRINT and ACCORD-BP randomized controlled trials [^113jvqKH]. Hypertension (2020). Low credibility.

In line with earlier separate analyses of SPRINT and ACCORD, we observed that patients in the pooled cohort with a higher initial eGFR decline are at increased CVD risk and experience more events during follow-up. However, these studies suggest that the increased risk of CVD is not a consequence of intensive BP-lowering as the effect is independent of treatment allocation. A post hoc analysis of the SOLVD (Studies of Left Ventricular Dysfunction) trial in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction showed that there was no increased risk of death in patients randomized to ACE inhibition compared with placebo when stratified to initial eGFR decline.

Similarly, post hoc analyses of the AASK (African American Study of Kidney Disease and Hypertension) and MDRD trials (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) in patients with CKD showed that an initial decline in renal function is associated with an increased risk for end-stage renal disease and mortality in patients with CKD. However, this association was only significant in the > 20% decline strata in the intensive group, while in the standard group, the 5% to 20% stratum was already associated with adverse events. Corroborating these data, a recent post hoc analysis of the ADVANCE trial (Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation) showed that the creatinine increase during the run-in phase was associated with an elevated cardiovascular risk but did not influence the effect of treatment on cardiovascular events. Our analysis extends these findings by showing…

### Serum creatinine elevation after renin-angiotensin system blockade and long term cardiorenal risks: Cohort study [^111MKuJi]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are commonly prescribed drugs for hypertension, heart failure, diabetic microalbuminuria, and proteinuric renal disease, as well as after myocardial infarction. Patients may, however, experience a sudden decline in kidney function after starting these drugs due to the antagonism of angiotensin II-mediated efferent arteriolar constriction. Despite clear recommendations to detect sudden renal impairment by monitoring serum creatinine before and after the start of ACEI/ARB treatment and to discontinue treatment if creatinine concentrations increase by 30% or more, recent data show that only 10% of patients receive the recommended monitoring and only 20% of those with a creatinine increase of 30% or more after starting ACEI/ARB treatment discontinue the drugs.

Clinical trial data indicate that ACEI/ARB-induced renal impairment is uncommon. However, patients seen in routine clinical practice are, on average, older and have more comorbidity than those eligible for trials. As a consequence, the absolute risk of increases in creatinine of 30% or more in the community setting is not negligible. Although this level of creatinine increase after starting ACEI/ARB treatment raises concern about the long-term balance of risks and benefits, smaller increases (< 30%) do not prompt consideration of treatment discontinuation according to guidelines. The rationale for the 30% threshold in the context of adverse clinical outcomes is unclear, as little evidence is available on the actual risk involved.

### Association of acute increases in plasma creatinine after renin-angiotensin blockade with subsequent outcomes [^111mkq3i]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2019). Low credibility.

Data from observational and interventional studies provide discordant results regarding the relationship between creatinine increase after renin-angiotensin system inhibition (RASi) and adverse outcomes. We compared health outcomes among patients with different categories of increase in creatinine upon initiation of RASi in a large population-based cohort.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Stockholm Creatinine Measurements database, which contains complete information on diagnoses, medication dispensation claims, and laboratory test results for all Stockholm citizens accessing health care. Included were 31,951 adults initiating RASi during 2007–2011 with available pre- and post-initiation creatinine monitoring. Multivariable Cox regression was used to compare mortality, cardiovascular, and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) events among individuals with different ranges of creatinine increases within 2 months after starting treatment.

- **Results**: In a median follow-up of 3.5 years, acute increases in creatinine were associated with mortality (3202 events) in a graded manner: compared with creatinine increases < 10%, a 10%-19% increase showed an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.15 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05 to 1.27); HR 1.22 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.40) for 20%-29%; HR 1.55 (95% CI, 1.36 to 1.77) for ≥ 30%. Similar graded associations were present for heart failure (2275 events, P < 0.001) and ESKD (52 events, P < 0.001), and, less consistently, myocardial infarction (842 events, P = 0.25). Results were robust across subgroups.

### Impact of early initiation of renin-angiotensin blockade on renal function and clinical outcomes in patients with hypertensive emergency: a retrospective cohort study [^1176HUdN]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Hypertensive emergency is an acute progressive disorder caused by severe hypertension and requires prompt recognition and timely intervention, which could prevent the occurrence of catastrophic events such as cerebral hemorrhage, heart failure, and acute kidney impairment. This disorder is often defined in many guidelines as acutely elevated blood pressure (BP), typically more than 180/120 mmHg, with barotrauma on major vital organs. Conversely, malignant hypertension is characterized by acute severe hypertension with advanced retinopathy and is recognized as a subset of hypertensive emergency or crisis. This raises the possibility of reappraising malignant hypertension.

A growing number of studies have attempted to characterize the pathophysiology of hypertensive emergency, noting an increase in hospital admissions for this disease over the past 20 years. However, there have been a limited number of investigations evaluating the long-term effects of this acute event on target organs, particularly the kidney, which may progress to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) requiring renal replacement therapy.

Significant progress has been made in the development of antihypertensive drugs, offering various mechanisms for clinical use, either solely or in combination with other types of antihypertensive agents. In malignant hypertension, long-term BP control is reported to offer favorable renal outcomes. Given that the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone (RAA) system is activated in this scenario, the strategic initiation of renin-angiotensin blockade may have implications for renal function and other clinical outcomes.

### Perioperative acute kidney injury: Diagnosis, prediction, prevention, and treatment [^112dK8BW]. Anesthesiology (2025). Low credibility.

Additionally, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers can lead to a "functional" AKI (defined as an increase in serum creatinine). The prospective Translational Research Investigating Biomarker Endpoints for Acute Kidney Injury (TRIBE-AKI) study demonstrated that the graded increase in functional AKI — continued angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker use greater than held angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker use, which is greater than no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker use — was not accompanied by "structural" AKI. There was no difference in AKI risk between the three exposure groups, as assessed by four different urinary biomarkers for AKI. The results of a study can be dramatically altered based on how AKI is defined (i.e. serum creatinine changes vs. biomarkers), and this discrepancy may be especially pronounced in patients on angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. This study demonstrates that a rise in serum creatinine is not always accompanied by tissue damage (and tissue damage does not always result in rising serum creatinine, i.e. subclinical AKI), highlighting one of the major limitations of serum creatinine as a biomarker.

- **Management of NSAIDs**: NSAIDs have been used to effectively mitigate postoperative pain while decreasing the opioid requirement. NSAIDs can adversely affect renal function via prostaglandin-mediated afferent arteriolar dilation, which causes reduced glomerular perfusion, leading to acute interstitial nephritis.

### Hyperkalemia after initiating renin-angiotensin system blockade: The Stockholm Creatinine Measurements (SCREAM) project [^114LBRqk]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2017). Low credibility.

The research examines the prediction of hyperkalemia after ACE-I or ARB initiation. The susceptibility score predicted the probability of developing potassium levels greater than 5.5 mmol/L in the following year, which varied by patient profile. Patients with relatively preserved eGFR or baseline potassium of 5.5 mmol/L had different risk profiles in the year following ACE initiation.

Among all new users of ACE-I or ARB therapy in the SCREAM cohort, 91.8% had a predicted risk of more than 20%. The risks among new users without potassium checks in the year following medication initiation were lower, with 95.6% having a predicted risk exceeding 20%.

- **Hyperkalemia susceptibility score**: Predicted probability of developing potassium levels greater than 5.5 mmol/L in the year following initiation of ACE-I or ARB therapy varied for different patient scenarios.

Overall, careful monitoring of potassium levels is essential for patients initiating these therapies to manage and mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia.
