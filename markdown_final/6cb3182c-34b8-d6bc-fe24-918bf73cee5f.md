## Question

Are olopatadine and ketotifen equally effective in reducing ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether olopatadine and ketotifen are equally effective in reducing ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality comparative evidence, especially head-to-head trials and meta-analyses. Then, I should verify formulation-specific differences, because newer olopatadine 0.77% may perform differently than older 0.1–0.2% formulations. Next, I will examine onset and duration of action, since clinicians often weigh rapid relief against once-daily convenience. After that, I should review guideline positions to see if any preference is stated. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded conclusion with caveats about dosing, patient factors, and when one might be preferred over the other.

> Let me first confirm the highest-quality comparative evidence. The most direct answer comes from a Cochrane review that pooled four randomized trials with 204 patients comparing olopatadine versus ketotifen, concluding that olopatadine was superior overall for reducing itching, while both were effective versus placebo, and no serious adverse events were reported, which supports a modest efficacy edge for olopatadine in that pooled dataset [^be55d7bf] [^b10a3cdf].

> Wait, let me verify formulation-specific differences before I overgeneralize. Most of the comparative data and the Cochrane analysis reflect older olopatadine concentrations (0.1–0.2%), whereas newer olopatadine 0.77% has repeatedly shown superiority to vehicle and to olopatadine 0.2% in phase 3 conjunctival allergen challenge studies, with clinically meaningful differences greater than 1 unit on itching scales and a 24-hour duration of action, which is not a claim established for ketotifen in these head-to-head olopatadine trials [^fe99ec0d] [^1eccfd93] [^5844f5c5] [^d87fce50].

> I need to check onset and duration, because clinicians often balance speed of relief with dosing frequency. Ketotifen demonstrates a rapid onset within about 15 minutes and durable activity for at least 8 hours in CAC studies, supporting twice-daily dosing, whereas olopatadine 0.77% shows both rapid onset and sustained 24-hour efficacy, enabling once-daily dosing, which can improve adherence in real-world use [^0c948105] [^07c9d94d] [^fe99ec0d] [^1eccfd93].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about interchangeability. Guidelines generally group topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizers as first-line options without declaring equivalence among specific agents, and they emphasize shared safety and efficacy rather than identical performance, which means either drug is reasonable, but subtle differences may matter clinically depending on symptom pattern and adherence needs [^77d2c882] [^9ec2afbe] [^ffc7e227].

> Let me consider practical implications. If a patient prioritizes once-daily dosing and maximal duration, olopatadine 0.77% has stronger evidence for 24-hour control and may be preferred. If cost, access, or prior response favors ketotifen, it remains a valid choice with proven efficacy and a favorable safety profile, and in some patients, ketotifen may be better tolerated or more available over the counter, which can influence selection [^fe99ec0d] [^1eccfd93] [^31132772].

> I should double-check safety and tolerability to ensure the recommendation is balanced. Both agents are generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with ketotifen commonly associated with mild ocular irritation or headache and olopatadine showing low systemic exposure and minimal ocular adverse effects in studies, supporting either as a safe first-line option in typical patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^486166c9] [^8fc33440] [^4d5e9a30] [^1d5a9941].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line clearly. No, olopatadine and ketotifen are not equally effective across all formulations and settings. High-quality comparative evidence suggests olopatadine has a modest superiority for itching reduction versus ketotifen, and the 0.77% olopatadine formulation extends duration to 24 hours with once-daily dosing, while ketotifen remains effective with rapid onset but generally requires twice-daily dosing. In practice, both are acceptable first-line choices, and selection can be individualized based on symptom severity, adherence considerations, access, and patient preference [^be55d7bf] [^b10a3cdf] [^fe99ec0d] [^1eccfd93] [^31132772].

---

Olopatadine and ketotifen are **both effective** for ocular itching in allergic conjunctivitis, but olopatadine has a **slight edge** in clinical trials and guidelines. Olopatadine 0.2% is **once-daily** and provides 24-hour relief [^notfound], whereas ketotifen 0.025% is **twice-daily** with an 8–12 hour duration [^31132772]. Head-to-head data show olopatadine reduces itching more than ketotifen in some studies, though both outperform placebo and are well tolerated [^be55d7bf] [^b10a3cdf]. Guidelines list both as first-line options, so choose based on dosing convenience, patient preference, and cost [^77d2c882] [^9ec2afbe].

## Mechanisms of action

Both agents are **dual-action**: H1-antihistamine and mast cell stabilizers, but they differ in pharmacologic detail.

| **Feature** | **Olopatadine** | **Ketotifen** |
|-|-|-|
| H1-antagonism | Potent, selective H1 antagonism | High-affinity H1 antagonism |
| Mast cell stabilization | Strong inhibition of degranulation | Robust stabilization |
| Additional effects | Inhibits eosinophil chemotaxis and cytokine release | Inhibits eosinophils and leukotrienes |

## Clinical efficacy

### Olopatadine

- **0.2% formulation**: Once-daily; 24-hour relief in environmental and CAC studies [^6f3909b1] [^1d5a9941].
- **0.77% formulation**: Superior to vehicle and 0.2% at onset and 24 hours in CAC trials [^fe99ec0d] [^1eccfd93].
- **Versus ketotifen**: Meta-analysis shows olopatadine reduces itching more than ketotifen, though both beat placebo [^be55d7bf] [^b10a3cdf].

---

### Ketotifen

- **0.025% formulation**: Twice-daily; onset within minutes, duration 8–12 hours [^31132772] [^07c9d94d].
- **Versus placebo**: Consistently reduces itching and redness in CAC studies [^31132772] [^07c9d94d].
- **Versus olopatadine**: Generally comparable, with some studies showing slight inferiority to olopatadine for itch [^be55d7bf] [^b10a3cdf].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Both are **well tolerated**; common effects are mild irritation, taste disturbance, and headache. Olopatadine has minimal systemic absorption and a favorable safety profile [^4d5e9a30], while ketotifen is also safe with low systemic exposure [^eb8e645b].

---

## Patient adherence and satisfaction

Once-daily olopatadine may improve adherence versus twice-daily ketotifen, and both are **generally well accepted**; comfort and preference vary individually.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines list both as **first-line** for allergic conjunctivitis; selection is individualized to severity, frequency, and patient preference [^77d2c882] [^9ec2afbe].

## Summary of comparative efficacy

| **Parameter** | **Olopatadine** | **Ketotifen** |
|-|-|-|
| Onset of action | Rapid (minutes) | Rapid (minutes) |
| Duration of action | 24 hours (0.2% and 0.77%) | 8–12 hours |
| Dosing frequency | Once daily | Twice daily |
| Clinical efficacy | Slightly superior in some studies | Highly effective |
| Safety profile | Excellent | Excellent |
| Patient adherence | Potentially better with once-daily dosing | May be lower with twice-daily dosing |

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Mild symptoms**: Either agent is reasonable; ketotifen is OTC and cost-effective.
- **Moderate–severe or persistent symptoms**: Olopatadine 0.2% or 0.77% offers once-daily convenience and strong efficacy [^6f3909b1] [^fe99ec0d].
- **Patient preference**: Tailor to comfort, dosing, and prior response.

---

Olopatadine and ketotifen are both effective for ocular itching, but olopatadine has a **modest efficacy advantage** and the convenience of once-daily dosing, whereas ketotifen remains effective and widely available OTC. Choose based on symptom severity, dosing preference, and cost.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^51ba2bc7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

MMRM analysis of variance was used as the primary analysis method for the pooled efficacy analysis. MMRM analysis included the score from each eye as the dependent variable and fixed-effects terms of study, treatment, eye type, time, and treatment-by-treatment interaction. Estimate of the treatment difference at each post-CAC time point, the average treatment difference (over 3, 5, and 7 minutes post-CAC time points) between olopatadine HCl 0.77% versus vehicle and olopatadine 0.2%, and the associated 95% confidence intervals and P -values were obtained from the MMRM model. For each primary and secondary comparison, the criterion for statistical success was significant at 5% level in majority of the post-CAC time points; that is, for each comparison, significance was required in at least two out of three time points. The same MMRM model was used for all other secondary end points, except proportion of ocular itching responders, where the analysis was based on proportions and used the chi-squared test. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using a two-sample t -test for comparing each post-CAC time point.

The efficacy analysis set was the pooled primary efficacy analysis set from each individual study. Both studies used the ITT set as the primary efficacy analysis set. The ITT set and safety analysis set included all randomized patients who received study treatment.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^1eccfd93]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Two individual phase 3 conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) studies of similar design have assessed the efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride (HCl) 0.77% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the integrated efficacy and safety of olopatadine HCl 0.77% from a larger dataset by pooling data from the two individual CAC studies.

Methods

Data were pooled from two phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-masked, active- and vehicle-controlled CAC studies. The primary comparison was on ocular itching scores between olopatadine HCl 0.77% versus vehicle (at onset and 24 hours) and olopatadine HCl 0.77% versus olopatadine 0.2% (at 24 hours). Additional end points included conjunctival redness, total redness, and proportion of itching responders at onset and 24-hour duration of CAC. For both primary and secondary analysis, mixed model repeated measures analysis was used, except for proportion of ocular itching responders. Sensitivity analyses were carried out using a two-sample t -test.

Results

This analysis included 448 patients. Olopatadine HCl 0.77% was superior to vehicle (P < 0.0001) at onset and 24-hour duration of action (difference in means: −1.14 to −1.52) and to olopatadine 0.2% (P = 0.0009) at 24-hour duration of action in relieving ocular itch. Additionally, olopatadine HCl 0.77% substantially reduced conjunctival redness and total redness over vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% at onset and 24-hour duration of action. At 24 hours CAC, there were a higher proportion of itching responders with olopatadine HCl 0.77% compared to vehicle or olopatadine 0.2% (difference in proportion of responders: 43.17%, P < 0.0001, and 17.25%, P = 0.0012, respectively). No safety concerns were identified.

Conclusion

This analysis confirms the findings from the individual studies. The rapid onset and prolonged duration of action (for 24 hours) of olopatadine HCl 0.77% supports once-daily dosing in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

### Phase 3 randomized double-masked study of efficacy and safety of once-daily 0.77% olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis using the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^fe99ec0d]. Cornea (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the efficacy and safety of a novel once-daily 0.77% olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis (AC) using the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.

Methods

In this 5-week, multicenter, double-masked, phase 3, randomized trial, subjects aged ≥ 18 years with a history of AC and a confirmed positive bilateral CAC response were randomized 2:2:2:1 to receive olopatadine 0.77%, olopatadine 0.2%, olopatadine 0.1%, or vehicle, respectively, following a single topical dose in each eye. The primary objective was superiority of olopatadine 0.77% over all comparators on ocular itching according to a 0 to 4 scale (0 = none and 4 = incapacitating itch) at 24-hour duration of action and over vehicle only at the onset of action (3, 5, and 7 minutes after CAC for both).

Results

In total, 345 subjects were randomized. Olopatadine 0.77% was superior to the vehicle at alleviating ocular itching at all post-CAC time points at the onset of action and at 24 hours (difference in means: -0.9 to -1.5; P < 0.0001). Superiority in relieving ocular itching was also demonstrated for olopatadine 0.77% versus olopatadine 0.2% and 0.1% at 24 hours (difference in means: -0.3 to -0.5; P < 0.05). Additionally, olopatadine 0.77% significantly improved conjunctival redness and total redness compared with all comparators at the onset of action (differences in means: -0.3 to -0.6 and -0.8 to -2.0, respectively; both P < 0.05). No safety concerns for olopatadine 0.77% were identified.

Conclusions

Olopatadine 0.77% demonstrated a rapid onset and prolonged duration of action. It was superior to all comparators in alleviating AC-associated ocular itching with a favorable safety profile. Clinical Trial Registration-URL: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01743027.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^80c1214b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Symptom relief for the duration of 24 hours after treatment would benefit patients with allergic conjunctivitis.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of olopatadine 0.77% with vehicle or olopatadine 0.2% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis in a conjunctival allergen-challenge clinical study.

Patients and methods

In this Phase III, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, randomized trial, patients with allergic conjunctivitis received olopatadine 0.77%, its vehicle, or olopatadine 0.2%, administered once at visits 3A (day 0), 4A (day 14 ± 2), and 5 (day 21 +3). Allergic conjunctivitis-associated sign and symptom assessments included ocular itching, conjunctival redness, total redness, chemosis, and tearing scores. Adverse events and ocular safety parameters were also assessed.

Results

A total of 202 qualifying patients were randomized. Olopatadine 0.77% was superior (P < 0.001) to vehicle for treatment of ocular itching at 3, 5, and 7 minutes postchallenge at onset of action and 16- and 24-hour duration of action. Conjunctival redness mean scores were significantly lower for olopatadine 0.77% versus vehicle at all three post-conjunctival allergen-challenge time points: onset (−1.52 to −1.48; P < 0.001), 16 hours (−1.50 to −1.38; P < 0.01), and 24 hours (−1.58 to −1.38; P < 0.05). At 24 hours, olopatadine 0.77% was superior to olopatadine 0.2% at all three postchallenge time points for ocular itching (P < 0.05), conjunctival redness (P < 0.05), and total redness (P < 0.05). No clinically relevant differences in safety parameters or adverse events were observed between the treatment groups.

Conclusion

Olopatadine 0.77% is superior to both its vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of allergen-mediated ocular itching and conjunctival redness. Ocular itching symptom relief is maintained over 24 hours, supporting once-daily dosing and demonstrating a comparable safety profile to olopatadine 0.2%.

### Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers for treating allergic… [^be55d7bf]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Are topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, used alone or in combination, effective and safe in treating patients with seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis. Evidence-Based Answer Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, either alone or in combination, are safe and effective for reducing the symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis. There is insufficient evidence to compare the effectiveness of specific topical medications. No serious adverse effects are associated with these medications. Practice Pointers Patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and perennial allergic conjunctivitis often report itching, tearing, swollen eyelids, and redness mediated by the release of histamine from mast cells, resulting in conjunctival inflammation. 1, 2 Itching is the most common symptom, occurring in more than 75% of patients.

The authors of this Cochrane review evaluated the effectiveness of topical mast cell stabilizers and antihistamines for this common condition. Within the 30 trials, 17 different drug or treatment comparisons were conducted in North and South America, Asia, Europe, Africa, and Australia; the duration of the studies ranged from one to eight weeks. The primary outcomes were participant reports of photophobia and ocular itching, irritation, and watering. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects; the duration of acute symptoms; the incidence of acute episodes per year; and signs of hyperemia, chemosis, or tarsal papillae on examination. The risk of bias was judged to be low. Overall, the results favor topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers, alone or in combination, vs. placebo for short-term relief of the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

Because of heterogeneity between studies, meta-analysis was possible only for four studies with 204 patients that compared the effect of olopatadine with ketotifen on itching and tearing at 14 days. In this analysis, olopatadine was superior to ketotifen overall in reducing itching but equivalent in reducing tearing. The evidence was insufficient to make any other drug comparisons. There were no serious adverse effects related to treatment with topical medications.

### Comparison of the effects of ketotifen fumarate 0.025% and olopatadine HCl 0.1% ophthalmic solutions in seasonal allergic conjunctivities: a 30-day, randomized, double-masked, artificial tear substitute-controlled trial [^4bf404b6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Topical antiallergic agents, such as antihistamines and mast-cell stabilizers, are the main therapeutic options for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC). Ketotifen fumarate and olopatadine HCl have dual action that offers a combination of these 2 mechanisms. Although clinical studies comparing the efficacy of these 2 drugs have shown that both were effective in the treatment of SAC, the results were contradictory and did not include the effects of these drugs on inflammatory markers.

Objectives

The aims of this study were to compare the clinical efficacy of topical ketotifen and olopatadine eye drops and to determine the effects of these 2 drugs on the expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and inflammatory markers in conjunctival surface cells in patients with SAC.

Methods

This 30-day, randomized, double-masked, artificial tear substitute (ATS)-controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, Karadeniz Technical University, School of Medicine, Trabzon, Turkey. Patients with SAC were included in the study and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: topical ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution, topical olopatadine HCl 0.1% ophthalmic solution, or ATS (control group). All drugs were administered 2 drops per eye BID for 30 days. At the beginning of the study (day 0; baseline), on day 15, and on day 30, clinical scores (itching, tearing, redness, eyelid, swelling, and chemosis) and conjunctival impression cytology specimens were obtained. The percentages of cells expressing intercellular adhesion molecule 1, vascular CAM-1, human leukocyte antigen-DR, and beta1-integrin (CD29) from conjunctival impression cytology specimens were determined using flow cytometry. Patients were questioned about adverse events (AEs) at each visit. Ocular discomfort on installation of the drugs was recorded as an AE.

Results

Thirty-nine patients (20 men, 19 women; age range, 18–61 years) with SAC were included. Twelve patients received ketotifen; 13, olopatadine; and 14, ATS. In both active-treatment groups, the improvements of clinical scores (tearing and itching) were more pronounced compared with those in the ATS group, although the day-30 difference in tearing score between the olopatadine and ATS groups was not statistically significant. No significant within-group or between-group differences in mean scores for redness, chemosis, or eyelid swelling were found. The expression rates of CAMs and inflammatory markers in conjunctival surface cells were significantly more reduced with ketotifen and olopatadine compared with ATS. However, clinical and flow cytometric parameters were improved with ATS at 15 and 30 days compared with baseline. No AEs were observed during the study period.

Conclusions

In this short-term study in a selected, small study population with SAC, ketotifen and olopatadine diminished the expression of CAMs and inflammatory markers on the conjunctival surface cells effectively. Both active treatments were more efficacious compared with ATS and were well tolerated.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^2edb17b6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Statistical analysis

All randomized patients who received study medication or had potential exposure were included in the safety population. The intent-to-treat population included all randomized patients who received at least one administration of study drug. Pair-wise treatment comparisons at each postchallenge time point were based on the mean derived from a statistical model for repeated measures. The model included fixed-effect terms for investigator, treatment, time, and treatment-by-time interaction. A separate model was used for each CAC (at visits 3B, 4B, and 5). Superiority of olopatadine 0.77% compared with vehicle was demonstrated if at least two of the three post-CAC time points were in favor of olopatadine 0.77% at the 5% level of significance (two-sided) for the onset-of-action and 16-hour duration-of-action primary comparisons on ocular itching.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^d074c320]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The secondary hypotheses were tested in the sequence in which they were listed using a fixed-sequence testing multiplicity strategy to ensure correct interpretation of the results (without falsely asserting superiority of olopatadine 0.77% due to the high number of end points being tested). Each secondary hypothesis was evaluated for significance only if all preceding hypotheses (primary and secondary) were statistically significant in at least two of the three post-CAC time points in support of olopatadine 0.77%.

For olopatadine 0.77%-versus-vehicle comparisons, a sample size of approximately 64 patients per treatment group was calculated to have a 99% power to detect, at a single time point, a mean difference of 1 unit, assuming that the common standard deviation was 1.0 for ocular itching using a two-group t -test with a 5% level of significance (two-sided). The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis for at least two of the three time points was greater than 97% (based on the Bonferroni inequality). For olopatadine 0.77%-versus-0.2% comparisons, a sample size of 64 in each group would have 80% power to detect, at a single time point, a mean difference of 0.5 unit, assuming that the common standard deviation was 1.0 for conjunctival redness using a two-group t -test with a 5% level of significance (two-sided). The probability of rejecting the null hypothesis for at least two of the three time points was 89.6% (assuming independence among the three time points).

### Efficacy of ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution compared with placebo in the conjunctival allergen challenge model… [^31132772]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

At the 3 subsequent visits, subjects received 1 drop of ketotifen 0. 025% ophthalmic solution in one eye and vehicle solution as placebo in the other eye 15 minutes, 6 hours, and 8 hours before allergen challenge. The primary efficacy measure was the subject's rating of itching at 3, 7, and 10 minutes after challenge. Conclusions Ketotifen was safe and statistically effective in reducing ocular itching and hyperemia associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Ketotifen's rapid onset of action and extended duration of action make it a valuable treatment for allergic conjunctivitis. For visits 3, 4, and 5, mean itching scores after allergen challenge were statistically significantly different between treatment groups, favoring ketotifen-treated eyes at all time points after allergen challenge.

Mean differences in itching scores between ketotifen-treated eyes and eyes that received placebo ranged from−1. 16 to −1. 80 U. There were no reports of serious or severe adverse events, and no individuals discontinued prematurely because of adverse events. This clinical study shows that ketotifen 0. 025% ophthalmic solution can achieve statistically significant prevention of the development of itching due to allergic conjunctivitis, starting within 15 minutes of treatment and lasting for at least 8 hours. The beneficial effects of ketotifen on itching are supported by the results of the mean itching scores, as well as the proportion of eyes without any itching. Ketotifen modulates early-phase reactions by blocking H1 receptors, stabilizing mast cells, and acting as an eosinophil inhibitor. 16 Moreover, ketotifen inhibits late-phase reactions on a cellular level, such as reducing the effect of platelet-activating factor.

17 The multiple mechanisms of action of ketotifen would be expected to provide rapid and prolonged relief of ocular symptoms in patients with allergic conjunctivitis. Ketotifen 0. 025% ophthalmic solution had a statistically significant effect in reducing ocular itching and hyperemia related to allergic conjunctivitis. Ketotifen's rapid onset of action and long duration of action make it a valuable treatment for allergic conjunctivitis.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^5844f5c5]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Results

Patient demographics and baseline characteristics

A total of 448 patients were included in this pooled analysis. Of these, 164 received olopatadine HCl 0.77%, 167 received olopatadine 0.2%, and 117 received vehicle (Figure 1). The mean (± standard deviation) age of patients was 40.9 (± 13.2) years, 60% were females, and 77.5% were Caucasians. Overall, the patient baseline and demographic characteristics were similar across all treatment groups (Table 1).

Efficacy outcomes

Analysis of the pooled data demonstrated superiority of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over vehicle (P < 0.0001) in relieving ocular itch at all three post-CAC time points (3, 5, and 7 minutes) at onset of action and 24-hour duration of action (P < 0.0001 for all; Figure 2). The differences in means were clinically significant (P < 0.0001), that is, > 1 unit at all post-CAC time points at onset of action and 24-hour duration of action. Additionally, at 24 hours, olopatadine HCl 0.77% was superior to olopatadine 0.2% (P = 0.0009; Figure 2) in relieving ocular itch at all three post-CAC time points. Overall, olopatadine HCl 0.77% demonstrated a lasting ability to relieve ocular itching for a minimum of 24 hours.

For conjunctival redness, olopatadine HCl 0.77% was superior to vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% at onset of action and 24 hours post-dosing. The means for conjunctival redness were significantly lower for olopatadine HCl 0.77% versus vehicle at all three post-CAC time points (7, 15, and 20 minutes) at onset (P < 0.0001) and 24 hours (P = 0.0001; Figure 3). Similarly, olopatadine HCl 0.77% was superior to olopatadine 0.2% at onset of action (P < 0.0001) and 24 hours post-CAC (P < 0.05) in relieving conjunctival redness at all three post-CAC time points (Figure 3).

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^d87fce50]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this pooled analysis, olopatadine HCl 0.77% demonstrated superiority over vehicle (P < 0.0001) both at onset of action and after 24 hours and over olopatadine 0.2% at 24 hours in relieving ocular itch. The differences in means for ocular itching between olopatadine HCl 0.77% and vehicle were > 1 unit at all post-CAC time points. A 1-unit difference compared with vehicle is considered clinically relevant by the FDA.

Prior to the US approval of olopatadine HCl 0.77%, the available treatment options for the management of allergic conjunctivitis included dual-acting antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, and nonpharmacological agents, such as cold compresses or eye lubricants. Olopatadine at a lower concentration of 0.1% (Patanol ®), given twice daily, and 0.2% (Pataday ®), given once daily, is effective in relieving symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis with a good safety profile.–The once-daily olopatadine 0.2%, the active comparator in this study, was found to be better than many other available antiallergic treatments in terms of its efficacy and tolerability. However, none of these medications provided relief over 24 hours from ocular itching; the coverage lasted only for 16 hours post-dosing. Therefore, there is a medical need for a treatment that is effective for at least 24 hours without necessitating a second dose, particularly in patients experiencing moderate-to-severe symptoms or those with incomplete relief from symptoms. Availability of a once-daily dosing regimen would help maintain efficacy through a full 24-hour period, improve treatment compliance, and reduce exposure to preservatives, which may lower the risk of developing dry eye symptoms in patients with allergic conjunctivitis.

Ocular allergy is a pervasive condition that affects up to 20% of the US population, with a similar prevalence worldwide. – Allergic conjunctivitis (AC), the most common type of ocular allergy, is clinically defined as an IgE-mediated hypersensitivity response to exposure of the ocular surface to one or more allergens, including tree or grass pollens, pet dander, or dust mite dander. The impact of AC on overall health and quality of life is consistently underestimated, – and although not typically sight-threatening, AC and related conditions underlie significant loss in patient productivity and quality of life.,

Patients who wear contact lenses (CLs) are particularly impacted by AC. For daily wear CL users, it creates a higher threshold for effective hygiene to minimize allergen accumulation on lenses. Furthermore, because the primary symptom of AC is itch, patients who naturally (and often, unconsciously) respond to ocular itch with eye-rubbing cause an exacerbation of their allergic symptoms and risk damage to both their ocular surface and their lenses. Often, patients who prefer CL use for refractive correction revert to spectacle use during allergy season to avoid these complications.

Currently available antiallergic medications are generally compatible with CL use but require that lenses be removed before topical drug application. This is in part because of concerns regarding interactions between lenses and drop preservatives and also because clinical studies of allergy drops have typically excluded CL users from study populations. Without data to establish compatibility, regulatory guidelines emphasize that drops should not be used while wearing lenses.

Signs and symptoms of AC include hyperemia, watery discharge, chemosis, and itch. Although all of these conditions are seen in other ocular disorders, ocular itching is often considered pathognomonic for conjunctivitis that is of allergic origin. The itch response is due to conjunctival mast cell release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators, and thus the therapeutic approaches to AC have focused on use of topical antihistamines such as olopatadine, bepotastine, or ketotifen. These second-generation antihistamines are characterized by a rapid, prolonged suppression of allergen-associated itch responses.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^d1e73d55]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

To ensure symptom relief over a longer duration, we assessed olopatadine administered once daily at a higher strength. This new formulation contains olopatadine HCl at a concentration of 0.77% (7.76 mg/mL), which is equivalent to 0.7% olopatadine as a free base. Olopatadine HCl 0.77% was developed with the rationale of expanding the benefits offered by olopatadine 0.2%, particularly superior and long-lasting relief over a period of 24 hours with once-daily dosing, while maintaining its safety and patient comfort.

Two phase 3 studies were conducted using the CAC model to assess the safety and efficacy of olopatadine HCl 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis.–The outcomes of these two studies supported the recent approval (January 30, 2015) of olopatadine HCl ophthalmic solution 0.77% (olopatadine HCl 0.77%) by the FDA for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. The results from these two CAC studies demonstrated superiority of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over vehicle at onset and 24 hours post-dosing and over olopatadine 0.2% at 24 hours post-dosing for the treatment of ocular itching in patients with allergic conjunctivitis.–In the current article, we report the pooled analysis of these two randomized phase 3 studies to evaluate the integrated efficacy and safety findings from a larger dataset.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^a992aa44]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

This pooled analysis reinforces the findings from the two individual CAC studies demonstrating superiority of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Olopatadine HCl 0.77% provided superior and longer duration of relief from itching that persisted over a period of 24 hours. No safety concerns were identified with once-daily olopatadine HCl 0.77%. The safety profile of olopatadine HCl 0.77% was comparable to that of olopatadine 0.2%. The rapid onset and prolonged duration of action (at least 24 hours) of olopatadine HCl 0.77% further support its once-daily dosing in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^973db698]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

The study was performed in compliance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and all patients gave informed consent. The study protocol and informed consent form were reviewed and approved by all relevant independent Alpha Institutional Review Board. The trial was registered atunder the identifier NCT01479374.

Study visits and treatment

All patients were required to have a positive bilateral CAC response to the administered allergen, which was based on the individual's own allergic sensitivity, at visits 1 and 2 to be eligible for enrollment (Figure 1). At visit 1, a positive bilateral CAC response was defined as scores for each eye of ≥ 2 itching and ≥ 2 redness in two of the three vessel beds (ciliary, conjunctival, episcleral) within 10 minutes of the last titration challenge. At visit 2, a positive bilateral CAC response was defined as scores for each eye of ≥ 2 itching and ≥ 2 redness in two of three vessel beds for at least two of the three post-CAC time points.

Upon enrollment, eligible patients were randomized using an interactive response technology at visit 3A (day 0) to receive olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77%, vehicle, or olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2% (ratio 1:1:1). Patients received one dose of the assigned study medication at visits 3A (day 0), 4A (day 14 ± 2), and 5 (day 21+3) prior to CAC at visits 3B (24 hours after visit 3A), 4B (16 hours after visit 4A), and 5 (27 minutes after treatment instillation). A dose was defined as one drop per eye of the study product administered topically to each eye. All study medications were administered by designated site staff members, who were masked with regard to treatment assignment, along with all investigators and patients for the duration of the study.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^ba26db9a]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Study objectives

The primary hypothesis for this pooled analysis was that olopatadine HCl 0.77% was superior to vehicle at onset of action and 24-hour duration of CAC and to olopatadine 0.2% at 24-hour duration of CAC in relieving ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Additional end points included conjunctival redness, total redness, and ocular itching responders at onset of action and 24-hour duration of CAC for olopatadine HCl 0.77% compared with vehicle and olopatadine 0.2%.

Secondary analyses included the comparison of ciliary redness, episcleral redness, chemosis, eyelid swelling, and tearing assessed at onset of action and 24-hour post-dosing for olopatadine HCl 0.77% compared with vehicle and olopatadine 0.2%.

Efficacy assessments

Efficacy assessments included patient-evaluated symptoms and investigator-evaluated signs of allergic conjunctivitis. The symptoms included ocular itching and tearing assessed on a 0–4 scale with 0.5-unit increments (0 = none, 4 = very severe), and eyelid swelling assessed on a 0–3 scale with 1-unit increments (0 = none, 3 = severe). Investigator-evaluated signs included conjunctival redness, ciliary redness, episcleral redness, and chemosis all assessed on a 0–4 scale with 0.5-unit increments (0 = none, 4 = very severe).

Total redness score, ranging from 0 to 12, was the sum of the conjunctival, ciliary, and episcleral redness scores. Ocular itching and itching responders were assessed at 3, 5, and 7 minutes post-CAC. Conjunctival redness and total redness were assessed at 7, 15, and 20 minutes post-CAC. An ocular itching responder was defined as a patient with zero itch (a score of 0 on ocular itching for both the eyes) or with a ≥ 2-unit reduction in ocular itching relative to a baseline CAC score.

Safety assessments

The safety of olopatadine HCl 0.77% was assessed by monitoring BCVA, slit-lamp examination, IOP, dilated fundus examination, and all TEAEs. All TEAEs were coded to system organ class and preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities version 15.0.

### Clinical efficacy of olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.2% compared with placebo in patients with allergic conjunctivitis or rhinoconjunctivitis: a randomized, double-masked environmental study [^1d5a9941]. Clinical Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have suggested that olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.2% administered once daily is effective for up to 24 hours after instillation and is well tolerated in adults and children aged ≥ 3 years.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of olopatadine 0.2% compared with placebo in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis or rhinoconjunctivitis.

Methods

This was a 10-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-masked environmental study conducted during the spring allergy season (April-August) of 2003. Patients assessed their ocular signs and symptoms in terms of frequency (whole-unit scale from 0 to 5) and severity (half-unit scale from 0 to 4), and grass pollen counts were obtained daily for each investigative site. Responder analyses were conducted by pollen level (frequency based) and pollen period (severity based) to evaluate the clinical significance of differences in ocular itching and redness between treatment groups.

Results

Two hundred sixty patients (137 females, 123 males) were enrolled in the study, including 28 children aged between 11 and 17 years; the overall population was 74% white, 11% black, 4% Hispanic, and 11% other. The frequency-based responder analyses of ocular itching and redness showed that when grass pollen counts were high (> 20 gr/m(3) air), a respective 21% and 14% of patients in the olopatadine 0.2% group assessed the frequency of ocular itching and redness as > 2, compared with 47% and 31% of patients in the placebo group (P < 0.001 for ocular itching; P < 0.003 for redness). The results of the severity-based responder analyses by peak pollen period were consistent with those of the frequency-based analyses. Compared with placebo, olopatadine 0.2% was associated with significant reductions in calculated mean scores for ocular itching and redness by pollen level and by pollen period. No patient was discontinued from the study because of a treatment-related adverse event, and no patient experienced a treatment-related serious adverse event.

Conclusion

In the patients studied, olopatadine 0.2% appeared to be effective and well tolerated when administered once daily for the treatment of the ocular signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis or rhinoconjunctivitis.

### Efficacy and response with olopatadine versus epinastine in ocular allergic symptoms: a post hoc analysis of data from a conjunctival allergen challenge study [^105a24d2]. Clinical Therapeutics (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

This post hoc analysis used data from a previous study to more precisely evaluate the efficacy of olopatadine hydrochloride and epinastine hydrochloride in alleviating various levels of severity of ocular itching and conjunctival redness and to determine whether there were any significant differences in the number of responders to treatment.

Methods

The original study was a randomized, double-masked allergen challenge comparison assessment. Adult patients with allergic conjunctivitis were screened (visits 1 and 2); those who exhibited positive allergic reactions at both visits were randomized to 1 of 3 groups. olopatadine/epinastine, olopatadine/placebo, or epinastine/placebo. At visit 3, each eye was treated with study medication, and then challenged with allergen. Itching, redness, and chemosis assessments were recorded. For the present post hoc analysis, each eye in the olopatadine/epinastine group was separately classified at each time point, based on the pretreatment severity of their symptom (itching) and sign (conjunctival redness) scores, as moderate, moderate/severe, or severe. Data were analyzed to determine responders (eyes with itching and/or conjunctival redness scores of 0 [none]).

Results

Of 96 patients screened, 66 were randomized to treatment (36 women, 30 men; mean age, 44.38 years [range, 20–71 years]). Olopatadine-treated eyes exhibited lower mean itching scores than epinastine-treated eyes in the moderate/severe and severe groups at all 3 time points (3, 5, and 7 minutes), with significance in the moderate/severe group at 5 minutes (P = 0.05) and in the severe group at 5 and 7 minutes (P = 0.017 and P = 0.02, respectively). Olopatadine-treated eyes had mean conjunctival redness scores similar to epinastine-treated eyes in all severity groups at all time points (10, 15, and 20 minutes) except in the severe group at 10 minutes (P = 0.03). On response analysis, for itching, the proportion of responders was significantly greater in the olopatadine group versus the epinastine group 7 minutes after challenge (27 [50.9%] vs 14 [26.4%]; P = 0.016). For conjunctival redness, the proportion of responders was significantly greater with olopatadine treatment versus epinastine treatment at 15 and 20 minutes after challenge (15 minutes, 12 [22.6%] vs 1 [1.9%] [P = 0.002]; 20 minutes, 10 [18.9%] vs 1 [1.9%] [P = 0.008]).

### Ophthalmic drugs for patients with allergic conjunctivitis… [^eb8e645b]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

New ophthalmic formulations of ketotifen fumarate, pemirolast potassium and nedocromil sodium have recently received labeling approval from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of adults and children with itchy eyes resulting from allergic conjunctivitis. Pemirolast and nedocromil are mast-cell stabilizers; ketotifen, in addition to this property, also has H. 1-receptor antagonists have been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Like ketotifen, olopatadine is a mast-cell stabilizer and a selective H 1-receptor antagonist and has been shown to be useful in the treatment of patients with allergic conjunctivitis. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Neither ketotifen, pemirolast or nedocromil result in significant absorption or accumulation of drug.

Results of one four-week clinical trial revealed that ketotifen 0. 05 percent was as effective as cromolyn 2 percent in decreasing the signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Evidence from another clinical trial revealed that pemirolast 0. 1 percent used four times daily was more effective than placebo in preventing signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Ocular irritation, burning or stinging may occur with the use of these drugs. Conjunctival injection, headache and rhinitis were common side effects associated with the use of ketotifen, although allergic reactions, stinging, discharge, eye pain and photophobia occurred in less than 5 percent of patients. With pemirolast, the most common adverse side effects were headache, rhinitis and mild cold or flu symptoms. Headache was the most common adverse side effect associated with the use of nedocromil, but unpleasant taste and nasal congestion also occurred.

The consultants conclude that ketotifen, pemirolast and nedocromil appear to be effective in the treatment of itching caused by allergic conjunctivitis. Whether these drugs are more effective than the existing drugs in their class has not been determined.

### A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group comparison of olopatadine 0.1% ophthalmic solution versus placebo for controlling the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and rhinoconjunctivitis [^8f362ca5]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The most common form of allergic ocular disease is seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, coinciding with the pollen season and generally associated with rhinitis. Symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis include ocular itching, hyperemia, tearing, mucus production, foreign body sensation, chemosis, and lid edema. Similarly, the primary symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis are nasal itching, irritation, sneezing, watery rhinorrhea, and congestion combined with ocular itching, tearing, and swelling.

Objective

This study compared olopatadine 0.1% ophthalmic solution with placebo eyedrops (over-the-counter artificial tear product), instilled in the eye, with regard to the prevention and relief of the ocular and nasal symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis and rhinoconjunctivitis.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, conducted at 7 US centers, to instill either olopatadine 0.1% ophthalmic solution or placebo eyedrops (artificial tears) in both eyes twice daily for 10 weeks. Patients were evaluated for efficacy (intent-to-treat) and safety. Only patients with proven grass pollen allergy (dermal and conjunctival allergen challenge tests) were selected; all patients were studied during the same period, historically shown to be grass season; and grass pollen counts were obtained.

Results

A total of 131 patients (64 olopatadine; 67 placebo) were assessed for efficacy (intent-to-treat); 132 patients were assessed for safety. The mean (SD) age of participants was 38.53 (11.61) years (range, 18 to 87 years), and 58.0% were women (76/131), with no significant differences between groups for age or sex. In the olopatadine group, 1.6% of patients were black (1/64), compared with 14.9% of the placebo group (10/67) (P = 0.005). Mean scores of ocular itching and hyperemia were lower at all assessment times with olopatadine than placebo. The difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) for itching on days 7, 14, 35, 63, and 70, and for hyperemia on days 14, 28, 42, and 63, after correction for multiplicity. Linear regression slopes predicting ocular itching and hyperemia from the pollen count were significantly lower (P < 0.003 and P < 0.035, respectively) with olopatadine than with placebo. Similar results were obtained for rhinorrhea, sneezing, and nasal itching (P < 0.006, P < 0.012, and P < 0.034, respectively). With placebo, the proportion of patients with frequent ocular itching and hyperemia increased as a function of pollen level; however, with olopatadine, the proportions remained low and virtually constant.

Conclusion

In the population studied, olopatadine 0.1% ophthalmic solution controlled ocular and nasal symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis and rhinocojunctivitis and was well tolerated when administered twice daily for 10 weeks.

### Management of ocular allergy itch with an antihistamine-releasing contact lens [^b1eb17f3]. Cornea (2019). Medium credibility.

Ketotifen exhibits a unique spectrum of activity among the agents used to treat AC. Like many ocular antihistamines, ketotifen possess both antihistamine and mast-cell stabilizing properties; it is a high-affinity antagonist of H 1 receptorswhich acts both as a competitive inhibitor of histamine and as an inhibitor of histamine release. In addition, ketotifen has been shown to attenuate accumulation of mast cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils at the sites of allergen deposition. This action prevents the initiation of more chronic allergic responses and contributes to the efficacy of ketotifen in the treatment of AC.

Topical treatments for ocular disease provide significant pharmacological advantages, particularly in terms of delivery of the therapeutic at the site of action and minimization of systemic exposure. Despite this, topicals are limited by a number of factors: tear film turnover is high (limiting exposure time), and accurate, reproducible instillation of drops is a challenge for many patients. Use of CLs as a vehicle for the delivery of therapeutic agents to the ocular surface may be a solution to these issues for lens users dealing with allergiesor other conditions, including glaucoma, ocular infection, or ocular trauma.

In this report, we describe the use of a CL-based delivery modality for ketotifen therapy of AC. The studies employed the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC; Ora, Inc, Andover, MA) model to measure the lens/ketotifen combination efficacy. The CAC model provides a controlled alternative to traditional environmental allergy trials and allows for reproducible allergic responses that can be used as a reliable test of antiallergic efficacy. In this method, a reproducible allergic response to a quantified, instilled allergen is established in each subject. In subsequent visits, these challenges are repeated following instillation of test compounds such as antihistamines or steroids. – By varying the time between treatment and challenge, both onset and duration of the therapeutic effects can be quantified. The model has been validated over many trials, and CAC-based studies are an established standard for FDA approval of ophthalmic antiallergicssuch as olopatadine, bepotastine, and alcaftadine.

### A comparison of the efficacy and tolerability of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution and cromolyn sodium 2% ophthalmic solution in seasonal allergic conjunctivitis [^e760432a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Treatments for allergic conjunctivitis have various mechanisms of action. Cromolyn sodium stabilizes conjunctival mast cells by preventing calcium influx across the cell membrane, whereas olopatadine hydrochloride is both an antihistamine and a mast cell stabilizer.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy and tolerability of olopatadine and cromolyn in controlling the ocular signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.

Methods

This was a multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group trial. One group instilled olopatadine 0.1% ophthalmic solution and placebo BID, and the other instilled cromolyn 2% ophthalmic solution QID, both for 6 weeks. The formulation of cromolyn used in this study is currently available only in Europe and Australia.

Results

The intent-to-treat efficacy and safety analyses included 185 patients, 91 in the olopatadine group and 94 in the cromolyn group. At 30 minutes after the first instillation, respective decreases of approximately 30% and approximately 20% were reported in self-rated ocular itching and redness with both treatments; by 4 hours, itching had decreased by approximately 38% in both groups. Differences between treatments were not statistically significant. At 4 hours, redness had decreased by approximately 38% and approximately 26% in the respective treatment groups. By day 42, both treatments had produced significant reductions from baseline in ocular signs and symptoms; however, the reductions in itching and redness were significantly greater with olopatadine compared with cromolyn (both variables, P < 0.05). The difference in physicians' impression of overall improvement on days 30 and 42 significantly favored olopatadine over cromolyn (both days, P < 0.05). Most patients (62.2%) had reacted positively to grass pollen at baseline. The regression slopes correlating itching and redness with pollen count were 5 times lower for olopatadine compared with cromolyn (P = 0.002 and P = 0.016, respectively), indicating that olopatadine's efficacy increased as the pollen count increased.

Conclusions

Six weeks' instillation of olopatadine 0.19% ophthalmic solution BID had a significantly greater effect on the ocular signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis compared with 6 weeks' instillation of cromolyn 2% ophthalmic solution QID. Both treatments were well tolerated by patients in all age groups; however, olopatadine appeared to have better local tolerability in children aged < 11 years.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^a68e656d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Olopatadine HCl 0.77% was also superior to vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% in relieving total redness at onset of action and 24 hours post-dosing. The means for total redness were significantly lower for olopatadine HCl 0.77% versus vehicle at all three post-CAC time points at onset and 24 hours (both P < 0.0001; Figure 4). Similarly, olopatadine HCl 0.77% was superior to olopatadine 0.2% in relieving total redness at onset of action (P < 0.0001) and 24 hours post-dosing (P = 0.0036; Figure 4).

The observed proportions of ocular itching responders for olopatadine HCl 0.77%, olopatadine 0.2%, and vehicle were 73.2%, 69.1%, and 11.1%, respectively, at onset of action and 45.7%, 28.5%, and 2.6%, respectively, at 24 hours post-dosing. At onset of action, the proportion of ocular itching responders with olopatadine HCl 0.77% was 62.06% higher than vehicle (P < 0.0001) and 4.08% higher than olopatadine 0.2% (P = 0.4142; Figure 5). At 24 hours, the proportion of ocular itching responders with olopatadine HCl 0.77% was 43.17% higher than vehicle (P < 0.0001) and 17.25% higher compared with olopatadine 0.2% (P = 0.0012; Figure 5).

In this pooled analysis, the differences in means for the additional signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis favored olopatadine HCl 0.77% over vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% at onset of action and 24-hour duration of action (Table 2). The differences in means for ciliary redness, episcleral redness, chemosis, eye lid swelling, and tearing between olopatadine 0.77% and vehicle were significant (P < 0.05) at all three post-CAC time points (7, 15, and 20 minutes; Table 2).

### Evaluation of the efficacy of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution and azelastine hydrochloride 0.05% ophthalmic solution in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^355211fd]. Clinical Therapeutics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution and azelastine hydrochlofide 0.05% ophthalmic solution are 2 topical antiallergic agents indicated for the treatment of itching of the eye associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Olopatadine has recently received US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for an expanded indication for the treatment of signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, including itching, tearing, eyelid swelling, redness, and chemosis.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of olopatadine hydrochloride versus azelastine hydrochloride and placebo (artificial tears) in the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, double-masked, contralaterally controlled, multicenter, allergen-challenge study. Itching was chosen as the primary efficacy variable since it is the only FDA-approved indication these 2 agents have in common. Subjects with a history of allergic conjunctivitis who responded to the CAC at screening visits 1 and 2 were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: olopatadine in 1 eye and azelastine in the other eye; olopatadine in 1 eye and placebo in the other eye; or azelastine in 1 eye and placebo in the other eye. At the assessment visit (visit 3), subjects received masked study medication according to the randomization scheme. After 5 minutes, subjects were bilaterally challenged with the allergen concentration that had elicited a positive conjunctival allergic response at visits 1 and 2. Immediately after challenge, subjects gave itching assessments (scale, 0 = no itching to 4 = severe itching) every 30 seconds for a total period of 20 minutes. Mean itching scores for all eyes were compared by treatment. Mean itching scores at each time point were compared between treatments using 2 sample t tests.

Results

Of the 180 subjects screened, 111 responded to the CAC at visits 1 and 2 and completed the study; 65% (72/111) of patients were female, 87% (97/111) were white, and 49% (54/111) had brown irides. The mean age was approximately 40 years. Seventy-three eyes were treated with olopatadine, 75 with azelastine, and 74 with placebo. A single dose of 1 of the 3 study medications per eye was well tolerated by all subjects. Both treatments were significantly more effective than placebo at reducing itching postchallenge. Olopatadine was significantly more effective than azelastine in reducing itching at 3.5 minutes through 20 minutes postchallenge (average mean unit difference of -0.31; P < 0.05) in the CAC model.

Conclusion

In this population, olopatadine was significantly more effective than azelastine in the management of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis in the CAC model.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^7bbaa20b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Results

Study population

A total of 202 patients were randomized in the study between December 2011 and March 2012; all were available for the safety analysis. Two patients discontinued after randomization but before the scheduled CAC; therefore, 200 patients were available for the intent-to-treat efficacy analysis.

Reasons for study discontinuation were similar across treatment groups, with 16 patients discontinuing the study early after visit 3A (Figure 1). Patient demographic and baseline characteristics were similar across treatment groups, except that different proportions of participants were allergic to different types of allergens causing allergic conjunctivitis (Table 1).

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^608335ab]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

As previously mentioned, the ocular symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis can affect the quality of life of patients. Olopatadine 0.77% fulfills the need for a treatment that provides full symptom relief over the duration of an entire 24-hour day. The present study has shown that olopatadine 0.77% is superior to its vehicle for the treatment of ocular itching at the onset of action (immediately after dosing), as well as having a lasting duration of action for 24 hours. Olopatadine 0.77% is also superior to its vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of conjunctival and total redness at onset of action and for up to 24 hours. These results showed that the relief from ocular itching provided by olopatadine 0.77% was highly consistent, and was maintained over 24 hours. Furthermore, olopatadine 0.77% showed reduced chemosis and tearing compared with its vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% at onset of action and for up to 24 hours. These findings are important, because allergen concentrations vary throughout the 24-hour day–night cycle, peaking at different times depending on the allergen and local environmental conditions.

### Pharmacokinetics and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in healthy subjects with asymptomatic eyes: data from 2 independent clinical studies [^fd158ca4]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ocular allergy includes a spectrum of disorders, such as seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, perennial allergic conjunctivitis, vernal keratoconjunctivitis, and atopic keratoconjunctivitis. Seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis, collectively known as allergic conjunctivitis, are the most common forms of ocular allergy, caused by immunoglobulin E-mediated reaction to allergens.–The overall prevalence of ocular allergy is reported to be ~15%–25% in the USA. Although not life threatening, symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, such as ocular itching, redness, eyelid swelling, chemosis, and tearing, significantly impact quality of life, particularly in the pediatric population. Therefore, multiple pathways need to be targeted to effectively alleviate these symptoms.–

Unlike other topical ocular medications available for the management of allergic conjunctivitis, olopatadine hydrochloride (HCl) ophthalmic solution acts through multiple pathways. Olopatadine is a selective antagonist of histamine H1 receptors as well as a mast cell stabilizer and prevents histamine-induced inflammatory cytokine production by conjunctival epithelial cells. In several clinical studies, olopatadine has consistently been shown to be well tolerated and an effective medication for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.–Olopatadine 0.1% and 0.2% (marketed as PATANOL ® and PATADAY ®, respectively, in the USA, by Alcon Research Ltd.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^b1132668]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Frequently associated with allergic rhinitis, allergic conjunctivitis is the most common form of ocular allergy, resulting in a condition better known as "allergic rhinoconjunctivitis". Itchy eyes and nasal congestion are the main symptoms, often accompanied by irritability and fatigue. Despite the efficacy of the current available products to treat allergic conjunctivitis, patients experiencing incomplete symptom relief are likely to benefit from using a product that provides symptom relief over the course of an entire day with the convenience of once-daily dosing.

Allergic conjunctivitis occurs when allergens such as grass or ragweed pollen, dust mites, and animal dander cause an immune reaction in the eye mediated by IgE. A cascade of events leads to mast-cell degranulation and release of histamine and other proinflammatory mediators at the site of allergen invasion. The inflammatory reaction results in vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, leukocyte chemotaxis, and emigration of inflammatory cells into the surrounding tissue spaces, thus causing ocular inflammation, ocular itching, redness, tearing, swelling of the conjunctiva (chemosis), and eyelid swelling. Ocular symptoms in particular – itchy eyes, puffers, and watering – can have a significant impact on patients' daily activities, leading to poorer quality of life and increased resource utilization, irrespective of the severity of nasal symptoms.

The prevalence of allergic conjunctivitis is difficult to ascertain; however, 30% of the US population report nasal and ocular symptoms for at least 1 week of the year, and approximately 70%–80% of seasonal allergic patients have severe ocular symptoms. An estimated 14% of the US population are thought to suffer from allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, and 15%–20% of the Japanese population are thought to suffer from allergic conjunctival diseases.

Available treatment options for the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis include antihistamines, mast-cell stabilizers, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Among antihistaminic drugs, olopatadine is a selective antagonist of histamine H 1 receptors, causing mast-cell stabilization and prevention of histamine-induced inflammatory cytokine production. Olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solutions at concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2% (Patanol ® and Pataday ®, respectively; Alcon Research Ltd, Fort Worth, TX, USA) are effective for the management of allergic conjunctivitis, including reducing ocular itching.–

### Comparison of the clinical efficacy and comfort of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution and nedocromil sodium 2% ophthalmic solution in the human conjunctival allergen challenge model [^13ec9828]. Clinical Therapeutics (2000). Low credibility.

Background

Mast cell stabilizers, such as the ocular antiallergic agent nedocromil sodium 2% ophthalmic solution, are not rapid acting and often require a loading period of ≥ 2 weeks for maximal efficacy. Olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution is a member of a new class of topical antiallergic agents that have combined antihistaminic and mast cell-stabilizing properties.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the clinical efficacy and comfort of olopatadine with those of nedocromil in the conjunctival allergen challenge model.

Methods

This was a single-center, 3-visit, randomized, double-masked, contralaterally controlled study. Seventy-five subjects with a history of allergic conjunctivitis were screened, and the 52 who responded to conjunctival allergen challenge at visits I and 2 were randomized by eye to receive olopatadine, nedocromil, or placebo (a "natural tears" lubricant eye drop). Because nedocromil may require a 2-week loading period for maximal efficacy, the eyes assigned to that agent received nedocromil for 14 days (between visits 2 and 3), whereas the eyes assigned to olopatadine or placebo received placebo during this period. Throughout the loading phase, subjects instilled 1 drop of the assigned masked medication in each eye twice daily. At the assessment visit (visit 3), subjects received I drop of masked olopatadine, nedocromil, or placebo in each eye and were asked to rate the comfort of each drop on a scale from 0 to 8. Fifteen minutes after instillation of medication, subjects were challenged with the allergen concentration that had elicited a positive conjunctival allergic response at the previous visits. Subjects then scored their itching on a scale from 0 to 4 at 3, 5, and 10 minutes after challenge. Mean itching scores for all eyes were compared by treatment. Paired t tests were performed on the mean itching and ocular comfort scores at each time point. At the end of the study, subjects were asked which treatment they preferred in terms of comfort and efficacy.

Results

Forty-nine subjects completed the study. Forty eyes received olopatadine, 36 received nedocromil, and 22 received placebo. Olopatadine was clinically and statistically superior to nedocromil at reducing itching in the conjunctival allergen challenge model (mean unit difference: -1.60 at 3 minutes, -1.68 at 5 minutes, -1.19 at 10 minutes; P < 0.001). One drop of olopatadine was more efficacious than 29 drops of nedocromil. Olopatadine-treated eyes were rated as being significantly more comfortable than nedocromil-treated eyes (0.73 vs 1.55; P = 0.034). Of the 14 subjects treated with olopatadine and nedocromil who stated a preference, 10 (71%) were more satisfied with olopatadine than with nedocromil.

Conclusion

In the conjunctival allergen challenge model, olopatadine was more efficacious and comfortable than nedocromil in reducing the itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^baafe54f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Efficacy analysis

Olopatadine 0.77% was significantly better (P < 0.001) than vehicle in reducing ocular itching, as shown by the treatment difference in means at all three post-CAC time points (3, 5, and 7 minutes) at onset of action and at 16- and 24-hour duration of action (P < 0.001 for all, Figure 2A). Clinical relevance is considered by the FDA as a mean difference of 1 unit or greater from vehicle in a CAC study. The difference in means was greater than 1 unit at all post-CAC time points for onset of action and 16- and 24-hour duration of action. Also, olopatadine 0.77% was superior to olopatadine 0.2% for ocular itching at all three post-CAC time points at 24 hours after dosing (P < 0.05). The treatment effect of olopatadine 0.77% in reducing ocular itching was maintained consistently from immediately after dosing through 24 hours after dosing.

For conjunctival redness, olopatadine 0.77% was significantly better versus vehicle at all three post-CAC time points at onset of action and at 16- and 24-hour assessments (P < 0.01 for all, Figure 2B). The difference in means was greater than 1 unit at all post-CAC time points for onset of action, but was less than 1 unit at all post-CAC time points for 16- and 24-hour duration of action. Olopatadine 0.77% was also superior to olopatadine 0.2% at treating conjunctival redness at all three post-CAC time points at 24 hours after dosing (P < 0.05). Similar results were obtained for total redness (P < 0.05). Lower scores at all post-CAC time points at onset of action and 16- and 24-hour assessments were also seen with olopatadine 0.77% versus vehicle for ciliary, episcleral, and total redness.

A reduced mean score for chemosis was observed for olopatadine 0.77% compared with its vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% at 7, 15, and 20 minutes after CAC at onset of action, and at 16, and 24 hour assessments (Figure 3A). Similar results were obtained for tearing (Figure 3B).

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^8adf6571]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis, caused by immunoglobulin E-mediated inflammatory reaction to an allergen, is the most common form of ocular allergy. Several epidemiological reports estimate its prevalence ranging from 15% to 20% worldwide, depending on the geographic location and patients' age. According to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III data, annually, ~40% of the population in the US has at least one occurrence of ocular symptoms indicative of allergic conjunctivitis, with the most common being ocular itching, redness, eyelid swelling, chemosis, and tearing. Several treatment options with different mechanisms of action are available for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Olopatadine, an antiallergic agent, exhibits its effects through selective antagonism of histamine H1 receptors, mast cell stabilization, and prevention of histamine-induced inflammatory cytokine production.–

Olopatadine HCl ophthalmic solution at concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2% (Patanol ® and Pataday ®, respectively; Alcon Research Ltd, Fort Worth, TX, USA) has been approved for the management of allergic conjunctivitis in over 100 countries, including the US and Canada, as twice-daily and once-daily treatments, respectively. Once-daily doses of olopatadine 0.2% and alcaftadine 0.25% reduce signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis for no more than 16 hours.

Despite the efficacy of available formulations of olopatadine and other topical ocular antiallergy treatments, there is a need for products that address the incomplete symptom relief and/or provide longer duration of symptom relief such that it lasts for at least 24 hours between two consecutive doses with once-daily administration.

### Treatment of allergic conjunctivitis with olopatadine hydrochloride eye drops [^a39fbb81]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Olopatadine hydrochloride exerts a wide range of pharmacological actions such as histamine H(1) receptor antagonist action, chemical mediator suppressive action, and eosinophil infiltration suppressive action. Olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution (Patanol((R))) was introduced to the market in Japan in October 2006. In a conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) test, olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution significantly suppressed ocular itching and hyperemia compared with levocabastine hydrochloride 0.05% ophthalmic solution, and the number of patients who complained of ocular discomfort was lower in the olopatadine group than in the levocabastine group. Conjunctival cell membrane disruption was observed in vitro in the ketotifen fumarate group, epinastine hydrochloride group, and azelastine hydrochloride group, but not in the olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution group, which may potentially explain the lower discomfort felt by patients on instillation. Many other studies in humans have revealed the superiority of olopatadine 0.1% hydrochloride eye drops to several other anti-allergic eye drops. Overseas, olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2% ophthalmic solution for a once-daily regimen has been marketed under the brand name of Pataday((R)). It is expected that olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solutions may be used in patients with a more severe spectrum of allergic conjunctival diseases, such as vernal keratoconjunctivitis or atopic keratoconjunctivitis, in the near future.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^9539393b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Study objectives and outcome measures

The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of olopatadine 0.77% compared with its vehicle for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis using the CAC immediately after dosing for onset of action and 16 hours after dosing to determine the duration of action.

Secondary objectives were to demonstrate the superiority of olopatadine 0.77% compared with its vehicle for the treatment of conjunctival redness following a CAC immediately after dosing for onset of action and 16 hours after dosing (16-hour duration of action). Superiority of olopatadine 0.77% compared with olopatadine 0.2% was also assessed for the treatment of total redness, ocular itching, and conjunctival redness following a CAC 24 hours after dosing. Chemosis and tearing scores at the postchallenge time points were assessed for onset of action and 16 and 24 hours after dosing for duration of action.

Efficacy variables

Patients were asked to evaluate on a scale from 0 to 4 (using Ora proprietary scales) ocular itching (0 = none, 4 = incapacitating itch, 0.5-unit increments) and tearing (0 = none, 4 = very severe, 1-unit increments). The investigator evaluated ciliary, conjunctival, and episcleral redness (each on a 0–4 scale by 0.5-unit increments; 0 = none, 4 = extremely severe), and chemosis (0 = none, 4 = severe, 0.5-unit increments).

Pre-CAC assessments of all mentioned ocular allergic signs and symptoms were conducted before dosing at visits 3A, 4A, and 5. Ocular itching was assessed at 3, 5, and 7 minutes post-CAC at visits 3B (24 hours after visit 3A), 4B (16 hours after visit 4A), and 5. Conjunctival, ciliary, and episcleral redness, chemosis, and tearing assessments were conducted at 7, 15, and 20 minutes post-CAC at visits 3B, 4B, and 5. Total redness score, ranging from 0 to 12, was the sum of conjunctival, ciliary, and episcleral redness scores.

Safety variables

The safety of olopatadine 0.77% was assessed on the basis of the following parameters: best-corrected visual acuity, slit-lamp examination, intraocular pressure, dilated fundus examination, and all treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs).

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^cfb96481]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

The aqueous solubility of olopatadine at neutral pH is a limiting factor in formulating olopatadine-containing ophthalmic solutions. This new formulation allows olopatadine to remain dissolved in a stable solution at a free base concentration of 0.7%. This improves the concentration of drug in the ocular tissue upon instillation (C max and area under the curve of olopatadine in the conjunctiva), thereby increasing the magnitude of effect and duration of action in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Olopatadine HCl 0.77% has shown long-lasting efficacy for a minimum of 24 hours post-dose in relieving ocular itch associated with allergic conjunctivitis. When dosed in the morning, this 24-hour duration of efficacy offers a lasting, clinically relevant benefit to patients throughout the day and night. This ensures complete coverage between two consecutive doses of medication administered 24 hours apart.

Results from the supportive pooled efficacy analyses have demonstrated superiority of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of ocular redness (both conjunctival and total redness) at onset and after 24 hours. These findings are consistent with the outcomes observed in the individual CAC studies. The benefit of a higher concentration of olopatadine was demonstrated by an increase in the proportion of itching responders at 24 hours (~17% greater) compared with olopatadine 0.2%, which was evident because of the 24-hour-lasting efficacy of olopatadine HCl 0.77%, unlike olopatadine 0.2% (16 hours), and the concentration differences. This suggests the beneficial effect of olopatadine HCl 0.77% in providing longer duration of action than olopatadine 0.2%, without losing its potent onset of action.

### Olopatadine hydrochloride (Patanol) [^4d5e9a30]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Olopatadine is an inhibitor of the release of histamine from the
mast cell and a relatively selective histamine H1-antagonist that inhibits the in vivo and in vitro type 1 immediate hypersensitivity
reaction including inhibition of histamine induced effects on human conjunctival
epithelial cells. Olopatadine is devoid of effects on alpha-adrenergic,
dopamine, and muscarinic type 1 and 2 receptors. Following topical ocular
administration in man, olopatadine was shown to have low systemic exposure. Two
studies in normal volunteers (totaling 24 subjects) dosed bilaterally with
olopatadine 0.15% ophthalmic solution once every 12 hours for 2 weeks
demonstrated plasma concentrations to be generally below the quantitation limit
of the assay (< 0.5 ng/mL). Samples in which olopatadine was quantifiable were
typically found within 2 hours of dosing and ranged from 0.5 to 1.3 ng/mL. The
half-life in plasma was approximately 3 hours, and elimination was predominantly
through renal excretion. Approximately 60–70% of the dose was recovered in the
urine as parent drug. Two metabolites, the mono-desmethyl and the N-oxide, were
detected at low concentrations in the urine.

Results from an environmental study demonstrated that PATANOL was effective
in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis when dosed
twice daily for up to 6 weeks. Results from conjunctival antigen challenge
studies demonstrated that PATANOL, when subjects were challenged with antigen
both initially and up to 8 hours after dosing, was significantly more effective
than its vehicle in preventing ocular itching associated with allergic
conjunctivitis.

### Bioequivalence of two formulations of ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution: a single-center, randomized, double-masked conjunctival allergen challenge investigation in allergic conjunctivitis [^0bfe5541]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.025% (reference formulation), a topical mast cell stabilizer/antihistamine combination, has been found to be effective and well tolerated in the prevention of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis (AC). A recently developed formulation of ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.025% (test formulation) contains the same active ingredient in the same concentration as the reference formulation, is intended for twice-daily dosing, and may provide a treatment option in patients with AC.

Objective

The aim of this study was to determine the clinical bioequivalence of the test and reference formulations using a conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.

Methods

This prospective, randomized, double-masked, active- and placebo-controlled CAC study was conducted in a clinical setting (ORA Clinical Research and Development, North Andover, Massachusetts). Patients aged < 18 years who had AC, a successful allergen challenge during screening and allergen confirmation visits, a history of ocular allergies, and positive skin-test reactivity were enrolled. Patients' eyes were randomized to receive the test or reference formulation or inactive vehicle (1 drop of 1 study medication per eye per visit). The primary efficacy end point was ocular itching, and the secondary end points were ocular redness, chemosis, lid swelling, tearing, and mucous discharge. Efficacy was assessed following challenge at 8 hours and 15 minutes after instillation. The test and reference formulations were considered bioequivalent if the 95% CIs for the differences in mean ocular itching scores between the 2 groups were within the range of 0.40 to 0.40.

Results

There were 108 patients enrolled (61 men, 47 women; mean age, 42 years; 91.7% white). The test and reference formulations both yielded clinically significant results compared with placebo in the prevention of ocular itching at CACs performed 8 hours and 15 minutes after instillation. At the 8-hour posttreatment CAC, the mean ocular itching scores for test formulation-treated eyes were 1.158, 1.265, and 1.305 units lower, respectively, than for eyes at 3, 5, and 7 minutes that were administered placebo. At 15-minute posttreatment CAC, the mean ocular itching scores for reference formulation-treated eyes at 3, 5, and 7 minutes were 1.481, 1.622, and 1.565 units lower, respectively, than for eyes that were administered placebo. With regard to the primary and secondary efficacy variables, no statistically significant differences were observed between test and reference formulations at any post-CAC time point.

Conclusions

In this population of patients with AC, the test formulation of ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution 0.025% met criteria for bioequivalence to the reference formulation, as established by the protocol. The test and reference formulations were well tolerated in the population studied.

### Comparison of ketotifen fumarate ophthalmic solution alone, desloratadine alone, and their combination for inhibition of the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in the conjunctival allergen challenge model: a double-masked, placebo-and active-controlled trial [^ee484609]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Ketotifen fumarate is a topical antiallergic combination mast-cell stabilizer and antihistamine indicated for the temporary prevention of ocular itching due to allergic conjunctivitis. Desloratadine is a systemic antihistamine indicated for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of ketotifen 0.025% ophthalmic solution instilled in the eye, desloratadine 5-mg tablets taken orally, and their combination for prevention of the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, as induced by the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-masked, placebo- and active-controlled, single-center clinical trial. At visit l, the dose of allergen necessary to elicit a qualifying allergic reaction was determined for subjects meeting the entry criteria. At visit 2, the allergen dose determined at visit 1 was confirmed, and all subjects who had a qualifying ocular and nasal allergic reaction were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: ketotifen ophthalmic solution and placebo tablet, desloratadine tablet and placebo eyedrop, or ketotifen and desloratadine. Subjects were instructed to instill 1 drop into each eye twice daily and take 1 tablet with water once daily at the same time as the morning eyedrop for approximately 4 weeks. At visit 3, subjects brought in their medication and were given 1 drop of the eyedrop bilaterally and 1 tablet with water. Bilateral CAC was performed 2 hours after administration of medication. Using standardized scales, subjects rated ocular itching at 3, 5, and 7 minutes after CAC; ocular tearing and eyelid swelling at 10, 15, and 20 minutes after CAC; and nasal signs and symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea and postnasal drip, pruritus, and nasal congestion) at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 minutes after CAC. The investigator graded ocular redness and chemosis at 10, 15, and 20 minutes after CAC. At all visits, subjects were offered an anti-allergy eyedrop to relieve any immediate ocular discomfort caused by CAC.

Results

One hundred two subjects were screened-82 (55 women, 27 men; mean age, 42.8 years [range, 21–70 years]) were randomized to treatment, and 80 completed the study. Subjects in the group that received ketotifen (n = 27) and the group that received ketotifen with desloratadine (n = 26) had significantly lower mean itching scores compared with those in the group that received desloratadine alone (n = 27) at all time points (P ≤ 0.05). Total ocular redness, calculated by summing the mean redness scores for each of the 3 vessel beds, was significantly lower in the ketotifen group than in the other treatment groups at most time points (P ≤ 0.05). All treatments attenuated nasal symptoms; no statistically significant differences were noted between treatment groups, with the exception of the 50-minute time point, at which combination treatment was significantly more effective than ketotifen alone (P ≤ 0.05). The proportion of subjects who requested relief drops after CAC was significantly lower in both the ketotifen alone and combination treatment groups compared with the desloratadine alone group (P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Ketotifen ophthalmic solution significantly decreased the signs and symptoms of ocular and nasal allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. The addition of ketotifen to the oral desloratadine regimen improved the overall antiallergic efficacy of both medications.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^3c791fa9]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

In addition, olopatadine HCl 0.77% had lower mean scores compared with vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for all other measured signs and symptoms post-CAC at onset of action and 24-hour duration of action. This data support the overall benefit of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over olopatadine 0.2% in relieving signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis, lasting for 24 hours. The similarities in study population and study design justify this pooled analysis, and the consistency of the results across multiple measures supports the overall benefit of olopatadine HCl 0.77% over olopatadine 0.2% in relieving signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis lasting for 24 hours.

No serious AEs were reported with olopatadine HCl 0.77% regardless of the treatment duration (onset of action and 24 hours). Overall, the safety profile of olopatadine HCl 0.77% was comparable to the vehicle and the well-established safety profile of olopatadine 0.2%.

### Olopatadine ophthalmic solution adjunctive to loratadine compared with loratadine alone in patients with active seasonal allergic conjunctivitis symptoms [^56df4073]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Olopatadine ophthalmic solution 0.1% (Patanol, Alcon Laboratories, Fort Woth, TX) is approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Loratadine 10 mg (Claritin, Schering-Plough, Madison, NJ) is a nonsedating oral antihistamine approved for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of olopatadine used adjunctively with loratadine versus loratadine alone in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.

Methods

This three-center, observer-masked, treatment-controlled, randomized, parallel-group study involved patients aged 7 to 74 years with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Patients were treated for 7 days with either olopatadine twice daily adjunctive to loratadine once daily or only loratadine once daily. Efficacy variables (ocular itching and redness, physician's impression, patient's impression, patient diary ratings of ocular redness and itching), and safety parameters were evaluated during the screening visit and on days 0, 3, and 7. Patients completed the rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire on days 0 and 7.

Results

Ninety-four patients received study drug. Patients receiving olopatadine twice daily in addition to loratadine once daily exhibited less ocular itching (P = 0.0436) and rated their ocular condition as more improved compared with those receiving loratadine alone (P < 0.0022). Twenty minutes after initial dosing, olopatadine plus loratadine relieved ocular itching and redness significantly better than loratadine alone (P = 0.001). Both treatment groups showed clinically meaningful improvements in overall quality of life in all but one of the rhinoconjunctivitis quality of life questionnaire domains. Overall, and in most domains, olopatadine plus loratadine also provided significantly better (P < 0.05) quality of life than loratadine alone at day 7.

Conclusions

Compared with loratadine alone, olopatadine adjunctive to loratadine provides greater relief of ocular itching and redness, a better quality of life, and is well tolerated in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis.

Patients and methods

Study design

This Phase III, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, vehicle- and active-controlled CAC trial was conducted under a common protocol at three investigational sites in the US. The study assessed the efficacy and safety of olopatadine 0.77% compared with its vehicle and olopatadine 0.2%. One dose (one drop in each eye) of the assigned test article was administered 27 minutes, 16, or 24 hours prior to a CAC test and allergic sign and symptom assessments. These dosing and CAC test visits occurred over a 3-week period after subject eligibility and randomization. Efficacy and safety were assessed using the CAC model (Ora-CAC ®; Ora Inc, Andover, MA, USA). In the CAC model, allergens are directly applied into the eye under controlled conditions to allow observations of acute allergic changes. The CAC model includes a titration visit to determine the allergen and its dose that elicits a positive clinical response, and a confirmation visit to confirm the reproducibility of the response using the same allergen and dose that elicited the positive clinical response at the titration visit. The efficacy of the study drug is then tested at visits that comprise instillation of the study drug, followed by CAC and measurement of signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

### Comparison of the clinical efficacy and tolerability of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution and loteprednol etabonate 0.2% ophthalmic suspension in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^55ef6490]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution and loteprednol etabonate 0.2% ophthalmic suspension are topical antiallergic agents indicated for treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis and seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), respectively.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of olopatadine, loteprednol, and placebo in inhibiting the early-phase allergic reaction (within 30 minutes) after conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC).

Methods

This was a single-center, randomized, double-masked, parallel-controlled CAC study. It consisted of 3 visits, with CAC performed at visit 1, confirmation and randomization at visit 2, and evaluation of the treatments at visit 3. Subjects with a history of allergic conjunctivitis were randomized to receive olopatadine, loteprednol, or placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio. Because loteprednol requires a loading period to achieve maximum efficacy, subjects assigned to this treatment received loteprednol QID bilaterally for a 14-day period; the olopatadine and placebo groups received placebo QID bilaterally during this period. At the evaluation visit, subjects received 1 drop of the assigned treatment in each eye. Fifteen minutes later, they were challenged with allergen. Subjects evaluated itching at 3, 5, and 10 minutes after challenge using a standardized 5-point scale; the investigator evaluated redness at 10, 15, and 20 minutes after challenge. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was measured at baseline and after the 14-day loading period. Nonparametric analyses were performed on the change from visit 2 to visit 3 in mean itching and redness scores for each time point, and on the change in mean IOP from visit 1 to visit 3.

Results

Fifty subjects (86% white; 42% male, 58% female; age range, 21–71 years) were enrolled and completed the study (20 olopatadine, 20 loteprednol, 10 placebo). The allergens to which subjects reacted were ragweed pollen (40%), cat hair or dander (30%), grass pollen (24%), and tree pollen (6%). The difference in inhibition of itching and redness was clinically significant (≥ 1 unit difference) and statistically significant (P < 0.05) in favor of olopatadine compared with loteprednol at all 3 time points. The loteprednol group had a statistically significant increase in IOP after 2 weeks of treatment (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

In the population studied, olopatadine was more efficacious than loteprednol in reducing the acute signs and symptoms of SAC during the early phase of the ocular allergic reaction and appeared to be better tolerated.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^045de1e7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

As with all clinical trials, this study has some limitations. A drawback of the CAC model as implemented in this study was that neither the late-phase response nor quality-of-life outcomes were tested. Additional studies using a modified version of the CAC model could assess efficacy of treatment against a late-phase response. Also, slightly more patients reactive to seasonal allergens (ragweed, grass, and trees) than to perennial allergens (dust mite, cat dander, and dog dander) were observed in the olopatadine 0.77%-treatment group than the olopatadine 0.2% or vehicle groups. However, each randomized patient had to meet a positive bilateral CAC response at screening visits 1 and 2, as described in the "Patients and methods" section, in order to be eligible for the study. Therefore, regardless of the specific type of allergen, all randomized patients met the minimum itching and redness criteria and were randomized to study treatment at visit 3A only after all entry criteria were met. Therefore, this slight difference in distribution of seasonal and perennial allergens was not considered significant in affecting the outcome of the study.

In conclusion, olopatadine 0.77% is superior to both its vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of allergen-mediated ocular itching and conjunctival redness. The relief from ocular itching provided by olopatadine 0.77% is maintained throughout a period of 24 hours, as assessed by the CAC model, supporting once-daily dosing of olopatadine 0.77% in the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis. This study showed that the benefit–risk profile for olopatadine 0.77% is superior to olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis-associated ocular itching when both are dosed once daily.

### Effect of alcaftadine 0.25% on ocular itch associated with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis: a pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized clinical trials [^cdda6140]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

After all evaluations were completed at the end of each visit, the use of over-the-counter antiallergy eye drop Visine-A ® was permitted. Systemic and/or topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, aspirin or aspirin-containing products, prescription, over-the-counter or homeopathic antiallergy therapies (including over-the-counter sleeping aids that contain an antihistamine and all antihistamines), all other topical ophthalmic preparations (including tear substitutes), and H 1 antagonist antihistamines/mast cell stabilizers (ie, olopatadine) were not permitted up to 72 hours prior to the start of the study or during the course of the study. Systemic and/or topical corticosteroids were not permitted up to 14 days prior to the start of the study or during the course of the study.

Efficacy and safety endpoints

The primary efficacy measure was ocular itching, 16 hours after instillation of study medication, evaluated by the subject at 3 minutes post-CAC (primary endpoint) and at 5 and 7 minutes post-CAC (secondary endpoints). For safety assessment, the incidence of adverse events was monitored and the severity and relationship to the study drug was determined by the Investigator. Adverse events were coded to system organ class and preferred terms using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, version 13.1.

### Pooled analysis of two studies evaluating efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^7697238c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Patients

The study eligibility criteria were similar in both studies. Key inclusion criteria were that patients must be aged ≥ 18 years with a history of seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis for at least 1 year prior to Visit 1 and have had a diagnostic skin test indicative of allergy for seasonal or perennial allergens within 24 months of Visit 1. Patients had to be willing to discontinue wearing contact lenses for ≥ 72 hours prior to the first study visit and throughout the study.

Enrolled patients had a positive bilateral CAC response to allergen at Visits 1 and 2. At Visit 1, a positive CAC response was defined as a score, in each eye, of ≥ 2 for itching and ≥ 2 for redness in two of the three vessel beds within 10 minutes of the last titration challenge. At Visit 2, a positive bilateral CAC response was defined as a score, in each eye, of ≥ 2 for itching and ≥ 2 for redness in two of the three vessel beds in at least two of the three post-CAC time points. Patients who had participated in any previous clinical trials with olopatadine HCl solution 0.77% were excluded from this study.

Study treatment

In one CAC study, patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive one drop per eye of olopatadine HCl 0.77%, olopatadine HCl 0.2%, or vehicle at Visits 3A (Day 0), 4A (Day 14 ± 2), and 5 (Day 21 ± 3) prior to CAC and at Visits 3B (24 hours after Visit 3A), 4B (16 hours after Visit 4A), and 5 (27 minutes after treatment instillation).

In the other CAC study, patients were randomized (2:2:2:1) to receive one drop per eye of olopatadine HCl 0.77%, olopatadine HCl 0.2%, olopatadine HCl 0.1%, or vehicle at Visits 3A (Day 0) and 4 (Day 14 ± 2) prior to CAC at 27 minutes (± 1 minute) posttreatment.

### Randomized, double-masked comparison of olopatadine ophthalmic solution, mometasone furoate monohydrate nasal spray, and fexofenadine hydrochloride tablets using the conjunctival and nasal allergen challenge models [^49603bb4]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

It is presumed that exposure to allergens in the environment occurs through both the eyes and the nose. Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is typically treated with a nasal spray or systemic antihistamine, neither of which may provide adequate relief of the ocular component of the disease.

Objective

This study was designed to gain a better understanding of the physiologic interaction between the conjunctival and nasal mucosa and thus help establish a profile for the most effective ocular treatment in patients whose allergies have both an ocular and a nasal component.

Methods

This was a single-center, randomized, double-masked clinical study using the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) and nasal allergen challenge (NAC) models. It compared the clinical signs and symptoms induced by CAC and NAC, the effects of drugs administered by 3 different routes, and the movement of fluorescein after instillation into the eye and nose (Jones test), and assessed levels of of inflammatory mediators in tears and nasal secretions. At visit l, subjects previously identified as CAC responders underwent NAC to determine the dose of allergen necessary to elicit a sufficient positive reaction. At visit 2, which took place 1 week later, subjects with a positive reaction at visit 1 were randomized to group A (CAC) or group B (NAC), and underwent challenge to confirm the allergen dose necessary to produce a positive reaction. Subjects who qualified were randomized to receive 1 of 3 treatments: olopatadine 0.1% ophthalmic solution, placebo nasal spray, and placebo tablets; mometasone furoate monohydrate 50-microg nasal spray, placebo topical solution, and placebo tablets; or fexofenadine hydrochloride 180-mg tablets, placebo topical solution, and placebo nasal spray. All study medications were administered according to their approved labeling: drops were administered twice daily in the eyes, and the nasal sprays and tablets were administered once daily. At visit 3, which took place 1 week after visit 2, subjects received study medication and 15 minutes later underwent CAC or NAC as before. The primary efficacy variables were ocular itching, ocular redness, and overall nasal symptoms (sneezing, rhino rrhea/postnasal drip, nasal pruritus, palatal pruritus, and nasal congestion) rated on standard scales. Peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) was measured at each visit, and the Jones test was performed at visits 1 and 3. At baseline and after challenge at visits 2 and 3, tear and nasal lavage samples were collected from a subset of randomly selected subjects for analysis of eosinophil cationic protein and tryptase.

Results

Seventy-three subjects (42 women, 31 men; mean age, 45.26 years [range, 21–73 years]) were screened, and all were randomized to treatment. Two subjects did not complete the study. CAC induced clinically significant (> 1 unit difference) ocular and nasal signs and symptoms, whereas NAC induced clinically significant nasal signs and symptoms only. In group A, there was a greater reduction in ocular itching with olopatadine compared with mometasone and fexofenadine at 3 minutes (P = 0.003 and P = 0.008, respectively) and 5 minutes (P = 0.007 and P = 0.013) after challenge. Although the difference was not statistically significant, overall relief of conjunctival redness (average of 3 vessel beds) was greatest in the olopatadine group, followed by fexofenadine. In group B, prevention of total nasal symptoms was significantly greater with mometasone compared with fexofenadine at 20 minutes (P = 0.006) and 30 minutes (P = 0.014) after challenge. There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in nasal symptom scores at any time point after CAC. There were also no significant differences in PNIF between treatment groups. Fluorescein was present in nasal secretions within 5 minutes of being instilled into the eye; no fluorescein was detected in the eye after instillation into the nose.

Conclusions

In this study, exposure of the nasal mucosa to allergen resulted in allergic rhinitis, and exposure of the ocular the ocular surface to allergen resulted in conjunctivitis with a secondary effect in the nose. These results suggest movement of allergens, their mediators, and antiallergy drugs from the ocular surfaces into the nasal cavity, with no meaningful movement from the nasal cavity to the ocular surface. In this controlled model, both the systemic agent and the nasal spray failed to control ocular symptoms. The topical ophthalmic solution provided the most effective management of allergic ocular signs and symptoms, and the nasal spray was most effective for nasal symptoms. Combined use of a nasal spray and topical ophthalmic solution may provide maximal relief in patients whose allergies have both ocular and nasal components.

### Comparison of the efficacy of combined fluticasone propionate and olopatadine versus combined fluticasone propionate and fexofenadine for the treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis induced by conjunctival allergen challenge [^4eac846f]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

One approach to treating allergic rhinoconjunctivitis is the concomitant use of an intranasal spray such as fluticasone propionate to alleviate nasal symptoms and a topical or systemic agent to relieve ocular symptoms. It has not yet been determined whether a topical or systemic agent is more effective for the latter purpose.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy of combined use of fluticasone and olopatadine with combined use of fluticasone and fexofenadine in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

Methods

This 2-site, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study employed the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model, a standardized method of inducing ocular and nasal signs and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. At visit 1, subjects underwent CAC to determine the dose of allergen required to elicit a positive reaction. The allergen dose was confirmed at visit 2, and, according to a randomization schedule, subjects were dispensed fluticasone, olopatadine, and placebo pill; fluticasone, fexofenadine, and tear substitute; or placebo nasal spray, placebo pill, and tear substitute. CAC took place at visit 3, after patients had used the assigned medications for 2 weeks. Study medication was instilled 2 hours before CAC, after which allergic signs and symptoms were graded on standardized scales. The primary efficacy variables were ocular itching, ocular redness, and overall nasal symptoms.

Results

Eighty subjects completed the study: 30 received fluticasone and olopatadine, 30 fluticasone and fexofenadine, and 20 placebo. Women constituted 63.8% of the study population and men 36.3%; 91.3% were white, 3.8% black, 2.5% Hispanic, 1.3% Asian, and 1.3% other. Concomitant use of fluticasone and olopatadine produced significantly greater improvements in ocular itching at 3 and 7 minutes after CAC compared with fluticasone and fexofenadine (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in redness scores between groups; however, concomitant use of fluticasone and olopatadine produced significantly greater improvements in redness at 2 time points in each of the 3 vessel beds (ciliary, conjunctival, and episcleral) compared with placebo, and fluticasone and fexofenadine produced significantly greater improvement in redness at 1 time point in I vessel bed compared with placebo (both comparisons, P < 0.05). The 2 treatments had similar effects on total nasal symptom efficacy scores.

Conclusions

In this study, concomitant use of the topical agents fluticasone and olopatadine was more effective than concomitant use of fluticasone plus fexofenadine for overall treatment of the signs and symptoms of induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.

### Efficacy and safety of ketotifen fumarate 0.025% in the conjunctival antigen challenge model of ocular allergic conjunctivitis [^07c9d94d]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the duration of action of ketotifen 0.025% eye drops vs placebo taken as single or multiple doses in an allergen challenge model.

Design

Two randomized, multicenter, double-masked, contralateral placebo-controlled studies, one a single-dose and one a multiple-dose study.

Methods

Two conjunctival provocation tests (CPTs) were initially conducted to confirm reproducibility of subject responses in both studies. Subjects in study 1 (n = 87) received single doses of ketotifen in one eye and placebo in the other 15 minutes, 6 hours, and 8 hours before CPT. Subjects in study 2 (n = 85) received ketotifen or placebo once 8 hours before CPT. Single-dose efficacy results were used to further qualify a subject as a responder. Responders were re-randomized to a 4-week twice daily dosing regimen with a CPT 8 hours after the final dose. In both studies, ocular symptoms were assessed at three time points 3 to 15 minutes after challenge. There were no significant differences in adverse events between groups.

Results

For both studies, ocular itching and vascular injection were significantly reduced (P < .003) at all time points after instillation of ketotifen, with a maximum reduction at 7 minutes postchallenge. In study 2, chemosis, tearing, and lid swelling were also assessed and were significantly reduced (P < .008) after instillation of ketotifen.

Conclusions

Ketotifen 0.025% eye drops were safe and statistically effective in preventing ocular itching, injection, and other signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis at 15 minutes, 6 hours, and 8 hours after a single dose and at 8 hours after the final dose of a 4-week twice daily regimen.

### Vernal keratoconjunctivitis [^ee145ca7]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment

There is currently no defined gold-standard treatment algorithm for VKC, but there are many options available, and treatment should be tailored to the individual.

Whatever treatment regimen is prescribed, it should be initiated promptly and the patient should be monitored closely for the development of any corneal complications.

A Cochrane review by Mantelli et al included 27 randomized controlled trials encompassing 2,184 eyes in an effort to evaluate topical therapies for the treatment of VKC. They found that all common antiallergic eye drops are effective in reducing signs and symptoms of disease, and that some patients even respond to placebo. A critical initial component of all allergic disease involves avoidance of inciting factors. Patients should be encouraged to wash hands frequently and avoid touching or rubbing their eyes. Cold compresses and artificial tears may help to alleviate symptoms in mild cases or as adjunctive therapy to pharmacologic treatment. First-line pharmacologic therapy for VKC is topical treatment, and there is considerable therapeutic overlap with other forms of allergic conjunctivitis. Mast cell stabilizers are a mainstay for prophylaxis. In milder cases, antihistamines may be of benefit, but more severe cases may require corticosteroid treatment. Long-term steroid use is associated with many complications, so other immunomodulatory treatments have been studied extensively.

Mast cell stabilizers

Mast cell stabilizers are thought to prevent mast cell degranulation via inhibition of calcium channels, but their mechanism is not completely understood. There is increasing evidence that mast cell stabilizers act more broadly on inflammatory cell chemotaxis. Commonly used mast cell stabilizers include cromolyn sodium and lodoxamide, which are frequently used as first-line therapy. Lodoxamide has been shown to be superior to cromolyn sodium in relieving symptoms and clinical signs of VKC. The medications should be used 4–6 times daily and may take up to 2 weeks to show response in mild cases of VKC.

Antihistamines

Antihistamines are sometimes used in the treatment of VKC: they are most often used in alleviating the symptoms of mild disease, but they have limited utility in severe cases.

More recent medications that combine antihistamine properties with mast cell stabilization include ketotifen and olopatadine. Both have been shown to improve the signs and symptoms of VKC, and there is evidence that ketotifen may be more effective. Some antihistamines may have a drying effect, which could exacerbate symptoms.

### Double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical study of the mast cell-stabilizing effects of treatment with olopatadine in the conjunctival allergen challenge model in humans [^4330ebba]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of olopatadine on the release of mast cell-derived mediators after conjunctival allergen challenge(CAC) in humans.

Methods

This was a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects with a clinical history of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (but no current symptoms or treatment at baseline) were studied. At visit 1, subjects underwent bilateral CAC with increasing doses of allergen every 15 minutes until a significant clinical reaction was obtained, then were evaluated at 15 minutes and 5 hours after CAC. At visit 2 (2 weeks later), subjects were rechallenged to confirm the allergic response. Subjects exhibiting positive reactions at both visits (at both 15 minutes and 5 hours) were randomized and instructed to treat 1 eye with olopatadine and the contralateral eye with placebo (commercially available artificial ears) in a double-masked fashion twice daily for the 5 days immediately preceding visit 3. At visit 3, bilateral CAC was performed with the same dose as at visit 2. Itching and redness were recorded. Tear cytology for inflammatory cell counts(ie, neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes) was carried out using precolored slides, and cell numbers were counted at 400x magnification. Tear histamine was assessed using radioimmunoassay histamine measurement. Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1/CD54 monoclonal antibody was used for immunohistochemical staining of conjunctival epithelial cells obtained by impression cytology. Slides were examined by 3 masked investigators and redness was classified on a scale of 0 (absent) to 3 (very intense).

Results

Ten subjects completed the trial. Olopatadine significantly reduced postchallenge itching and redness compared with placebo (P < 0.01 and P < 0.03, respectively). Olopatadine also reduced the number of neutrophils and the total number of cells at 30 minutes (both P = 0.015), and the number of eosinophils(P < 0.001), neutrophils (P < 0.004), lymphocytes (P = 0.011), and total number of cells (P = 0.001) at 5 hours postchallenge compared with placebo. Tear histamine levels were significantly lower after challenge in the eyes pretreated with olopatadine compared with placebo (mean [SD], 7 [8] vs 22 [12] nmol/L; P = 0.04). Olopatadine significantly reduced tear histamine levels compared with those measured in the same eyes after CAC at visit 2 (P = 0.001), whereas placebo did not affect histamine levels. Olopatadine also significantly reduced ICAM-1 expression compared with placebo at 30 minutes and 5 hours postchallenge(P < 0.03 and P < 0.01, respectively).

Conclusion

In the present study, olopatadine significantly reduced the levels of histamine, cellular infiltrate, and ICAM expression compared with placebo after CAC, suggesting that it reduced the release of mast cell-derived mediators in humans. This inhibition of mediator release correlated with reduction of itching and redness.

### The phase 3 INVIGORATE trial of reproxalap in patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis [^070222c2]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Surprisingly, given the significant incidence of allergic conjunctivitis, new mechanisms of action for treatment have not been introduced in decades. Although topical antihistamines are considered standard of care for allergic conjunctivitis, the most common reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database for topical antihistamine monotherapy (olopatadine, ketotifen, alcaftadine, epinastine, and bepotastine) are "treatment failure" (45%) and "drug ineffective" (17%), which may partially explain why polypharmacy is common in allergic conjunctivitis. Histamine is rapidly metabolized and likely peaks soon after allergen exposure, thereby limiting the duration of activity of antihistamines. Furthermore, many non-histaminic mediators likely contribute to the clinical presentation of ocular allergy. Because of toxicity concerns, corticosteroids can only be safely used on a short-term basis. Therefore, novel treatments are needed. The data reported herein suggest that use of the novel RASP modulator reproxalap may be an effective treatment for the symptoms and signs of allergic conjunctivitis. By extension, based on the activity reported herein, RASP modulation may represent a potential therapeutic approach for other allergic diseases.

### Alcaftadine for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis [^fe5596d8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of alcaftadine for the prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.

Data Sources

A medical literature search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed (2006-February 2012) and EMBASE (2006-February 2012) using the search terms alcaftadine and Lastacaft. References from these publications were reviewed for additional resources. Additional information was collected from Web sites of the US government (http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, http://www.fda.gov) and of Allergan Inc, the manufacturer of Lastacaft (http://www.lastacaft.com).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All identified articles and publications in English were reviewed for pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety data. Priority was placed on clinical trials.

Data Synthesis

Two published clinical trials evaluated the efficacy of alcaftadine in the prevention of ocular itching and conjunctival redness associated with allergic conjunctivitis. One trial compared alcaftadine to placebo, and another trial compared alcaftadine to placebo and olopatadine HCl to placebo. Both studies showed superior efficacy, both clinically and statistically, in the prevention of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis compared to placebo. Although conjunctival redness was evaluated in the 2 trials, neither trial demonstrated both clinical and statistical significance. Both trials demonstrated a rapid onset of action of less than 15 minutes, as well as a duration of action greater than 16 hours, which supports the use of once-daily administration. Overall, alcaftadine was well tolerated, and common adverse effects, reported in less than 4% of patients, included ocular irritation, pruritus, erythema, and stinging or burning upon instillation. Ocular adverse effects were typically mild in severity and self-limiting.

Conclusions

Alcaftadine is a safe and effective option for the prevention of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis, is dosed once daily, and is competitively priced among prescription medications for allergic conjunctivitis. Additional studies are needed to further evaluate the comparative efficacy among ocular antihistamine/mast cell stabilizing medications.

### A comparison of the relative clinical efficacy of a single dose of ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution versus placebo in inhibiting the signs and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis as induced by the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^f4fbb41b]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution is an antiallergic treatment currently available in the United States. It is indicated for the temporary prevention of ocular itching due to allergic conjunctivitis.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to determine the relative efficacy of ketotifen when applied topically to the eye, compared with placebo, in the treatment of nasal signs and symptoms of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis as induced by the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.

Methods

This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, single-center clinical study using the CAC model. Patients aged ≥ 18 years, able to follow the study instructions, willing to avoid disallowed medications, and having a history of rhinoconjunctivitis and a positive skin test were eligible. At visit 1, the dose of allergen necessary to achieve a qualifying reaction was determined using bilateral ocular instillation of allergen to eligible patients. At visit 2, the allergen dose determined at visit 1 was confirmed, and all patients attaining a qualifying nasal reaction continued in the study. At visit 3, each patient was randomized to receive 1 drop of ketotifen bilaterally in the eyes or 1 drop of placebo bilaterally. Fifteen minutes after instillation of the study medication, bilateral CAC was performed. Patients rated nasal symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea and postnasal drip, nasal pruritus, palatal pruritus, and nasal congestion) on standardized scales at 10, 20, and 30 minutes after CAC.

Results

Thirty-two patients (16 men, 16 women; mean age, 45 years [range, 28–70 years]) were randomized to treatment and completed the study. Nineteen patients received ketotifen and 13 received placebo. Nasal symptom scores in ketotifen-treated patients were statistically and clinically significantly fewer than in those treated with placebo at all time points (mean baseline corrected total nasal score: 10 minutes, P = 0.010; 20 minutes, P = 0.025; 30 minutes, P = 0.006).

Conclusion

In this study, topical ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution, when dosed ocularly, offered protecdon against the nasal signs and symptoms of acute allergic rhinoconjunctival reaction as induced by the CAC model.

### Comparative efficacy of bepotastine besilate 1.5% ophthalmic solution versus olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2% ophthalmic solution evaluated by patient preference [^8be33d24]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this study was to compare patient-perceived relief of ocular itch, nasal symptoms, and eye drop comfort when allergic conjunctivitis was treated with bepotastine besilate 1.5% versus olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2%.

Methods

This randomized, observer-masked, single-center, crossover study included 30 patients with ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis accompanied by nasal symptoms. Patients were treated with bepotastine besilate 1.5% twice daily (7 am and 4 pm) or olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2% once daily (7 am) for 14 days. Following a 7-day washout period during which only preservative-free artificial tears were used twice daily, patients were crossed over to the alternative treatment for 14 days. Parameters evaluated by twice-daily patient diaries included each treatment's ability to relieve ocular itch, ability to relieve itchy/runny nose, ability to relieve ocular allergy symptoms, and eye drop comfort. At the conclusion of the study, patients were also asked to identify which agent provided better all-day relief of ocular itching, better all-day relief of itchy/runny nose, superior comfort, and for which treatment they would prefer a prescription.

Results

According to the mean daily diary responses, bepotastine besilate 1.5% provided significantly better relief of evening ocular itch, relief of morning and evening itchy/runny nose, and relief of morning and evening ocular allergy symptoms. At study end, 63.3% and 66.7% of patients preferred bepotastine besilate 1.5% for all-day relief of ocular itching and all-day relief of itchy/runny nose, respectively. At study end, there was no significant difference in the number of patients preferring one treatment over the other for comfort. Overall, 66.7% of patients stated that they would prefer to treat their allergic conjunctivitis with bepotastine besilate 1.5% over olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2%.

Conclusion

Based on their evaluation of therapeutic performance, patients preferred bepotastine besilate 1.5% over olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2% by two-to-one for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^74fa7c88]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

This double-masked, randomized, controlled trial assessed for the first time the efficacy and safety of once-daily olopatadine 0.77% compared with its vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis using a CAC model. We found that olopatadine 0.77% was superior to both its vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

The efficacy of olopatadine 0.77% versus vehicle and olopatadine 0.2% was evaluated immediately after dosing for onset of action and at 16 and 24 hours after dosing to assess the duration of action using the CAC model. This model is appropriate to test the efficacy of antiallergic agents, as it accurately replicates in a controlled and reproducible setting the true IgE-mediated allergic reaction seen in patients with allergic conjunctivitis. Indeed, the CAC model is a standardized testing model widely accepted by the FDA, as well as the Japanese Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency for registration purposes.–In this study, patients with a history of allergic conjunctivitis were enrolled based on a sufficiently severe response to a controlled CAC on two separate occasions. One advantage of CAC studies over environmental studies is that participants reliably come into contact with the allergen that triggers their allergic conjunctivitis, whereas in environmental studies this is not necessarily the case, and interpretation of results may therefore be confounded. Other advantages of the CAC model include individual titration of allergens to obtain a threshold dose for adequate reactivity and the highly standardized grading systems used.

### Efficacy and toxicity evaluation of bepotastine besilate 1.5% preservative-free eye drops Vs olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2% bak-preserved eye drops in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^4a1d188a]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To study the efficacy and toxic effects of bepotastine besilate 1.5% preservative-free (BB-PF) and olopatadine 0.2% BAK-preserved (OL-BAK) drops on the ocular surface of patients with allergic conjunctivitis.

Patients and Methods

Ninety-seven patients with allergic conjunctivitis diagnosis participated in a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group clinical trial. Patients received either BB-PF (n = 48) or OL-BAK (n = 49), both administered once daily in the morning. The patients were followed for 60 days. Ocular itching was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included ocular symptoms, signs, and non-ocular symptoms associated with rhinoconjunctivitis. Conjunctival impression cytology (CIC) was performed to evaluate histopathological changes related to the toxic effects of preservatives.

Results

BB-PF treatment was associated with a 1.30 more probability of diminished ocular itching than OL-BAK (odds ratio (OR) = 1.30; 95% CI = (0.96–1.7); p = 0.086). No statistically significant differences were found between treatments in the resolution of other ocular symptoms or signs, except for tearing, which was superior in the BB-PF (OR = 1.37; 95% (1.26–1.47); p < 0.0001). BB-PF was superior in terms of the resolution of rhinorrhea (p = 0.040) and nasal itching (p = 0.037). After 60 days of treatment, the BB-PF group exhibited 2.0 times higher probability of having a lower Nelson scale score compared to the OL-BAK group (OR = 2.00; 95% CI = (1.19–3.34); p = 0.010).

Conclusion

Both medications presented a similar efficacy in terms of the resolution of ocular signs and symptoms associated with ocular conjunctivitis. BB-PF is superior in the resolution of non-ocular symptoms and safer for the ocular surface than OL-BAK.

### A placebo-controlled comparison of ketotifen fumarate and nedocromil sodium ophthalmic solutions for the prevention of ocular itching with the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^0c948105]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution and nedocromil sodium 2.0% ophthalmic solution are 2 topical antiallergic medications with different modes of action and efficacy profiles. Both solutions are indicated for ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy, safety, and comfort of ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution and nedocromil sodium 2.0% ophthalmic solution for the prevention of ocular itching, using the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.

Methods

This was a single-center, double-masked, contralateral, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled CAC clinical trial. Subjects aged > 10 years with a history of allergic hypersensitivity who responded to the CAC at screening visits 1 and 2 qualified for randomization at visit 3. At visit 3 (day 21) and visit 4 (day 35), subjects received 1 of 3 treatments: ketotifen, nedocromil, or placebo (artificial tears), randomized by eye. Allergen challenges were conducted at 5 minutes posttreatment dose (visit 3) and 12 hours posttreatment dose (visit 4). At each visit, subjects evaluated their ocular itching every 30 seconds for 20 minutes. At visit 4, subjects evaluated the comfort of the medication immediately after instillation, at 30 seconds after instillation, and at l, 2, 5, and 10 minutes after instillation. The subjects were also queried about overall eyedrop comfort by choosing from descriptive terms and about overall eyedrop preference based on comfort and perceived efficacy.

Results

Eighty-five subjects were screened for this study. Fifty-nine (28 males, 31 females; mean age, 38.7 years) qualified and were randomized to receive study medications. Ketotifen-treated eyes experienced significantly less ocular itching induced by CAC than nedocromil-treated eyes and those that received placebo at both the 5-minute and 12-hour posttreatment allergen challenges (all P < 0.05). Nedocromil-treated eyes showed no statistical or clinical differences from placebo at any time point. Ketotifen-treated eyes showed no differences in comfort from those that received placebo but were significantly more comfortable than nedocromil-treated eyes at 1, 2, 5, and 10 minutes after instillation (all P < 0.05). On the basis of comfort and subjective efficacy, 60% of subjects preferred ketotifen, 21% preferred nedocromil, and 19% preferred placebo.

Conclusion

Ketotifen was significantly more effective and comfortable than nedocromil at both 5 minutes and 12 hours after administration in this CAC model.

### Efficacy and toxicity evaluation of bepotastine besilate 1.5% preservative-free eye drops Vs olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2% bak-preserved eye drops in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^46f61a7a]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

Study Population

A total of 101 patients were included in this study. Four of them were not included as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 97 patients from 4 ophthalmological centers were enrolled and randomized into treatment groups at the baseline visit, of which 75 completed all study visits (Figure 1).

Figure 1
CONSORT Flow Diagram.

The demographic characteristics (sex and age) of the patients were well-balanced between the treatment groups in the intention to treat (ITT) population. Pairwise comparisons between groups showed no statistically significant differences. The median age of the enrolled population (n = 97) was 43.2 years for bepotastine group and 45.0 for Olopatadine group, while most patients were women in both treatment groups: 68.1% for bepotastine group and 66.7% for olopatadine group.

Ocular Symptoms

Ocular itching: The degree of ocular itching decreased significantly over time in both groups of treatment (p < 0.0001). Bepotastine besilate 1.5% PF administered once daily to patients with allergic conjunctivitis significantly reduced ocular itching, with a probability 1.30 times greater than that of olopatadine 0.2% BAK-preserved (odds ratio (OR) = 1.30; 95% confidence interval (CI) = (0.96–1.70); p = 0.086). After 60 days of treatment, 80.60% of patients in the bepotastine group completely resolved the main symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis, whereas 71.80% of patients in the olopatadine group completely resolved this symptom. None of the patients in the bepotastine group reported a moderate or severe degree of ocular itching after 60 days of treatment (Figure 2).

### Evaluation of alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution in acute allergic conjunctivitis at 15 minutes and 16 hours after instillation versus placebo and olopatadine 0.1% [^f9b0680d]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the effectiveness of alcaftadine 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.25% ophthalmic solutions in treating the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis when compared with olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% and placebo using the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.

Methods

One hundred and seventy subjects were randomized and 164 subjects completed all visits. CAC was performed to determine and confirm subjects' eligibility at visits 1 and 2, respectively. The CAC was repeated at visit 3 (day 0 ± 3), 16 hours after study medication instillation, and at visit 4 (day 14 ± 3), 15 minutes after instillation. Ocular itching and conjunctival redness were evaluated after an allergen challenge, along with several secondary endpoints.

Results

Alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.1% treatments exhibited significantly lower mean scores compared with placebo for ocular itching and conjunctival redness at visits 3 and 4. Most adverse events were self-limiting and mild in severity. No serious treatment-related adverse events occurred.

Conclusion

Treatment with alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution resulted in mean differences of > 1 unit (ocular itching) and approximately > 1 unit (conjunctival redness), which was significant (P < 0.001) compared with placebo treatment. All doses of alcaftadine were safe and well tolerated in the population studied.

### A comparison of the clinical efficacy of pheniramine maleate / naphazoline hydrochloride ophthalmic solution and olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in the conjunctival allergen challenge model [^588eb9cf]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis include ocular redness and itching. Two treatment options currently indicated for acute ocular allergic reaction are pheniramine maleate 0.3%/naphazoline hydrochloride 0.025% ophthalmic solution, an over-the-counter antihistamine/vasoconstrictor combination; and olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution, a prescription antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer.

Objective

This study was designed to compare, at onset of action, the relative effectiveness of pheniramine/naphazoline and olopatadine, when administered before conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC), using the ocular allergy index (OAI) as the primary end point.

Methods

This was a prospective, randomized, double-masked, contralateral, active- and placebo-controlled, single-center study of the CAC model. The first 2 study visits established and confirmed the subjects' ocular allergic reaction (no medication administered). At visit 3, the subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 contralateral (right eye vs left eye) treatment combinations: pheniramine/naphazoline + olopatadine, pheniramine/naphazoline + placebo, or olopatadine + placebo. Medication was given 10 minutes before CAC. The subjects' erythema in the ciliary, conjunctival, and episcleral vessel beds; eyelid swelling; chemosis; and itching were evaluated at 7, 12, and 20 minutes after CAC. The OAI was calculated as a composite score of 6 signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis to assess global severity. Between-treatment differences in OAI scores were used to evaluate efficacy. Subjects were asked their eye drop preference at the conclusion of visit 3.

Results

Subjects (n = 83) ranged in age from 20 to 70 years (mean, 42.5 years), 61.4% (n = 51) were female, and 94.0% (n = 78) were white. Both pheniramine/naphazoline and olopatadine were associated with significantly lower OAI scores than placebo at all 3 time points (all, P < 0.001). OAI scores were significantly lower with pheniramine/naphazoline than with olopatadine at 12 and 20 minutes (P = 0.005 and P = 0.001, respectively).

Conclusion

In this patient sample, studied in a CAC model of onset of action, prophylactic pheniramine/naphazoline was more effective than olopatadine and placebo in alleviating the signs and symptoms of the acute ocular allergic reaction, as measured by the OAI.

### Randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled comparison of the efficacy of emedastine difumarate 0.05% ophthalmic solution and ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution in the human conjunctival allergen challenge model [^e041943e]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Emedastine difumarate 0.05% ophthalmic solution and ketotifen fumarate 0.025% ophthalmic solution are 2 topical antiallergic agents available in the United States and other countries. Emedastine is indicated for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. Ketotifen is indicated for the temporary relief of ocular itching caused by allergic conjunctivitis.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of these agents in the temporary relief of ocular itching due to allergic conjunctivitis. The 2 agents were compared with each other and with placebo (artificial tears) using the conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) model.

Methods

This was a single-center, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study. At visit 1, CAC was performed on eligible subjects to identify the dose required to elicit a positive allergic reaction. Subjects returned after 7 days for visit 2 to confirm the allergen dose. On day 14 (± 3) of the study, enrolled subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: emedastine in I eye and placebo in the other, ketotifen in 1 eye and placebo in the other, or emedastine in 1 eye and ketotifen in the other. In 25 subjects, bilateral CAC was performed 5 minutes after study medication instillation. In a second group of 20 subjects, CAC was performed 15 minutes after medication instillation. Itching was graded according to a standardized 5-point scale (0 = none to 4 = severe itching) at 3, 5, and 10 minutes postchallenge. Differences in efficacy scores between treatments and versus placebo were compared using 2-sample t tests of equal variance.

Results

A total of 45 patients (mean age, 41.2 years) received treatment: 16 received emedastine in 1 eye and ketotifen in the other; 14 received emedastine in 1 eye and placebo in the other; and 15 received ketotifen in 1 eye and placebo in the other. Both emedastine and ketotifen significantly inhibited itching (P < 0.05) compared with placebo at all time points after the 5- and 15-minute CAC. Mean raw scores for the active treatments were not statistically different. The mean itching efficacy scores were also not statistically different between active treatments. No adverse events were reported in this study.

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest that emedastine and ketotifen are not significantly different with respect to anti-itching efficacy in the CAC model of acute allergic conjunctivitis.

### Effect of alcaftadine 0.25% on ocular itch associated with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis: a pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized clinical trials [^96e1c067]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Study treatment and clinical assessments

Subject assessments were conducted at three study visits that were identical in the two trials. These assessments were included in the pooled analysis. At the first visit (day −21 ± 3) or titration visit, subjects were challenged with increasing concentration of allergens followed by the subject rating ocular itching severity after 10 minutes. Subjects were challenged with seasonal or perennial allergens to which they had known sensitivity; allergens used for conjunctival challenge in both studies included cat dander, dog dander, cockroach, dust mite, grass, ragweed, and trees. Cat hair was also included as a possible allergen in one of the two studies. A CAC reaction was considered positive when the score for both ocular itching and conjunctival vessel bed redness was ≥ 2.0. Itching was graded by the subject on a 0–4 scale, which allowed half increments for measurements, and conjunctival redness was scored by the investigator on a 0–4 scale for ocular redness.

At the second visit (day −14 ± 3) or confirmation visit, subjects still satisfying eligibility criteria were challenged with the final concentration of allergen from the first visit to obtain baseline data. Following CAC with seasonal or perennial allergens, subjects rated ocular itching at 3, 5, and 7 minutes and those meeting qualifying criteria (post-challenge bilateral itching ≥ 2 and bilateral conjunctival redness ≥ 2 at two of the three time points assessed by the investigator [7 minutes, 15 minutes, and 20 minutes]) continued to the third visit.

The third visit (day 0) occurred approximately 2 weeks after visit 2, and subjects were randomized (1:1:1) to receive treatment with alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution (Lastacaft ®; Allergan, Inc.), olopatadine 0.2% ophthalmic solution (Pataday ®; Alcon Laboratories, Inc. Fort Worth, TX, USA), and placebo (0.3% hydroxypropyl methylcellulose [Tears Naturale ® II; Alcon Laboratories, Inc.]). Each eye received a single drop of the study medication. Subjects then returned 15.5 hours later and were challenged 16+1 hours, using the allergen (seasonal or perennial) and dose established to elicit an allergic response at visits 1 and 2.

### DEXTENZA versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^37510713]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis is a common cause of ocular itching, conjunctival hyperemia, and watering and can be triggered by both seasonal and perennial allergens. Its prevalence has been estimated at up to 40%. The condition negatively impacts quality of life and work productivity.

The pathophysiology of allergic conjunctivitis involves immune responses mediated by histamine and mast cells. Treatment consists of antihistamines for immediate relief and mast-cell stabilizers for long-term control. Corticosteroids can be used for short periods to manage acute flares but safety issues such as elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and cataract formation limit long-term use. Recently, Dextenza, a 0.4 mg dexamethasone intracanalicular insert (Ocular Therapeutix, Bedford, MA) has been approved for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis; it is also approved for the treatment of ocular inflammation and pain following ocular surgery. The dexamethasone intracanalicular insert is a rod-shaped depot of 0.4 mg preservative-free dexamethasone encapsulated within polyethylene glycol-based hydrogel that expands after contact with fluid to occlude the punctum and secure its placement. Fluorescein is conjugated to the hydrogel to enable visualization. The insert delivers a sustained and tapered dose of dexamethasone to the ocular surface for up to 30 days and resorbs completely.

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, the dexamethasone insert relieved ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis more effectively than placebo when evaluated using a modified conjunctival allergen challenge model. To date, no real-world studies have evaluated the insert's effectiveness in managing signs and symptoms of clinical allergic conjunctivitis, nor have any studies included comparisons to other treatments for allergic eye disease. We have conducted a randomized trial comparing the dexamethasone insert to loteprednol — a topical corticosteroid — and to olopatadine — a topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer — in reducing the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis.

Clinical studies: alcafatadine 0.25%, olopatadine 0.2%, and placebo

Ackerman et al later conducted a study evaluating the efficacy and duration of action of once-daily dosing with alcaftadine 0.25% and olopatadine 0.2% as compared with a placebo in the prevention of ocular itching. Additionally, the efficacy of alcaftadine 0.25% was directly compared to olopatadine 0.2% in the prevention of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis utilizing the aforementioned CAC model. A multicenter, double-masked, randomized, active-, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted ~5 weeks. Inclusion criteria were similar to the Torkildsen and Shedden study. Subjects also agreed to avoid disallowed medications and contact lens wear during the study period. Females who were pregnant, planning a pregnancy, lactating, or not using a medically accepted form of birth control were excluded from the study due to the category C labeling of olopatadine 0.2% utilized in one treatment arm. Participants were ≥ 10 years of age. One hundred twenty-seven subjects were equally randomized into one of the three groups: alcaftadine 0.25% ophthalmic solution, olopatadine 0.2% ophthalmic solution, or placebo with 115 subjects completing the study.

Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis (AC) is the most common allergic ocular disorder, affecting approximately 20% of the global population. The prevalence of AC is region-dependent, and appears to be increasing worldwide. This pathology is associated with seasonal pollen sensitivity, although perennial forms are associated with exposure to animal dander, mites, and molds. AC is a type-1, IgE-mediated hypersensitivity immune reaction that occurs in individuals previously exposed to a specific allergen. The immune response involves the release of inflammatory mediators, including histamine, leukotrienes, bradykinin, prostaglandins, proteases, and cytokines, which contribute to the development of signs and symptoms. Histamines from degranulated mast cells are the principal immune mediators related to early allergic responses. This molecule binds to receptors (H1, H2, H3, and H4) on vascular endothelial cells, neuronal fibers, goblet cells, immune cells, and conjunctival epithelium culminating in clinical manifestations of allergic conjunctivitis including redness, periocular swelling, chemosis, itching, and tearing. This is followed by a late phase that is manifested by pro-inflammatory mediators and the recruitment of immune cells including eosinophils and neutrophils.

The keystone of the treatments is histamine antagonists (also called antihistamines), which inhibit the action of histamine by blocking histamine receptors and, consequently, inhibiting clinical manifestations related to this mediator. Mast cell stabilizers inhibit mast cell degranulation and, consequently, the release of histamine by interrupting the normal chain of intracellular signals. The first line of treatment for this condition includes antihistamines that combine both mechanisms of action: dual-action antihistamines, which present an increased safety and efficacy profile compared with older topical agents used in the treatment of AC.

Bepotastine besilate is the latest-generation ophthalmic antihistamine with multiple mechanisms of action in both preclinical and clinical studies. This drug is a highly selective H1 receptor antagonist with potent mast cell-stabilizing action. Bepotastine besilate exerts its anti-inflammatory action through the inhibition of leukotriene B4and the reduction and activation of eosinophil chemotaxis. It also inhibits the biosynthesis of proinflammatory IL-5 in vitro. The clinical efficacy and safety of bepotastine besilate twice a day (BID) have been demonstrated in several clinical studies. Recent studies suggest that the effect of bepotastine besilate 1.5% was maintained for up to 16 hr, so a posology of once a day in the morning can be proposed.

### Comparative efficacy of topical antihistamines in an animal model of early phase allergic conjunctivitis [^4f1884d3]. Experimental Eye Research (2008). Low credibility.

In order to compare the relative efficacy of topical antihistamines with balanced saline solution (BSS) and benzalkonium chloride (BC) in the early phase of allergic conjunctivitis in an animal model of ocular anaphylaxis, 96 male guinea pigs were sensitized with intraperitoneal egg albumin (EA) and aluminum hydroxide. Seventy-six animals were used for determination of Evans blue (EB) extravasation and 20 for clinical evaluation of the allergic response (redness, edema, discharge and itch-scratch response). Eighteen days after sensitization the animals were topically challenged by conjunctival instillation of EA and treated 15 min before and 15 min after challenge with commercially available drugs (ketotifen, ketotifen single dose units [SDU], olopatadine, azelastine, spaglumic acid and emedastine) and controls (BSS and BC). The animals used for EB quantification were anesthetized and received an intravenous injection of EB simultaneously to the topical challenge. The ocular extravasation of the colorant was determined by 620 nm absorbance spectrophotometry. The animals used for clinical evaluation were observed for clinical signs of the allergic reaction. EB ocular extravasation was significantly lower in the eyes treated by spaglumic acid and emedastine. The clinical scoring was consistent with EB extravasation, though the difference was not statistically significant. Spaglumic acid and emedastine seem to be the most useful drugs to reduce EB extravasation and allergic signs in an animal model of early phase allergic conjunctivitis.

### Effects of adjuvant therapy with 0.1% olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution on quality of life in patients with allergic rhinitis using systemic or nasal therapy [^f82821a7]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis patients are often treated with nasal or systemic allergy therapy, forgoing therapy for ocular symptoms. This treatment regimen leaves important aspects of the allergic reaction untreated and affects quality of life (QoL). The Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Allergic Conjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire quantify separate aspects of QoL.

Objective

To determine the benefit gained in QoL, measured by these questionnaires, when antiallergy eyedrops (olopatadine) were added to patients' preexisting regimens of nasal or systemic allergic rhinitis treatment.

Methods

This was a 4-week prospective, multicenter, open-label, crossover, environmental QoL study. Visit 1 randomized patients to treatment group A or B and included baseline examinations and questionnaires. Group A instilled olopatadine twice daily and concomitantly with previously prescribed nasal or systemic antiallergy medication for 2 weeks. Group B received no ocular therapy and used only previously prescribed antiallergy medication for 2 weeks. Treatment group crossover occurred at visit 2. Patients again completed the questionnaires at visits 2 and 3.

Results

Two hundred patients completed the study, 97 in group A and 103 in group B. Groups A and B experienced ocular allergic symptoms for 3.88 and 3.96 days, respectively, during the week before baseline. At visits 2 and 3, questionnaire scores were significantly improved for each group when olopatadine was added compared with the nontreatment periods. By visit 2, olopatadine improved QoL by 49% compared with 5% in the nontreated group (P < .001).

Conclusions

In this study, 90.5% of patients with allergic rhinitis treated nasally or systemically also had ocular allergic symptoms. Adding olopatadine to these patients' medication regimens significantly improved ocular allergic symptoms and overall QoL.

Participants

Male and female patients were eligible for inclusion if they were at least 18 years old, were able to have both eyes dosed with eyedrops, and had a positive diagnostic skin test indicative of allergy to cat hair, cat dander, grasses, ragweed, dust mite, dog dander, cockroaches, and/or trees within 24 months of visit 1 (day 21 ± 2, Figure 1). In addition, eligible patients were required to have a history of seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis for ≥ 1 year before visit 1 and a positive bilateral CAC response at visits 1 (day 21 ± 2) and 2 (day 14 ± 3), and were willing to discontinue wearing contact lens for ≥ 72 hours before the first study visit and throughout the study.

Exclusion criteria included a known history or presence of persistent dry eye syndrome or recurrent treatment for dryness of eyes, and the presence of active blepharitis, active meibomian gland dysfunction, active rosacea affecting the ocular adnexa, follicular conjunctivitis, iritis, preauricular lymphadenopathy, ocular irritation not due to ocular allergy, or any other clinically significant ophthalmic abnormality. Other medical conditions that precluded participation in the study included presumed or actual ocular infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or a history of ocular herpes; the presence of any chronic ocular degenerative condition or active intraocular inflammation that in the opinion of the investigator was likely to worsen during the study; any contraindications or hypersensitivities to use of the study medications or their components; a history of ocular surgery (including refractive procedures, such as laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis, photorefractive keratectomy, and radial keratotomy, within 6 months; any type of glaucoma at visit 1; past history or diagnosis of glaucoma or glaucoma-suspect status (ocular hypertension); signs or symptoms of active allergic conjunctivitis; history of anaphylactic reaction to any study allergens; current evidence or recent (within 6 months) history of severe, unstable, or uncontrolled systemic disease; use of any disallowed medications during the period indicated prior to visit 1 in the protocol; any contraindications or hypersensitivities to use of the study medications or their components; or participation in another investigational agent trial within 30 days.

### DEXTENZA versus topical steroid or antihistamine therapy for treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^d2bbd05f]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first real-world study of the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert for allergic conjunctivitis. Patients experienced greater improvements in signs and symptoms with the dexamethasone intracanalicular insert than with the topical steroid loteprednol and preferred the insert to topical therapy by more than a 2-to-1 margin. Conversely, outcomes were similar and no clear preference was demonstrated between the insert and the use of the topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer olopatadine.

Statistical differences in signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis favoring the dexamethasone insert over topical loteprednol therapy may be explained in several ways. First is the two drugs' relative potency: dexamethasone is considered a highly potent corticosteroid while loteprednol is considered a weak corticosteroid. Second is differences in formulation. Solutions typically clear from the ocular surface within 15 minutes and suspensions within 2 hours. In contrast, the intracanalicular insert provides constant tapered delivery of dexamethasone over its ~30-day dosing period. Consequently, the bioavailability of drug at the ocular surface is likely greater with the dexamethasone insert compared to the loteprednol solution. Regarding the strong preference expressed by patients for the dexamethasone insert over topical loteprednol, part may be explained by the superior efficacy of the insert over topical drops in relieving the signs and symptoms of ocular allergy, while part may be related to the freedom from self-administration of topical drops 2 times daily for 30 days (60 instillations).

In contrast, there was no significant difference in improvement of most signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, nor a strong preference by patients, between the dexamethasone insert and the topical antihistamine/mast cell stabilizer olopatadine (OLO). Changes in ocular itching, eyelid swelling, and tearing/watering were similar between treatment groups, while there was a significant difference favoring the dexamethasone insert in ocular hyperemia. This may be explained in part by differences in mechanism of action of these two drugs. Antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers directly target the specific form of inflammation underlying allergic conjunctivitis, while corticosteroids have a broader and nonspecific action on histamine-mediated inflammation. In addition, OLO is used once daily with a reduced drop burden. Given the different mechanism of action, a further study to evaluate the use of both medications together may be useful.

### Comparison of cytotoxicities and anti-allergic effects of topical ocular dual-action anti-allergic agents [^fad116e6]. BMC Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The prevalence rates of allergic diseases have been increasing due to hereditary factors, environmental pollution, increased allergen levels, and changes in life patterns including dietary. Approximately 6–30% of individuals are suffering from allergic conjunctivitis (AC) and 30~70% of them accompany other allergic diseases. Even though AC is not a life-threatening disease, its chronic, recurrent tendencies influence the quality of patient's life considerably.

The fundamental treatment for AC is to avoid allergens that cause hypersensitive reactions as other allergic diseases. However, it is difficult not only to identify the causative allergens accurately but also to avoid a known allergen completely if they are easily encountered in daily life. For these reasons, pharmacotherapy has been used to provide symptom relief and treatment in AC.

The clinical manifestations of AC such as itching, hyperemia, chemosis, and eyelid swelling are the result of mast cell degranulation and the release of inflammatory chemical mediators (especially histamine), which are initiated by crosslinking between permeated allergen and sensitized IgE on mast cell surface. Therefore, these pathologic immune reactions have been considered as main targets for pharmacotherapy, and can be controlled by antihistamine agents and mast cell stabilizers. Olopatadine was the first approved dual-action topical agent and other two dual-action agents have been developed and become general trend to treat AC. Although dual-action agents reduce dosage and frequency due to its rapid onset and long lasting therapeutic effect, long period of use can damage ocular surface cells. An impaired epithelial barrier may allow allergens to infiltrate easily and exacerbate the disease. Therefore, reliable safety as well as therapeutic effects are required for anti-allergic agents.

We chose three topical ocular dual-action anti-allergic agents for this study; alcaftadine 0.25% (Lastacaft®, Allergan, Inc. Irvine, CA, USA) and bepotastine besilate 1.5% (Talion®, Dong-A ST, Seoul, Korea), which were introduced recently, and olopatadine HCL 0.1% (Pataday®, Alcon, Fribourg, Switzerland), a traditionally and widely used agent. The aim of this study was to investigate the cytotoxicities of these agents on cultured human corneal epithelial cells and their anti-allergic effects on cultured human conjunctival epithelial cells in vitro.

### Efficacy and toxicity evaluation of bepotastine besilate 1.5% preservative-free eye drops Vs olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2% bak-preserved eye drops in patients with allergic conjunctivitis [^914e4245]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

We identified the need to compare bepotastine with other antiallergic treatments owing to the lack of published evidence. To the best of our knowledge, only two studies have compared bepotastine with other commercially available antiallergic ophthalmic solutions. Ayyappanavar et al compared bepotastine besilate 1.5% BID with olopatadine hydrochloride 0.2% and alcaftadine 0.25% administered once daily. Both antiallergic solutions were superior to Olopatadine analyzed by Total Ocular Symptom Scoring System (TOSS) after 14 days of treatments. McCabe et al assessed patient preferences for bepotastine besilate 1.5% administered twice daily and olopatadine 0.2% ophthalmic solution taken once daily in terms of patient-assessment relief and ocular comfort. Bepotastine besilate 1.5% BID provides better relief from ocular itching, nose itching, and morning and evening relief from ocular allergy symptoms than Olopatadine. However, there was no study that compared Bepotastine besilate 1.5% once a day vs any other antiallergic ophthalmic eye drop. In our study, we conducted a comparative analysis between reduced dosage of Bepotastine besilate 1.5% and olopatadine 0.2%, both administered once daily. Olopatadine is a well-established dual-action antihistamine that has been widely used worldwide for several decades. It has demonstrated a similar efficacy and safety profile in resolving symptoms and signs associated with allergic conjunctivitis. Upon evaluating the signs and symptoms related to AC, we found no statistically significant differences between this and treatments, except for tearing, where bepotastine exhibited superior effectiveness compared to Olopatadine group over time.

### Ketotifen fumarate [^486166c9]. FDA. Low credibility.

Common adverse reactions (1–10%) associated with the use of ketotifen OPHTH include: conjunctivitis, eye pain, generalized pruritus, hyperlacrimation, keratitis, mydriasis, pharyngitis, photophobia, red eyes, skin rash and xerophthalmia.

### Efficacy and safety of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen-challenge model [^a812d5c0]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

A new formulation of olopatadine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution was recently approved in the US by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Each milliliter of this new formulation contains 7.76 mg of olopatadine hydrochloride, which is equivalent to 7 mg olopatadine free base. As olopatadine is soluble only in water (pH ~7.0) at room temperature up to a concentration of 0.18% w/v, the higher concentration olopatadine hydrochloride 0.77% formulation contains compounds to improve its solubility, including a cyclodextrin derivative (hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin), a lactam polymer (polyvinylpyrrolidone [povidone]), and polyethylene glycol (PEG400).

Various methods can be used to assess the treatment effectiveness of antiallergy agents in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis, including environmental studies, in which patients are given a course of treatment to take at home where they record their symptoms throughout the study period. This type of study accurately refects a normal clinical practice; however, confounding factors, such as variability in sensitivity to allergens, differing exposure to allergens, reliance on subjective data, and incomplete compliance, may make interpretation of the findings problematic. An alternative methodology is based on a conjunctival allergen-challenge (CAC) model. The CAC allows a level of internal control that is not seen with environmental studies, has an inherent reproducibility of repeated study visits under controlled conditions, and has been used extensively for testing topical ophthalmic medications.

This study compared the safety and efficacy of olopatadine 0.77% with its vehicle or olopatadine 0.2% in patients with allergic conjunctivitis, using a CAC model in a controlled setting. In order to assess the onset of action, as well as the duration of action at 16 and 24 hours postadministration, all tested therapies were administered as a single dose prior to each challenge on 3 nonconsecutive days.

Discussion

Signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis significantly decrease the quality of life and ability to function, sleep problems, decrease the ability to visual tasks, and social interactions. This leads to missed time at work, owing to visits to the doctor's office and decreased productivity. Consequently, it is important to establish non-pharmacological, pharmacologically effective, and safe treatments.

Bepotastine besilate is a last-generation antihistamine drug with a high affinity for the H 1 receptor without any appreciable action on other receptors associated with undesirable effects such as histamine H 3, adrenergic (α 1, α 2, β), serotonin (5-HT 2), muscarinic, and benzodiazepine receptors. This multi-action antiallergic drug was first approved in Japan as an oral tablet formulation indicated to allergic rhinitis (AR) treatment. Clinical trials have investigated its safety and non-sedating effects when administered orally. In 2009, an ophthalmic formulation was developed and approved by the FDA and Drug Administration for the treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis when administered BID.

The efficacy and safety of bepotastine besilate 1.5% ophthalmic solution were studied previously using the CAC model of allergic conjunctivitis. These studies reported positive effects, including a reduction in ocular itching, which lasted for up to 8 hr, and even extended to 16 hr. Although the CAC model presents several advantages such as reproducibility, controlled allergen exposure, and the possibility of internal control when administered in the contralateral eye as a placebo solution, environmental models allow accurate assessment of chronic exposure to allergens with the normal fluctuating effects of geographic location, diversity in allergen sources, weather, and evidence of clinical improvements over several days or weeks, reflecting the real-life benefits of this therapeutic option. Carr and collaborators published a natural exposure, a placebo-control clinical trial where the efficacy of bepotastine besilate 1.5% BID over 2 weeks was evaluated. In this trial, bepotastine resulted in efficacy and safe treatment of allergic conjunctivitis administered twice a day compared with placebo solutions.

### Update and clinical utility of alcaftadine ophthalmic solution 0.25% in the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis [^479a26ff]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

This study was designed to assess duration of action at 24 hours as a previous study evaluated duration at 16 hours with results suggesting a longer duration than the time frame allowed. Additionally, it allowed for direct comparison of both once-daily antiallergic ocular formulations. While both medications were successful in preventing ocular itching at the 16-hour CAC, alcaftadine 0.25% efficacy was most apparent in the itch scores where a greater number of scores were ≤ 1.5, whereas the scores for olopatadine were evenly distributed between 0 and 2. The findings in this study further support the quick onset and long duration of alcaftadine 0.25% in the prevention of signs and symptoms associated with allergic conjunctivitis.

McLaurin et alutilized the same study design as Ackerman et alwith 157 subjects completing the second study. Data collected from both multicenter studies were then pooled. Findings in the second study mirrored the comparison outcomes of alcaftadine 0.25% versus olopatadine 0.2% at the 16-hour allergen challenge and in mean itch scores at all time points demonstrating repeatable results.

Olopatadine 0.7% was newly released on the market, but at this time, it has only been compared to olopatadine 0.1% and 0.2%. However, we feel in the short future, a study comparing the onset of action and, more importantly, duration of action of olopatadine 0.7% and alcaftadine 0.25% will be conducted.

### Effect of alcaftadine 0.25% on ocular itch associated with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis: a pooled analysis of two multicenter randomized clinical trials [^40f81f11]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Allergic conjunctivitis is a common ocular condition estimated to affect 15%–40% of the general population in developed nations.–Ocular allergy is characterized by an inflammatory response primarily of the conjunctival mucosa that also may affect the cornea and eyelids. Allergic conjunctivitis encompasses a group of disorders that include seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC), perennial allergic conjunctivitis (PAC), as well as more severe and chronic conditions of vernal keratoconjunctivitis and atopic keratoconjunctivitis. Acute allergic conjunctivitis is primarily caused by IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation and the subsequent release of histamine and other inflammatory mediators. Release of histamine induces ocular itching (the hallmark symptom of ocular allergy), as well as other ocular signs and symptoms, including redness, eyelid swelling, chemosis, and tearing. These ocular symptoms are commonly accompanied by nasal symptoms or rhinitis, and often collectively referred to as allergic rhinoconjunctivitis.–Ocular itching is directly related to the action of histamine on H 1 receptors in the conjunctiva. Other allergic symptoms have been attributed to the action of H 1 or H 2 receptors on the vasculature.

### Efficacy of epinastine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in allergic conjunctivitis by conjunctival cedar pollen allergen challenge [^3ce3ad2a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Epinastine hydrochloride is a selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist that also inhibits IgE receptor-mediated histamine release from mast cells.

Objective

To show the superiority of epinastine 0.05% ophthalmic solution (epinastine) to placebo ophthalmic solution (placebo) and noninferiority to olopatadine 0.1% ophthalmic solution (olopatadine) for cedar pollen antigen-induced ocular itching and conjunctival hyperemia.

Methods

The study was conducted in ophthalmologically asymptomatic adult volunteers with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis using a conjunctival allergen challenge test. Subjects were randomized into 3 groups (n = 87) to evaluate superiority to placebo (visits 4 to 6) and 2 groups (n = 86) to evaluate noninferiority to olopatadine (visit 7). At each visit, a single administration of the study medication was instilled at 15 minutes (visit 4), 4 hours (visit 5), 8 hours (visit 6), and 4 hours (visit 7) before the conjunctival allergen challenge test. Ocular itching and conjunctival hyperemia of allergic conjunctivitis were assessed after the conjunctival allergen challenge test.

Results

For the primary end point, epinastine showed superiority to placebo for the inhibition of ocular itching and conjunctival hyperemia induced at 4 hours after the dose (equivalent to 4-times-daily dosing). For the secondary end points, epinastine significantly inhibited itching and conjunctival hyperemia induced at 15 minutes and 8 hours after the dose (equivalent to 2-times-daily dosing) compared with placebo. In addition, epinastine demonstrated noninferiority to olopatadine for ocular itching and conjunctival hyperemia. No adverse drug reactions or serious adverse events were reported throughout the study, indicating that epinastine has a good safety profile.

Conclusion

Epinastine is effective and safe for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.

Trial Registration

### Changes in tear function and the ocular surface after topical olopatadine treatment for allergic conjunctivitis: an open-label study [^e1694ca6]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% eye drops represent a new class of anti-allergic agent with combined antihistaminic and mast cell-stabilizing properties.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe alterations in tear function and the ocular surface in patients with allergic conjunctivitis and to analyze the effect of topical olopatadine treatment on corneal sensitivity, tear function, and impression cytology variables.

Methods

This was a single-center, 3-visit, prospective, open-label study conducted in patients with allergic conjunctivitis. Patients received 1 drop of topical olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% BID for 3 weeks. At each visit, patients and healthy control subjects underwent routine ophthalmic examinations and measurements of corneal sensitivity and tear function (Schirmer test of tear quantity, tear film break-up time [BUT], fluorescein staining of the cornea). All control subjects and a subgroup of patients also underwent conjunctival impression cytology for assessment of squamous metaplasia and goblet cell density. The outcomes of interest were changes in corneal sensitivity, tear function, and impression cytology variables after 3 weeks of treatment with olopatadine eye drops, both in patients with allergic conjunctivitis and between patients and controls.

Results

At enrollment, the study included 46 eyes of 23 patients (9 men, 14 women; age range, 20–42 years) with allergic conjunctivitis; results were calculated based on the 21 patients who completed the study. The control group consisted of 70 eyes of 35 healthy subjects (13 men, 22 women; age range, 22–39 years). Before treatment, 64.3% of the eyes of patients with allergic conjunctivitis had a fluorescein staining score of > 1 point, whereas after treatment, 14.3% had a score of > 1 point (P < 0.001). Patients' mean (± SD) corneal sensitivity improved to 55.0 ± 2.5 mm from the pretreatment value of 42.5 ± 2.5 mm (P < 0.001). Mean BUT values before and after treatment were 8.1 ± 3.5 and 14.0 ± 7.0 seconds, respectively (P < 0.001). Before treatment, patients' mean squamous metaplasia grade was 2.5 ± 0.5; at the end of treatment, it had decreased to 1.0 ± 0.5 (P < 0.001). The mean pretreatment goblet cell density of 545 ± 85 cells/mm2 improved to 1,090 ± 100 cells/mm2 after treatment (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

In the patient population studied, the disorder of tear function, squamous metaplasia, and loss of ocular surface goblet cells associated with allergic conjunctivitis improved with topical olopatadine treatment.

### Management of ocular allergy itch with an antihistamine-releasing contact lens [^045f695d]. Cornea (2019). Medium credibility.

Between the 2 studies, there were 24 ocular AEs in a total of 488 subject eyes (4.9%). The majority of these were mild in severity and not considered study related (see Supplemental Table 2, Supplemental Digital Content 1). Two ocular AEs in study 2 were judged severe; these involved an increased lacrimation (reported by one subject in both eyes). In addition, one subject in study 2 opted out of the study due to a pregnancy.

Visual acuity assessments were similar for control- and test-CL groups over the course of both studies. Small changes, within normal variation, were reported in the CL-corrected and best-corrected visual acuity of subject eyes in both studies; this observation indicated that the addition of ketotifen to CLs had no adverse effects on visual acuity (see Supplemental Table 3, Supplemental Digital Content 1).

### Topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers for treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis [^b10a3cdf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Seasonal/perennial allergic conjunctivitis is the most common allergic conjunctivitis, usually with acute manifestations when a person is exposed to allergens and with typical signs and symptoms including itching, redness, and tearing. The clinical signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis are mediated by the release of histamine by mast cells. Histamine antagonists (also called antihistamines) inhibit the action of histamine by blocking histamine H1 receptors, antagonising the vasoconstrictor, and to a lesser extent, the vasodilator effects of histamine. Mast cell stabilisers inhibit degranulation and consequently the release of histamine by interrupting the normal chain of intracellular signals. Topical treatments include eye drops with antihistamines, mast cell stabilisers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combinations of the previous treatments, and corticosteroids. Standard treatment is based on topical antihistamines alone or topical mast cell stabilisers alone or a combination of treatments. There is clinical uncertainty about the relative efficacy and safety of topical treatment.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, for use in treating seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2014, Issue 7), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to July 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 17 July 2014. We also searched the reference lists of review articles and relevant trial reports for details of further relevant publications.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing topical antihistamine and mast cell stabilisers, alone or in combination, with placebo, no treatment or to any other antihistamine or mast cell stabiliser, or both, that examined people with seasonal or perennial allergic conjunctivitis, or both. The primary outcome was any participant-reported evaluation (by questionnaire) of severity of four main ocular symptoms: itching, irritation, watering eye (tearing), and photophobia (dislike of light), both separately and, if possible, by an overall symptom score. We considered any follow-up time between one week and one year.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion among review authors and the involvement of a third review author. We followed standard methodological approaches used by Cochrane.

Main Results

We identified 30 trials with a total of 4344 participants randomised, with 17 different drugs or treatment comparisons. The following antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers were evaluated in at least one RCT: nedocromil sodium or sodium cromoglycate, olopatadine, ketotifen, azelastine, emedastine, levocabastine (or levocabastine), mequitazine, bepotastine besilate, combination of antazoline and tetryzoline, combination of levocabastine and pemirolast potassium. The most common comparison was azelastine versus placebo (nine studies). We observed a large variability in reporting outcomes. The quality of the studies and reporting was variable, but overall the risk of bias was low. Trials evaluated only short-term effects, with a range of treatment of one to eight weeks. Meta-analysis was only possible in one comparison (olopatadine versus ketotifen). There was some evidence to support that topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo. There were no reported serious adverse events related to the use of topical antihistamine and mast cell stabilisers treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

It seems that all reported topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers reduce symptoms and signs of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis when compared with placebo in the short term. However, there is no long-term data on their efficacy. Direct comparisons of different antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers need to be interpreted with caution. Overall, topical antihistamines and mast cell stabilisers appear to be safe and well tolerated. We observed a large variability in outcomes reported. Poor quality of reporting challenged the synthesis of evidence.

### Role of antihistamines in ocular allergy [^55fdb075]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Although H(1) antihistamines are commonly used to treat allergic disorders and have demonstrated efficacy in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, data on the effects of these agents specifically on ocular symptoms are limited. Oral H(1) antihistamines inhibit some symptoms of pruritus and erythema in laboratory models and have been shown to be superior to placebo for relief of symptoms in clinical trials. Eye drops typically provide faster relief of ocular symptoms than oral agents, and combination therapy with a topical agent and an oral agent has been found to be superior to the oral agent alone. In general, oral H(1) antihistamines have been considered superior to intranasal corticosteroids for relief of ocular symptoms, but some studies have shown equal efficacy for these agents, or even superior efficacy for intranasal corticosteroids.
