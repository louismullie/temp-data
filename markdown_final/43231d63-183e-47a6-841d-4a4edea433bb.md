## Question

What is the recommended Viagra dosage?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the recommended Viagra (sildenafil) dosage is for erectile dysfunction. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled standard dosing, timing, maximum frequency, and titration. Then, I should verify absolute contraindications and major drug–drug interactions that override routine dosing. Next, I will examine dose adjustments for hepatic and renal impairment and reconcile any conflicting FDA sources. After that, I should consider elderly patients and practical dose optimization. Finally, I will review key adverse effects and counseling points and clearly distinguish ED dosing from PAH dosing to avoid confusion.

> Let me first confirm the on-label regimen for erectile dysfunction. The FDA-labeled starting dose for most adults is 50 mg taken as needed approximately 1 hour before sexual activity, with a permissible window of 30 minutes to 4 hours, and the maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day; the dose may be titrated based on efficacy and tolerability down to 25 mg or up to a maximum of 100 mg, and tablets come in 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg strengths and may be taken with or without food [^117SrG3Q] [^113KQU8C].

> Wait, before dosing, I need to screen for absolute contraindications. Concomitant use with any form of nitrates is contraindicated because of the risk of profound hypotension, and use with guanylate cyclase stimulators such as riociguat is also contraindicated; patients should be counseled to stop sexual activity and seek care if they develop chest pain, dizziness, or nausea during sex given the cardiac demand of sexual activity [^117SrG3Q] [^111pMShk].

> Next, I should review interaction-driven dose modifications. Hold on, I should verify the key interacting classes. Patients on alpha-blockers should be hemodynamically stable on the alpha-blocker before initiating sildenafil, and sildenafil should be started at 25 mg to mitigate orthostatic hypotension risk; with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, a 25 mg starting dose is advisable due to increased sildenafil exposure, and with ritonavir the maximum dose is 25 mg within a 48‑hour period because ritonavir can raise sildenafil levels about 11‑fold, making standard daily dosing unsafe; avoid combining with other PDE-5 inhibitors to prevent additive effects [^117SrG3Q] [^112wvREf] [^116y2Kgr].

> I need to ensure hepatic impairment adjustments are clear for ED. For erectile dysfunction, start at 25 mg in hepatic impairment, including Child-Pugh A or B and even C when ED dosing is considered; this aligns with multiple SPL entries and is consistent with the traditional Viagra label approach of using a lower starting dose in hepatic impairment due to reduced clearance and higher exposure [^1148HtG9] [^111HhjaS] [^116N2pcw]. But wait, let me verify an apparent discrepancy: some FDA materials for sildenafil used in PAH indicate no dose adjustment for mild-to-moderate hepatic impairment, which applies to Revatio regimens rather than ED; I should explicitly separate the ED on-demand dosing from PAH chronic dosing to avoid conflation [^111byArs] [^111NSheM].

> Now renal impairment. I should double-check the ED-specific guidance. For erectile dysfunction, patients with severe renal impairment, typically creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min, should start at 25 mg; similar caution applies in dialysis settings, where conservative dosing as per severe renal impairment is advised, acknowledging that dialysis will not enhance sildenafil elimination due to high protein binding; these ED-focused SPL recommendations are consistent with clinical prudence for reduced clearance states [^111pMShk] [^113okgpK] [^111mYP5s] [^11398GQg]. Hmm, wait a minute, another FDA source notes no dose adjustment is required even in severe renal impairment, but that pertains to the PAH labeling and should not override the ED-centered, on-demand dosing recommendations; I should confirm we are applying the correct labeling context for ED here [^111byArs].

> Let me consider older adults. While there is no mandated specific dose adjustment solely for age, clinical pharmacology cautions support conservative dose selection in those 65 years and older because of the higher prevalence of hepatic, renal, or cardiac comorbidity and polypharmacy; many clinicians reasonably begin at 25 mg in frail or multimorbid older adults and titrate to effect as tolerated, recognizing that iterative attempts are often needed to find the optimal dose [^111byArs] [^113hkdin].

> I should confirm dose optimization and real-world use. Patients often achieve better satisfaction after education and titration, with many requiring several attempts and, in some cases, escalation to 100 mg for optimal effect; structured counseling and flexible dosing based on response improve outcomes, reinforcing the need not to judge efficacy after just one attempt and to titrate within the labeled range [^115EVE1k] [^113hkdin].

> Next, I should review safety profile and key counseling points. Common adverse effects include headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and transient visual disturbances, with meta-analytic data showing increased risk of these non-serious events versus placebo but no significant increase in serious adverse events or discontinuations for adverse events overall; counsel patients on priapism, to seek urgent care if an erection lasts more than 4 hours, and warn about rare but serious vision changes such as NAION and sudden hearing loss, which require immediate evaluation [^111uvhgG] [^113y5n1E] [^112wvREf].

> Hold on, I should verify that ED dosing is not confused with PAH dosing. For pulmonary arterial hypertension, sildenafil is marketed as Revatio at 20 mg three times daily orally or 10 mg IV every 8 hours, with a much higher daily exposure and different interaction guidance; this is distinct from the on-demand Viagra regimen for ED, and cross-application of one label's dosing to the other indication would be inappropriate [^112KpJsc] [^1149DZzD] [^111NSheM].

> Let me now synthesize the practical recommendation, checking consistency one last time. For most patients with erectile dysfunction, prescribe sildenafil 50 mg as needed about 1 hour before sexual activity, allow a 30 minute to 4 hour window based on individual response, do not exceed once daily use, and titrate to 100 mg if needed or down to 25 mg if not well tolerated; begin at 25 mg in hepatic impairment, severe renal impairment, or with alpha-blockers or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, and in ritonavir-treated patients limit to 25 mg within a 48‑hour period, while strictly avoiding use with nitrates or riociguat and counseling on cardiovascular symptoms during sex and priapism precautions [^117SrG3Q] [^116CrvkC] [^112wvREf] [^111pMShk].

---

The recommended Viagra (sildenafil) dose for erectile dysfunction is 50 mg taken about 1 hour before sexual activity, not more than once daily [^114xYUWu] [^117SrG3Q]. Adjust based on response and tolerability: increase to 100 mg or decrease to 25 mg as needed [^117SrG3Q] [^115EVE1k]. Start at 25 mg in patients ≥ 65 years, those with severe renal or hepatic impairment, or those taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors. Do not use with nitrates or riociguat because of the risk of severe hypotension [^117SrG3Q] [^111pMShk] [^116CrvkC]. Common side effects include headache, flushing, and visual disturbances [^113y5n1E] [^111uvhgG]; seek immediate medical care for chest pain, vision loss, or erections > 4 hours [^112wvREf] [^1179DQLF].

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Standard dose**: 50 mg orally, as needed [^114xYUWu], about 1 hour before sexual activity [^117SrG3Q].
- **Timing flexibility**: May be taken 30 minutes to 4 hours before activity [^117SrG3Q] [^111pMShk].
- **Maximum frequency**: Once per day [^117SrG3Q] [^111pMShk].
- **With or without food**: High-fat meals may delay onset.

---

## Dose adjustments

### Based on effectiveness and tolerability

Increase to **100 mg** if the response is inadequate and the drug is tolerated [^117SrG3Q] [^115EVE1k]. Decrease to **25 mg** if adverse effects occur [^117SrG3Q].

---

### Special populations

| **Population** | **Recommended dose** |
|-|-|
| Elderly (≥ 65 years) | 25 mg initially |
| Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) | 25 mg initially [^117SrG3Q] [^116CrvkC] |
| Hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A or B) | 25 mg initially [^117SrG3Q] [^111HhjaS] |
| Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir) | 25 mg initially; max 25 mg every 48 hours [^117SrG3Q] [^116y2Kgr] |

---

## Contraindications and precautions

- **Nitrates**: Contraindicated due to severe hypotension risk [^117SrG3Q] [^111pMShk] [^114ZE86L].
- **Riociguat**: Contraindicated [^117SrG3Q] [^111pMShk].
- **Cardiovascular risk**: Use caution in recent MI, stroke, or unstable angina [^117SrG3Q] [^112wvREf].
- **Alpha-blockers**: Ensure stable therapy; start sildenafil at 25 mg [^117SrG3Q] [^112wvREf].

---

## Adverse effects

- **Very common (> 10%)**: Headache, flushing, dyspepsia, visual disturbances [^113y5n1E] [^111uvhgG].
- **Common (1–10%)**: Dizziness, nasal congestion, nausea, back pain, myalgia.
- **Rare**: Priapism, sudden hearing loss, NAION [^114wtdGt] [^111GQbms] [^115YAcyU].

---

## Overdose

In overdose, **Symptoms** include severe hypotension, priapism, and visual disturbances [^11398GQg] [^113dscSV]. Management includes **supportive care**; dialysis is not effective [^11398GQg].

---

## Patient counseling

Counsel patients that **onset is 30 minutes to 1 hour** and may be delayed by high-fat meals. Advise them to **avoid nitrates and other PDE-5 inhibitors** [^117SrG3Q] [^116y2Kgr] [^111pMShk]. Instruct them to **seek care for chest pain, vision loss, or erections > 4 hours** [^114wtdGt] [^1179DQLF]. When used correctly, Viagra is effective for ED; **individualized dosing** and attention to contraindications optimize safety and outcomes [^111DnrcR].

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sildenafil citrate PO (also known as Viagra):

- **Cardiovascular events**: Use caution in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia, resting hypotension, uncontrolled hypertension, heart failure, unstable angina, or left ventricular outflow obstruction, such as aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.

- **Hearing loss**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden hearing loss, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness.

- **Hypotension**: Use caution in patients with resting hypotension, fluid depletion, severe left ventricular outflow obstruction (aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), autonomic dysfunction, or concomitant use of antihypertensives or α-blockers.

- **Increased serum sildenafil levels**: Use caution in patients taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors. Reduce starting dose to 25 mg daily.

- **Increased serum sildenafil levels**: Use caution in patients taking ritonavir. Maximum dose of 25 mg every 48 hours for erectile dysfunction.

- **Priapism**: Use caution in patients with anatomic penile abnormalities, such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease, or conditions predisposing to priapism, such as sickle cell disease, multiple myeloma, or leukemia.

- **Vision loss, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden vision loss.

### Viagra [^117SrG3Q]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

- **Dosage information**: For most patients, the recommended dose is 50 mg, taken as needed, approximately 1 hour before sexual activity. However, Viagra may be taken anywhere from 30 minutes to 4 hours before sexual activity. The maximum recommended dosing frequency is once per day. Based on effectiveness and tolerance, the dose may be increased to a maximum recommended dose of 100 mg or decreased to 25 mg.

- **Use with food**: Viagra may be taken with or without food.

- **Dosage adjustments in specific situations**: Viagra was shown to potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates, and its administration in patients who use nitric oxide donors such as organic nitrates or organic nitrites in any form is therefore contraindicated [see Contraindications (4.1), Drug Interactions (7.1), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. When Viagra is co-administered with an alpha-blocker, patients should be stable on alpha-blocker therapy prior to initiating Viagra treatment, and Viagra should be initiated at 25 mg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5), Drug Interactions (7.2), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

- **Dosage adjustments due to drug interactions**:

- **Ritonavir**: The recommended dose for ritonavir-treated patients is 25 mg prior to sexual activity, and the recommended maximum dose is 25 mg within a 48-hour period because concomitant administration increased the blood levels of sildenafil by 11-fold [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6), Drug Interactions (7.4), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **CYP3A4 inhibitors**: Consider a starting dose of 25 mg in patients treated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.

### Sildenafil: Efficacy and safety in daily clinical experience [^112NysBF]. European Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Sildenafil citrate (Viagra) is a potent selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase type 5 proposed for the oral treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED). The aim of this study was to evaluate its efficacy and safety when used in daily practice in patients with ED of various aetiology.

From September 1998 to April 1999, 380 patients chose sildenafil as treatment for their ED. One hundred forty-five (38%) of them suffered from psychogenic ED, 125 (33%) from organic ED, and 110 (29%) from mixed aetiology. The efficacy was assessed by the grade of erection achieved and the occurrence of satisfactory sexual intercourse. Safety and tolerance were evaluated by recording any side effects or adverse events.

The overall efficacy of Viagra was 77%, with a response of 100% among the group of hormonal patients, 88% for psychogenic, 72% for mixed, 69% for diabetes, 65% for vascular, and 60% for neurological symptoms. A few mild to moderate side effects were recorded.

These results indicate that the use of sildenafil citrate is an effective and well-tolerated therapy for men with ED of various aetiology, with an overall success rate of 77%.

### Management of sildenafil treatment failures [^114o1jcA]. Current Opinion in Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Although oral type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitors are considered first-line therapy for most causes of erectile dysfunction due to their high efficacy, ease of use, and acceptable safety profile, some individuals fail to respond, mainly due to end-organ failure. This communication reviews the management of sildenafil failures in light of recent advances.

- **Recent findings**: Sildenafil failures can be attributed to either lack of efficacy or side effects; issues may involve the physician, patient, and his partner. Physicians may contribute to sildenafil failure and discontinuation due to inadequate instructions, lack of adequate follow-up, suboptimal dosing, lack of adequate trial, and insufficient clarification about safety issues. Studies have demonstrated that progression of endothelial dysfunction and diminished cavernosal smooth-muscle content are recognized organic factors which cause end-organ dysfunction and ultimately treatment failure.

Proper counseling, medication optimization, and modifying associated risk factors can provide success in men initially failing sildenafil therapy for erectile dysfunction. Other treatment modalities that may be considered when sildenafil failure occurs include vacuum devices, intraurethral and intracavernosal administration of vasoactive drugs alone or combined with sildenafil. Penile prosthesis implantation is considered a last resort if all first-line and second-line therapies fail.

### The effects of sildenafil citrate on intrauterine growth restriction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1171wffF]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

The effect of sildenafil citrate on delivery outcomes is significant. The effect on birth weight at delivery is depicted in Fig. 3, Panel A. The neonatal birth weight was the primary outcome measuring the effectiveness of sildenafil citrate in IUGR. An increase of 112.64 g (MD = 112.64, 95% CI [33.84, 191.44], P = 0.005) was observed in neonates exposed to sildenafil citrate, with significant increases in the sildenafil-treated group compared to control subjects, favoring the sildenafil group. A considerable degree of heterogeneity was noted among studies (I² = 77%, Chi² = 30.49, P < 0.0001).

- **Forest plot details**:
	- A: Neonatal weight at delivery
	- **B**: Gestational age at delivery
	- **C**: Stillbirth rate
	- **D**: Neonatal death
	- **E**: Neonatal ICU admission rate

The effect of sildenafil citrate on gestational age at delivery is represented in Fig. 3, Panel B. The outcome was gestational age (GA) at delivery, available for three randomized studies, where the mean GA corresponded to preterm delivery. As gestational age (weeks) is a continuous variable, the pooled MD was determined to be 0.82 (95% CI [-0.15, 1.80], P = 0.10), reflecting non-significant increases in pregnancy duration among sildenafil-treated groups compared to control groups. The forest plot for the effect on GA showed a statistically non-significant difference between treated and control groups, with a tendency to favor sildenafil. There was a high degree of heterogeneity across the selected studies (I² = 89%, P < 0.00001 for the Q test).

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^114zqX7B]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

There was generally no information on intervals between dosing and timing of intercourse, either for speed of onset of effect or duration of effect. The following points summarize the findings from the four studies comparing tadalafil 20 mg with placebo:

- **Relationship between dosing and intercourse**: The majority of attempts and successful attempts occurred within four hours, and about 90% within 12 hours. Success rates with tadalafil 20 mg and placebo did not differ, irrespective of when intercourse occurred.

No other studies provided useful information relating to timing of intercourse after dosing.

### Psychosocial outcomes and drug attributes affecting treatment choice in men receiving sildenafil citrate and tadalafil for the treatment of erectile dysfunction: results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label, crossover study [^114PCRjg]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Although sildenafil citrate (sildenafil) and tadalafil are efficacious and well-tolerated treatments for erectile dysfunction (ED), preference studies have shown that patients may favor one medication over the other.

- **Aim**: To determine whether psychosocial outcomes differed when men with ED received tadalafil compared with sildenafil.

- **Main outcome measures**: Measures included a treatment preference question, Psychological and Interpersonal Relationship Scales (PAIRS), and Drug Attribute Questionnaire.

- **Methods**: Randomized, open-label, crossover study. After a 4-week baseline, men with ED (N = 367; mean age = 54 years; naïve to type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor therapy) were randomized: tadalafil for 12 weeks then sildenafil for 12 weeks or vice versa (8-week dose optimization/4-week assessment phases). During dose optimization, patients started with 10 mg tadalafil, or 25 or 50 mg sildenafil and could titrate to their optimal dose (10 or 20 mg tadalafil; 25, 50, or 100 mg sildenafil). Medications were taken as needed. Patients completing both 12-week periods chose which medication to continue during an 8-week extension.

- **Results**: Of 291 men completing both treatment periods, 71% (N = 206) chose tadalafil and 29% (N = 85) chose sildenafil (P < 0.001) for the 8-week extension. When taking tadalafil compared with sildenafil, men had higher mean endpoint scores on PAIRS Sexual Self-Confidence (tadalafil = 2.91 vs. sildenafil = 2.75; P < 0.001) and Spontaneity (tadalafil = 3.32 vs. sildenafil = 3.17; P < 0.001) Domains and a lower mean endpoint score on Time Concern.

### Sildenafil [^11398GQg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

In studies with healthy volunteers, single doses of up to 800 mg resulted in adverse events similar to those observed at lower doses, though with increased rates and severities. In cases of overdose, standard supportive measures should be adopted as necessary. Renal dialysis is not expected to accelerate clearance since sildenafil is highly bound to plasma proteins and is not eliminated in the urine.

### Treatment of erectile dysfunction: What should we do next [^113HMNNA]. World Journal of Surgery (2000). Low credibility.

Because sildenafil (Viagra) is scheduled to be clinically available in the near future, urologists in Japan must prepare for changes in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. The drug will surely influence our clinical style of diagnosis and treatment of the dysfunction. We herein discuss this issue, referring to favorable and unfavorable effects that will be brought about by the drug. We also propose several future studies that we should conduct, including those on testosterone replacement therapy. We present results of our experiment using testosterone replacement therapy in aged rats and speculate about the mechanism by which the hormone replacement works in the sex center of the brain.

### Intravenous sildenafil citrate and post-cardiac surgery acute kidney injury: a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^115dE1E1]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2020). Low credibility.

- **Editor's key points**:
	- Acute kidney injury is common after cardiac surgery.
	- Intravenous sildenafil has been shown to decrease kidney injury after cardiac surgery in a porcine model.
	- This clinical trial in human cardiac surgery patients evaluated the effect of intravenous sildenafil on various surrogate markers of renal injury, inflammation, and organ damage; no meaningful beneficial effect was found.
	- Intravenous sildenafil is unlikely to be beneficial for this indication, and larger trials are not warranted based on the findings of this study.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in up to one-third of all patients after cardiac surgery. It is characterised by an acute decline in kidney function as determined by elevations in serum creatinine and is associated with significant increases in postoperative complications and an almost four-fold increase in the risk of postoperative death. Our understanding of the underlying processes is poor, and there are no effective preventive measures. Experimental studies have demonstrated that preservation of endogenous nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability is renoprotective in response to a variety of injurious stimuli. Endogenous NO activity is increased by the administration of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) type 5 inhibitor sildenafil citrate, which is used clinically in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (Viagra®; Pfizer, New York, NY, USA) and more recently as an intravenous formulation (Revatio®; Pfizer) for pulmonary hypertension and acute right ventricular failure. We have shown that intravenous sildenafil prevents post-cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) AKI.

### Viagra [^111pMShk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2017). High credibility.

Viagra (sildenafil citrate) tablets: What is the most important information I should know about Viagra? Viagra can cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly to an unsafe level if it is taken with certain other medicines. Do not take Viagra if you take any other medicines called "nitrates". Nitrates are used to treat chest pain (angina). A sudden drop in blood pressure can cause you to feel dizzy, faint, or have a heart attack or stroke.

Do not take Viagra if you take medicines called guanylate cyclase stimulators, which include riociguat (Adempas®), a medicine that treats pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic-thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

Inform all your healthcare providers that you take Viagra. If you need emergency medical care for a heart problem, it will be important for your healthcare provider to know when you last took Viagra.

Stop sexual activity and get medical help right away if you experience symptoms such as chest pain, dizziness, or nausea during sex. Sexual activity can put an extra strain on your heart, especially if your heart is already weak from a heart attack or heart disease. Consult your doctor to assess if your heart is healthy enough to handle the extra strain of having sex.

### Prescribing all phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors to a patient with erectile dysfunction — a realistic and feasible option in everyday clinical practice — outcomes of a simple treatment regime [^115ftyc8]. European Urology (2006). Low credibility.

In clinical practice, the objective was to apply and evaluate outcomes of a treatment regime in which the patient had the opportunity to try all the available phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitors.

- **Methods**: Patients eligible for treatment with PDE5 inhibitors were prescribed eight tablets with a shorter-acting substance (four tablets sildenafil 100mg and four tablets vardenafil 20mg) and eight tablets with a long-acting substance (tadalafil 20mg). Outcomes of the regime were recorded.

- **Results**: Of the 186 patients, 64 (34%) had not been treated previously (naïve), and 122 (66%) were undergoing treatment for their erectile dysfunction. The overall treatment response was 89% (165 of 186 patients); 78% (n = 145 of 186 patients) tested all three substances. No significant difference in choice between long- and shorter-acting medications in the overall material was observed. Two-thirds of the naïve patients (n = 64) preferred a shorter-acting substance (p < 0.01). Every fifth man requested both a shorter- and a long-acting medication to accommodate his need.

- **Conclusion**: If patients are given the opportunity in clinical practice to try all three available PDE5 inhibitors, the overall response rate is very high, almost 90%. No significant difference in patient preference between long- and shorter-acting drugs was observed. Treatment choice was based mainly on efficacy or duration of effect.

### Effect of Viagra on the foveolar choroidal circulation of AMD patients [^112K8Y5s]. Experimental Eye Research (2005). Low credibility.

To investigate the effects of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) on foveolar choroidal circulation in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study was conducted. Fifteen male AMD patients received a dose of 100 mg of sildenafil or a matching placebo on two separate days. Laser Doppler flowmetry was performed to assess relative choroidal blood velocity (ChB(Vel)), volume (ChB(Vol)), and flow (ChB(Flow)) in the study eye prior to drug administration at baseline and 30, 90, 180, and 300 minutes after dosing.

Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity (CS), mean arterial blood pressure (BPm), heart rate (HR), intraocular pressure (IOP), and ocular perfusion pressure (PP) were determined. In comparison to placebo, sildenafil did not cause any statistically significant changes in mean ChB(Vel) (ANOVA, P = 0.12), ChB(Vol) (ANOVA, P = 0.24), or ChB(Flow) (ANOVA, P = 0.46). There were no statistically significant changes in CS (ANOVA, P = 0.59), BCVA (P = 0.58), IOP (P = 0.81), or HR (P = 0.07) throughout the study. However, significant decreases in BPm (P = 0.006) and PP (P = 0.006) were observed 30 minutes after sildenafil administration. Overall, sildenafil citrate did not cause any statistically significant changes in the foveolar choroidal circulation of AMD patients.

### The effects of sildenafil citrate on intrauterine growth restriction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116LhmgZ]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

A limited number of experimental and human studies reported on the beneficial effect of sildenafil citrate on improving fetal outcomes in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) pregnancies. This meta-analysis was performed in view of the contradictory results on sildenafil citrate's effect on pregnancies complicated by IUGR, including recent meta-analyses. We included nine of the published reports on sildenafil's effect on IUGR pregnancies, which passed the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Several outcomes associated with sildenafil citrate treatment in improving IUGR outcomes were analyzed: neonatal weight, gestational age at delivery, neonatal ICU admission post-delivery, stillbirth, and neonatal birth rates. Doppler ultrasound parameters were selected in assessing the systolic/diastolic blood pressure ratio and plurality index. These were excluded from further analysis due to difficulties in evaluating the pregnancy outcomes with these variables and the varying ultrasound strength in specific cases. Study subjects included pregnant women with IUGR who were grouped into sildenafil-treated and control (untreated, placebo) groups. Selected studies included participants from different ethnicities (Egypt, the UK, Brazil, and Canada). Except for one study, which included participants with shorter (< 24 weeks) gestation, the gestational age ranged from 24–34 weeks. It was noteworthy that most of the selected studies originated from Egypt, thus necessitating the need for parallel studies on different ethnicities.

The main finding of the study is the improvement in fetal growth afforded by sildenafil citrate treatment in pregnancies complicated by IUGR.

### The effects of sildenafil citrate on intrauterine growth restriction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115ycsjW]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

This study demonstrates the effect of sildenafil citrate in the improvement of pregnancy outcomes in women with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The application of sildenafil increases birth weight and prolongs pregnancies, but it did not positively affect the rates of stillbirths, neonatal deaths, and neonatal ICU admissions. This finding might be relevant for future human studies on sildenafil citrate.

### Efficacy of 1, 5, and 20 mg oral sildenafil in the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension: a randomized, double-blind study with open-label extension [^1115Bj8x]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Sildenafil is one of the most widely used drugs in the treatment of PAH. The dose of 20 mg TID was approved based on the results of the SUPER-1 study, which demonstrated that sildenafil 20 mg TID appeared to reach the plateau of the dose-response curve for 6MWD, despite the larger hemodynamic effects seen with the highest dosage (80 mg TID). These results raise the question as to whether a lower dosage could have a similar effect on 6MWD compared to the approved dose. This aspect was addressed in the present study.

We found a significant increase from baseline in 6MWD at 12 weeks with all sildenafil doses; however, only at higher doses (5 and 20 mg TID) was the improvement of a magnitude considered to be clinically relevant (~40 m). In the absence of a placebo control arm, the small non-clinically significant increase in 6MWD in the 1 mg TID group in the double-blind phase should be interpreted with caution as being a treatment effect, as it is possible that this improvement could be seen as a "placebo effect" due to participation in an RCT.

Among dose groups, the change in 6MWD from baseline was significant only with sildenafil 20 mg TID compared with sildenafil 1 mg TID. A Williams trend test confirmed that sildenafil 1 mg TID was the only dose statistically inferior to the approved dose of 20 mg TID. Generally, patients had greater improvements in hemodynamic parameters with sildenafil 20 mg TID versus 1 mg TID; however, these improvements were not statistically significantly different. Significant differences were observed between sildenafil 1 mg TID and 20.

### Efficacy, safety and patient acceptance of sildenafil citrate as treatment for erectile dysfunction [^117EYLNe]. The Journal of Urology (2000). Low credibility.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of sildenafil citrate as a treatment for erectile dysfunction.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 433 completely evaluated men with chronic erectile dysfunction were treated with sildenafil citrate. Response was assessed prospectively by baseline and follow-up physician interviews, and by a patient self-administered 15-item questionnaire. This questionnaire covered domains such as patient treatment response and satisfaction, partner treatment satisfaction, comparative previous treatment satisfaction, adverse effects, and patient and partner quality of life.

- **Results**: Out of the 304 men (70.2%) who completed the questionnaire, 278 received sildenafil, including 186 who had previously undergone treatment for erectile dysfunction, principally involving intracavernous injection therapy. A response was elicited by a median dose of 100 mg in 188 patients (67.6%) who achieved an erection suitable for sexual intercourse. Those with psychogenic erectile dysfunction responded significantly better than those with organic dysfunction (p < 0.001). An erection suitable for intercourse was attained by 30.8% of patients with erectile dysfunction after radical prostatectomy and 80% with cavernous veno-occlusive dysfunction. Among previous responders to intracavernous injection therapy, 29.9% were refractory to sildenafil, while 33.3% of previous nonresponders responded to sildenafil. The sildenafil response was considered inferior to the intracavernous injection response by 43.6% of the men who had previously responded to intracavernous injection, with 51.5% continuing to receive it.

### Long-term follow-up of retinal morphology and physiology after 2000 mg sildenafil overdose as a means of attempted suicide: a case report [^113dscSV]. BMC Ophthalmology (2022). Low credibility.

Usually, sildenafil is administered at a dosage of 25–100 mg/day. Auso et al. reported sildenafil-induced visual adverse effects in 3–11% of men who received this drug at doses of 25–100 mg, in 50% of men who received 200 mg, and in 100% of men who received 600 or 800 mg of this drug. These findings indicate that ocular adverse effects are dose-dependent. To our knowledge, this is the first case report that describes long-term follow-up (over 6 months) in a patient who overdosed on sildenafil (2000 mg).

A sildenafil overdose is associated with a variety of ocular side effects; compared with other ocular effects, reduction in the BCVA is less common. A 32-year-old woman with a history of primary pulmonary hypertension received oral sildenafil (60 mg/day) over 5 years, showed a decrease in BCVA to 20/100 in the left eye, and was diagnosed with parafoveal retinal pigment epithelium atrophy. Another study reported a mild decrease in BCVA to a decimal visual acuity of 0.7 and fractional visual acuity of 20/30 at the initial visit in a patient who received high-dose sildenafil. In contrast, BCVA did not decrease in our patient, although the BCVA observed immediately after the overdose remains unknown in this case. Although studies have reported mydriasis after ingestion of 100 mg of sildenafil, the pupillary diameter and light reflex were normal in our patient at the initial 3-month examination. Serous foveal detachment has been reported after ingestion of 150–400 mg of sildenafil; however, our patient did not show retinal detachment.

### A double-blind placebo-controlled evaluation of the acute effects of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) on visual function in subjects with early-stage age-related macular degeneration [^111tBvsn]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2002). Low credibility.

To assess the effects of a single 100-mg dose of sildenafil citrate on visual function in men with early-stage age-related macular degeneration, a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted. Nine men (mean age 71 years, range 59–85 years) with early-stage age-related macular degeneration (characterized by minimal visual impairment and large drusen in the macula) and 20/40 or better-corrected visual acuity in at least one eye were prospectively randomized. Each participant received either a placebo or sildenafil citrate (Viagra; Pfizer Inc, New York, New York) 100 mg as a single oral dose. After 7–14 days, they received the alternate treatment.

Subjects underwent various visual function tests — including visual acuity, Amsler grid, color discrimination (D15), traffic light, Humphrey perimetry, and photo-stress testing — in each eye before and at specific intervals within 8 hours after dosing.

Compared with placebo, no pattern of errors was evident in any visual function test following sildenafil administration. No statistically or clinically relevant changes from baseline were observed in visual acuity, Humphrey perimetry (corrected pattern standard deviation), D15 color discrimination, or photo-stress tests. Additionally, no clinically relevant changes were observed in the Amsler grid or traffic light tests. Sildenafil treatment was associated with transient mild or moderate headache, flushing, and rhinitis. Importantly, there were no visual adverse events spontaneously reported to the investigator.

A single 100-mg dose of sildenafil was well tolerated and produced no acute visual effects or exacerbation of preexisting conditions in this population.

### Effects of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) combined with nitrate on the heart [^114ZE86L]. Circulation (2000). High credibility.

Sildenafil citrate (Viagra) is indicated for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. Large and sudden decreases in systemic blood pressure were reported in a substantial number of patients taking sildenafil citrate combined with nitroglycerin. We studied the effect of sildenafil citrate on the relationship between changes in systemic blood pressure and coronary blood flow.

- **Methods and results**: Healthy male beagles were used to assess systemic blood pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and flow in the left circumflex artery (in which a critical stenosis was established) and left anterior descending coronary artery. After measurement of the hemodynamic variables, 2 mg/kg sildenafil citrate was administered via a nasogastric tube. Hemodynamic changes were monitored for 1 hour. Subsequently, the acute effect of nitrate combined with sildenafil citrate was studied by the bolus injection of 0.2 mg isosorbide dinitrate before and after sildenafil citrate. Systemic blood and pulmonary arterial pressures and circumflex flow did not change during this study; however, left anterior descending coronary arterial flow increased from 16.0 ± 5.8 to 24.6 ± 8.7 mL/min 1 hour after administration of sildenafil citrate. The prolongation of systemic blood pressure decrease and the circumflex flow decrement induced by isosorbide dinitrate after sildenafil citrate were significantly larger and longer than those before sildenafil citrate.

- **Conclusions**: Sildenafil citrate had the effect of vasodilation in a normal coronary artery; however, a combined effect with nitrate resulted in la

### Association between dosage frequency and the treatment outcomes of sildenafil in young and middle-aged men with erectile dysfunction: A Chinese, multicenter, observational study [^111tEGSY]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the correlation between the dosage frequency of sildenafil and its treatment outcomes in men with erectile dysfunction (ED).

Data were derived from a 4-week, multicenter, observational study involving 1,699 men, aged between 18 and 60, who had a clinical diagnosis of ED defined by the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM) score of ≤ 21. Erectile function and quality of sexual life were assessed at both the baseline and endpoint of sildenafil treatment (after 4 weeks) using various measures: SHIM, Self-Esteem and Relationship Questionnaire, 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, Erection Hardness Score, and the global efficacy question.

- **Results**:
	- Nine hundred thirty-five patients were enrolled in the ≤ 1 weekly cohort, 573 in the 2–3 weekly cohort, and 158 in the 4–7 weekly dosage frequency cohort.
	- After 4 weeks of treatment, a higher dosage frequency of sildenafil was associated with significant improvements in SHIM, Self-Esteem and Relationship Questionnaire, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey scores (all P < .0001).
	- Hyperlipidemia appeared to be a poor prognostic factor (odds ratio, 3.59; p = 0.04), whereas hypertension (odds ratio, 0.25; P < .01) and coronary heart disease (odds ratio, 0.56; p = 0.05) were sensitive to sildenafil treatment.

In conclusion, a higher dosage frequency of sildenafil is linked to better improvements in sexual function and quality of life for men with ED. Additionally, the concomitant treatment of hyperlipidemia is recommended.

### The effects of sildenafil citrate on intrauterine growth restriction: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111oQAzG]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Low credibility.

A limitation of this meta-analysis is the inclusion of studies with different dosages and frequencies of administration of sildenafil citrate, ranging from 50 mg tid to 25 mg tid and 20 mg tid, or 20 mg bid (twice a day), thereby necessitating addressing the dose dependency in future controlled studies. Accordingly, the choice of the ideal therapeutic dose of sildenafil will be hampered due to the lack of studies, thus requiring further research. Recent studies demonstrated the change in the pharmacokinetics of sildenafil citrate during pregnancy by increasing clearance rates due to induced CYP3A4 isoform. The decrease in the concentration of plasma protein and volume of distribution also contributes to the rise of sildenafil removal from the body. Although the recent clinical guideline from the Society for Maternal–Fetal Medicine did not recommend the use of sildenafil for IUGR treatment, future studies on the effect of sildenafil on fetal growth could reveal stronger evidence and shed more light on the subject of discussion. More studies covering larger sample sizes, including ethnic-specific growth chart analysis and considering the impact of confounding variables, are required for more definitive guidelines development.

### Ocular safety in patients using sildenafil citrate therapy for erectile dysfunction [^115zBhWR]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Sildenafil citrate improves erectile function in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) by selectively inhibiting cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), which is present in all vascular tissue. Sildenafil also has a weaker inhibitory action on PDE6, located in the rod and cone photoreceptors. Modest, transient visual symptoms — typically a blue tinge to vision, increased brightness of lights, and blurry vision — have been reported with sildenafil use and occur more frequently at higher doses. Visual function studies in healthy subjects and patients with eye disease suggest that sildenafil does not affect visual acuity, visual fields, and contrast sensitivity.

Transient, mild impairment of color discrimination can occur around the time of peak plasma levels. Spontaneous postmarketing reports of visual adverse events, including nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION), have been reported during the seven years that sildenafil has been prescribed to more than 27 million men worldwide. However, because men with ED frequently have vascular risk factors that may also put them at increased risk for NAION, a causal relationship is difficult to establish. No consistent pattern has emerged to suggest any long-term effect of sildenafil on the retina, other structures of the eye, or on the ocular circulation.

### Achieving treatment optimization with sildenafil citrate (Viagra) in patients with erectile dysfunction [^113hkdin]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Since its approval in 1998, sildenafil citrate (Viagra) has been shown to be efficacious in over 100 clinical trials involving more than 8,000 men with erectile dysfunction (ED). In clinical practice, however, many men do not continue long-term use of sildenafil for a variety of reasons. Here, six different aspects of optimizing treatment with sildenafil are described:

- **Intercourse success rates**: Considered a reflection of real-world effectiveness, these were assessed in 1,276 patients with ED. The results indicated that the cumulative probability of achieving intercourse success with sildenafil increased with the number of attempts, reaching a plateau after approximately eight attempts.

- **Comprehensive disease management approach**: This included a medical history, physical examination, educational materials about ED, modifications of risk factors, lifestyle changes, and counseling, resulting in successful intercourse in 74% of 111 patients taking sildenafil.

- **Physician survey**: A survey conducted among primary care physicians revealed that almost 50% did not routinely question their patients about ED symptoms. It is known that most patients would prefer their physician to take the initiative.

- **Reeducation and counseling**: Overall, 55% of 137 men who were previously not successful with sildenafil became successful after reeducation and counseling. This included information on patient and partner expectations, how to properly take the drug, titration to maximum dose, and a minimum trial of eight attempts for efficacy assessment.

- **Comorbidities and polypharmacy**: Many men with ED have underlying comorbidities or take multiple medications that are risk factors for ED.

Sildenafil has increased the pool of couples seeking treatment for this important health issue, as well as expanding the numbers of physicians treating it. Research into the growing field of erectile dysfunction is expanding at a rapid pace. Independent investigators worldwide now regularly contribute to our body of scientific knowledge. Novel oral therapies targeted at specific points along the erectile cascade are undergoing pre-clinical and early-phase registration trials, with the promise of rapid action, extended duration of responsiveness, and an improved side effect profile. In this review, we have highlighted recent information on the next generation of phosphodiesterase inhibitors and summarized the evolving research into centrally acting agents, which may lead to effective combination therapy.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^111uCxqL]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Combining all information on 50 mg and 100 mg with dose-optimized regimens, both all-cause and lack-of-efficacy withdrawals reported in about 5600 men were lower with sildenafil than with placebo, with NNTp values of 23 (17 to 37) and 25 (21 to 34) respectively. However, adverse event withdrawals were higher with sildenafil than with placebo, with an NNH of 120 (67 to 560).

For particular adverse events, reported in 2600 to 6300 men, occurrences were generally higher with sildenafil than with placebo, except for serious adverse events, which showed no difference. The NNH values varied between 4.9 (4.2 to 6.0) for men reporting at least one adverse event (49% of men taking sildenafil) to 18 (15 to 23) for those reporting dyspepsia. Headache was the most commonly reported individual adverse event, affecting 17% of men taking sildenafil, followed by flushing in 13% and dyspepsia in 7.8%. The majority of trials reported that adverse events were mostly mild or moderate and frequently transient.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^1118po7j]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

There were 35 included studies using sildenafil, treating 7,135 men with a mixture of conditions causing erectile dysfunction. Among these men, 3,279 received placebo and 3,856 received sildenafil, with the vast majority taking licensed doses of 25 to 100 mg. Optimized dosing with 25–100 mg was most commonly used (2,546 men), followed by 100 mg (506) and 50 mg (370). All studies were placebo-controlled with no active comparators. Quality scores were high: 11 trials scored 5 out of 5 points, 17 scored 4 points, six scored 3 points, and two scored 2 points. One additional study used a withdrawal model after successful treatment; however, information from the 205 men in this study was not included in this analysis.

There were eight included studies using tadalafil, treating 2,071 men with various conditions causing erectile dysfunction. Of these, 632 received placebo and 1,439 received tadalafil, with all but 35 taking licensed doses of 5 to 20 mg. All were placebo-controlled with no active comparators. Doses of 20 mg (1,258) and 10 mg (109) were most frequent, with no dose-optimized studies included. Quality scores were high: two trials scored 5 out of 5 points, one scored 4 points, four scored 3 points, and one scored 2 points. One additional trial was a population dose-response study and was not included.

There were seven included studies with vardenafil, treating 3,374 men with various conditions causing erectile dysfunction. Among these, 1,067 received placebo and 2,307 received vardenafil, all at licensed doses of 5 to 20 mg.

### Indirect comparison of interventions using published randomised trials: Systematic review of PDE-5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction [^115T5SUa]. BMC Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Combining all information on 10 mg and 20 mg with dose optimized regimens, adverse event outcomes were reported in 1,000 to 2,400 men and were generally higher with vardenafil than with placebo, except for serious adverse events, which showed no difference, and men with at least one adverse event, which was not commonly reported in these trials. The lowest (worst) number needed to harm (NNH) was 8.0 (6.9 to 9.6) for men reporting flushing. Headache was the most commonly reported individual adverse event in 15% of men taking vardenafil, followed by flushing reported in 13% and rhinitis in 7.9%. The majority of trials reported that adverse events were mostly mild or moderate, and frequently transient.

- **Comparing different treatments**: Continuous outcomes are compared in Table 8, which documents the number of trials and patients for which the consistently reported outcomes were available, together with the weighted mean result for both placebo and the top doses plus dose optimized regimens of individual PDE-5 inhibitors. There was remarkable consistency. For instance, the percentage of successful attempts at intercourse with placebo varied narrowly between 23% and 28%. The three PDE-5 inhibitors had success rates of 65% for sildenafil, 62% for tadalafil, and 59% for vardenafil. The final erectile function domain score and change from baseline were highly consistent for both placebo and PDE-5 inhibitors.

### Sildenafil [^111GQbms]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of sildenafil, which is marketed for both pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and erectile dysfunction. These reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size; therefore, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Cardiovascular events**: In postmarketing experience with sildenafil at doses indicated for erectile dysfunction, serious cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and vascular events have been reported in temporal association with the use of the drug. These events include myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, hypertension, pulmonary hemorrhage, and subarachnoid and intracerebral hemorrhages. Most of these patients, but not all, had preexisting cardiovascular risk factors. Many of these events were reported to occur during or shortly after sexual activity, while a few were reported to occur shortly after the use of sildenafil without sexual activity. Others were reported to have occurred hours to days after use coincided with sexual activity. It is not possible to determine whether these events are related directly to sildenafil, to sexual activity, to the patient's underlying cardiovascular disease, or to a combination of these or other factors.

- **Nervous system events**: Seizures and seizure recurrence have been reported.

- **Ophthalmologic events**: Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) has been reported (see warnings and precautions, patient counseling information).

Drug interactions:

- **Nitrates**: Concomitant use of sildenafil with nitrates in any form is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)].

- **Strong CYP3A inhibitors**: Concomitant use of sildenafil with strong CYP3A inhibitors is not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Moderate-to-strong CYP3A inducers**: Concomitant use of sildenafil with moderate-to-strong CYP3A inducers, such as bosentan, decreases sildenafil exposure. Dose up-titration of sildenafil may be needed when initiating treatment with moderate-to-strong CYP3A inducers. Reduce the dose of sildenafil to 20 mg three times a day when discontinuing treatment with moderate-to-strong CYP3A inducers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Clinical Studies (14)].

- **Use with strong CYP3A inhibitors**: Not recommended [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Oral sildenafil citrate (Viagra) for erectile dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis of harms [^111uvhgG]. Urology (2009). Low credibility.

To summarize and compare evidence on harms in sildenafil- and placebo-treated men with erectile dysfunction (ED), a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) were identified through an electronic search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, and Cochrane CENTRAL. The rates of any adverse events (AEs), most commonly reported AEs, withdrawals because of adverse events, and serious adverse events were ascertained and compared between sildenafil and placebo groups. Results were stratified by clinical conditions, and statistical heterogeneity was explored. Meta-analyses based on a random-effects model were also performed.

A total of 49 RCTs were included in the analysis. Sildenafil-treated men exhibited a higher risk for all-cause AEs (RR = 1.56, 95% CI: 1.38, 1.76), including headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and visual disturbances, compared with placebo-treated men. The magnitude of excess risk was greater in fixed-dose than in flexible-dose trials. The rates of serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events did not differ significantly between sildenafil and placebo groups. However, a higher dose of sildenafil was associated with a greater risk of AEs. The increased risk of harms was observed within and across clinically defined groups of patients.

There was a notable lack of RCTs reporting long-term (> 6 months) harms data. In short-term trials, men with ED randomized to sildenafil showed an increased risk of all-cause AEs, headache, flushing, dyspepsia, and visual disturbances. The exploration of different modes of dose optimization for better safety profiles remains an area for further research.

### A prospective study of the beneficial effects of dose optimization and customized instructions on patient satisfaction with sildenafil citrate (Viagra) for erectile dysfunction [^115EVE1k]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Our objective was to assess the effects of customized instructions and dose optimization on treatment satisfaction and improvement in erectile function (EF) with sildenafil citrate in men with erectile dysfunction (ED) who had not been previously treated with a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor. This 8-week, multicenter, open-label, flexible-dose (25, 50, or 100 mg sildenafil) study included two phases. During phase 1, patients took 50 mg sildenafil and followed the sildenafil sample package instructions. In phase 2, the sildenafil dose could be adjusted based on efficacy and tolerability, and investigators provided additional customized instructions.

The primary efficacy variable was the satisfaction rate, defined as patients responding "very" or "somewhat" satisfied to the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction [EDITS] Question 1. Other efficacy assessments included the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) and the percentage of successful sexual intercourse attempts.

Of the 1109 men (mean age, 54 ± 13 years) treated, 867 completed the study. In phase 1, 75% of patients were very or somewhat satisfied with treatment. The mean EF domain score on the IIEF increased from 14.3 at baseline to 23.5, and 79% of sexual intercourse attempts were successful. In phase 2, 53% of patients increased their sildenafil dose to 100 mg and 2% decreased to 25 mg. Satisfaction with sildenafil increased to 86%, 91% of sexual intercourse attempts were successful, and the mean IIEF EF domain score increased to 25.7.

### Ocular safety of sildenafil citrate when administered chronically for pulmonary arterial hypertension: Results from phase III, randomised, double masked, placebo controlled trial and open label extension [^1174DRen]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

In the open label extension, the first pivotal portion involved a forced masked upward titration (figure). The participants originally randomised to receive placebo or sildenafil 20 or 40 mg in the double masked study received a starting dose of sildenafil 40 mg three times daily during the first six weeks, after which the dose was increased to 80 mg three times daily. Those randomised to 80 mg sildenafil three times daily in the double masked study remained on this dose for the first six weeks of the extension and had a sham dose escalation. One down-titration was permitted for tolerability during the first 12 weeks of the extension study.

The open label extension study was unmasked after the last participant had completed at least three months of extension treatment. After unmasking, sildenafil was titrated according to clinical need as determined by the investigator and the participant to a maximum of 80 mg three times daily or to a minimum of 20 mg three times daily. Participants were to continue taking their optimised dose of sildenafil until the last enrolled patient had completed three years of treatment or until sildenafil was shown to be ineffective, poorly tolerated, or unsafe in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

### Ocular safety of sildenafil citrate when administered chronically for pulmonary arterial hypertension: Results from phase III, randomised, double masked, placebo controlled trial and open label extension [^115YAcyU]. BMJ (2012). High credibility.

At baseline, participants were randomised (1:1:1:1) to receive either 20, 40, or 80 mg of sildenafil or a placebo, administered three times daily. Participants randomised to receive 80 mg initially received 40 mg for one week and then were titrated to 80 mg. All other participants had a sham titration. The study drug was added to the participant's baseline drug treatment regimen and administered for 12 weeks.

The study used an automated interactive voice response system incorporating a central randomisation and drug supply scheme. The randomisation scheme was stratified by baseline walking distance (< 325 m, ≥ 325 m) and cause (primary pulmonary arterial hypertension, pulmonary hypertension secondary to connective tissue disease, pulmonary hypertension with surgical repair).

The interactive voice response system assigned numbers sequentially to the participants from the appropriate randomisation stratification group as they were determined to be eligible for treatment by the investigator. The drug supply scheme consisted of a list of pack numbers and corresponding treatment types. A unique pack number identified each drug pack. The interactive voice response system assigned participants a pack number from the list corresponding to the treatment assigned.

At the start of the masked study, the study site was instructed on the method for unmasking, which was either a manual or an electronic process. Masking codes were broken only in emergency situations for reasons of participants' safety. The investigator was encouraged to contact the study sponsor before unmasking.

### Sildenafil [^111byArs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Geriatric use**: Clinical studies of sildenafil did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: No dose adjustment for mild to moderate impairment is required. Severe impairment has not been studied [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

- **Patients with renal impairment**: No dose adjustment is required (including severe impairment CLcr < 30 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Nitrate cessation profiles in men wishing to use sildenafil citrate [^111H3qNL]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

To define the likelihood of nitrate users wishing to use sildenafil citrate being permitted by their nitrate-prescribing physicians to cease nitrate use, we conducted a study. A total of 248 patients with erectile dysfunction participated. All patients using or possessing nitrates who opted for sildenafil treatment had letters sent to their nitrate-prescribing physician, requesting permission to cease nitrate use.

Of the 248 letters sent, 236 (95.7%) received responses. The types of nitrate use reported included oral (72 patients), sublingual (150 patients), and transdermal (14 patients); the mean patient age was 64 years. In response to the question about permitting cessation of nitrate use to facilitate sildenafil use, 42% of the physicians (99 of 236) answered "yes". Specifically, for those using oral, transdermal, and as-required sublingual nitrates, the "yes" responses were 28%, 0%, and 53%, respectively.

A multivariable analysis identified five predictors of a "no" response: patient age greater than 65 years, duration of nitrate possession less than 6 months, oral/transdermal nitrate use, sublingual nitrate use more than once per year, and nitrate medication prescribed by a non-cardiology physician.

In conclusion, 42% of men with erectile dysfunction using nitrates were permitted to cease usage to facilitate sildenafil use. We also identified factors predicting a "no" response.

### Safety of sildenafil [^114EYnCm]. Current opinion in urology (2000). Low credibility.

Sildenafil has an excellent safety record in its clinical trials; however, there have been reports of deaths associated with its usage now that it is in widespread clinical use. Many of these deaths are clearly unrelated to the drug, although some may be related to usage in contexts where there are clear contraindications to its use. Some deaths may occur because the patients are at risk from cardiac problems, yet there remains an occasional unexplained death. There is no evidence at present to suggest that sildenafil is a specific causative factor, and the research so far has failed to support it as such.

### After sildenafil: Bridging the gap between pharmacologic treatment and satisfying sexual relationships [^117XbcE5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Erectile dysfunction is a prevalent and distressing problem. The availability of sildenafil citrate has significantly altered the way in which erectile dysfunction is treated. While this medication is extremely effective in restoring erectile function, it is often necessary to ensure that the partner is actively involved in treatment, since many men are in relationships characterized by sexual apathy, avoidance, and relationship conflict. These problems, if left untreated, can thwart the transition from sexual abstinence to sexual intimacy. Suggestions are offered for evaluating and intervening with men and their partners who are planning to resume a sexual life with sildenafil treatment for erectile dysfunction.

### Sildenafil misuse for its psychoactive properties? A case report [^114rPQxj]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Sildenafil is a widely used drug for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, typically in dosages ranging from 50 to 100 mg per day. Recreational use is reported among youth for its sexual function-enhancing effects. At the time of writing, however, no study has reported the use of sildenafil for its nonsexual, psychoactive effects.

We report a case of a 38-year-old male with opioid and sedative use disorder who self-administered sildenafil orally in a dose of up to 2000 mg per day for its psychoactive effects, primarily for 10 years, before seeking treatment. This case allows us to discuss the literature relevant to the misuse of sildenafil for psychoactive properties.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sildenafil citrate IV (also known as Viagra):

- **Cardiovascular events**: Use caution in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmia; resting hypotension; uncontrolled hypertension; heart failure; unstable angina; or left ventricular outflow obstruction such as aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis.

- **Exacerbation of hypotension**: Use caution in patients with resting hypotension, fluid depletion, severe left ventricular outflow obstruction (aortic stenosis or idiopathic hypertrophic subaortic stenosis), autonomic dysfunction, or the concomitant use of antihypertensives or α-blockers.

- **Hearing loss**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden hearing loss, which may be accompanied by tinnitus and dizziness.

- **Increased serum sildenafil levels**: Use caution in patients taking potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.

- **Priapism**: Use caution in patients with anatomic penile abnormalities such as angulation, cavernosal fibrosis, or Peyronie's disease, or conditions predisposing to priapism, such as sickle cell disease, multiple myeloma, or leukemia.

- **Vision loss, non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as sildenafil has been associated with an increased risk of sudden vision loss.

### The efficacy of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) in clinical populations: an update [^111DnrcR]. Urology (2002). High credibility.

Although certain risk factors are known to be associated with erectile dysfunction (ED), the demographic and ED characteristics of the population of men with ED are quite diverse. We examined results from randomized trials of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) to ascertain if efficacy differed across various subgroups of men with ED. In addition, we reviewed findings from long-term extension studies and published accounts of sildenafil use in clinical practice to determine if effectiveness is maintained with long-term sildenafil treatment and to determine if effectiveness in the clinical practice setting is consistent with that reported in clinical trials.

Data were pooled from 11 double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible-dose (taken as needed) studies to assess the efficacy (N = 2667) of sildenafil in men (aged 23 to 89 years) with ED of broad-spectrum etiology who were not receiving concomitant nitrate therapy. Efficacy evaluations included the International Index of Erectile Function, a global efficacy question ("Did treatment improve your erections?"), and a patient-recorded event log of sexual activity. Significantly improved erectile function was demonstrated for sildenafil compared with placebo for all efficacy parameters analyzed. More than 95% of patients reported that they were satisfied with the treatment.

### The effects of sildenafil citrate on intrauterine growth restriction: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1114qDHh]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). High credibility.

In view of its role as the main regulator of the delivery of nutrients for the fetus, and in light of the temporary interface that regulates the connection between maternal and fetal circulation, the placenta is responsible for sustaining fetal growth and development. Decreased placental surface area, overall volume, and diminished vascularization of the terminal villi are associated with fetal growth restriction. Reduced trophoblastic layer volume, resulting from excessive apoptosis, was demonstrated in the placenta of women with fetal growth restriction. Failure of cytotrophoblasts to migrate into the maternal spiral artery and subsequent interaction with natural killer cells is key for retaining the smooth muscle layer and internal elastic lamina. Consequently, higher blood velocity within the spiral artery results in a decreased lumen, negatively affecting perfusion and exchange of nutrients.

Doppler studies demonstrated the presence of uterine and umbilical arteries with high-resistance waveforms in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) pregnancies and were shown to be related to the disruption of spiral artery invasion by trophoblastic tissue and failure of the remodeling processes. Currently, there is no effective treatment regimen for IUGR apart from timely delivery. A recent study demonstrated the beneficial effect of direct infusion of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) combined with amino acids to the umbilical vein through the perinatal port, suggesting an alternative potential therapy for IUGR pregnancies.
