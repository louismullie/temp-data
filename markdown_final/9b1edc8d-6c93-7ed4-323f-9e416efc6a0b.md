## Question

A 58-year-old man with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis presents to the emergency department with new-onset abdominal pain and mild ascites. Laboratory studies reveal mildly elevated liver enzymes and a normal alpha-fetoprotein level. Doppler ultrasound of the abdomen shows evidence of portal vein thrombosis. The patient is hemodynamically stable and has no history of malignancy. The admitting team is considering the next steps in evaluating the cause of the portal vein thrombosis.

According to current guidelines, what imaging study should be obtained next to evaluate for a potential underlying cause of the portal vein thrombosis in this patient with cirrhosis, and what is the rationale for this investigation?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which imaging study should be obtained next to evaluate for a potential underlying cause of portal vein thrombosis in a 58-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis, new abdominal pain, and PVT identified on Doppler ultrasound, and what the rationale is for that choice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and characterizing the thrombus. Then, I should verify the need to exclude malignant portal vein invasion from hepatocellular carcinoma. Next, I will consider the role and limitations of Doppler ultrasound versus cross-sectional imaging. Finally, I should align the recommendation with current guideline statements and specify whether CT or MRI is preferred in this scenario.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why the next step matters. In cirrhosis, portal vein thrombosis is common and often reflects slowed portal flow and portal hypertension rather than a primary hypercoagulable state, but malignant portal vein tumor thrombus must be excluded because it changes management entirely, even when alpha-fetoprotein is normal, as AFP lacks sensitivity for HCC in this setting [^7350d7aa] [^e45a8bcd] [^a8368cfb].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic performance of Doppler ultrasound so I don't overstate it. Doppler ultrasound has good sensitivity and specificity for detecting PVT, around 89–93% and 92–99% respectively, but it is limited in characterizing the extent of thrombus, assessing mesenteric vein involvement, and distinguishing bland thrombus from tumor thrombus, which is why cross-sectional imaging is required for definitive evaluation in cirrhosis [^a8368cfb] [^327512d7].

> I should confirm the guideline direction now. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same next step: obtain contrast-enhanced cross-sectional imaging with CT or MRI to confirm the diagnosis, delineate the clot burden and chronicity, evaluate extension into mesenteric veins, and critically, exclude malignant venous obstruction attributable to HCC, which is mandatory in patients with cirrhosis who develop PVT [^aadb55a4] [^6b0c747c] [^7350d7aa] [^e45a8bcd] [^1fc8ea0b] [^cb1e9a80].

> Hold on, I should verify whether CEUS could substitute for CT/MRI here. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound can help differentiate bland from tumor thrombus in expert hands, but it does not replace multiphasic CT or MRI for comprehensive mapping of thrombus extent, mesenteric involvement, and baseline staging for longitudinal follow-up, so CEUS is not the guideline-preferred next step in this cirrhotic patient [^86665fc6] [^a8368cfb].

> Let me consider CT versus MRI in this case. Either multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is acceptable. CT is often faster and more available emergently, while MRI avoids radiation and may better characterize soft tissue and thrombus chronology; both have excellent sensitivity and specificity for PVT, and the choice should be individualized to availability, renal function, and contrast allergy considerations [^a8368cfb] [^3be82422].

> I should double-check that I'm not missing a competing priority. The rationale is threefold: confirm and characterize the thrombus, exclude malignant portal vein invasion, and establish a baseline for future comparisons. This directly informs whether anticoagulation is indicated and how urgently it should be initiated, which is precisely why guidelines mandate this cross-sectional imaging step before committing to long-term anticoagulation decisions in cirrhosis [^aadb55a4] [^7350d7aa] [^e45a8bcd].

> Bottom line, after verifying the evidence and guidelines, the next imaging study should be a contrast-enhanced multiphasic CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis to confirm PVT, map extent including mesenteric veins, assess chronicity, and exclude HCC tumor thrombus. This is the standard of care in cirrhosis with newly diagnosed PVT and will guide subsequent management decisions, including anticoagulation and transplant-related planning [^aadb55a4] [^6b0c747c] [^7350d7aa] [^e45a8bcd] [^1fc8ea0b] [^cb1e9a80].

---

The next imaging study should be a **contrast-enhanced CT or MRI** of the abdomen and pelvis to confirm portal vein thrombosis, define the extent of thrombus, and exclude malignant portal vein invasion from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [^aadb55a4] [^1fc8ea0b]. This is essential because Doppler ultrasound cannot reliably distinguish bland from tumor thrombus or assess mesenteric extension, and a normal AFP does not exclude HCC [^a8368cfb] [^7350d7aa]. CT is typically preferred for speed and availability, but MRI is reasonable if contrast is contraindicated or to better characterize chronicity and collaterals [^notfound]. A hypercoagulable workup is not indicated in cirrhosis unless there is additional thrombosis, family history, or atypical features [^fce73974] [^03b631fe].

---

## Rationale for cross-sectional imaging

Cross-sectional imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is indicated in cirrhotic patients with suspected PVT to:

- **Confirm the diagnosis**: Ultrasound can miss or incompletely characterize PVT, especially in obese patients or with extensive collaterals [^a8368cfb].

- **Define extent**: CT/MRI delineates thrombus extension into mesenteric veins and degree of occlusion, which guides management [^aadb55a4].

- **Exclude malignancy**: Differentiate bland thrombus from tumor thrombus; arterial enhancement within the thrombus suggests HCC invasion [^a689f6a8].

- **Guide therapy**: Extent and chronicity inform anticoagulation decisions and transplant planning [^3be82422].

---

## CT vs MRI: choosing the modality

CT and MRI are both acceptable; the choice depends on clinical context:

| **Factor** | **Ct** | **Mri** |
|-|-|-|
| Speed | Fast; widely available | Slower; less available |
| Contrast safety | Risk of nephrotoxicity | Gadolinium-based agents; safer in renal impairment |
| Soft tissue characterization | Moderate | Superior for chronicity and collaterals |
| Radiation exposure | Yes | No |

---

CT is **preferred for initial assessment** due to speed and availability, whereas MRI is useful when CT contrast is contraindicated or when better soft-tissue characterization is needed [^notfound].

---

## Role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)

CEUS can help distinguish bland from tumor thrombus by showing arterial-phase enhancement in tumor thrombus, but it is **not a substitute for CT/MRI** in cirrhosis because it cannot reliably assess full extent or mesenteric involvement and is operator dependent [^86665fc6] [^a689f6a8].

---

## Thrombophilia evaluation

Routine thrombophilia testing is **not indicated in cirrhosis** because portal hypertension and slow flow are the dominant drivers of PVT; testing is reserved for atypical features, additional thromboses, or strong family history [^fce73974] [^03b631fe].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Next imaging**: Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis [^aadb55a4] [^1fc8ea0b].

- **Primary goal**: Confirm PVT, define extent, exclude HCC tumor thrombus [^aadb55a4] [^7350d7aa].

- **Modality choice**: CT for speed; MRI if contrast contraindicated or for better characterization [^notfound].

- **CEUS**: Optional adjunct, not replacement [^86665fc6].

- **Thrombophilia**: Not indicated unless atypical features or family history [^fce73974] [^03b631fe].

---

Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI is the **next essential step** to confirm PVT, map extent, and exclude malignant invasion, directly informing management in this cirrhotic patient.

One meta-analysis suggested that mental recovery was consistently more rapid in patients whose treatment included a branched-chain amino acid infusion; three studies found lower mortality rates in patients who received this treatment, and two others suggested that the treatment increased mortality. Portal Hypertension and Variceal Bleeding Regardless of the etiology of cirrhosis, the development of portal hypertension is nearly universal and results from an increased resistance to portal flow secondary to scarring, narrowing, and compression of the hepatic sinusoids. When the portal pressure exceeds a certain threshold, it results in the development of varices. Approximately 50 percent of patients with cirrhosis develop varices, most commonly in the distal 2 to 5 cm of the esophagus.

The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of variceal hemorrhage recommend that patients with cirrhosis who present with evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding undergo an urgent upper endoscopic evaluation. 9 If no varices are observed, these patients should have repeat endoscopy at three-year intervals. If small varices are diagnosed, patients should have repeat surveillance at one-year intervals. Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is aimed at reducing the portal pressure gradient, azygous blood f low, and variceal pressure. 9 This treatment option should be performed in medical centers with particular expertise. TIPS has been shown to reduce portal hypertension and can be effective in converting patients with diuretic-resistant ascites to diuretic-sensitive ascites, as well as reducing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage. Evidence regarding whether or not TIPS improves survival is conflicting.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in the cirrhotic population is a challenging clinical phenomenon requiring a nuanced management approach. Uncertainty exists regarding the clinical significance of PVT in the cirrhotic population because the data for PVT are based mainly on retrospective, small cohort studies. Therefore, strong recommendations regarding the optimal timing, modality, and duration of therapy for PVT in the cirrhotic population cannot be made. However, this review aims to summarize the current literature and provide stepwise guidance in diagnosing and managing PVT in patients with cirrhosis.

Description

Portal vein thromboses (PVTs) are common in patients with cirrhosis and are associated with advanced portal hypertension and mortality. The treatment of PVTs remains a clinical challenge due to limited evidence and competing risks of PVT-associated complications vs bleeding risk of anticoagulation. Significant heterogeneity in PVT phenotype based on anatomic, host, and disease characteristics, and an emerging spectrum of therapeutic options further complicate PVT management. This Clinical Practice Update (CPU) aims to provide best practice advice for the evaluation and management of PVT in cirrhosis, including the role of direct oral anticoagulants and endovascular interventions.

Methods

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute CPU Committee and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPU Committee and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: Asymptomatic patients with compensated cirrhosis do not require routine screening for PVT. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: Patients with cirrhosis with PVTs identified on Doppler ultrasound should undergo cross-sectional imaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to confirm the diagnosis, evaluate for malignancy, and document the degree of lumen occlusion, clot extent, and chronicity. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT do not require a hypercoagulable workup in the absence of additional thromboemboli or laboratory abnormalities or family history suggestive of thrombophilia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT with evidence of intestinal ischemia require urgent anticoagulation to minimize ischemic injury. If available, these patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team, including gastroenterology and hepatology, interventional radiology, hematology, and surgery. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: Consider observation, with repeat imaging every 3 months until clot regression, in patients with cirrhosis without intestinal ischemia and recent (< 6 months) thrombosis involving the intrahepatic portal vein branches or when there is < 50% occlusion of the main portal vein, splenic vein, or mesenteric veins. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Anticoagulation should be considered in patients with cirrhosis without intestinal ischemia who develop recent (< 6 months) PVT that is > 50% occlusive or involves the main portal vein or mesenteric vessels. Patients who have increased benefit of recanalization include those with involvement of more than 1 vascular bed, those with thrombus progression, potential liver transplantation candidates, and those with inherited thrombophilia. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Anticoagulation is not advised for patients with cirrhosis with chronic (> 6 months) PVT with complete occlusion with collateralization (cavernous transformation). BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT warrant endoscopic variceal screening if they are not already on nonselective beta-blocker therapy for bleeding prophylaxis. Avoid delays in the initiation of anticoagulation for PVT, as this decreases the odds of portal vein recanalization. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Vitamin K antagonists, low-molecular-weight heparin, and direct oral anticoagulants are all reasonable anticoagulant options for patients with cirrhosis and PVT. Decision making should be individualized and informed by patient preference and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class. Direct oral anticoagulants may be considered in patients with compensated Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A and Child-Turcotte-Pugh class B cirrhosis and offer convenience as their dosages are independent of international normalized ratio monitoring. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 10: Patients with cirrhosis on anticoagulation for PVT should have cross-sectional imaging every 3 months to assess response to treatment. If clot regresses, anticoagulation should be continued until transplantation or at least clot resolution in nontransplantation patients. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 11: Portal vein revascularization with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting may be considered for selected patients with cirrhosis and PVT who have additional indications for transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting, such as those with refractory ascites or variceal bleeding. Portal vein revascularization with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunting may also be considered for transplantation candidates if recanalization can facilitate the technical feasibility of transplantation.

### Portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis: diagnosis, natural history, and therapeutic challenges [^94fba4f4]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatologists face dilemmas in clinical practice concerning the management of cirrhotic patients with PVT. To treat or not to treat with anticoagulant agents, what is the least hazardous treatment option in PVT, or the optimal dose, and for how long should it be administered, taking into consideration the bleeding risk in patients with clinically significant portal hypertension? All these questions become more critical in patients awaiting transplantation. Definitive answers concerning the impact of PVT and its prognostic effect on cirrhosis outcome are still needed.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^a8368cfb]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis — diagnostic imaging and thrombophilia workup: The initial diagnosis of PVT in cirrhosis is established on Doppler ultrasound, which has 89%–93% sensitivity and 92%–99% specificity for PVT. Cross-sectional imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI should be performed to assess for concurrent hepatic malignancy, confirm diagnosis of PVT, characterize PVT by extent, degree of occlusion, chronicity, and establish a baseline for longitudinal assessment, and both CT and MRI have excellent sensitivity and specificity for PVT. Best Practice Advice 3: Patients with cirrhosis and PVT do not require a hypercoagulable workup in the absence of additional thromboembolism or laboratory abnormalities or family history suggestive of thrombophilia, and as portal hypertension is the main driver of PVT development in cirrhosis, routine screening for thrombophilic disorders is not warranted in the absence of risk factors such as personal history of additional thrombi, family history of thromboembolic disease, or laboratory evidence of bone marrow disorder.

American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) 2020 portal vein thrombosis (PVT) evaluation and management — when "PVT suspected on ultrasound", if there is "Evidence for mesenteric ischemia or severe portal hypertension bleed?" the Yes branch directs "Admit to hospital for emergent evaluation and therapy", whereas No leads to "Obtain contrast-enhanced multiphase cross-sectional imaging to rule out malignant obstruction and confirm diagnosis of partially occlusive or complete main trunk PVT". Next, assess "Does the patient have an accepted indication for TIPS?"; if Yes, "Refer for TIPS to a center with advanced interventional radiology expertise", and if No, "Perform upper endoscopy to assess for high-risk varices and treat if present as per practice guidelines". Then determine "Is the patient an anticoagulation candidate?"; if No, "Follow clinically and manage portal hypertension complications", and if Yes, "If individual patient benefits outweigh risks, initiate therapeutic anticoagulation; consider transplant referral". During therapy, "Repeat cross-sectional imaging every 2 to 3 months on therapy to assess for treatment response or failure".

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^3dacf736]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis — anticoagulation monitoring and duration: Best Practice Advice 10 states patients with cirrhosis on anticoagulation for PVT should have cross-sectional imaging every 3 months to assess response, and if clot regresses, anticoagulation should be continued until transplantation or at least clot resolution in transplantation patients. Treated patients should be evaluated every 3 months with computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with reimaging every 3 months when complete recanalization or partial regression occurs. Anticoagulation can be discontinued for futility in nonresponders after 6 months, as recanalization is unlikely, and recurrent PVT after revascularization or treatment discontinuation occurs within 2–5 months in up to 38% of patients. A platelet count < 50 × 10⁹/L has been associated with a bleeding risk in patients on anticoagulation, so cautious use may be considered on an individualized basis, and thromboelastography may represent a promising tool to assess bleeding risk and may help guide decision making regarding risks and benefits of anticoagulation use.

### AGA clinical practice update on management of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis: expert review [^98ffa5be]. Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — risk factors and screening: Best Practice Advice 1 states that "Asymptomatic patients with compensated cirrhosis do not require routine screening for PVT", and risk factors for PVT in cirrhosis include portal hypertension, slow portal flow, metabolic syndrome, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are no symptoms specific to PVT in patients with compensated cirrhosis; it is reasonable, however, to perform Doppler ultrasound to evaluate for PVT if evidence of unexplained worsening portal hypertension (worsening varices, new or progressive ascites) is seen. Transplantation candidates should be evaluated for PVT as part of the transplantation evaluation, a multiphase, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can evaluate for both hepatocellular carcinoma and PVT in the same setting, and symptoms of new-onset abdominal pain should prompt evaluation for acute symptomatic PVT; recurrent PVT is pragmatically defined as occurring within the last 6 months based on data that lack of recanalization within 6 months is unlikely to respond to anticoagulation.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in cirrhosis — anticoagulation benefits, stratification, and monitoring are outlined as follows: "Even in the absence of intestinal ischemia, some patients with cirrhosis and PVT benefit from timely anticoagulation", and "In a large meta-analysis, anticoagulation increased recanalization rate with an odds ratio of 4.8 (95% CI, 2.7–8.7; P < .0001)". Decision-making "should be individualized on a case-by-case basis", dividing patients into "the following 3 groups based on PVT characterization: 1) recent but minimally obstructive (< 50%) thrombi, 2) recent and partial (> 50%) or completely obstructive and/or extensive thrombi, and 3) chronic, well-established thrombi with extensive collateralization". Additional considerations include "Comorbid hypercoagulable state, evolution of the thrombus over time (ie, regression or progression), presence of symptoms, and potential transplantation candidacy", and assessing "risks of anticoagulation… including history of bleeding, fall risk, frailty, and thrombocytopenia". For "recent PVTs (< 6 months) that are limited in extent and minimally obstructive (< 50%), it is reasonable to monitor with serial cross-sectional imaging", while "Individuals with symptomatic PVT, clinically worsening portal hypertension, awaiting liver transplantation, or those who have progression of the PVT on serial imaging would have higher potential benefits from anticoagulation".

Guidance statements — management of recent PVT by clinical setting and extent of portal vein (PV) occlusion are as follows: "In all patients with recent PVT and concern for intestinal ischemia, immediate consultation with surgery, critical care, interventional radiology, and hematology is recommended, with the need for surgery in cases of intestinal infarction". "In patients without cirrhosis and with recent PVT, directed antithrombotic therapy should be considered in order to avoid intestinal ischemia and prevent the development of chronic PVT with portal hypertension". For patients with cirrhosis, "Treatment should be considered on a case-by- case basis", and "Decisions for treatment of an individual patient should be based on expected benefit and minimization of clot extension risk". In cirrhosis with minimally occlusive "(< 50% obstruction of the lumen)" thrombosis of the main PV, "observation with serial imaging every 3 months without therapy is reasonable. Treatment for progressive clot should then be considered in this setting". The guidance also notes a separate scenario of "occlusive or partially occlusive (> 50% obstruction of the lumen) thrombosis of the main PV or mesenteric veins".

Guidance statements for HVT/BCS — diagnosis, surveillance, and therapy: "HVT-BCS should be considered in any patient with liver disease (recent or chronic) of unknown etiology. Suspicion should be even higher in a patient with a recognized prothrombotic disorder". For imaging, "Doppler ultrasound, performed by an experienced operator, is the reference imaging study for HVT/BCS". Hematologic evaluation is advised: "At the time of HVT/BCS diagnosis, a full thrombophilia workup is recommended, and even when one causal factor is identified, additional factors should be investigated. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended". Cancer surveillance is specified: "Surveillance for HCC in patients with chronic HVT/BCS is recommended as in the general cirrhosis population, with ultrasound every 6 months with or without alpha-fetoprotein determination". Given vascular perturbation, "HCC diagnosis in these patients should not rely on imaging criteria alone and should require histological confirmation". Treatment sequencing and referral are emphasized: "A progressive "step-up" therapeutic strategy according to the clinical response from less to more invasive therapies is recommended for HVT/BCS. Early referral to tertiary care centers with expertise in this disorder is recommended". Anticoagulation and shunt therapy are defined: "All patients with HVT/BCS, even in the absence of a recognized prothrombotic disorder, should receive therapeutic anticoagulation". and "TIPS or DIPS using PTFE-covered stents is the treatment of choice for HVT/BCS when medical therapy or angioplasty fail or are not feasible".

### Portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis: diagnosis, natural history, and therapeutic challenges [^9e7283db]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a frequent complication in cirrhosis and its prevalence increases with disease severity. Several factors are involved in the development and progression of PVT. The challenge for the management of PVT is the precise evaluation of the bleeding risk as opposed to life-threatening extension of thrombosis. Nevertheless, the impact on the progression and outcome of liver disease is unclear. A critical evaluation of the available data discloses that treating PVT in cirrhotics is safe and effective. However, there are open issues, such as which anticoagulant could represent a safer therapeutic option, and when and for how long this treatment should be administered to cirrhotic patients with PVT.

### Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications… [^cadf657e]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Cirrhosis leads to intrahepatic resistance, which causes portal hypertension and, at later stages, hepatic insufficiency, which disrupts the liver's normal metabolic functions. Together these features cause gut-barrier disruption and portosystemic shunting, resulting in the multisystem complications of cirrhosis, eg, hepatic encephalopathy, sarcopenia, ascites, and kidney injury. Cirrhosis can be diagnosed by liver biopsy but may also be diagnosed noninvasively. Elastography, a noninvasive assessment of liver stiffness measured in kilopascals, can typically confirm cirrhosis at levels of 15 kPa or greater. Approximately 40% of people with cirrhosis are diagnosed when they present with complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or ascites. Most prevalent cases of cirrhosis are caused by alcohol use disorder, hepatitis C, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, with many patients having overlapping causes.

4 However, hepatitis C is now curable with direct-acting antivirals and most newly diagnosed cirrhosis is due to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and alcohol use disorder.
5. What can be done to improve survival among patients with compensated cirrhosis. Survival for patients with cirrhosis is improved with control of their underlying chronic liver disease. Beyond that, screening for liver cancer with biannual ultrasound and α-fetoprotein is associated with higher rates of curative treatment when cancer is detected. When patients develop portal hypertension, nonselective β-blockers are associated with lower rates of decompensation or death. The causes of cirrhosis vary by context and many overlap.

In a study of 68 673 patients from a national sample of patients in the Veterans Administration, the causes of cirrhosis were hepatitis C, alcohol related, hepatitis C and alcohol related, NAFLD related in the extracellular matrix. This process disrupts the connection between hepatocytes and sinusoids where blood flows, leads to formation of nodules of fibrosis, and impedes portal inflow resulting in portal venous hypertension. Chronic liver injury results in increased vasoconstrictor signaling and decreased production of vasodilators, further restricting sinusoidal flow. Inflammatory injury from alcohol or steatosis also increases vascular resistance.

In both NAFLD and alcohol-related liver disease, heritable factors in lipid metabolism have been associated with progression of liver disease. 57 In addition, chronic liver injury causes hepatocyte loss and reduces the liver's capacity for metabolic activity including protein synthesis, detoxification, nutrient storage, and bilirubin clearance. Over time, patients may progress from compensated cirrhosis without clinical manifestations to decompensated cirrhosis with variceal hemorrhage, ascites, or hepatic encephalopathy. Portal hypertension, defined as a pressure gradient between the hepatic and portal vein of 10 mm Hg or greater, promotes development of varices.

PVT prevalence and risk factors: patients with cirrhosis — In liver transplant candidates, a study based on 849 patients with cirrhosis reported a prevalence of 9%, and an autopsy study showed PVT prevalence of 6.59% in patients with cirrhosis and 0.05% in patients without cirrhosis, while broader reports list prevalence in cirrhosis between 1.3% and 9.8%. Severity of portal hypertension and liver disease are major predictive factors, and decreased portal vein (PV) flow with thresholds ranging from 10 to 15 cm/s has been associated with increased PVT risk by Doppler ultrasonography. A meta-analysis found increased PVT incidence with nonselective beta-blockers (OR, 4.62; 95% CI, 2.50–8.53; P < 0.001; I² = 80%; P < 0.001), although confounding raises questions about an independent effect. For evaluation, testing for factor V Leiden and G20210A in cirrhosis is rarely useful and does not change management, and a detailed thrombophilia workup is not generally recommended unless specific concerns arise during history, routine laboratory, and imaging; because hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) invading the PV and/or hepatic vein (HV) is common, it is mandatory to rule out malignant venous obstruction with appropriate dynamic contrast-enhanced studies.

Concluding remarks

PVT in cirrhosis still has many unanswered questions. PVT is a relatively frequent event in advanced cirrhosis with severe portal hypertension, but also occasionally in early stages, in patients with a high level of systemic inflammation. Standard laboratory coagulation tests are unable to predict bleeding and are inadequate for the assessment of hemostatic status in cirrhotic patients; hence, more comprehensive tests are required to guide the management of thrombotic and bleeding complications. The importance of early detection of PVT led to a pretest scoring system to predict the probability of future or present PVT formation, but it needs to be assessed in prospective clinical studies.

Treatment is difficult because of the heterogeneity of patients with PVT. When cavernous transformation has occurred, prophylactic anticoagulation is reserved only for patients with thrombophilic conditions and/or a high risk of thrombus extension into the superior mesenteric vein. LT candidates should be carefully monitored, since PVT complicates the surgical procedure and anticoagulation is frequently required. A strict three-monthly imaging follow up should be performed to detect extension of the thrombus in cases without anticoagulation during the pre-transplantation period. There is sufficient evidence for inter­ventional therapy such as TIPS, despite its technical difficulties.

The use of anticoagulants in asymptomatic patients with decompensated cirrhosis, or patients with clinically significant PHT and cavernomatous transformation is controversial. Recent studies confirm the safety and efficacy of VKA or LMWH in cirrhosis. Results of clinical trials of DOACs in cirrhotics with PVT are pending, in order to determine their efficacy and safety. Furthermore, the treatment subgroups most likely to reap maximum benefit should be identified, allowing for a personalized management of PVT in cirrhosis.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) refers to the development of a non-malignant obstruction of the portal vein, its branches, its radicles, or a combination. This Review first provides a comprehensive overview of all aspects of PVT, namely the specifics of the portal venous system, the risk factors for PVT, the pathophysiology of portal hypertension in PVT, the interest in non-invasive tests, as well as therapeutic approaches including the effect of treating risk factors for PVT or cause of cirrhosis, anticoagulation, portal vein recanalisation by interventional radiology, and prevention and management of variceal bleeding in patients with PVT. Specific issues are also addressed including portal cholangiopathy, mesenteric ischaemia and intestinal necrosis, quality of life, fertility, contraception and pregnancy, and PVT in children. This Review will then present endpoints for future clinical studies in PVT, both in patients with and without cirrhosis, agreed by a large panel of experts through a Delphi consensus process. These endpoints include classification of portal vein thrombus extension, classification of PVT evolution, timing of assessment of PVT, and global endpoints for studies on PVT including clinical outcomes. These endpoints will help homogenise studies on PVT and thus facilitate reporting, comparison between studies, and validation of future studies and trials on PVT.

### Current knowledge and management of portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis [^8599d7ac]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is an increasingly recognised complication of cirrhosis whose incidence increases in parallel with the severity of cirrhosis. Several risk factors have been associated with the occurrence and progression of PVT. Although the negative effect of complete PVT on the surgical outcome of liver transplant recipients is clear, its impact on cirrhosis progression remains uncertain. Treatment options include anticoagulants and interventional thrombolytic therapies, which are chosen almost on a case-by-case basis depending on the characteristics of the patient and the thrombus. In this manuscript, we review current knowledge regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, diagnosis and classification, natural history, clinical consequences and treatment of non-neoplastic PVT in cirrhosis.

### Contemporary management of portal vein thromboses in patients with and without cirrhosis [^7ab85eba]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Portal vein thromboses (PVT) is a common clotting disorder that can be seen in patients with and without cirrhosis. There are no current clinical guidelines on management of portal vein thromboses in these two distinct populations given most studies are retrospective and comprised of heterogenous cohorts.

Recent Findings

When evaluating PVT, patients must first be stratified into those with cirrhosis and those without cirrhosis. In addition, a novel nomenclature can help categorize specific PVT types and determine the need and response to anticoagulation. The management of PVT in patients with cirrhosis varies and is primarily dependent on whether the PVT is recent or chronic. In contrast, patients without cirrhosis are almost always anticoagulated to avoid complications of PVT. Direct oral anticoagulants, low-molecular weight heparin, and vitamin-K antagonists have all been used in patients with and without cirrhosis, without clear guidance on optimal treatment duration and surveillance.

Summary

Direct oral anticoagulants are increasingly used for patients with PVT though there is limited data on the safety and efficacy of these medications. The risk/benefit profiles of various anticoagulants must be considered when choosing a therapeutic anticoagulant. There are ongoing studies evaluating outcome measures of different anticoagulants in patients with PVT. Large, multicenter, randomized controlled trials may help elucidate the efficacy of anticoagulants on various outcome measures in PVT, including recanalization, bleeding, and survival.

PVT prevalence and risk factors: patients without cirrhosis — PVT without cirrhosis is a rare disease, with an autopsy study showing a PVT prevalence of 0.05% and likely overestimation due to post mortem thrombosis. A combined evaluation by an experienced hematologist and hepatologist of every patient without cirrhosis who develops PVT is recommended. The thrombophilia workup is similar to that for hepatic vein thrombosis (HVT), and in contrast to cirrhosis, a detailed thrombophilia workup is warranted in most patients without cirrhosis who develop PVT. Obstruction of the extrahepatic portal venous system without cirrhosis is mostly related to myeloproliferative neoplasia, surgery, or inflammatory conditions affecting the digestive system organs or the spleen; contributors include bariatric surgery, splenectomy, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, appendicitis, and diverticulitis, and ~30% of these patients also have a systemic thrombophilic disorder.

### Challenging anticoagulation cases: acute extensive portal vein thrombosis in a patient without cirrhosis-evidence-based management of a rare clinical entity [^7017bb5e]. Thrombosis Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute non-cirrhotic and non-malignant portal vein thrombosis (aPVT) is a rare and heterogenous condition. Current guidelines recommend early initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation to prevent extension of thrombosis, and favor recanalization. Although not formally defined, a poor outcome in the acute setting would include thrombosis extension with progression to intestinal infarction. Patients are also at risk of negative long-term outcomes related to complications of portal hypertension, such as variceal bleeding, ascites, and portal cholangiopathy. Identifying patients at risk of these events despite early initiation of anticoagulation remains challenging. Trials comparing treatment strategies in those failing standard therapy with meaningful radiological and clinical endpoints, whether in the short or long term, are desperately needed. The objective of this review will be to discuss a real-life clinical case and propose a treatment approach for aPVT based on the available evidence. We will mainly focus on management strategies including anticoagulation, prognostic factors, and options beyond anticoagulation, such as thrombolysis, thrombectomy, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts. This review will not cover tumor portal vein thrombosis or thrombosis associated with cirrhosis.

### EASL clinical practice guidelines on vascular diseases of the liver [^99ff5cea]. Journal of Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vascular diseases of the liver include portal vein thrombosis (with or without cirrhosis), portosinusoidal vascular disorder, Budd-Chiari syndrome, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, non-obstructive sinusoidal dilatation and peliosis, splanchnic artery aneurysms, and hepatic arteriovenous fistulas. Except for portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis, these are all rare conditions. Since the last Clinical Practice Guidelines were issued by the European Association for the Study of the Liver in 2016, much data has been published on the diagnosis and management - medical and interventional - of patients with vascular liver diseases. Based on a thorough review of the relevant literature, recommendations are provided to address key clinical dilemmas. The document emphasises personalised care, considering individual risk factors and clinical presentation. Multidisciplinary management involving hepatologists, haematologists, pathologists, interventional radiologists and surgeons is essential in this area. Our aim is to provide guidance on the management of patients with vascular liver diseases based on the best available evidence.

Discussion

PVT increases the risk of portal hypertension and related complications, such as bleeding, thrombotic progression, and death. The presence of PVT also adds to the complexity of liver transplantation and increases the risk of early death after liver transplantation. Consequently, monitoring the outcome of PVT patients' prognosis is critical for clinicians to quickly assess PVT risk and make timely, more targeted decisions.

We analyzed the clinical outcomes of patients with PVT and identified protective and risk factors for portal vein recanalization. In our research, anticoagulation was the only independent protective factor for recanalization of portal vein thrombosis. However, the use of anticoagulants for patients with cirrhotic PVT remains controversial due to the uncertain prognosis of these patients. Additionally, anticoagulants for cirrhotic PVT have a limited suitable population recommended by the guidelines, and their optimal use is still unclear. This is due to insufficient clinical data on the safety and efficacy of anticoagulants for the treatment of PVT in cirrhosis. Accordingly, we analyzed the patients in our hospital to determine the current status of anticoagulants in the treatment of PVT in cirrhosis and analyzed the clinical and imaging outcomes of patients with PVT in cirrhosis to provide more experience in anticoagulation therapy. In addition, we also evaluated the impact of anticoagulation therapy on PVT. The results show that anticoagulation improves recanalization rates without increasing the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding and death rates within two years and improves liver function.

### Idiopathic portal vein thrombosis not related to hepatic disease or malignancy [^95f58594]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Acute portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare disorder defined by the sudden occlusion of the portal vein, which could be partial or complete. Prothrombotic states, inherited or acquired, are thought to be the cause in patients without cirrhosis or malignancy. However, the aetiology of some cases remains idiopathic despite a multidisciplinary diagnostic approach. The initial diagnostic modality to confirm PVT is either contrast-enhanced abdominal (CT) or MRI; as it can identify predisposing factors, and detect evidence of complications. Eliciting the underlying aetiology is critical to guide overall management and prevent future recurrence. The purpose of treatment is to stop thrombus extension and achieve portal vein patency by anticoagulation to optimise outcomes. Herein, we present an unusual case of spontaneous PVT in a young woman. We will also discuss the evaluation of patients without obvious aetiology.

Portal vein thrombosis

Increased levels of factor VIII (procoagulant driver) and decreased levels of protein C (anticoagulant driver), combined with reduced portal vein flow velocity and endothelial injury, increase the risk of portal vein thrombosis (PVT).

Many patients are asymptomatic; the diagnosis is often made on routine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) surveillance, or coincidentally during liver decompensation. However, PVT is independently associated with worsening decompensation, including variceal bleeding and with increased mortality in liver transplant candidates.

Initial diagnosis is made on Doppler US or CT imaging. MR/CT imaging should be performed to evaluate the extent of the thrombus and rule out neoplastic PVT/HCC. Consider screening for underlying thrombophilic conditions if there are extensive clots or other thromboses.

The management of PVT in cirrhosis is summarised in figure 2. Initial treatment is with anticoagulation, although treatment is not required in all cases. Chances of responding to anticoagulation are higher if treatment is started within 6 months of diagnosis. The recent Baveno VII guidelines recommend treatment in patients with cirrhosis and recent (< 6 months) PVT involving > 50% of the portal vein trunk lumen, any symptomatic PVT or PVT in potential liver transplant candidates. Treatment can also be considered if there is progression of thrombosis on early follow-up (1–3 months), or compromise of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV).

Liver biopsy in cirrhosis — bleeding risk and laboratory cutoffs are summarized as follows: "The risk of bleeding with liver biopsy, either percutaneous or transjugular, is low in the general population, but may be higher in patients with cirrhosis". In one study, "2,740 percutaneous liver biopsies performed in patients with advanced fibrosis or well-compensated cirrhosis documented a 0.6% bleeding rate with no bleeding-related deaths", with data suggesting association of postbiopsy hemorrhage with "thrombocytopenia (< 60,000/μL) and elevated INR (> 1.3)". Despite this, "current AASLD guideline recommendations on liver biopsy do not identify a specific INR or platelet cutoff in which the risk of bleeding is substantially increased, but suggest individualized approaches and assessment of other risk factors that may increase bleeding risk, as discussed above".

Conclusions

Warfarin following danaparoid sodium for the treatment of PVT in patients with liver cirrhosis was safe and effective. An early diagnosis of PVT along with the evaluation of the volume of PVT on CT and an early intervention would contribute to the higher efficacy of the treatment. Thus, we recommend anticoagulation for the management of PVT in liver cirrhosis. Prevention of PVT or successful recanalization of a previously thrombosed portal vein can potentially improve survival of such patients.

The effect of cirrhosis on antithrombin levels and the platelet count, in addition to the presence of renal failure or bacterial infections, should always be taken into consideration, as they may provoke an added risk for bleeding complications. According to the recent guidance published by the Anticoagulation Forum, cirrhotic patients with PVT should undergo endoscopic screening of esophageal varices and, if indicated, banding treatment should precede the LMWH treatment (either prophylactic doses or half therapeutic doses depending on the platelet count).

Recommendations for anticoagulation treatment based on the Baveno VI Consensus Workshop highlight the need for individualization of treatment. LT candidates should be on anticoagulation until transplantation to prevent re-thrombosis. If they remain untreated, an ultrasound follow up every 3 months or CT imaging every 6 months should be performed. In case of thrombosis extension, immediate use of anticoagulation is recommended. Comorbidities predisposing to prothrombotic conditions or extended PVT are among the factors that physicians should take into account, even in non-LT candidates for anticoagulation as a therapeutic option. On the other hand, according to the guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, acute PVT should be treated for at least 3 months with LMWH and switched to oral anticoagulant agents after patient stabilization. In fact, randomized controlled trials of anticoagulation thera­py for the prevention of recurrent thrombosis are lacking in cirrhotic PVT.

Several small clinical studies have assessed the impact of anticoagulation on recanalization rate and bleeding complications (Table 2). Senzolo et al have demonstrated in 56 cirrhotic patients with PVT that anticoagulation is associated with better recanalization rates and fewer portal hypertension complications. A retrospective study by Delgado et al demonstrated a 60% rate of partial or complete recanalization among 55 selected cirrhotic patients with PVT treated early with LMWH or VKA, findings in accordance with a previous study of 251 cirrhotics, candidates for LT, performed by Francoz et al. Data from a recent multicenter study including 76 cirrhotic patients with PVT, 51 of them on anticoagulation (LMWH or warfarin), confirms the low risk of life-threatening gastrointestinal bleeding events. In this study survival was inferior for treated patients (median 15 months) albeit not statistically significantly (P = 0.311), and PV patency was achieved in 28.5% of treated patients (P = NS).

Supporting data cited on-page note a prospective observational study of 102 patients with acute PVT (without cirrhosis) in which Ninety-five patients were started on early anticoagulation within 13 days; Thirty-eight percent recanalized, and no patient who failed to recanalize in the initial 6 months did so later. For chronic PVT with partial or minimal occlusion and no cavernomas, decision making "should be individualized" and such patients "may be considered for anticoagulation trial".

Treatment options for PVT in cirrhosis

Current evidence from case series and observational studies has not provided robust data for the optimal management of PVT in cirrhosis. The main concern with PVT treatment is to balance the bleeding risk against the life-threatening extension of thrombosis (Fig. 2).

Figure 2
Portal vein thrombosis in cirrhosis: algorithm for diagnosis and treatment

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs)

A critical issue is which anticoagulation could represent a safer therapeutic option, and when and for how long this treatment should be administered in cirrhotic patients with PVT. Anticoagulation, with LMWH or fondaparinux parenterally, and VKA orally have been used therapeutically in cirrhotic patients with PVT. Drawbacks include the subcutaneous administration and the presence of ascites in weight-adjusted dose for LMWH and close monitoring of the international normalized ratio (INR target range: 2–3 based on empirical rules), dietary limitations and interference with model for end-stage liver disease score for VKA. Cirrhosis affects coagulation tests, increasing INR and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and decreasing anti-Xa. Several studies have even documented a correlation between higher INR levels and increased severity of cirrhosis. This makes therapeutic drug monitoring difficult to interpret and optimize because INR elevation caused by warfarin cannot be differentiated from progression of the underlying disease. Intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin (UFH) is not indicated, because baseline aPTT in cirrhosis is often prolonged well above normal values and therefore the effective dosage will probably be underestimated. The aPTT test has not been assessed in cirrhotic patients and the target aPTT range is unclear in this group of patients. UFH cannot be used practically and conveniently for long-term treatment; nevertheless, it could be a potential option in patients with concomitant renal failure and/or hemodynamic instability.

Indeed, in the majority of patients with cirrhosis, PVT is an incidental finding, often during routine ultrasound, CT or MRI evaluation. The first-line technique for PVT detection is Doppler ultrasound. Contrast-enhanced imaging techniques are useful in further characterization of PVT. Intra-thrombus vascularity, observed in the arterial phase of contrast imaging studies, has been reported to be specific for malignant PVT on both CT and MRI. CEUS seems to be superior to Doppler US for the characterization and further evaluation of PVT, and consequently staging of HCC. In general, the sensitivity range for partial PVT detection for all imaging techniques is rather low (14.3–50%). Nevertheless, there is no consensus regarding the benefit of systematic screening of cirrhotic patients for PVT.

Sarin et al recently suggested a pretest probability assessment based on major (Child's class B or C, prior history of resolved PVT, prothrombotic risk factors such as factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation, MTHFR mutation) and minor (evidence of a large portosystemic shunt, large isolated gastric varices, HCC, previous/or active systemic venous thrombotic events or abortions, acute abdomen, new onset or worsening portal hypertension complications, recent endoscopic, radiological or surgical abdominal interventions, portal flow velocity < 15 cm/sec) criteria. The pretest scoring system requires assessment and validation in prospective clinical studies.

### Acute portal vein thrombosis unrelated to cirrhosis: a prospective multicenter follow-up study [^80b82288]. Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Current recommendations for early anticoagulation in acute portal vein thrombosis unrelated to cirrhosis or malignancy are based on limited evidence. The aim of this study was to prospectively assess the risk factors, outcome, and prognosis in patients managed according to these recommendations. We enrolled 102 patients with acute thrombosis of the portal vein, or its left or right branch. Laboratory investigations for prothrombotic factors were centralized. Thrombus extension and recanalization were assessed by expert radiologists. A local risk factor was identified in 21% of patients, and one or several general prothrombotic conditions in 52%. Anticoagulation was given to 95 patients. After a median of 234 days, the portal vein and its left or right branch were patent in 39% of anticoagulated patients (versus 13% initially), the splenic vein in 80% (versus 57% initially), and the superior mesenteric vein in 73% (versus 42% initially). Failure to recanalize the portal vein was independently related to the presence of ascites (hazard ratio 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.3–11.1) and an occluded splenic vein (hazard ratio 3.5, 95% confidence interval 1.4–8.9). Gastrointestinal bleeding and intestinal infarction occurred in nine and two patients, respectively. Two patients died from causes unrelated to thrombosis or anticoagulation therapy.

Conclusion

Recanalization occurs in one-third of patients receiving early anticoagulation for acute portal vein thrombosis, whereas thrombus extension, intestinal infarction, severe bleeding, and death are rare. Alternative therapy should be considered when ascites and splenic vein obstruction are present.

### Management of portal vein thrombosis in liver cirrhosis [^91b1baa3]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a fairly common complication of liver cirrhosis. Importantly, occlusive PVT might influence the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis. Evidence from a randomized controlled trial has shown that anticoagulation can prevent the occurrence of PVT in patients with cirrhosis without prior PVT. Evidence from several case series has also demonstrated that anticoagulation can achieve portal vein recanalization in patients with cirrhosis and PVT. Early initiation of anticoagulation therapy and absence of previous portal hypertensive bleeding might be positively associated with a high rate of portal vein recanalization after anticoagulation. However, the possibility of spontaneous resolution of partial PVT questions the necessity of anticoagulation for the treatment of partial PVT. In addition, a relatively low recanalization rate of complete PVT after anticoagulation therapy suggests its limited usefulness in patients with complete PVT. Successful insertion of a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) not only recanalizes the thrombosed portal vein, but also relieves the symptomatic portal hypertension. However, the technical difficulty of TIPS potentially limits its widespread application, and the risk and benefits should be fully balanced. Notably, current recommendations regarding the management of PVT in liver cirrhosis are insufficient owing to low-quality evidence.

ACG clinical guideline — portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis (PVT/MVT) with and without cirrhosis advises that thrombophilia evaluation be performed in non-cirrhotic patients lacking an obvious cause, and that in cirrhosis work-up is performed with prior thrombosis, unusual sites (e.g., hepatic veins), or family history; "JAK2 mutation testing should be obtained" to evaluate myeloproliferative neoplasms. Suspicion is raised by "abdominal pain disproportionate to physical findings", and intestinal ischemia is suspected with fever, ascites, rebound tenderness, leukocytosis, and elevated serum lactate. Doppler ultrasound of hepatic vasculature "should be obtained" for new cirrhosis, onset of portal hypertension (PH), or decompensation; endoscopic evaluation "should be performed" in chronic PVT to assess for varices. "More data are needed" before routine prophylactic anticoagulation to prevent PVT in cirrhosis, and for portal hypertensive cholangiopathy, endoscopic treatment is indicated for symptomatic cholangitis; choledocholithiasis or biliary stricture may also benefit, with surgery considered only when endoscopic therapy is ineffective.
