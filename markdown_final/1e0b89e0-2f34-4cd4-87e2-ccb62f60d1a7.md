## Question

46-year-old, female, presenting, low red blood cells, low hemoglobin, low, MCHC high MPV no history of this bloodwork being low before. low vitamin D as well but the iron profile is normal. B12 levels are normal, and creatine levels are low. Lower back and hip pain. Patient is positive for BRCA gene and had breast cancer at 29 caught early. No treatment. Could it possibley be multiple myeloma? Would this show it being active multiple myeloma and not in the smoldering stage?
Bone marrow biopsy scheduled as well as an endoscopy and colonoscopy and full body bone scan.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a 46-year-old woman with new anemia, low creatinine, and bone pain could have active multiple myeloma rather than smoldering myeloma, and how to interpret the planned workup and next steps. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how multiple myeloma is defined today versus smoldering myeloma. Then, I should verify whether her anemia meets myeloma-defining criteria. Next, I will review the significance of low creatinine and whether it alters the diagnosis. After that, I need to check what additional tests are required to confirm or exclude myeloma-defining events and biomarkers. Finally, I will synthesize the most likely diagnosis and outline immediate actions and follow-up, anchoring to SLiM-CRAB and contemporary guidelines [^114RUPwy] [^115ULuyv].

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic framework. Active multiple myeloma is defined by clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 10% or biopsy-proven plasmacytoma plus at least one myeloma-defining event, which includes CRAB features (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions) or SLiM biomarkers (≥ 60% clonal plasma cells, involved/uninvolved free light chain ratio ≥ 100 with involved FLC ≥ 100 mg/L, or more than one focal lesion ≥ 5 mm on MRI) [^114RUPwy] [^115ULuyv]. Smoldering multiple myeloma is defined by serum M-protein ≥ 3 g/dL or clonal plasma cells 10–59% without any myeloma-defining events or amyloidosis, so by definition it is asymptomatic and lacks CRAB/SLiM features [^111HFvEG] [^112AcYDX].

> Now, I need to check whether her anemia meets a myeloma-defining threshold. The IMWG anemia criterion is hemoglobin < 10 g/dL or a decrease of > 20 g/L from the lower limit of normal attributable to myeloma; if her hemoglobin is below 10 g/dL and other causes are excluded, that alone would satisfy the "A" in CRAB and establish active myeloma if clonal plasma cells are ≥ 10% or a plasmacytoma is present [^115ULuyv] [^114RUPwy]. Wait, let me verify the attribution step: iron studies reportedly normal and B12 normal reduce the likelihood of nutritional anemia, but I should confirm there is no chronic blood loss, hemolysis, CKD, or inflammation before attributing anemia to myeloma, which is why endoscopic evaluation is appropriate here [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about the bone pain yet. Bone pain raises concern for lytic lesions, but I need to ensure that any bone disease is documented on appropriate imaging because bone lesions must be proven on CT, PET/CT, or MRI to meet the "B" in CRAB; plain radiographs are no longer sufficient for initial staging in most settings [^111Di1jq] [^113NHkcp]. I should double-check that the planned full-body bone scan is actually a low-dose whole-body CT or PET/CT, since nuclear bone scans are not recommended for myeloma evaluation and can be misleading [^112huLv9].

> I will now examine the low creatinine. Low serum creatinine is not a myeloma-defining feature and does not, by itself, argue for or against active disease; it may reflect low muscle mass, high hydration, or normal variation, and it does not fulfill renal insufficiency criteria for myeloma, which require creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min or serum creatinine > 177 μmol/L (> 2 mg/dL) attributable to myeloma [^115ULuyv]. So, I should not overinterpret the low creatinine; it neither confirms nor excludes myeloma and should be contextualized with calculated creatinine clearance and urinalysis rather than used as a diagnostic discriminator [^112Ncmbn].

> Next, I should review what additional tests are mandatory to classify her disease. I need to confirm clonality and quantify tumor burden with serum protein electrophoresis, serum immunofixation, a 24-hour urine for UPEP/UIFE, and a serum free light chain assay; concurrently, I should obtain CBC, creatinine/eGFR, corrected calcium, LDH, and beta-2 microglobulin to assess for other CRAB features and prognosis [^113NHkcp] [^116paFzF]. But wait, what if light chain disease is present? A 24-hour urine study helps detect Bence Jones proteinuria, which can be missed by serum testing alone, so I should ensure urine studies are not omitted if light chain myeloma is suspected [^117U4cDh].

> I need to ensure the imaging plan is aligned with current standards. Whole-body low-dose CT or FDG-PET/CT is preferred to detect lytic lesions; if those are negative but suspicion remains high, whole-body MRI can identify medullary disease and focal lesions ≥ 5 mm that would meet SLiM criteria and upstage to active myeloma even without CRAB features [^113NHkcp] [^113FBrPb]. Hold on, I should verify that the "full body bone scan" ordered is not a technetium-99m bone scan; if it is, I should request substitution with low-dose whole-body CT or PET/CT to avoid false reassurance from a nondiagnostic study [^111Di1jq].

> Let me consider the bone marrow biopsy next. I should confirm that the planned marrow will include an estimate of clonal plasma cells, immunohistochemistry or multiparameter flow cytometry for phenotype, and cytogenetics/FISH for t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), del(17p), 1q gain/amplification, and del(13q), as these findings inform prognosis and may influence therapy selection if myeloma is confirmed [^113NHkcp]. If the plasma cell percentage is ≥ 60%, that alone would meet a SLiM biomarker and classify her as active myeloma regardless of CRAB features, so I should be prepared for that possibility [^114RUPwy].

> But wait, what if all CRAB and SLiM features are absent despite clonal plasma cells 10–59%? In that scenario, she would meet criteria for smoldering multiple myeloma, which is observed rather than treated outside of clinical trials, with surveillance every 3–6 months initially and risk stratification using validated models such as Mayo 20/2/20 or IMWG criteria incorporating cytogenetics [^112WXuZQ] [^117QTXoz]. I should double-check that if she is ultimately classified as high-risk SMM, early intervention with daratumumab has now shown improved progression-free and overall survival in a phase 3 trial, which may alter management discussions even in the absence of CRAB features [^115evKiN].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the following to distinguish active myeloma from smoldering myeloma in her case: whether hemoglobin is < 10 g/dL and attributable to myeloma, whether clonal plasma cells are ≥ 10% or ≥ 60% on marrow, whether there are bone lesions on CT/PET/MRI, and whether SLiM biomarkers are present, especially FLC ratio ≥ 100 with involved FLC ≥ 100 mg/L or more than one focal lesion on MRI [^115ULuyv] [^114RUPwy]. Given new anemia with bone pain and a normal iron profile, the pretest probability of active myeloma is high, but I must verify these myeloma-defining events with the appropriate labs and imaging before labeling her disease as active and initiating therapy [^notfound].

> Final reasoning and immediate actions: Yes, multiple myeloma is strongly suspected and could already be active disease if her anemia meets the < 10 g/dL threshold and is attributable to myeloma, pending confirmation of clonal plasma cells and exclusion of other causes; the planned bone marrow biopsy, modern skeletal imaging, and full myeloma laboratory panel are the correct next steps, and I should expedite them to avoid delays in treating potentially active disease [^115ULuyv] [^113NHkcp]. If active myeloma is confirmed, treatment should begin promptly; if smoldering myeloma is confirmed, I should risk-stratify and discuss surveillance versus early intervention, noting that high-risk SMM may benefit from daratumumab in appropriate candidates [^113JTimV] [^115evKiN].

It is **possible** that this 46-year-old woman with new anemia, bone pain, and a BRCA mutation has active multiple myeloma, but the current data are **insufficient to confirm** this diagnosis or exclude smoldering disease. The normal iron and B12 profiles reduce the likelihood of common nutritional anemias, while the low creatinine does not rule out myeloma. Definitive classification hinges on the pending bone marrow biopsy, serum/urine M-protein and free light chains, and advanced imaging (MRI or PET/CT) to assess for myeloma-defining events (CRAB or SLiM) [^115ULuyv]. If any myeloma-defining event is present, this would indicate active myeloma; if absent and plasma cells are 10–59% without symptoms, this would favor smoldering myeloma [^112AcYDX].

---

## Differential diagnosis of anemia

Anemia in multiple myeloma is typically normocytic, normochromic, and due to marrow infiltration, cytokine-mediated suppression, or renal impairment; **MCHC is usually normal or low**, not high. The patient's high MCHC is atypical for myeloma and suggests other causes such as hereditary spherocytosis, autoimmune hemolysis, or lab artifact. However, myeloma can rarely present with atypical indices, so this does not exclude the diagnosis.

---

## Relevance of BRCA mutation

BRCA mutations are not directly linked to multiple myeloma, but they **increase overall cancer risk** and may influence treatment decisions if myeloma is diagnosed. The early breast cancer history raises suspicion for a predisposition to malignancy, but it does not specifically indicate myeloma.

---

## Laboratory findings and multiple myeloma

- **Anemia**: Common in myeloma, but the high MCHC is unusual and warrants further evaluation.
- **Normal iron profile and B12**: Reduces likelihood of nutritional anemia, supporting marrow infiltration or chronic disease anemia.
- **Low creatinine**: Not a classic myeloma feature; myeloma more often causes normal or elevated creatinine due to renal involvement.
- **Low vitamin D**: Common and non-specific; may reflect chronic illness or limited sun exposure.

---

## Clinical symptoms and multiple myeloma

Bone pain is a hallmark of myeloma, typically from lytic lesions or osteopenia; **back and hip pain** are common sites. However, bone pain alone is insufficient to diagnose active myeloma without corroborating laboratory or imaging evidence.

---

## Diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma (IMWG)

According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), **active multiple myeloma** requires clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 10% or biopsy-proven plasmacytoma, plus at least one myeloma-defining event (MDE):

| **Myeloma-defining events (mdes)** | **Criteria** |
|-|-|
| Hypercalcemia | Serum calcium > 0.25 mmol/L (> 1 mg/dL) above ULN or > 2.75 mmol/L (> 11 mg/dL) |
| Renal insufficiency | Creatinine clearance < 40 mL/min or serum creatinine > 177 μmol/L (> 2 mg/dL) |
| Anemia | Hemoglobin > 20 g/L below normal or < 100 g/L |
| Bone lesions | ≥ 1 osteolytic lesion on skeletal radiography, CT, or PET-CT |
| - Clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60% <br/> - Involved/uninvolved serum free light chain ratio ≥ 100 (involved FLC ≥ 100 mg/L) <br/> - > 1 focal lesion ≥ 5 mm on MRI | SLiM criteria |

---

Smoldering multiple myeloma is defined by **serum M-protein ≥ 30 g/L or urinary M-protein ≥ 500 mg/24 h and/or clonal bone marrow plasma cells 10–59%**, with **absence of MDEs** [^112AcYDX].

---

## Current diagnostic workup

The planned bone marrow biopsy, endoscopy, colonoscopy, and full-body bone scan are appropriate. Bone marrow biopsy will establish plasma cell burden and phenotype; **endoscopy and colonoscopy** will evaluate for gastrointestinal blood loss as a cause of anemia; and **bone imaging** (preferably MRI or PET/CT) will assess for lytic lesions or focal marrow lesions that could upstage to active myeloma [^113NHkcp].

---

## Likelihood of active multiple myeloma versus smoldering myeloma

Given the new anemia, bone pain, and absence of documented MDEs, **active myeloma is possible but not confirmed**. The normal iron and B12 profiles and the presence of bone pain increase suspicion, but definitive classification awaits the results of bone marrow biopsy, serum/urine M-protein and free light chains, and advanced imaging.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

- **Active multiple myeloma remains a possibility** given the new anemia and bone pain, but current data are insufficient to confirm this or exclude smoldering myeloma.
- **Definitive classification** depends on bone marrow biopsy, serum/urine M-protein and free light chains, and advanced imaging (MRI or PET/CT) [^113NHkcp].
- **If any MDE is present**, the diagnosis would be active multiple myeloma; if absent and plasma cells are 10–59% without symptoms, this would indicate smoldering myeloma [^115ULuyv].

---

The patient's presentation is **concerning for myeloma**, but the diagnosis and classification **cannot be finalized** until the pending investigations are completed.

### How I treat smoldering multiple myeloma [^116uop2x]. Blood (2014). Low credibility.

Smoldering myeloma is a heterogeneous clinical entity where a subset of patients has an indolent course of disease that mimics monoclonal gammopathy of undermined significance, whereas others have a more aggressive course that has been described as "early myeloma". It is defined as either serum M-protein ≥ 3 g/L or ≥ 10% monoclonal plasma cells in the bone marrow. There are currently no molecular factors to differentiate risks of progression for these patients. Current recommendations of therapy continue to be patient observation or patient enrollment in clinical trials. However, new definitions of active multiple myeloma recently agreed upon by the International Myeloma Working Group may alter the timing of therapy. On the basis of emerging data of therapy in these patients, it seems reasonable to believe that future recommendations for therapy of patients with smoldering myeloma will become an increasingly important topic. In this article, we review the current knowledge of this disease and risk factors associated with progression. We also examine biological insights and alterations that occur in the tumor clone and the surrounding bone marrow niche. Finally, we review clinical trials that have been performed in these patients and provide recommendations for follow-up of patients with this unique disease entity.

Introduction

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is an asymptomatic clonal proliferation of plasma cells that can progress to MM. It was first described in 1980, and since then, efforts have been made to identify laboratory and imaging markers for impending MM. The first identified markers of progression risk included light chain proteinuria and plasma cell proliferative index (labeling).SMM is defined by the presence of either serum monoclonal protein ≥ 3 g/dL (or ≥ 500 mg per 24-hour urine) or ≥ 10% clonal bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs) without evidence of a myeloma-defining event.

SMM is a heterogeneous entitycomprising 3 patient populations: in the first, disease biology resembles that of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS); in the second, disease is slowly progressing to MM; and in the last, disease is myeloma in evolution and will develop into overt disease in < 2 years. There is an urgent need for better risk stratification for all 3 groups. The risk of progression to MM decreases over time; overall risk of progression is 10% per year for the first 5 years (50% in 5 years), 3% per year for the next 5 years (65% in 10 years), and 1% per year for thereafter (similar to the risk of progression from MGUS). An estimated 25% of patients with SMM never progress to symptomatic disease.

Patients with high-risk SMM (HR-SMM) are described as having disease in which the risk of delaying therapy exceeds any benefits of continued observation. Can this group be reliably identified? There are several risk models of progression to active MM, but there is a significant degree of discordance between these risk models, and there is currently no uniformly accepted definition of HR-SMM. HR-SMM is not a disease. It represents a statistical estimate of time to symptom development. Consensus suggests that an 80% likelihood of symptomatic myeloma within 24 months of diagnosis is sufficient to warrant intervention in an otherwise asymptomatic individual.

The search for early interventions in SMM arises from the significant rate of early mortality in MM, which was previously found to be > 10%, and the risk of irreversible kidney damage, spinal cord compression, debilitating fractures, and chronic pain related to bone disease. The ideal strategy would involve not treating too early, to avoid the toxicity of therapy, and not treating too late, to avoid irreversible complications, balancing toxicity with need for treatment in asymptomatic patients. Finding this sweet spot is challenging.

### Smoldering multiple myeloma: reviewing the rationale for intervention [^1179KiUL]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2022). Medium credibility.

Smoldering multiple myeloma has been recognized for over 40years and represents a pre-symptomatic phase of the 2nd most common hematologic malignancy. 1/3 of patients will remain asymptomatic at 10years. There is an identifiable subset of patients that will develop CRAB within 2years of recognition and these patients are considered for therapeutic intervention before the development of potentially irreversible complications. Obstacles to widespread implementation of therapeutic guidelines are limited by the variable definitions associated with this high-risk group as well as the poor concordance between classification schemes. Analysis of clinical trial outcomes as well as uniform eligibility helps determine whether a given patient should be considered for therapeutic intervention outside of a clinical trial.

### Is it time for preemptive drug treatment of asymptomatic (smoldering) multiple myeloma? [^111jj8SQ]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2015). Low credibility.

Asymptomatic (smoldering) multiple myeloma is a heterogeneous plasma cell proliferative disorder with a variable rate of progression to active multiple myeloma or related disorders. Hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, bone lesions or recurrent bacterial infections characterize active multiple myeloma. Some patients with asymptomatic myeloma develop active disease rapidly, and others can stay asymptomatic for many years. Those who are likely to progress within the first 2 years of diagnosis have been categorized as having high-risk disease. The availability of novel agents in the treatment of active multiple myeloma and our better understanding of the heterogeneity of asymptomatic multiple myeloma have spurred interest in the early treatment of these patients. We have reviewed the current proposed definitions of high-risk asymptomatic multiple myeloma, the concerns about future therapy in view of the transient nature, remissions and toxicities of the therapies, and the eventual relapses that characterize this incurable disease.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that early therapeutic intervention in patients with sMM, who are at elevated risk of progression to symptomatic disease, is beneficial. The pooled analysis revealed a 60% reduction in the risk of disease progression to active myeloma or mortality in patients who received treatment versus those on observation. A more robust effect was observed in studies assessing contemporary anti-myeloma therapeutic regimens like daratumumab and lenalidomide. These findings strengthen the accumulating body of evidence that supports a risk-adapted approach in the management of sMM, thereby transitioning the paradigm from passive surveillance to proactive intervention in those with high-risk characteristics.

Although there is a clear signal for PFS benefit in the majority of the included studies, with progression defined as time to active myeloma, we should note that PFS represents a key surrogate measure for patient-centered outcomes. On the one hand, the therapeutic importance of postponing progression from an asymptomatic state to symptomatic disease may be challenged, especially when considering the lack of evidence for an OS advantage ultimately. Our pooled analysis indicated a 45% reduction in the risk of mortality among treated patients; nevertheless, OS was not a primary study endpoint and the limited number of studies providing mature OS data pinpoints to the need of additional investigations with extended follow-up. On the other hand, our study also indicated that therapy substantially prolonged the TTP to symptomatic multiple myeloma. Administering a fixed-duration and tolerable regimen in order to prevent or postpone end-organ damage is an important element to consider in a shared decision-making process between the clinician and the patient with high-risk sMM. However, we should underline that the progression criteria were not uniformly similar among the included studies in the meta-analysis, which reflects the changing landscape of the management of patients with high-risk sMM over time. All included studies, except for the AQUILA clinical trial, had been designed before the implementation of the SLiM-CRAB criteria. Two studies included biochemical criteria similar to symptomatic MM for defining progression in addition to the traditional CRAB features. However, declaring progression in patients with sMM based solely on biochemical progression criteria for MM does not signify true evolution events to symptomatic disease, according to the current knowledge. Defining the optimal endpoint in clinical trials evaluating early intervention in patients with sMM remains challenging. Although the definition of progression to active myeloma according to the SLiM-CRAB criteria may be acceptable from a regulatory perspective, time to event may be substantially prolonged and meaningful results may take years to be reported. In addition, it is important to determine intermediate endpoints, eg biochemical progression or molecular biomarkers, before the documentation of SLiM-CRAB criteria, in order to define a window of opportunity for further early intervention before the occurrence of symptomatic disease.

### Observation or treatment for smoldering multiple myeloma? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies [^113FFGLf]. Blood Cancer Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

When discussing potential treatment benefits for patients with otherwise asymptomatic disease, the risk/benefit balance should be considered. As anticipated, our analysis showed an increased frequency of severe toxicities in patients who received active treatment compared to controls. Importantly though, two studies that assessed quality of life indices, did not show significant differences between the treatment and observation groups. Furthermore, treatment did not increase the incidence of SPMs. In addition to the above, the decision to provide anti-myeloma treatment in asymptomatic patients with precursor disease entails ethical considerations, in the light of potential overtreatment in individuals who may never develop symptomatic MM. However, high-risk patients have also an increased risk to present with end-organ damage at the time of myeloma progression, even if they are on active surveillance. Furthermore, the AQUILA study showed that significantly fewer patients required anti-myeloma therapy in the daratumumab group (~20%) than in the observation group (~40%) at 3 years from study entry. Therefore, early intervention prevents/delays a significant number of patients from needing intensive anti-myeloma therapy. For those reasons, it is essential both to evaluate long-term results of ongoing clinical trials and to refine the stratification systems in order to define the true high-risk patients. The incorporation of genomic, proteomic and immunophenotypic features in combination with clinical and laboratory parameters may be useful to this direction. International collaborative efforts are deemed essential to develop and validate new prognostic models for patients with sMM. Overall, our findings underline the need for informed and shared decision making with patients with high risk sMM before initiating treatment in the clinical practice.

### Smoldering multiple myeloma [^115RHNNp]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is an asymptomatic clonal plasma cell disorder. SMM is distinguished from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance by a much higher risk of progression to multiple myeloma (MM). There have been major advances in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of SMM in the last few years. These include a revised disease definition, identification of several new prognostic factors, a classification based on underlying cytogenetic changes, and new treatment options. Importantly, a subset of patients previously considered SMM is now reclassified as MM on the basis of biomarkers identifying patients with an ≥ 80% risk of progression within 2 years. SMM has assumed greater significance on the basis of recent trials showing that early therapy can be potentially beneficial to patients. As a result, there is a need to accurately diagnose and risk-stratify patients with SMM, including routine incorporation of modern imaging and laboratory techniques. In this review, we outline current concepts in diagnosis and risk stratification of SMM, and provide specific recommendations on the management of SMM.

### Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smoldering myeloma: new insights into pathophysiology and epidemiology [^111QgWuT]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2010). Low credibility.

Routine screening for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is not indicated. Despite this fact, MGUS is a common finding in medical practice. Almost all individuals diagnosed with MGUS represent incidental cases diagnosed when physicians order serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, or both, as part of the work-up of a number of common symptoms and laboratory abnormalities. In the absence of reliable molecular predictors of outcome, the detection of an early precursor state typically imposes a complex situation for the patient and the responsible physician-usually, it leads to a lot of questions that lack clear answers. In the past years, several novel insights have been gained in the area of multiple myeloma (MM) precursor disease. This review focuses on results from recent investigations and discusses implications for diagnostic work-up, clinical management, and patient counseling. More specifically, it sheds light on the following commonly asked questions by patients and physicians: i) what is the risk of progression from precursor to full-blown MM, and are there ways to risk-stratify patients?; ii) is MM always preceded by a precursor state, and is there anything that could or should be done to delay or prevent progression?; and iii) why do some individuals develop MM precursor diseases, and is there a reason to screen the family?

### How I approach smoldering multiple myeloma [^111XvUUB]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

The current standard of care in smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is close surveillance, outside of clinical trials. Efforts are being made to understand the pathobiologic process that leads to the progression of SMM to active MM. This review provides a critical description of available data, including risk factors and risk models of progression, as well as clinical trials investigating interventions for this patient population. We describe 2 cases in which patients were seen before the concept of a myeloma-defining event was established. Today, based on the International Myeloma Working Group criteria, both patients would have been identified as experiencing myeloma-defining events, and therapy would have been initiated. These cases show that occasionally, patients can undergo observation only, even when they exceed criteria for high-risk SMM.

Background

Smoldering multiple myeloma (sMM) is an intermediate condition between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM). According to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), it is defined by a clonal plasma cell population in the bone marrow of at least 10% but no more than 60%, and/or a serum monoclonal protein (M-protein) concentration of at least 3 g/dL or urine monoclonal protein (U-protein) concentration of at least 500 mg/24 h, without the co-presence of the conventional CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, osteolytic bone lesions) or AL amyloidosis or biomarkers indicative of active myeloma (SLiM criteria: 60% or more clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage, involved to uninvolved free light chain (FLC) ratio 100 or higher, more than 1 focal lesion at least 5 mm on magnetic resonance imaging). A recent population-level screening study in Iceland indicated that the incidence of sMM among screened individuals aged over 40 years in the general population is 0.53%. Among them, one third were classified as intermediate or high risk for progression to active myeloma. Individuals with sMM are asymptomatic but possess a fluctuating risk of advancing to MM ranging from 10% per year for the first 5 years, to 3% per year for the next 5 years, and 1% per year for the next 10 years. However, high-risk patients present a progression rate of up to 50% within two years. The identification of risk factors, including the percentage of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, the level of the M-protein, the involved to uninvolved FLC ratio, the presence of cytogenetic abnormalities such as translocations t(4;14) and t(14;16), 1q addition/amplification, deletion 13q, age, serum creatinine levels and hemoglobin dynamics in time has led to the development of several risk stratification systems that inform physician decisions for patient management.

### Smoldering multiple myeloma: biology, clinical manifestations and management [^11122Gqv]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2022). Medium credibility.

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a heterogeneous group of asymptomatic plasma cell disorder characterized by the presence of monoclonal protein ≥ 30g/L and/or 10–60% of bone marrow plasma cells and no evidence of SLiM-CRAB criteria according to the 2014 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) recommendations. Once the effort to reclassify SMM with active disease as MM requiring treatment was completed, the need to redefine new high-risk SMM arose. The 20/2/20 and the IMWG risk model with the add-on high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities allow to identify high-risk SMM with 50% risk of progression to MM within 2 years, and therefore might help to propose a better therapeutic approach, either with the goal to « cure » by profoundly debulk the MM with aggressive therapies, or alternatively to restore the immune surveillance like a « delay » strategy with immune-based therapies. The debate is still ongoing but clearly challenges the watch-and-wait standard of care.

Presentation leading to MM diagnosis

We reviewed the provider documentation and laboratory/imaging studies to determine the events leading to the diagnosis of active MM. We observed recurring themes which we classified into the following mutually exclusive categories: (1) "surveillance labs" if the diagnosis was made based on abnormalities on scheduled surveillance laboratory testing, satisfying MM diagnostic criteria (hypercalcemia, anemia, renal dysfunction, FLCr), (2) "surveillance imaging" if bone/bone marrow lesions satisfying MM criteria were detected on imaging obtained in the absence of symptoms, (3) "surveillance labs/imaging and symptoms" if in addition to (1) and/or (2), the patient has symptoms, for e.g. worsening fatigue, lightheadedness, and/or exertional dyspnea attributed to anemia, (4) "workup due to laboratory changes" if MM was diagnosed based on further workup (bone marrow biopsy or imaging) obtained due to changes observed on surveillance laboratory testing that were suspicious for progression (e.g. decrease in hemoglobin, increase in calcium/creatinine/monoclonal proteins otherwise not satisfying MDE criteria), (5) "workup for unrelated medical condition/symptom" if the diagnosis was made incidentally during workup of an unrelated medical condition or symptom, (6) "bone pain" if imaging obtained for evaluation of bone pain led to the diagnosis of MM, (7) "hospitalization/ ED due to MM complications/symptoms" if the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) or was hospitalized for evaluation or management of a symptom related to MM or end-organ damage (e.g. bone pain, symptoms of anemia, fracture, hypercalcemia, acute renal failure), and (8) "unknown", if this data was unavailable.

### Diagnosis and management of smoldering multiple myeloma: the razor's edge between clonality and cancer [^115CMVsc]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2018). Low credibility.

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) is a rare plasma cell disorder, and as the disease is asymptomatic, diagnosis is often incidental. SMM is characterized by increased marrow infiltration by clonal plasma cells and/or elevated serum M-protein in the absence of a myeloma-defining event (MDE). In recent years, SMM has gained increased attention owing to a broadening of the criteria for MDE, which include apart from the CRAB criteria, three additional parameters. Survival advantage may be offered by early treatment in the high-risk subset, based on a single trial. In this review, we assess the risk factors and models for progression to multiple myeloma. A review of our diagnostic and management approaches to SMM is presented.

Recent data indicate that multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by the precursor states of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma. Currently, multiple myeloma is a clinical diagnosis based on manifestations including hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions, whereas MGUS and smoldering myeloma are diagnosed based on laboratory abnormalities. Current clinical markers allow for more individualized risk stratification and counseling of these patients. However, there is a dearth of biomarkers and molecular imaging techniques capable of (1) accurately identifying patients with disease biology corresponding with high risk of progression; (2) elucidating the mechanism of transformation to multiple myeloma; and (3) forming a framework for development of targeted therapies. This case presentation and review discusses the current understanding of myeloma precursor disease and future opportunities for improving personalized management of patients with MGUS or smoldering myeloma, as well as the potential for developing early treatment strategies designed to delay and prevent development of multiple myeloma.

CHALLENGES IN DIAGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and SMM are precursor conditions for multiple myeloma (MM). MM is a malignancy of plasma cells traditionally defined by the presence of hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, or bone lesions (the CRAB criteria). MGUS nearly always precedes the onset of MM. Table 1 lists the diagnostic criteria for these plasma cell disorders.

TABLE 1.
Criteria for Diagnosis of MGUS, Smoldering Multiple Myeloma, and Multiple Myeloma

SMM, initially described in 1980, occupies the middle space between MGUS and MM, with higher disease burden but without the clinical sequelae of the CRAB criteria or "myeloma" defining biomarkers.SMM is less common than MGUS, representing an estimated 13.7% of patients with MM, with 4,100 new patients per year. The rate of progression to active MM is 10% per year for the first 5 years, declines to 3% per year for the next 5 years, and is then 1% per year for the following 10 years. The cumulative probability of progression from SMM to MM is 73% at 15 years. There is debate as to whether SMM is a condition to be treated as an early stage of MMor simply observed, as with MGUS. To date, neither genomic sequencing nor expression profiling have identified a molecular predictor for patients with SMM who progress to MM. It is possible that factors independent of the myeloma cell, but related to the microenvironment, play a more important role in disease progression.

### Mode of progression in smoldering multiple myeloma: a study of 406 patients [^1138RXrX]. Blood Cancer Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

At this time, there is variability in the management of patients with high-risk SMM in the clinical setting. Despite clinical trial data suggesting benefit from early intervention, the majority of patients with SMM are observed. Our experience over a 10-year period suggests that clinically significant end-organ damage may not be preventable with expectant monitoring alone, and that progression to MM is not always detected by follow-up testing. These findings may provide support for early intervention in high-risk patients. Efforts to further refine the current risk stratification systems will better delineate the subset of patients who would benefit from early intervention in the future.

### International myeloma working group updated criteria for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma [^114RUPwy]. The Lancet: Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

This International Myeloma Working Group consensus updates the disease definition of multiple myeloma to include validated biomarkers in addition to existing requirements of attributable CRAB features (hypercalcaemia, renal failure, anaemia, and bone lesions). These changes are based on the identification of biomarkers associated with near inevitable development of CRAB features in patients who would otherwise be regarded as having smouldering multiple myeloma. A delay in application of the label of multiple myeloma and postponement of therapy could be detrimental to these patients. In addition to this change, we clarify and update the underlying laboratory and radiographic variables that fulfil the criteria for the presence of myeloma-defining CRAB features, and the histological and monoclonal protein requirements for the disease diagnosis. Finally, we provide specific metrics that new biomarkers should meet for inclusion in the disease definition. The International Myeloma Working Group recommends the implementation of these criteria in routine practice and in future clinical trials, and recommends that future studies analyse any differences in outcome that might occur as a result of the new disease definition.

The approach to patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) varies among clinicians; while some advocate early intervention, others reserve treatment at progression to multiple myeloma (MM). We aimed to describe the myeloma-defining events (MDEs) and clinical presentations leading to MM diagnosis among SMM patients seen at our institution. We included 406 patients diagnosed with SMM between 2013–2022, seen at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN. The 2018 Mayo 20/2/20 criteria were used for risk stratification. Median follow-up was 3.9 years. Among high-risk patients who did not receive treatment in the SMM phase (n = 71), 51 progressed by last follow-up; the MDEs included: bone lesions (37%), anemia (35%), hypercalcemia (8%), and renal failure (6%); 24% met MM criteria based on marrow plasmacytosis (≥ 60%) and/or free light chain ratio (> 100); 45% had clinically significant MDEs (hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, and/or bone lesions). MM diagnosis was made based on surveillance labs/imaging(45%), testing obtained due to provider suspicion for progression (14%), bone pain (20%), and hospitalization/ED presentations due to MM complications/symptoms (4%). The presentation was undocumented in 14%. A high proportion (45%) of patients with high-risk SMM on active surveillance develop end-organ damage at progression. About a quarter of patients who progress to MM are not diagnosed based on routine interval surveillance testing.

### Clinical course and prognosis of smoldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma [^114MuMZc]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

The clinical calculator "Asymptomatic myeloma prognosis" for smoldering myeloma and multiple myeloma.

The Asymptomatic Myeloma Prognosis calculator is a prognostic tool designed to estimate the risk of progression in patients with asymptomatic myeloma over a five-year period. This tool is particularly useful in guiding clinical decision-making and patient counseling regarding the potential need for treatment initiation and close monitoring.

The primary components of this calculator are bone marrow plasmacytosis and serum monoclonal protein levels. Bone marrow plasmacytosis is categorized into two levels: greater than or equal to 10%, and less than 10%. Similarly, serum monoclonal protein is divided into two categories: greater than or equal to 3 g/dL, and less than 3 g/dL.

The risk of progression at five years is determined based on the combination of these two factors. If bone marrow plasmacytosis is less than 10% and serum monoclonal protein is greater than or equal to 3 g/dL, the risk of progression at five years is 15%. If bone marrow plasmacytosis is greater than or equal to 10% and serum monoclonal protein is less than 3 g/dL, the risk of progression at five years is 43%. If both bone marrow plasmacytosis and serum monoclonal protein are at or above the higher thresholds (10% and 3 g/dL, respectively), the risk of progression at five years is 69%. If both bone marrow plasmacytosis and serum monoclonal protein are below the higher thresholds, the criteria for asymptomatic myeloma are not met.

This calculator does not apply to patients who do not meet the criteria for asymptomatic myeloma, specifically those with bone marrow plasmacytosis less than 10% and serum monoclonal protein less than 3 g/dL.

The calculator aims to predict the prognosis for individuals with asymptomatic myeloma by assessing the risk of disease progression over five years. This is done using two key laboratory measurements: bone marrow plasmacytosis percentage and serum monoclonal protein levels.

The user provides the following inputs:

- Bone marrow plasmacytosis percentage, which can be:

- " ≥ 10%"
- " < 10%"

- Serum monoclonal protein level, which can be:

- " ≥ 3 g/dL"
- " < 3 g/dL"

With these inputs, the calculator evaluates the following conditions to assess risk:

- When bone marrow plasmacytosis is " < 10%" and serum monoclonal protein is " ≥ 3 g/dL", the risk of myeloma progression at five years is 15%.
- When bone marrow plasmacytosis is " ≥ 10%" and serum monoclonal protein is " < 3 g/dL", there's a 43% risk of progression within five years.
- If both bone marrow plasmacytosis is " ≥ 10%" and serum monoclonal protein is " ≥ 3 g/dL", the risk rises to 69% at five years.
- If both parameters are below their respective thresholds (bone marrow plasmacytosis " < 10%" and serum monoclonal protein " < 3 g/dL"), the individual does not meet the criteria for asymptomatic myeloma.

This structured approach clearly identifies and communicates the percentage risk of myeloma progression over a five-year period, helping patients understand their prognosis based on these specific clinical measurements.

Table 1.
Current diagnostic criteria for monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, smoldering multiple myeloma and multiple myeloma, according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria.

Clinical and laboratory monitoring of SMM should initially be performed every 2–3 months after diagnosis for 6–12 months. If test results are stable, patients may be followed every 4–6 months for another year and every 6–12 months thereafter. However, follow-up should be individualized based on risk of progression. Despite the absence of prospective data, according to the Expert Panel, imaging evaluation might preferably be repeated annually with MRI (because of the higher sensitivity for early damage) for the first 5 years (then stopped or the frequency reduced) or at clinical suspicion/pain or progressive increase of M-component (low-dose whole-body CT or MRI). A detailed imaging algorithm for patients with SMM is reported in the recent IMWG consensus on imaging.

Importantly, combined, longitudinal evaluation and review of all relevant disease parameters may be required to interpret dynamics of the disease correctly.

New prognostic scores

During the last years, several risk scores for SMM progression, combining routinely used laboratory parameters, have emerged. These include the BMPC infiltration rate, an aberrant plasma cell phenotype (> 95% clonal BMPC within the BMPC compartment), immunoparesis, the amount of serum M-component, an altered FLC ratio, and albumin levels.

Further studies have highlighted the prognostic value of additional factors: (i) a progressive increase of the Mcomponent and Bence-Jones proteinuria over time;, (ii) an evolving decrease in hemoglobin;(iii) bone marrow biopsy characteristics;(iv) presence of circulating plasma cells and their proliferative activity in the bone marrow;, (v) bone involvement detected by MRI or PET-CT imaging;, (vi) cytogenetic and molecular features of the clonal population;, and (vii) serum levels of B-cell maturation antigen. In particular, a Southwest Oncology Group model, incorporating serum FLC values, serum Mcomponent and the University of Arkansas Medical Sciences 70-gene expression profile signature (GEP-70), predicted 2-year progression rates of 66.7%, 21.9% and 3.4% in patients with two or three, one, and no risk factors, respectively, ranking statistically first among other investigated clinical risk scores available at the time of analysis (Table 2).

Patients with biomarker defined MM should be carefully followed up by skeletal imaging (whole body MRI, or diffusion-weighted MRI, or PET/CT, or skeletal CT) and laboratory tests at reasonable intervals. In case of an evolving pattern, including the M-component, hemoglobin, GFR, and skeletal findings, initiation of therapy should be considered. Finally, it is not the disease itself which has changed its behavior; it is rather the advancement in myeloma diagnostics, better access to care, and care by myeloma specialists that allows us to better define the prognosis of patients with smoldering myeloma and of those with biomarker-defined MM. Clearly, further advances in prognostication are needed to finetune management of individual patients.

### Clinical course and prognosis of smoldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma [^111bm4ud]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). Excellent credibility.

Background

Smoldering (asymptomatic) multiple myeloma is an asymptomatic plasma-cell proliferative disorder associated with a high risk of progression to symptomatic multiple myeloma or amyloidosis. Prognostic factors for the progression and outcome of this disease are unclear.

Methods

We searched a computerized database and reviewed the medical records of all patients at Mayo Clinic who fulfilled the criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group for the diagnosis of smoldering multiple myeloma between 1970 and 1995. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy specimens were studied, and patients were followed throughout the course of disease.

Results

During the 26-year period, 276 patients fulfilled the criteria for smoldering multiple myeloma. During 2131 cumulative person-years of follow-up, symptomatic multiple myeloma or amyloidosis developed in 163 persons (59%). The overall risk of progression was 10% per year for the first 5 years, approximately 3% per year for the next 5 years, and 1% per year for the last 10 years; the cumulative probability of progression was 73% at 15 years. At diagnosis, significant risk factors for progression included the serum level and type of monoclonal protein, the presence of urinary light chain, the extent and pattern of bone marrow involvement, and the reduction in uninvolved immunoglobulins. The proportion of plasma cells in the bone marrow and the serum monoclonal protein level were combined to create a risk-stratification model with three distinct prognostic groups.

Conclusions

The risk of progression from smoldering multiple myeloma to symptomatic disease is related to the proportion of bone marrow plasma cells and the serum monoclonal protein level at diagnosis.

### Understanding biology to tackle the disease: multiple myeloma from bench to bedside, and back [^111v8b99]. CA (2014). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of antibody-producing plasma cells. The pathognomonic laboratory finding is a monoclonal immunoglobulin or free light chain in the serum and/or urine in association with bone marrow infiltration by malignant plasma cells. MM develops from a premalignant condition, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), often via an intermediate stage termed smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), which differs from active myeloma by the absence of disease-related end-organ damage. Unlike MGUS and SMM, active MM requires therapy. Over the past 6 decades, major advancements in the care of MM patients have occurred, in particular, the introduction of novel agents (ie, proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory agents) and the implementation of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in suitable candidates. The effectiveness and good tolerability of novel agents allowed for their combined use in induction, consolidation, and maintenance therapy, resulting in deeper and more sustained clinical response and extended progression-free and overall survival. Previously a rapidly lethal cancer with few therapeutic options, MM is the hematologic cancer with the most novel US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs in the past 15 years. These advances have resulted in more frequent long-term remissions, transforming MM into a chronic illness for many patients.

Current diagnosis and monitoring

SMM is currently diagnosed according to International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria, based on amount of M-component, percentage of clonal bone marrow plasma cells (BMPC) infiltration and no evidence of end-organ damage (CRAB) or amyloidosis (Table 1). Updated IMWG criteria re-classified 10–15% of patients previously diagnosed as having SMM, on the basis of new myeloma-defining events (biomarkers of malignancy: > 60% BMPC, free light chains [FLC] ratio > 100 42 and > 1 focal lesion with magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), the so-called "SLIM CRAB" criteria, as "ultra-high-risk" SMM. These patients are considered eligible for full MM treatments, having a risk of progression of about 80% at 2 years.

The new IMWG criteria emphasize the role of imaging to risk-stratify SMM, with patients having two or more focal lesions > 5 mm detected by MRI qualifying for active treatments. In particular, the IMWG recommends sensitive low-dose whole-body CT for the staging of monoclonal gammopathies. This imaging technique was recently validated in a prospective study of 100 patients with SMM at different timepoints to identify early bone lesions related to MM evolution. If low-dose wholebody CT is negative, whole-body or spine and pelvis MRI, where possible, should be pursued, although the latter MRI protocol can miss around 10% of non-axial lesions. Given the spatial distribution of focal bone lesions, it has been recently suggested that the cutoff for the number of focal lesions should be adapted according to the MRI protocol used. 47 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET)-CT may be considered an appropriate alternative to low-dose whole-body CT. It is highly recommended to distinguish between SMM and active MM, if low-dose whole-body CT is negative and whole-body MRI is unavailable. In the case of uncertain or borderline lesions, radiological studies should be repeated, preferably alternating different techniques, every 3–6 months or whenever clinically indicated, until a definitive diagnosis of symptomatic MM is reasonably made or excluded, (i.e. the suspicious lesion remains stable, is not accompanied by other signs of progression, or is disappearing).

### Evolving diagnostic criteria for multiple myeloma [^115J1Wps]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2015). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy historically defined by the presence of end-organ damage, specifically, hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions (CRAB features) that can be attributed to the neoplastic process. In 2014, the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) updated the diagnostic criteria for MM to add specific biomarkers that can be used to make the diagnosis of the disease in patients who did not have CRAB features. In addition, the update allows modern imaging methods including computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography-CT to diagnose MM bone disease. These changes enable early diagnosis, and allow the initiation of effective therapy to prevent the development of end-organ damage in patients who are at the highest risk. This article reviews these and several other clarifications and revisions that were made to the diagnostic criteria for MM and related disorders. The updated disease definition for MM also automatically resulted in a revision to the diagnostic criteria for the asymptomatic phase of the disease termed smoldering MM (SMM). Thus the current diagnosis and risk-stratification of SMM is also reviewed in this article. Using specific prognostic factors, it is possible to identify a subset of patients with SMM who have a risk of progression to MM of 25% per year (high-risk SMM). An approach to the management of patients with low- and high-risk SMM is discussed.

### Patterns of progression among 427 patients with smoldering myeloma diagnosed after 2014: importance of monitoring [^113xQ5Ar]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

TO THE EDITOR:

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), may evolve to symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) with heterogeneous rates and clinical patterns. The 2014 International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) criteria incorporated biomarkers of malignancy (SLiM criteria) within the definition of symptomatic MM, beyond the historical CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia, and bone lesions); thus, patients with SMM may be considered for therapy based on the evolution of biomarkers and not symptomatic complications. Furthermore, availability of advanced imaging improved the identification of early disease, potentially altering the natural history of SMM and MGUS by enabling timely therapeutic interventions. The risk of SMM progression is heterogeneous. The IMWG's 20/2/20 modelprovided a simple stratification system based on serum free light chain (FLC) ratio, monoclonal spike, and bone marrow plasma cell infiltration, and was developed from a large cohort that also included patients without access to advanced imaging at diagnosis or during follow-up. We describe the clinical course of SMM in patients diagnosed after 2014, using 2014 IMWG criteria, and managed with contemporary imaging to evaluate how advancements in diagnostics have impacted risk stratification and patterns of disease progression.

### European Myeloma Network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: what to use and when [^115r8diq]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

While novel agents have certainly improved the outcomes of patients with myeloma, prompt diagnosis and close follow-up of MM patients remain highly relevant and contribute to better survival. In most cases, the diagnosis of MM is straightforward, being based on biological and radiological evidence when evocative clinical signs are present. During response assessment, the evaluation of MRD will become increasingly important and, within the next few years, will guide treatment choices in clinical trials and possibly also outside trial scenarios. International efforts are needed to standardize the different techniques that can be used to evaluate MRD. Guidelines on appropriate follow-up and patient-tailored monitoring have been updated in this EMN consensus paper and should help to improve the outcome and prognosis of our patients.

### The role of bone marrow biopsy in patients with plasma cell disorders: should all patients with a monoclonal protein be biopsied? [^116MM8uk]. Blood Cancer Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematological malignancy that results from neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM). In 2018, ~30,770 people will be diagnosed with MM in the United States, accounting for 1.8% of all new cancer cases, and ~12,770 people will die from MM. MM evolves from the premalignant state of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Progression from MGUS to MM may include an intermediate stage of disease, smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM), a heterogeneous entity comprising of a group of patients that behave biologically like MGUS and another group that eventually develop clinical manifestations of myeloma requiring therapy such as hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction, anemia and bone lesions (CRAB). Like MM, rates of MGUS prevalence increase with age: more than 4% in Caucasians over age 50 and greater than 6% in Caucasians over 70 years of age. Prevalence rate for MGUS among African Americans is threefold higher than Caucasians. Patients with MGUS, SMM, and MM require comprehensive clinical and laboratory assessment to differentiate one from the other. This distinction is important because the first two diagnoses do not require active therapy, whereas the third does.

By definition, patients with MGUS or SMM are "asymptomatic", but in reality many have symptoms that prompted the testing, but these symptoms are eventually deemed not to be related to their plasma cell disorder. Others arrive at a diagnosis due to an incidental finding of an elevated sedimentation rate or total protein. BM aspiration and biopsy (BM) and advanced imaging can help differentiate between entitiesand provide prognostic information –, but the frequency in which these expensive and/or invasive tests contribute changes in management has not been well delineated. Herein we report on patients with SMM and MM that present without symptoms and in whom BM was critical for diagnosis.

a A bone marrow can be deferred in patients with low risk MGUS (IgG type, M protein < 1.5 gm/dL, normal free light chain ratio), in patients with uncomplicated suspected IgM MGUS < 1.5 gm/dl, and in patients with light chain MGUS who have a serum FLC ratio < 8, in whom there are no clinical features concerning for myeloma, macroglobulinemia, or amyloidosis.

Our recognition that the clinical course of SMM has a progression risk that decreases over time along with information from other laboratory studies has led us to better understand SMM as being a heterogenous clinically defined entity rather a than a true biologic intermediate stage between MGUS and MM. Thus SMM as currently defined includes some patients with biological pre-malignancy (biological MGUS) and some with biologic malignancy (multiple myeloma). This is a major paradigm change, and over the last 10 years has initiated a cascading series of changes in our strategic approach to both SMM and MM. One of the initial goals was to immediately identify the group of SMM patients who have biologic malignancy that will declare itself with clinical complications within 2 years. Three biomarkers were validated: bone marrow clonal plasma cells ≥ 60%, serum involved to uninvolved free light chain (FLC) ratio ≥ 100 (provided involved FLC level is ≥ 100 mg/L), and more than 1 focal lesion (5 mm or more in size) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), each of which identified patients at high (approximately 80%) risk of progression within 2 years. These biomarkers were considered myeloma defining events (MDE), and adopted in 2014 in the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Revised Diagnostic Criteria for multiple myeloma and related plasma cell disorders. When using the FLC ratio ≥ 100 as a biomarker for the diagnosis of myeloma, it is important to ensure that the urinary monoclonal protein is concordant, with a level of at least 200 mg per 24 h on urine protein electrophoresis.

General considerations

Despite the many ongoing and planned studies, only one randomized trial has so far demonstrated a significant survival benefit for early active therapy of high-risk SMM. Another recent trial showed an improvement in progression-free survival, but follow-up is still too short for adequate evaluation of overall survival.

Both these studies raised some concerns. Their sample size was limited, with less than 100 patients in each arm. The Spanish study was conducted between 2007 and 2013, when some new MM drugs were not available, while bone involvement was assessed by a low-sensitivity technique such as plain radiography. Thus the survival benefit in some patients could have been due to treating active MM, rather than SMM. Furthermore, patients in the control group could start therapy only after meeting CRAB criteria, which may be difficult in patients with progressive deterioration of renal function or anemia, because they would start therapy before the cut-off is reached. On the other hand, in the US trial, the high discontinuation rate and the fact that the group achieving the most significant benefit with lenalidomide in terms of progression-free survival included only 25 patients could be concerns.

Notwithstanding, all ongoing studies seem to take a survival benefit for granted, as they do not include an untreated control group or compare two arms with active treatments, thus substantially accepting the philosophy that high-risk SMM "should" be treated. However, while some experts suggest that the Soutwest Oncology Group and Spanish trials should represent the current standard of care for patients with high-risk SMM, others are not convinced. Studies underway will likely show a response to therapy, more or less pronounced depending on the drugs used, with consequent improvement of progression- free survival. However, whether these often intensive treatments with novel agents will also have an extensive impact on overall survival of SMM patients will not be formally addressed and could remain unclear. The key issue remains to identify patients with high-risk SMM who "must" receive a treatment, because they will certainly have a significantly longer survival.

### European Myeloma Network recommendations on tools for the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma: what to use and when [^113SfDCX]. Haematologica (2018). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of multiple myeloma can be challenging, even for experienced physicians, and requires close collaboration between numerous disciplines (orthopedics, radiology, nuclear medicine, radiation therapy, hematology and oncology) before the final diagnosis of myeloma is made. The definition of multiple myeloma is based on the presence of clinical, biochemical, histopathological, and radiological markers of disease. Specific tests are needed both at presentation and during follow-up in order to reach the correct diagnosis and characterize the disease precisely. These tests can also serve prognostic purposes and are useful for follow-up of myeloma patients. Molecular analyses remain pivotal for defining high-risk myeloma and are used in updated patient stratifications, while minimal residual disease assessment via flow cytometry, molecular techniques and radiological approaches provides additional prognostic information on patients' long-term outcome. This pivotal information will guide our future treatment decisions in forthcoming clinical trials. The European Myeloma Network group updated their guidelines on different diagnostic recommendations, which should be of value to enable appropriate use of the recommendations both at diagnosis and during follow-up.

Introduction

The classification and differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies is based on clinical, biological and radiological criteria but remains challenging in certain cases. Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common malignant gammopathy and is associated with a wide spectrum of signs and symptoms. In the past decade, the treatment options for patients with MM have increased considerably. Together with improved supportive care, these new regimens significantly prolong the survival of both younger and older patients. The 2014 revision of the diagnostic criteria for MM allows the initiation of treatment in patients defined only by biomarkers, annotated as SLIM criteria [bone marrow (BM) infiltration > 60%, involved/uninvolved serum free light-chain (SFLC) ratio > 100 or > 1 focal lesion > 5 mm as determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)], without waiting for conventional CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone disease) to occur. Both the SLIM biomarker and CRAB criteria are listed in Figure 1. Given the recent evolution in diagnosis and response assessment, members of the European Myeloma Network (EMN) agreed to review and recommend diagnostic and response criteria to allow their discriminating use in daily practice and current care of patients'.

### Dynamic follow-up of smoldering multiple myeloma identifies a subset of patients at high risk of progression [^1165KP9n]. American Journal of Hematology (2021). Medium credibility.

Several studies have shown that eMP is associated with a high risk of progression, however, with different cut‐offs of relative increase (Table S3 in Appendix S1). Furthermore, assessing a relative increase could include patients with a low absolute increase in patients with MP < 30 g/L, that is. in patients with an MP of 10 g/L as a diagnosis value, the absolute increase correlation to the suggested relative increases in previous studies, 10%, 25%, and 64% would give increases of 1, 2.5, and 6.4 g/L, respectively. Studies assessing absolute increase, showed that eMP > 5 g/L is an independent RF, which is in concordance with our data (Table S3 B in Appendix S1). The impact of eiFLC > 169% as a RF 5 could not be validated in our cohort. In addition, we could demonstrate that absolute increase exhibited a better discriminatory ability compared to a relative increase. It could be argued that relative increases could overestimate the impact of a dynamic biomarker, particularly in patients with low levels at diagnoses.

Anemia is one of the hallmark symptoms in symptomatic MM. Hence, a decrease in hemoglobin during the first year of diagnosis as a RF of progression in SMM has been suggested in previous studies (Table S3 B in Appendix S1). We could not confirm that the decrease of hemoglobin by ≥ 5 g/L during the first year of follow‐up as a RF. Moreover, this cut‐off could include values within the intra‐individual variation of hemoglobin.

The findings in our retrospective study support that dynamic changes in MP can identify patients at high risk of progression. In conclusion, BMPCs > 20% and MP > 20 g/L at diagnosis, were independent RFs for the progression. Moreover, eMP > 5 g/L and eFLCr > 4.5 were significant predictors of progression during the follow‐up. With a median TTP of 5 months after an evolving pattern is observed, patients with evolving RF should be closely monitored. However, as these findings are exploratory, they should be validated in future prospective studies. The observed high risk of progression in patients with either or both evolving biomarkers may advocate a closer monitoring of these patients as well as possibly inclusion in future prospective early intervention trials.

### Outcomes after biochemical or clinical progression in patients with multiple myeloma [^116MrM3i]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Our study has some limitations. This was a retrospective study that lacked protocol standardization, including the frequency of follow-up and tests for progression and CRAB symptoms. Next, the imaging technique was not consistent throughout the study, and skeletal survey (with lower sensitivity in detecting osteolytic lesions) was also used, especially during the earlier time periods. Patients who were inaccurately suspected of having BP because of the lack of imaging and who were included in the BP group may have a negative impact on survival, but this should not have affected the overall findings. Complete longitudinal data on monoclonal protein evaluations during first remission have not been collected; therefore, the study does not answer the question of whether the occurrence of CP could have been predicted and mitigated by starting treatment earlier, because the precise proportion of patients who had a BP was unknown.

One of the important questions in the field is the timing of treatment of relapsed disease, at the time of BP or when clinical signs and symptoms develop, an approach that is being studied in the setting of smoldering MM. Given the shorter time to second-line therapy in the CP group in our study, it is likely that at least a proportion of these patients have a distinct biology that predisposes to progression with clinical features rather than increasing M spike values. We also acknowledge that early initiation of treatment may not alter the survival of all patients and that we need to better determine the characteristics of patients who will benefit from early treatment. These issues can be answered only in a carefully designed prospective study, and we hope the data presented here will help form the framework for developing such a trial in the near future.

In conclusion, patients with clinical features at relapse have a worse overall and postprogression survival than patients who relapsed solely biochemically. Approximately half of CP presented while the patient was receiving active treatment, which suggests that even closely monitored patients may develop CRAB features at relapse. Factors that help predict the occurrence of CP include male sex, PCL index ≥ 2%, and EMD at diagnosis. Patients with deeper response to first-line treatment are less likely to develop CP, once again highlighting the need for deep responses for first-line therapy, especially in those with high-risk features at baseline. Patients tend to present CRAB criteria at relapse similar to what they present at diagnosis.

### How we approach smoldering multiple myeloma [^113UYJ1i]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Based on the bone marrow involvement and level of monoclonal protein, our patient was classified as having SMM (Fig 1). There was no evidence of anemia, hypercalcemia, or bone lesions, and renal function was normal and unchanged; hence, he does not have MM. The new Mayo 20/2/20 criteria stratify him in the high-risk SMM category, the group that gained the most in the ECOG E3A06 trial. Our patient chose to be observed, and 7 years after initial presentation, he continues under surveillance, with persistent disease classified as SMM.

PET-CT was negative for [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose-avid bone lesions. By the 20/2/20 criteria, this patient has high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma.

### Treatment of multiple myeloma: ASCO and CCO joint clinical practice guideline [^111YFiLD]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

ASCO/CCO multiple myeloma guideline — Recommendation 7.1 (biochemical relapse management) states that treatment of biochemically relapsed myeloma should be individualized, considering prior treatment tolerance, rate of rise of myeloma markers, cytogenetic risk, comorbidities, frailty, and patient preference; high-risk patients as defined by high-risk cytogenetics and early relapse post-transplant/initial therapy should be treated immediately, and close observation is appropriate for slowly progressive and asymptomatic relapse (Type: informal consensus/evidence-based; Evidence quality: intermediate, benefit outweighs harm; Strength of recommendation: moderate). Biochemically relapsed myeloma is defined by IMWG criteria as a rise in serum or urine paraprotein in the absence of clinical signs or symptoms; repeat imaging should be performed to assess for active bone disease including new lytic lesions and extramedullary disease, and for standard-risk patients a bone-marrow biopsy should be considered to re-evaluate cytogenetic risk. Overall, treatment should be initiated at the time of biochemical relapse in those with high-risk cytogenetics, extramedullary disease, early relapse after transplant or initial therapy, and/or with evidence of rapid rise in myeloma markers, while close observation with frequent paraprotein assessment is required for slowly progressive and asymptomatic relapse.

### SLiM CRAB criteria revisited: temporal trends in prognosis of patients with smoldering multiple myeloma who meet the definition of' biomarker-defined early multiple myeloma'-a systematic review with meta-analysis [^111zw5GN]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Our findings highlight the importance of using modern skeletal imaging techniques in all patients with 'biomarker-defined MM' to exclude patients with myeloma bone involvement. Furthermore, including additional risk factors for biomarker-defined MM patients would improve the identification of patients with a high probability of rapid progression to active myeloma and could facilitate treatment decisions in these patients, an opinion which is shared by Akhlaghi et al. Combining the existing criteria with risk factors such as cytogenetic factors, light chain proteinuria, gene expression data, circulating plasma cells, whole exomeor genome, and immuneprofiling, among others, should increase the prognostic accuracy of biomarker-defined MM. Very recent studies suggest to adapt the definition of patients with a high FLCratio and to include the detection of concomittant proteinuria (> 200 mg/24 h) as an essential criterion for high-risk in those patients. Taking up this suggestion would imply that the IMWG consensus needs to be adapted also in this respect. Furthermore, an MGUS phenotype has been shown to signal a very low risk for progressionand identification of these patients should spare them the burden of anti-myeloma therapy. A reasonable approach to better characterize the aggressiveness of the underlying disease is dynamic follow-up. Evolving patterns of certain markers of disease, such as an increasing M-component and BMPC infiltration or decreasing hemoglobin levels, may be used together with static data.

In summary, we found a roughly threefold longer TTP and an about 50% lower 2-year progression risk in patients with biomarker-defined MM and ≥ 60% BMPCs or a FLCratio ≥ 100 in recent studies compared to those observed in earlier publications. Our findings have several implications. First, patients with an FLCratio ≥ 100 and an involved FLC level ≥ 100 mg/dl should not automatically be considered as early myelomas, as about half of properly staged patients will remain progression-free for roughly four years. Second, more recent data on patients with high BMPCs (≥ 60%) showed a much lower 2-year progression risk (45.5%) than the early studies (86.21%). Therefore, a more conservative approach should be applied when considering treatment initiation. Third, the natural history of truly smoldering and biomarker-defined MM should be prospectively studied using modern diagnostic criteria as envisaged in the CARRISMM study, and therapeutic studies in these patients should include a carefully followed untreated control group with one of the endpoints being overall survival.

### Daratumumab or active monitoring for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma [^115evKiN]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

Background

Daratumumab, an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody, has been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma. Data are needed regarding the use of daratumumab for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma, a precursor disease of active multiple myeloma for which no treatments have been approved.

Methods

In this phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma to receive either subcutaneous daratumumab monotherapy or active monitoring. Treatment was continued for 39 cycles, for 36 months, or until confirmation of disease progression, whichever occurred first. The primary end point was progression-free survival; progression to active multiple myeloma was assessed by an independent review committee in accordance with International Myeloma Working Group diagnostic criteria.

Results

Among the 390 enrolled patients, 194 were assigned to the daratumumab group and 196 to the active-monitoring group. With a median follow-up of 65.2 months, the risk of disease progression or death was 51% lower with daratumumab than with active monitoring (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.67; P < 0.001). Progression-free survival at 5 years was 63.1% with daratumumab and 40.8% with active monitoring. A total of 15 patients (7.7%) in the daratumumab group and 26 patients (13.3%) in the active-monitoring group died (hazard ratio, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.98). Overall survival at 5 years was 93.0% with daratumumab and 86.9% with active monitoring. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse event was hypertension, which occurred in 5.7% and 4.6% of the patients in the daratumumab group and the active-monitoring group, respectively. Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 5.7% of the patients in the daratumumab group, and no new safety concerns were identified.

Conclusions

Among patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma, subcutaneous daratumumab monotherapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of progression to active multiple myeloma or death and with higher overall survival than active monitoring. No unexpected safety concerns were identified. (Funded by Janssen Research and Development; AQUILA ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03301220.).

### Multiple myeloma: diagnosis and treatment [^112huLv9]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma, the most common bone malignancy, is occurring with increasing frequency in older persons. Typical symptoms are bone pain, malaise, anemia, renal insufficiency, and hypercalcemia. Incidental discovery on comprehensive laboratory panels is common. The disease is diagnosed with serum or urine protein electrophoresis or immunofixation and bone marrow aspirate analysis. Skeletal radiographs are important in staging multiple myeloma and revealing lytic lesions, vertebral compression fractures, and osteoporosis. Magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography or computed tomography are emerging as useful tools in the evaluation of patients with myeloma; magnetic resonance imaging is preferred for evaluating acute spinal compression. Nuclear bone scans and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry have no role in the diagnosis and staging of myeloma. The differential diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies includes monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance, smoldering (asymptomatic) and symptomatic multiple myeloma, amyloidosis, B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, and rare plasma cell leukemia and heavy chain diseases. Patients with monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance or smoldering multiple myeloma should be followed closely, but not treated. Symptomatic multiple myeloma is treated with chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation, if possible. Melphalan, prednisolone, dexamethasone, vincristine, doxorubicin, bortezomib, and thalidomide and its analogue lenalidomide have been used successfully. It is important that family physicians recognize and appropriately treat multiple myeloma complications. Bone pain is treated with opiates, bisphosphonates, radiotherapy, vertebroplasty, or kyphoplasty; nephrotoxic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be avoided. Hypercalcemia is treated with isotonic saline infusions, steroids, furosemide, or bisphosphonates. Because of susceptibility to infections, patients require broad-spectrum antibiotics for febrile illness and immunization against influenza, pneumococcus, and Haemophilus influenzae B. Five-year survival rates approach 33 percent, and the median survival rate is 33 months.

New insights into the molecular pathogenesis of smoldering multiple myeloma

All cases of MM evolve through MGUS and SMM stages, although these are often not clinically evident. The disease pathogenesis starts from intrinsic genomic defects in plasma cells, mainly translocations of oncogenes under the control of regulatory elements of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus or multiple trisomies of odd-numbered chromosomes. However, these are not sufficient to cause the progression from MGUS to SMM or MM, as in most cases the clone will not evolve in a patient's lifetime. Furthermore, high-risk translocations such as t(4;14) and t(14;16) are less frequent in asymptomatic cases, while t(11;14) is more frequent in SMM. These different frequencies reflect different intrinsic propensities of the oncogenic translocation to drive symptomatic progression. Hyperdiploidy seems to slightly increase the risk of transformation to active MM as well. Interestingly, the number of chromosomal trisomies is lower in hyperdiploid MGUS than in hyperdiploid SMM, suggesting that ongoing acquisition of genomic lesions may be the cause of progression. Consistently, secondary copy-number abnormalities, such as del(1p), amp(1q), del(16q), and del(17p), are also more frequent in MM than in SMM. Next-generation sequencing studies evidenced a globally lower number of mutations in MGUS and SMM than in MM. This was particularly true for mutations in KRAS, NRAS, FAM46C, but also for genes in the NF-κB pathway and DNA repair pathway genes. Conversely, high-risk SMM showed a landscape of mutations and chromosomal abnormalities more similar to that of MM. Indeed, single-cell studies have highlighted, within a clonal plasma cell population, the presence of subclones with distinct phenotypes that could be linked to malignant progression and prove the step-wise evolution of MM.

### Risk stratification of smoldering multiple myeloma incorporating revised IMWG diagnostic criteria [^117RqNyq]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Outcomes

Over an estimated median follow-up period of 74.8 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 67.7–83.0), progression was documented in 165 (39.2%) patients; 158 of them developed MM while 7 developed AL amyloidosis. The estimated median TTP for the entire cohort was 57.3 months (95% CI, 44.8–72.2). The estimated proportion of patients progressing at 2, 5, and 10 years were 28.8% (95% CI, 24.1–34.0), 51.0% (95% CI, 44.8–57.2), and 71.2% (95% CI, 60.8–79.8), respectively. The risk of progression was 18% during the first year, approximately 10% per year for the next 3 years, and about 4% per year thereafter till 10 years from diagnosis. Among patients who developed MM, the most common myeloma defining events were anemia (n = 65; 41%) and skeletal lesions (n = 53; 33%). Renal dysfunction was seen in 7 (4%) and hypercalcemia in 3 (2%). Forty-five (28.4%) patients were treated in the absence of CRAB features due to markers like high M-protein (> 5 g/dL), high BMPC%, and rapidly rising FLC level. During follow-up, 127 (30.2%) patients died. The median OS for the entire cohort was 11.3 years (95% CI, 9.8–not reached).

### Positron emission tomography-computed tomography in the diagnostic evaluation of smoldering multiple myeloma: identification of patients needing therapy [^117X9cQp]. Blood Cancer Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Results

One hundred and eighty-eight patients were identified with a suspected diagnosis of SMM in whom a PET-CT scan had been performed as part of the diagnostic evaluation. PET-CT was positive in 74 patients, and negative in 114 patients. Of the 74 patients with a positive PET-CT, 49 were diagnosed and treated as MM, whereas 25 were considered to still have SMM and observed (Figure 1). Of the 49 patients diagnosed as MM, 12 (24%) were upstaged to the diagnosis of active disease solely based on the findings of the PET-CT; in the remaining 37 patients, myeloma defining events were identified on other laboratory tests conducted during the same visit. Similarly, of the 114 patients with a negative PET-CT, 17 (14%) were diagnosed and treated as MM based on other laboratory parameters, whereas 97 were considered to have SMM and observed. Thus, 25 patients with a positive PET-CT and 97 patients with a negative PET-CT who were observed without therapy formed the principal cohort (n = 122) for this study (Figure 1). Patient characteristics are provided in Table 1. The rate of progression to MM within 2 years was then compared between these two groups.

The probability of progression to MM within 2 years was 75% in patients with a positive PET-CT (n = 25) compared with 30% in patients with a negative PET-CT (n = 97); median TTP was 21 months versus 60 months, respectively, P = 0.0008 (Figure 2). The mode of progression in patients with a positive PET-CT who progressed was anemia (10 patients, including one patient who also developed amyloidosis and one patient with central nervous system disease), bone disease (6 patients, including 2 patients with concurrent renal failure and one with cryoglobulinemia), renal failure (1 patient) and rapid rise in M protein (1 patient).

The median TTP in patients with positive PET-CT and underlying osteolysis (n = 16) was 21 months compared with 60 months in patients with no evidence of osteolysis on PET-CT (n = 106), P = 0.004 (Figure 3). Among patients with a positive PET-CT, the probability of progression was 87% at 2 years in the subset of patients with underlying osteolysis (n = 16) and 61% in patients with abnormal PET-CT uptake but no evidence of osteolysis (n = 9), P = 0.31.

Regarding medical management for multiple myeloma, more specifically with respect to management of relapsed/refractory disease (general principles), ASCO/CCO 2019 guidelines recommend to initiate immediate treatment in high-risk patients, as defined by high-risk cytogenetics and early relapse post-transplant/initial therapy,
and patients with symptomatic clinical relapse.

Multiple myeloma — response assessment timing and testing frequency are guided by clinical context: Assessment of the response using paraprotein measurements and/or imaging should be evaluated in the context of the clinical picture, and assessment after one to two cycles will allow evaluation to ensure that the disease is not progressing based on the response criteria, in which case a change in therapy will be warranted. If the response after one to two cycles is stable disease but there is evidence of clinical deterioration or lack of improvement, such as worsening end organ damage, a potential change in therapy should be addressed, and evidence of response at the end of the first cycle will be reassuring to the patient and provider. Once there is evidence of sustained disease response, checking the response every other cycle will be adequate and can decrease the testing burden; however, if there is evidence of progression at any time, it should be repeated at the minimum during the next cycle, or sooner if there is evidence of clinical deterioration to confirm the progression. Once the patient is in plateau, the frequency can be altered to less-frequent testing aligned with the frequency of visits required for therapy and other logistical factors, and once there are results showing a trend toward increasing paraprotein, more frequent testing should be resumed, preferably every cycle until the patient meets criteria for progression or treatment is changed.

### Daratumumab or active monitoring for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma [^1149erAr]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The study AQUILA was published by Meletios A Dimopoulos and colleagues in 2025 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Smoldering myeloma. In the AQUILA study, the trial question was: what is the role of daratumumab monotherapy in patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma? In the AQUILA study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the AQUILA study, the population was: 390 patients (202 female, 188 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma. The key exclusion criteria were multiple myeloma requiring treatment; primary systemic amyloid light-chain amyloidosis; prior exposure to daratumumab; ongoing treatment with other monoclonal antibodies; receipt of treatment for malignancy in the past 3 years; medical or psychiatric condition or disease. In the AQUILA study, the interventions were: n = 194 daratumumab (subcutaneous dose of 1,800 mg on a weekly basis in cycles 1–2, every 2 weeks in cycles 3–6, and every 4 weeks thereafter in 28-day cycles continued for up to 39 cycles or for 36 months) n = 196 active monitoring (no disease-specific treatment for 36 months or until confirmation of disease progression). In the AQUILA study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in progression-free survival (65.5% vs. 49.5%; HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.78). In the AQUILA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in overall survival (92.3% vs. 86.7%; HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.7) Significant decrease in initiation of first-line treatment (33.2% vs. 53.6%; HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.62). In the AQUILA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in hypertension. In the AQUILA study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with high-risk smoldering myeloma, daratumumab was superior to active monitoring with respect to a progression-free survival.

### Time to redefine myeloma [^111yJ9ac]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

In November 2014 the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) revised the definition of multiple myeloma, such that asymptomatic patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma without any of the traditional 'CRAB' (hypercalcaemia, renal impairment, anaemia, bone disease) end organ damage criteria but with one of three new criteria would be recommended to start treatment. Previously, the standard of care for such patients was expectant management. These three new criteria are: greater than 60% clonal plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy, a serum free light chain (sFLC) ratio of > 100 (the involved sFLC must be > 100 mg/l) and greater than one unequivocal focal lesion on advanced imaging (low dose whole body computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, (18) F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography). Although this would appear to affect a small number of patients, the impact of these changes are broad, leading to an increased use of advanced imaging, a debate around the management of patients previously diagnosed with smouldering myeloma, changed terminology and clinical trial design and an extension of the use of biomarkers. For the first time the philosophy of treatment in myeloma will change from treatment initiation only being triggered by overt end organ damage to an era where sub clinical risk factors will also be taken into account.

MDEs and presentations in non-high-risk patients

Among patients with non-high risk SMM (226 patients), 35 (15%) received treatment for SMM after a median of 4.0 (range: 0–51.1) months from diagnosis, and 191(85%) were observed (Table 2). Among those 35 patients who received treatment, 3 patients (9%) progressed by their last follow-up after 4.8, 6.0, and 7.6 years from diagnosis. The MDEs in these 3 patients were bone lesions, anemia and bone lesions, and BMPCs/FLCr criteria only; two were diagnosed with MM based on surveillance labs/surveillance imaging, and another patient was diagnosed based on workup due to laboratory changes. Among those who were observed (191 patients), 59 (31%) had progressed by their last follow-up with a median TTP of 6.7 (95% CI: 4.9–7.9) years. The MDEs were bone lesions in 30 patients (51%), anemia in 21 patients (36%), hypercalcemia in 4 patients (7%), renal insufficiency in 5 patients (8%), and BMPCs/FLCr criteria only in 8 patients (14%). Twenty (34%) had > 1 MDE, and 35 (59%) had clinically significant MDEs (Fig. 1). Four patients (7%) had compression fractures. Among those who had renal insufficiency (5 patients), renal function returned to baseline in 1 patient only.

The presentations leading to MM diagnosis were surveillance labs/surveillance imaging in 19 patients (32%), workup due to laboratory changes in 10 patients (17%), bone pain in 12 patients (20%), workup for unrelated medical condition/symptom in 4 patients (7%), unknown presentation in 8 patients (14%), and hospitalization/ED due MM complications/symptoms in 6 patients (10%); 1 patient presented to the ED with bone pain, and 5 patients were hospitalized for: bone pain and compression fracture (1), renal failure (1), hypercalcemia and renal failure (1), hypercalcemia with renal failure and severe anemia (1), and symptomatic anemia (1); among those, 2 patients died after 2 and 4 months from MM diagnosis.

Table 1A.
Examples and characteristics of patients with multiple myeloma who achieved long-term remission and cure* (University of Freiburg, UKF).

Case presentation – long-term disease control

While the sustained absence of any kind of measurable disease activity is a pre-requisite for curing MM, some patients experience persistence of a very low level of detectable MM cells while either on or off treatment but remain in deep response for even decades. Disease activity in such patients resembles monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or low-risk smoldering MM rather than overt MM requiring therapy, and is sometimes referred to as a plateau phase. The term 'operational or functional cure' has been introduced to describe such monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance- or smoldering MM-like behavior after successful induction therapy. Definitions and typical features of cure, operational cure and incurable MM are displayed in Table 2.

The following history of a 52-year-old male who was diagnosed with MM in June 2003 represents a classical case of an operational cure. His clinical characteristics included an IgG kappa (k) subtype (IgG 60 g/L, k-serum free light chains: 650 mg/L), an ISS/R-ISS score of I, and standard-risk cytogenetics. The initial bone marrow biopsy revealed an infiltration rate of 50%. There was no prevalent renal impairment. The patient's Revised-Myeloma Comorbidity Index score was 2/9, indicating that he was fit to undergo ASCT. He was enrolled in the DSMM-V study and received tandem ASCT without maintenance therapy. Ever since completion of the second ASCT, residual monoclonal protein in the serum, indicative of disease activity, could be detected. Nevertheless, the patient has been in longterm remission with no evidence of disease progression. In this case, the patient has been in a state of sustained very good partial response for 20 years since his initial diagnosis. While the patient has low, detectable levels of monoclonal protein, he does not have any clinical symptoms or end-organ damage. Other representative patients with an 'operational or functional cure' are summarized in Table 1B.

Multiple myeloma (symptomatic) — primary treatment and surveillance: Initiate myeloma therapy and bone-targeting treatment plus supportive care treatment as indicated for symptom management; assess for candidacy for transplant after starting therapy and reassess for transplant as performance status improves; refer to a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) center and harvest hematopoietic stem cells, considering 2 transplants if appropriate. Follow-up/surveillance may include laboratory assessments appropriate for monitoring treatment toxicities such as complete blood count with differential and metabolic panel; serum quantitative immunoglobulins, SPEP, and SIFE; 24-hour urine for total protein, UPEP, and UIFE as clinically indicated; serum FLC assay; whole-body MRI without contrast, low-dose CT, FDG-PET/CT annually or as clinically indicated, ideally with the same technique used at diagnosis; bone marrow aspirate and biopsy at relapse with FISH as clinically indicated; consider MRD testing as indicated for prognostication after shared decision with patient; and see NCCN Guidelines for Survivorship. For care pathway navigation, Response q leads to Response after primary therapy (MYEL-5) and Progression q leads to Additional Treatment (MYEL-6); for MM with CNS disease, see CNSM-1. Autologous transplantation guidance states that Category 1 evidence supports proceeding directly after primary therapy to high-dose therapy and HCT, and that collecting stem cells and delaying HCT is also an option; renal dysfunction and advanced age are not contraindications to transplant. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### International myeloma working group recommendations for global myeloma care [^114j3HHD]. Leukemia (2014). Low credibility.

Recent developments have led to remarkable improvements in the assessment and treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). New technologies have become available to precisely evaluate the biology and extent of the disease, including information about cytogenetics and genetic abnormalities, extramedullary manifestations and minimal residual disease. New, more effective drugs have been introduced into clinical practice, which enable clinicians to significantly improve the outcome of patients but also pose new challenges for the prevention and management of their specific side effects. Given these various new options and challenges, it is important to identify the minimal requirements for diagnosis and treatment of patients, as access to the most sophisticated advances may vary depending on local circumstances. Here, we propose the minimal requirements and possible options for diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of patients with multiple myeloma.

Multiple myeloma — confirmation of responses: All responses excluding marrow and imaging should be confirmed as per IMWG criteria (Type: evidence based; Evidence quality: high, benefit outweighs harm; Strength of recommendation: strong). The requirement of confirmatory testing was introduced into the IMWG criteria to ensure that laboratory variations are accounted for, and the recent versions of the criteria have eliminated a previously prescribed minimum gap. At this time, a repeat testing can be done on the same day from a separate blood draw or the urine can be done a day apart to meet the requirement of confirmation, and given that bone marrow and imaging findings are less likely to have variation in interpretation and the burden of repeat testing, these do not need to be confirmed.

### New developments in myeloma treatment and response assessment [^111bUdGt]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic neoplasm characterized by the clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow. It is almost always preceded by an initial monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, which then develops into asymptomatic, or smoldering, MM, which constitutes an intermediate clinical stage between monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and MM. The definition of symptomatic MM, a clinical stage requiring treatment, was traditionally based on the presence of organ damage related to plasma cell growth as defined by the CRAB criteria (calcium elevation, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone lesions). This definition was revised in 2014 by the International Myeloma Working Group, integrating new prognostic biomarkers with the aim of not delaying treatment of high-risk smoldering-MM–classified patients and avoiding establishment of harmful bone lesions or renal impairment. New biomarkers have therefore been defined that are associated with an 80% probability of progression toward positive MM CRAB criteria within 2 y, making it possible to identify patients requiring therapy; these biomarkers are a clonal bone marrow plasma cell percentage of at least 60%, an involved or uninvolved serum free light chain ratio of at least 100, and more than one bone focal lesion (FL) on MRI assessment.

Given that the presence of even an asymptomatic bone lesion must be considered a treatment criterion, the role of imaging has increased during the last few decades and modern morphologic or hybrid imaging techniques have replaced the conventional skeletal survey. It is now recommended that whole-body CT be performed as dedicated CT, or as part of PET/CT using 18 F-FDG, when symptomatic MM diagnosis is first diagnosed and there are one or more osteolytic lesions (defining the "B" of the CRAB criteria). Moreover, MRI detects bone abnormalities in more than 90% of patients presenting with symptomatic MM and appears to be the best procedure for evaluating painful lesions and detecting medullary compression. However, during the therapeutic follow-up, the performance of whole-body CT and MRI is less satisfactory because of the high frequency of false-positive images, whereas 18 F-FDG PET appears to be more effective.

### Personalised progression prediction in patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance or smouldering multiple myeloma (PANGEA): a retrospective, multicohort study [^114yusga]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Multiple myeloma is often preceded by two precursor conditions, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and smouldering multiple myeloma, with current diagnostic criteria differentiating these from symptomatic multiple myeloma, as defined by SLiM-CRAB guidelines: clonal bone marrow plasma cells greater than or equal to 60%; serum free light chain (FLC) ratio greater than or equal to 100, provided involved FLC level is 100 mg/L or higher; more than one focal lesion on MRI; hypercalcaemia; renal failure; anaemia; and bone lesions. Various criteria have been developed to stratify patients with precursor disease into risk groups based on predicted probability of progression to multiple myeloma and to identify which patients might benefit from early intervention. The Mayo criteria stratify patients with smouldering multiple myeloma into risk categories depending on no risk factors (low-risk), one risk factor (intermediate-risk), or two or more risk factors (high-risk), which include a free light chain (FLC) ratio of more than 20, a monoclonal protein concentration of more than 2·0 g/dL, and a bone marrow plasma cell percentage (BMPC%) of more than 20%. This 20/2/20 stratification system was updated by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) to include the fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) results of t(4;14), t(14;16), gain(1q), and del(13/13q). These models are applied at precursor diagnosis and rely on discrete cutoffs despite inherent variation in biomarkers throughout disease monitoring. Consequently, the models are rarely used to restratify patients according to evolving laboratory findings, despite improvements to the ability of the 20/2/20 model to prognosticate when applied at discrete timepoints after diagnosis.

### Multiple myeloma: diagnosis and treatment [^117X4HbD]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple myeloma accounts for 1.6% of all cancer cases and approximately 10% of hematologic malignancies in the United States. In 2015, an estimated 28,850 new cases of multiple myeloma were diagnosed in the United States, and the disease caused more than 11,000 deaths. Patients older than 65 years account for 85% of those diagnosed with multiple myeloma, and there is a twofold increased incidence in blacks compared with whites. Patients may present with bone pain or with symptoms that are often nonspecific, such as nausea, vomiting, malaise, weakness, recurrent infections, and weight loss. Many patients present with only laboratory abnormalities, such as anemia, renal disease, and elevated protein levels. The diagnosis of multiple myeloma requires increased numbers of immature, abnormal, or atypical plasma cells in the bone marrow; a monoclonal protein in the serum or urine; or characteristic bone lesions. The diagnostic workup in a patient with suspected multiple myeloma should include a complete blood count with differential; serum chemistries; creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and beta2-microglobulin tests; immunoglobulin studies; skeletal survey; and bone marrow evaluation. Initiation of chemotherapy and assessment of eligibility for autologous stem cell transplantation require referral to an oncologist. Most patients with multiple myeloma will receive thromboprophylaxis, bisphosphonate therapy, and prophylaxis against infection at some point in their treatment. Family physicians play a role in assessing these patients for infection, adverse treatment effects, and renal and thrombotic complications, and in managing issues related to pain, nutrition, and psychosocial support.

Patients

Patients presenting with ≥ 1 of the following SMM criteria were included: serum M protein ≥ 30 g/l, urinary M protein ≥ 500 mg/24 h, or ≥ 10% of clonal bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs). Index date was designated as the date of the first SMM diagnosis.

To distinguish between patients with SMM and MM, this study utilized recommendations from the IMWG and input from experts. Patients with the following characteristics indicating active MM at baseline were excluded: patients identified as having MM using the SLiM criteria (bone marrow infiltration ≥ 60%, FLC ratio ≥ 100 or > 1 focal lesion > 5 mm as determined by magnetic resonance imaging) and/or the CRAB criteria (hypercalcemia [serum calcium > 0.25 mmol/l (> 1 mg/dl) higher than the upper limit of normal or > 2.75 mmol/l (> 11 mg/dl)]; renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance < 40 ml/min or serum creatinine > 177 µmol/l [> 2 mg/dl]); anemia (hemoglobin value of > 20 g/l below the lower limit of normal, or a hemoglobin value < 100 g/l); bone lesions (≥ 1 osteolytic lesions on skeletal radiography or computed tomography [CT] or positron emission tomography-CT scan); or if the patient started MM treatment within 90 days of SMM diagnosis. Patients with light chain amyloidosis at baseline were excluded. In addition, patients who could not be classified into any risk group based on Mayo 20/2/20 criteria due to missing data were also excluded.

Patients who met the above identification criteria were classified into 2 groups (high risk and non–high risk [intermediate and low risk]) based on the Mayo 20/2/20 criteria. High-risk SMM was defined as ≥ 2 of the following: FLC ratio > 20 and < 100, serum M protein > 2 g/dl, or clonal BMPCs > 20% to < 60%. Due to the large degree of missing cytogenetic data (Table 1), it was not possible to evaluate data from patients with SMM risk stratified using the IMWG 2020 criteria that includes cytogenetic abnormalities.

### High levels of peripheral blood circulating plasma cells as a specific risk factor for progression of smoldering multiple myeloma [^115BRa6H]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) carries a 50% risk of progression to multiple myeloma (MM) or related malignancy within the first 5 years following diagnosis. The goal of this study was to determine if high levels of circulating plasma cells (PCs) are predictive of SMM transformation within the first 2–3 years from diagnosis. Ninety-one patients diagnosed with SMM at Mayo Clinic from January 1994 through January 2007, who had testing for circulating PCs using an immunofluorescent assay and adequate follow-up to ascertain disease progression, were studied. High level of circulating PCs was defined as absolute peripheral blood PCs > 5 × 10(6)/l and/or > 5% PCs per 100 cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (Ig)-positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Patients with high circulating PCs (14 of 91 patients, 15%) were significantly more likely to progress to active disease within 2 years compared with patients without high circulating PCs, 71% versus 24%, respectively, P = 0.001. Corresponding rates for progression within 3 years were 86% versus 34%, respectively, P < 0.001. Overall survival (OS) after both SMM diagnosis and MM diagnosis was also significantly different. High levels of circulating PCs identify SMM patients with an elevated risk of progression within the first 2–3 years following diagnosis.

Useful in certain circumstances are, if whole-body low-dose CT or FDG-PET/CT is negative, to consider whole-body MRI without contrast to discern smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) from multiple myeloma (MM), tissue biopsy to confirm suspected plasmacytoma, evaluation for light chain amyloidosis, obtaining baseline clonotype identification at diagnosis or storing an aspirate sample for future clonotype identification to enable minimal residual disease (MRD) testing by NGS, serum viscosity, hepatitis B and hepatitis C testing and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as required, assessment for circulating plasma cells as clinically indicated, and renal biopsy if albuminuria or abnormal renal function. For cytogenetics, 1q21 amplification is defined as ≥ 4 copies detected by FISH and a gain is defined as ≥ 3 copies of 1q21. Frailty assessment should be considered in older adults. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Results

Our literature search revealed 3159 records by searching databases and 27 abstracts by hand searching (Fig. 1). After eliminating duplicates, publications not addressing biomarker-defined MM or SMM, and publications without graphs suitable for data digitization, we ended up with 11 studies (non-randomized observational cohort studies) that were included in the meta-analysis. In addition to the six studies published up until the end of 2014, which formed the basis of the current treatment guidelines, we identified five recent studies, containing data and diagrams that were viable for the meta-analysis, of which one contained novel data both on patients with increased BMPCs and on high FLCratio, four on high FLCratio only, and none on focal lesions. The data by Rago et al.on the impact of BMPCs, albeit containing a suitable graph, were not used for the 2014 consensus. We also did not include them in our analysis because of inconsistencies in the publication. Data from individual studies are shown in Fig. 2. In total, the studies included 3482 patients, none of whom was treated for myeloma during the duration that was taken into consideration.

Methods

For this systematic review with meta-analysis, we conducted a comprehensive literature review following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and searched PubMed and EMBASE databases from January 1 2010 to November 1 2022. The search terms used are shown in Supplementary File, Table S1. Two authors (HL and SK) conducted independently from each other hand-searching of the citation lists of the selected papers and of abstracts recently presented at EHA. Articles not including Kaplan–Meier-curves on TTP and those using thresholds other than ≥ 60% BMPCs, FLCratio ≥ 100, or > 1 focal lesion were excluded (Supplementary File, Table S1). In three cases of discrepant assessments the authors discussed the arguments of each other and finally agreed upon inclusion or not.

The quality of the selected papers was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NIH;), but we excluded question 3, 5, 10, and 13, due to inapplicability (Supplementary File, Table S2). The Quality Assessment Tool was applied by two independent reviewers, and discrepancies in judgement were resolved by discussion. Although the quality of the publications varied (Supplementary File, Table S3), we chose to use all available studies due to the good quality of the graphs and underlying data. The relevance of the research question was discussed during a scientific meeting in Würzburg organized by Prof. Einsele, with Prof. Gareth Morgan and Prof. Martin Kaiser commenting. In addition, the authors had a few informal meetings. This review was not registered beforehand and no review protocol is available.

Time to progression of data obtained from early vs. recent publications. A: Patients with ≥ 60% BMPCs vs. < 60%, B: Patients with FLCratio ≥ 100 or < 100, and C: Patients with > 1 focal lesion vs. ≤ 1 (no new data published after consensus).

Median TTP and 2-year risk of progression of biomarker-defined patient cohorts positive or negative for the respective criteria are shown in Table 1, comparing data available for the 2014 consensus and data published afterwards, as well as combined results. In patients with ≥ 60% BMPCs, median TTP increased from 9.2 months in the earlier compared to 30.3 months in later studies; this was associated with a marked decrease in the 2-year risk of progression from 86.2% to 45.5%. Similar trends were observed in patients with an FLCratio ≥ 100. Median TTP increased from 15.3 to 48.1 months between both time periods, while the 2-year risk of progression decreased from 73.0% to 31.6%. All studies on the impact of > 1 focal lesion on time-to-progression were published between 2010 and 2014, and no reports on this topic were published thereafter. Median TTP was 15.1 months and 2-year risk of progression 67.3%. These findings are supported by a sensitivity analysis that excluded five trials that ranked lowest in the quality assessment (Supplementary File, Table S5). Like in the analysis of all studies, a significant prolongation of the TTP and a reduction in the 2-year risk of progression was noted. A funnel plot did not reveal any indication for a publication bias (see Supplementary File, Fig. S1), a finding which was supported by a trim-and-fill analysis (estimated number of missing studies: 0 (SE = 1.51)). The only discenable asymmetry is due to the outlying, small-sample study of Kastritis et al.arguably indicating some publication bias during the early time period, but not supported by the trim-and-fill analysis.

The increasing awareness of monoclonal gammopathies and referal to hematologists likely has led to more frequent work-up, to exclusion of CRAB positive MM, and thus to inclusion of more patients with an insidious course of the disease in recent studies. The uptake of newer diagnostic measures seems to also explain the shift in the control groups with a lower FLCratio (< 100) toward a more favorable prognosis in recent reports.

The small number of eligible studies available for the comparison of patients with BMPCs ≥ 60/ < 60% with only one recent publication, as well as the small number of studies on focal lesions, is a limitation of this analysis. Another important limitation of this meta-analysis was the unavailability of accurate censored data for digitized individual patient data. Even though estimates for median TTP and 2-year-progression risks obtained from the digitized data are very similar to the published values (see Supplementary File, Table S4), the exact number of progressions or censorings, as well as their timing, could not be accurately obtained from the published figures, inter alia due to a lack of censoring ticks. Nevertheless, our estimates of median TTP and 2-year-progression risk should be quite accurate (assuming a low proportion of early censorings), while confidence intervals, significance tests and hazard ratios may deviate slightly from the original data. We must also mention that some studies used in this meta-analysis received a low quality ranking according to the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies (Supplementary File, Table S3), although we have confidence in the quality of the graphs and underlying data, which is supported by a sensitivity analysis excluding these low-scoring studies (Supplementary File, Table S5). A further limitation is the lack of novel data on > 1 MRI-defined focal lesion. New studies could reveal whether a similar shift toward improved prognosis could be observed. This is not completely unlikely with the use of new imaging tools such as diffusion-weighted MRI or MRI in combination with PET/CT. Furthermore, it should be mentioned that the exact definition of biomarker-defined MM patients with an FLCratio ≥ 100 includes a minimal involved free light chain concentration of ≥ 100 mg/dl. This criterion was taken into account in five of the seven published studies. Two studies did not employ the latter criterion, and a third study did not use it for their diagram, a fact which might have led to underestimation of the risk of their 'marker positive' patients. Lastly, this study has not been registered in PROSPERO, an international prospective register of systematic review protocols in health and social care. This registry informs investigators about planned and ongoing systematic reviews thereby avoiding possible doublication of efforts. Searching PROSPERO did not reveal any projects with competing design and aims.
