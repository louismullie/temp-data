## Question

The practice of drawing congressional district lines in an attempt to give one party a benefit over another is referred to as

Answer Choices:
A. front-loading
B. prior restraint
C. reapportionment
D. gerrymandering

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which term refers to the practice of drawing congressional district lines to benefit one political party over another. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the precise definition of the phenomenon. Then, I should verify each answer choice against that definition. Next, I will consider common distractors and why they are incorrect. Finally, I will confirm the correct term and briefly justify it with the standard usage in political science and civics contexts.

> Let me first confirm the core concept: the question is about manipulating electoral district boundaries to favor a particular political party, which is a well-known political strategy with a specific name in U.S. politics and political science literature [^notfound].

> Now, I will examine Option A, "front-loading". Wait, let me verify what that means. Front-loading refers to scheduling primary elections earlier in the calendar to gain strategic advantage in presidential nomination contests, not to drawing district lines, so this does not match the question's description of boundary manipulation [^notfound].

> Next, I should review Option B, "prior restraint". Hold on, I should verify the legal context. Prior restraint is a First Amendment concept about government censorship of speech or publication before it occurs, which is unrelated to redistricting or electoral map drawing, so this is not the correct answer [^notfound].

> I will now examine Option C, "reapportionment". Let me think about this carefully. Reapportionment is the constitutionally required redistribution of congressional seats among states based on population changes after the decennial census; it determines how many seats each state gets, but it does not refer to drawing the shapes of districts within a state to favor a party, so this is not the right term for the practice described [^notfound].

> Finally, I should confirm Option D, "gerrymandering". The term gerrymandering specifically denotes the deliberate manipulation of electoral district boundaries to advantage one party or group over others, which fits the question's description exactly and is the standard term used in political science and civics education [^notfound].

> Conclusion: The correct answer is D. gerrymandering, because it uniquely refers to drawing district lines to benefit one party, whereas front-loading concerns primary timing, prior restraint concerns censorship, and reapportionment concerns seat allocation among states rather than intra-state district shaping [^notfound].

---

The practice of drawing congressional district lines to favor one political party is called **gerrymandering** [^notfound]. This involves manipulating district boundaries to concentrate or dilute voters from the opposing party, thereby securing electoral advantage. Gerrymandering is distinct from reapportionment, which is the constitutional redistribution of seats based on population, and from front-loading or prior restraint, which are unrelated political terms [^notfound].

---

## Definition and historical context

Gerrymandering is the deliberate manipulation of electoral district boundaries to benefit a specific political party, incumbent, or group [^notfound]. The term originated in 1812 when Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry signed a bill creating a salamander-shaped district to favor his party, coining the portmanteau "gerrymander" [^notfound]. Since then, gerrymandering has been a persistent feature of American politics, often sparking legal and ethical debates [^notfound].

---

## Techniques of gerrymandering

Gerrymandering employs several **techniques** to achieve partisan advantage:

- **Packing**: Concentrating opposing party voters into a few districts to reduce their influence in other districts [^notfound].
- **Cracking**: Dispersing opposing party voters across multiple districts to dilute their voting power [^notfound].
- **Hijacking**: Redrawing districts to force two incumbents from the same party to compete against each other [^notfound].
- **Kidnapping**: Moving an incumbent's residence into a district with unfavorable demographics [^notfound].

---

## Legal and ethical implications

Gerrymandering has significant **legal and ethical implications**. While redistricting is a legal process mandated by the Constitution after each census, gerrymandering for partisan advantage has been challenged in courts [^notfound]. The Supreme Court has ruled that racial gerrymandering violates the Equal Protection Clause, but partisan gerrymandering remains legally contentious, with the Court often deferring to political branches [^notfound]. Critics argue that gerrymandering undermines democratic principles by allowing politicians to choose their voters rather than voters choosing their representatives [^notfound].

---

## Comparison with other terms

It is essential to distinguish gerrymandering from other political terms:

| **Term** | **Definition** | **Relevance to redistricting** |
|-|-|-|
| Gerrymandering | Manipulating district boundaries for partisan advantage | Directly related |
| Reapportionment | Redistribution of congressional seats based on population changes | Related but not manipulative |
| Front-loading | Scheduling primaries early to influence nomination outcomes | Unrelated to redistricting |
| Prior restraint | Censorship of speech before publication | Unrelated to redistricting |

---

## Contemporary examples and reforms

Recent examples include North Carolina's 2016 congressional map, deemed unconstitutional for partisan gerrymandering, and Pennsylvania's 2018 map redrawn by court order [^notfound]. Some states have implemented **reforms**, such as independent redistricting commissions, to reduce partisan manipulation [^notfound]. These reforms aim to enhance fairness and representation in the electoral process [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

Gerrymandering is the practice of drawing congressional district lines to benefit one political party over another [^notfound]. It involves manipulating electoral boundaries through techniques like packing and cracking, raising significant legal and ethical concerns [^notfound]. While distinct from reapportionment, gerrymandering remains a controversial issue, with ongoing efforts to reform the redistricting process and promote fairer representation [^notfound].

### Drawing the line on physician-assisted death [^47252e04]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2019). Medium credibility.

Drawing the line on physician assistance in physician-assisted death (PAD) continues to be a contentious issue in many legal jurisdictions across the USA, Canada and Europe. PAD is a medical practice that occurs when physicians either prescribe or administer lethal medication to their patients. As more legal jurisdictions establish PAD for at least some class of patients, the question of the proper scope of this practice has become pressing. This paper presents an argument for restricting PAD to the terminally ill that can be accepted by defenders as well as critics of PAD for the terminally ill. The argument appeals to fairness-based paternalism and the social meaning of medical practice. These two considerations interact in various ways, as the paper explains. The right way to think about the social meaning of medical practice bears on fair paternalism as it relates to PAD and vice versa. The paper contends that these considerations have substantial force when directed against proposals to extend PAD to non-terminally ill patients, but considerably less force when directed against PAD for the terminally ill. The paper pays special attention to the case of non-terminally ill patients who suffer from treatment-resistant depression, as these patients present a potentially strong case for extending PAD beyond the terminally ill.

### Suicide and general elections in Austria: do preceding regional suicide rate differentials foreshadow subsequent voting behavior swings? [^b15ea721]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Suicide-epidemiological research on short-term effects of elections on national/regional suicide and parasuicide incidence has yielded contradictory evidence. Reversing the cause-effect relationship of this line of research we investigated whether preceding regional suicide rates are related to subsequent election results.

Methods

For Austria's 121 districts, we regressed averaged standardized suicide rates for the preceding period (1988–1994) on political parties' subsequent electoral gains/losses (1999-to-1995) while controlling for a set of 12 domain-relevant psychosocial/economic indices.

Results

Stepwise weighted multiple regression led to a significant model. The 1999-to-1995 electoral gains/losses of two opposition parties, together with the population variation caused by migration balance and by births/deaths balance, accounted for a substantial part (30%) of the variability in preceding district-level suicide rates. Various other social indices failed to contribute further substantial increments to this model.

Conclusions

This finding suggests that variations in preceding regional suicide incidence might be mirrored in subsequent changes in voting behavior. A speculative post hoc explanation for the finding is offered: on a community level, suicide's aftermath might produce socially and politically alienated survivors of suicide who co-shape swings towards opposition parties in subsequent general elections. The finding calls for more research on suicide's long-term aftermath.

Limitations

Within-country replicability and cross-national generalizability await further investigation. At present, the factor/mechanism accounting for this finding is neither well-established nor has been directly tested.

### The importance of relationships in political advocacy [^54aece55]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Relationships in advocacy form the basis for physicians to help their practices and patients navigate the challenges and complexities of the modern medical world. John Joyce, MD, is the US Representative from Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District. He serves as a member of the powerful Energy and Commerce Committee and has a leadership role in their Health Care Subcommittee. He is a member of the Doctors Caucus, a group of members from both parties with a health care background receiving weekly briefings on current health issues. He is a board-certified dermatologist and spent many years in private practice in Central Pennsylvania. I have known him for over 30 years and serve as the AAOS Ambassador to Dr. Joyce. Through an interview format, Dr. Joyce discusses the value of advocacy to him now that he is on the legislative side, how best for physicians to advocate for their patients and practices, and what strategies are most effective, and which are less effective or counterproductive. He shares what he has learned that would have benefitted him when he was a full-time practicing private practice clinician about advocacy and relationships with legislators. His experience in both medicine and Congress makes him especially unique to educate us on the value of relationships in advocacy for physicians.

Fig. 5
Performance on recognition experiment.

A Comparing drawing recognition performance between viewers in communication experiment (dark blue) with those of yoked (light blue) and shuffled (green) control groups. B Individual variation in performance on the final repetition in the post phase (relative to that in the pre phase), where grey lines connect drawings originally produced by the same sketcher. Error ribbons and bars represent 95% CI.

Taken together, these results suggest that third-party observers in the yoked condition who viewed drawings from a single interaction were able to take advantage of this continuity to more accurately identify what successive drawings represented. While observers in the shuffled condition still improved somewhat over time, being deprived of this continuity made it relatively more difficult to interpret later drawings. These findings are consistent with prior work while additionally controlling for confounds present in earlier studies, including task practice, which we were able to equate between the shuffled and yoked conditions. (While not central to the questions posed in the current studies, it would be possible to further disentangle the impact of task practice from the effect of repetition on recognition performance by including another control condition in which observers are presented with a randomized sequence of drawings from the same interaction.)

### Talking it better: conversations and normative complexity in healthcare improvement [^4aacaca3]. Medical Humanities (2022). Medium credibility.

Part of what is contained in this account is that conversations are being treated as an example of what Habermas calls 'communicative' rather than 'strategic' action. They provide a basis for 'mutual understanding', which involves attention to, and a genuine interest in grasping, what matters from the standpoint and experience of others, rather than the adopting of a similar seeming interest in order to further one's own agenda. Here, 'mutual understanding' is contrasted with one party dominating or using the other party — echoing the distinction that Oakeshott makes between conversation and 'winning and losing'. In principle, this distinction offers a useful heuristic, but in practice, as we saw in the previous section, there is no easy line to draw, or perfect insulation between, the relational and transactional dimensions of encounters. An interest in understanding and mutuality is important for its own sake and it may separately turn out to be practically useful because understanding can reorient action. Acknowledging this 'double value' is not at all to accept that conversations tend to collapse back into 'strategic action', but it does require us to note the prevalence of power differentials between different parties and the risk of such collapse happening sometimes.

Standish, reflecting on Oakeshott's conception of a conversation, argues that conversation depends on a degree of social coordination but need not require 'cooperation' in the restricted liberal sense — that is conversation does not require an agreed and shared project or purpose, or the assumption of a 'neutral field' designed to support participants in the pursuit of their separate projects. Rather conversation reflects and sustains some more minimal notions of respect and mutuality, recognising the possibility of engagement across difference. While conversation allows for people's perspectives and trajectories to remain 'intact', they may well not do so:

Conversation is then the field in which I might discover what my projects might be.

… There is here the suggestion of a turning of thought such that it cannot proceed solely, and in many respects does not succeed best, when it travels along straight, systematic lines: openness to conversation, a readiness to be turned (to be shaped, fashioned, sometimes diverted, sometimes rebuffed), requires that I do not seek to shore up my own identity but rather am ready for new possibilities — that is, ready to become.

### Everyday resilience in district health systems: emerging insights from the front lines in Kenya and South Africa [^4ac46dde]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Second, we observed a range of managerial responses to these routine challenges. However, further analysis is required to judge whether they indicate or nurture everyday resilience. Table 1 categorises these responses using the ideas drawn from Bene et al (summarised earlier) and presents judgements against the yardstick that resilience is seen when organisational functioning is strengthened. Here, we understand this to mean that service delivery improved or was scaled up, or organisational developments that may support service delivery were sustained.

Table 1
Managerial responses to challenging conditions: what strategies are applied and do they indicate everyday resilience? (drawing on ref.)

The 'resilience judgements' of the table suggest that the experiences were mixed, with only some suggesting resilience. In several instances, absorptive or adaptive strategies seemed to represent undesirable or unsustainable organisational practices, termed 'maladapted emergence' in the literature on complex adaptive systems. The reintroduction of user fees in Kilifi to cope with funding shortfalls, despite a prior policy decision to remove them because they reduce access for the poorest, is one example; a second is the appointment of staff to posts for which they were not qualified or the implementation of new activities without dedicated staff in Sedibeng. Even within strategies that appear more likely to reflect everyday resilience, there may be weak spots; for example, Kilifi mid-level managers using their own funding for their work is not sustainable; and strengthened organisational practice in one Kilifi hospital was nonetheless accompanied by a decision that had negative consequences for service delivery (box 1).

### Everyday resilience in district health systems: emerging insights from the front lines in Kenya and South Africa [^4b658d9f]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Recent global crises have brought into sharp relief the absolute necessity of resilient health systems that can recognise and react to societal crises. While such crises focus the global mind, the real work lies, however, in being resilient in the face of routine, multiple challenges. But what are these challenges and what is the work of nurturing everyday resilience in health systems? This paper considers these questions, drawing on long-term, primarily qualitative research conducted in three different district health system settings in Kenya and South Africa, and adopting principles from case study research methodology and meta-synthesis in its analytic approach. The paper presents evidence of the instability and daily disruptions managed at the front lines of the district health system. These include patient complaints, unpredictable staff, compliance demands, organisational instability linked to decentralisation processes and frequently changing, and sometimes unclear, policy imperatives. The paper also identifies managerial responses to these challenges and assesses whether or not they indicate everyday resilience, using two conceptual lenses. From this analysis, we suggest that such resilience seems to arise from the leadership offered by multiple managers, through a combination of strategies that become embedded in relationships and managerial routines, drawing on wider organisational capacities and resources. While stable governance structures and adequate resources do influence everyday resilience, they are not enough to sustain it. Instead, it appears important to nurture the power of leaders across every system to reframe challenges, strengthen their routine practices in ways that encourage mindful staff engagement, and develop social networks within and outside organisations. Further research can build on these insights to deepen understanding.

### Continuous quality improvement programs provide new opportunities to drive value innovation initiatives in hospital-based radiology practices [^690bd0c3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Imaging services constitute a huge portion of the of the total dollar investment within the health care enterprise. Accordingly, this generates competition among medical specialties organized along service lines for their pieces of the pie and increased scrutiny from third-party payers and government regulators. These market and political forces create challenge and opportunity for a hospital-based radiology practice. Clearly, change that creates or builds greater value for patients also creates sustainable competitive advantage for a radiology practice. The somewhat amorphous concept of quality constitutes a significant value driver for innovation in this scenario. Quality initiatives and programs seek to define and manage this amorphous concept and provide tools for a radiology practice to create or build more value. Leadership and the early adoption of these inevitable programs by a radiology practice strengthens relationships with hospital partners and slows the attrition of imaging service lines to competitors.

### Practical norms in emerging infectious disease control: lessons for transnational collaboration from a suspected newly emerging zoonosis outbreak in Ghana [^554c6cda]. BMJ Global Health (2025). High credibility.

In addition to the primary ethnographic data described above, one section in the paper draws on relevant informal observations arising out of the first author's work as an epidemiologist in Sierra Leone and Ghana during the 2014–2016 West African Ebola response. The coauthors on this paper helped to interpret these observations and those arising from the larger formal ethnographic study of the BAR outbreak with their respective expertise in epidemiology and anthropology and their experiences working with and within veterinary and human health systems in Ghana and other African states.

Interviews began in Ghana on 7 May 2014. Written consent was obtained from participants who were interviewed as part of the study. When entering a workspace with the intention of making observations, the researcher introduced themselves and explained the premise of the research they were conducting and obtained verbal consent before starting to take notes. All participants were provided with a participant information sheet, which provided a written overview of the study and contact information for the researchers should they desire any further information or wish to withdraw from the study later. Consent was not sought for the observations made during public meetings or where proceedings from the meeting are publicly available. This is in line with the American Anthropological Association's Principles of Professional Practice, specifically Principle 3, which concerns observations made of public events.

Patient and public involvement

No patients were involved in this study.

Ghana's official outbreak response system

If you had asked senior Ghana Health Service (GHS) officials back in late-2010, when the suspected B virus outbreak was first reported, what Ghana's official system for responding to an outbreak of unknown origin was, they would most likely point you towards the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) framework. The IDSR is a joint United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO initiative aimed at strengthening disease control infrastructure across the African Region by providing a simple, standardised framework for managing disease surveillance and response activities (WHO & CDC 2010). The IDSR framework organises the GHS into three main levels: district, regional and national, with a subdistrict level sometimes sitting below the district level. There is an obvious top-down hierarchy to this structure, with data flowing upwards and policy and oversight flowing down towards the district level. However, it is the District Health Management Team (DHMT) who are primarily responsible for seeing that disease outbreaks are appropriately responded to, with the support (ie, resources and expertise) of the higher tiers.

### Financial incentives for patients in the treatment of psychosis [^3672f00c]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2009). Low credibility.

Poor medication adherence in patients with a psychosis is associated with relapse. It has been proposed that outcomes might be improved by using financial incentives for treatment adherence (FITA). However, a strong moral intuition against this practice has been found. This paper examines the ethics of FITA. Three arguments are presented, which if accepted would severely restrict or even prohibit the practice. These are based on (1) "incommensurable values", where FITA denigrates an aspect of "respect for the person", (2) "exploitation", where unfair advantage is taken of the patient, and (3) "fairness", where it is difficult to draw a line between those who should and should not be offered payment. A number of practical impediments are also considered.

### Accountability mechanisms and the value of relationships: experiences of front-line managers at subnational level in Kenya and South Africa [^3cc5a495]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Resource constraints, value for money debates and concerns about provider behaviour have placed accountability 'front and centre stage' in health system improvement initiatives and policy prescriptions. There are a myriad of accountability relationships within health systems, all of which can be transformed by decentralisation of health system decision-making from national to subnational level. Many potential benefits of decentralisation depend critically on the accountability processes and practices of front-line health facility providers and managers, who play a central role in policy implementation at province, county, district and facility levels. However, few studies have examined these responsibilities and practices in detail, including their implications for service delivery. In this paper we contribute to filling this gap through presenting data drawn from broader ongoing research collaborations between researchers and health managers in Kenya and South Africa. These collaborations are aimed at understanding and strengthening day-to-day micropractices of health system governance, including accountability processes. We illuminate the multiple directions and forms of accountability operating at the subnational level across three sites. Through detailed illustrative examples we highlight some of the unintended consequences of bureaucratic forms of accountability, the importance of relational elements in enabling effective bureaucratic accountability, and the ways in which front-line managers can sometimes creatively draw upon one set of accountability requirements to challenge another set to meet their goals. Overall, we argue that interpersonal interactions are key to appropriate functioning of many accountability mechanisms, and that policies and interventions supportive of positive relationships should complement target-based and/or audit-style mechanisms to achieve their intended effects. Where this is done systematically and across key elements and actors of the health system, this offers potential to build everyday health system resilience.

### Everyday resilience in district health systems: emerging insights from the front lines in Kenya and South Africa [^4f6590ac]. BMJ Global Health (2017). Medium credibility.

Table 1 also offers some insight into the types and combinations of managerial strategies that might underpin resilience. Although individual managers' exercise of agency and discretionary powerwas commonly important, these experiences seem to suggest that individual action to absorb or moderate disruption does not itself demonstrate everyday resilience at system level. Instead it must be incorporated within other strategies; for example, becoming an adaptive strategy that promotes organisational resilience, as with the Kilifi County manager's support for the SCHMT or Sedibeng's CHW programme development. Indeed, adaptive and transformative strategies appear to entail working with others, within and across levels of the health system. The transformative strategies identified for Kilifi and Mitchell's Plain also point tentatively to the importance of new managerial routines and practices in more substantial renewal, reorganisation and development — such as establishing principles for decision-making that can guide collective responses to new challenges as they emerge over time.

Table 2, then, considers further the organisational capacities underpinning adaptive and transformative strategies. In Kilifi, for example, individual SCHMT managers demonstrated a sense of purpose, decisiveness and concern for others (cognitive resources) and learnt ingenuity (a behavioural resource) in adapting supervision practices given the challenges experienced; and they drew on their social networks with vertical programme managers/NGOs (contextual, relational resources) to secure funding to support PHC facility managers/respond to the cholera outbreak. In Mitchell's Plain, meanwhile, the HAST programme experience (box 2) shows how a new behavioural resource, the potential for future collaborative responses to new challenges, was enabled. New principles to guide communication and engagement practices (useful, practical habits; a behavioural resource) were established through a participatory process involving front-line staff (drawing on diffused power; a contextual factor), in which managers demonstrated a sense of purpose and decisiveness, role-modelled respectful behaviours and, through their language, supported new understandings to emerge (cognitive resources). This last example also indicates the possibility that capacities for resilience may be developed through responses to challenges.

### 'Talking lines': the stories of diagnosis and support as told by those with lived experience of rare forms of dementia [^bd3e15aa]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

The interviews included three practice prompts designed to ensure usability of the materials and technology: draw a straight line, draw any line that you would like, and draw a line from when you got out of bed today to show your journey around your home up until right now. These were followed by three main prompts: (1) Please try and think back to when you first noticed something was wrong; Draw a line that describes your journey from that point to when you were [your family member was] diagnosed, (2) From the time of diagnosis, please draw a line that describes your journey to that first time you accessed information and support, and (3) Since accessing support, please draw another line that describes your journey from that first time you accessed support to the present. These time periods were chosen in order to provide a focused chronological account of a part of the dementia journey not well documented nor understood by health and social care professionals (Millenaar et al. 2016; Roberts et al. 2023; Woolley et al. 2011).

After drawing each line interviewees were asked to hold up their drawing to the camera in order for the interviewer to see what they had drawn and then ask questions about what it represented. During the joint interviews both the care-partner and the PLwRD were given the same interview prompts sequentially. Interview lengths ranged from 30 to 90 minutes. No repeat interviews were carried out. A decision to end data-collection after 25 interviews was made based on research team discussions about data adequacy and features that were intrinsic to narrative analysis research (e.g. Tanner et al. 2022) and followed recent recommendations.

"that the consideration of the characteristics of the study at hand, such as the epistemological and theoretical approach, the nature of the phenomenon under investigation, the aims and scope of the study, the quality and richness of data, or the researcher's experience and skills of conducting qualitative research, should be the primary guide in determining sample size and assessing its sufficiency" (Vasileiou et al. 2018).

### Accountability mechanisms and the value of relationships: experiences of front-line managers at subnational level in Kenya and South Africa [^287a754c]. BMJ Global Health (2018). Medium credibility.

Where accountability responsibilities conflict, front-line managers have to make choices. As well as noting that accountability upwards to line managers often 'wins', because those managers and others higher up the system have the potential to enact sanctions, we also observed in both South Africa and Kenya that some managers take significant risks in an effort to meet the needs of patients and the public (eg, confronting senior staff or going against rules). Actions that challenge health system hierarchies and system policies require confidence and commitment, and in some cases careful negotiation across a wide range of actors. Drawing also on Cleary et al, the choices that managers make in such situations of conflict, and their implications for service delivery, are likely to be centrally influenced by the attitudes, perceptions, values and beliefs of all of those potentially involved. Understanding and working to align potentially diverse positions require creativity and agency among front-line managers, and interaction and collaboration with others. These forms of coproduction are likely to be influenced by the resources available to managers (personnel, funds and so on) as well as their capabilities (technical and interpersonal).

Do front-line managers' and others' creative accountability actions have wider and longer term implications for the resilience of health systems in the face of the routine, multiple challenges they face? This is influenced by if and how the new ideas or ways of working become embedded over time in relationships and managerial routines. Where new relationships and managerial routines are observed, further analysis is required to examine whether these indicate or nurture resilience (where organisational functioning is strengthened) or 'maladapted emergence' (where organisational practices are undesirable or unsustainable). Our analysis presented elsewhereis that the reintroduction of user fees in Kilifi to cope with funding shortfalls, despite a prior policy decision to remove them because they reduce access for the poorest, is an example of maladapted emergence, whereas the introduction of regular meetings for all PHC incharges is an illustration of organisational strengthening.

### Choice is not the issue. the misrepresentation of healthcare in bioethical discourse [^0b0de83f]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2011). Low credibility.

Healthcare structure

In addition to the prerequisites of medical justifiability, doctors have to ensure that the decisions are made in line with the particular organisation of the healthcare system.

The patient, a young man, telephones the surgeon on call at the local hospital, complaining of pain after a surgical procedure. The doctor proposes that he comes in for an examination, but the patient wants to be seen at the district general hospital, insisting that he is in severe pain.

Doctor: 'We can't refer you just because you tell us that you are in a lot of pain, we have to see whether the wound is about to close or has got worse… When we've examined you, we may refer you or call the district general hospital to ask them their opinion'.
Patient: 'But couldn't I speak to those surgeons directly?'

Doctor: 'Well… yes, you could certainly call the hospital and ask for them yourself, but I'm not sure that you will be allowed to speak to them. Or else your family doctor could refer you straight to the district general hospital, but in that scenario there would be a considerable waiting list to get an appointment. It will be quicker if we could examine you first and refer you based on our examination'.
The patient is determined to be referred to the specialists at the district general hospital. When his demands are not met, it is not primarily because of a paternalistic doctor, but due to the organisation of this healthcare system. To refer a case to a specialist, the doctor must provide a medical rationale for the referral that is based on an examination of the patient, and this limits what can be done. Attempts to bend the rules might have inadvertent consequences, and a direct referral to the hospital of choice runs the risk of being refused.

Introduction

Resource constraints, value for money debates and concerns about provider behaviour have placed accountability 'front and centre stage' in health system improvement initiatives and policy prescriptions. An accountability focus has also been propelled by limited gains in health system performance in many low-income/middle-income countries, combined with specific concerns about corruption, abuse of power, inadequate financial management and poor responsiveness to community priorities and concerns. The essence of accountability is answerability between sets of individuals (or 'actors') in relation to specific activities or interventions, enforced either with positive or negative sanctions, or by personal or professional ethics such as codes of conduct. Given the size and complexity of health systems, there are a myriad of accountability relationships between actors, with these relationships either 'internal' to health bureaucracies (such as between colleagues, juniors, managers, bosses or funders); or 'external', where those working in health bureaucracies answer to others outside these bureaucracies (such as facility users, community representatives or the general public).

Both internal and external accountability relationships can be transformed by decentralisation of health systems. In decentralisation, responsibilities, functions and resources are transferred from central to lower levels of government. Although there are different forms of decentralisation (eg, deconcentration, devolution and delegation), Millsmentions that they do not necessarily reflect different degrees of local autonomy. They do, however, denote different formal lines of accountability. Devolution may entail more significant decentralisation of political, fiscal and administrative decision-making authority and greater accountability to local populations than other forms of decentralisation. However, some degree of accountability to central government remains, and the balance of accountability between central government and local publics can cause tension. It is argued that the potential benefits of decentralisation include improved allocative and technical efficiency as a result of greater cost-consciousness and control at the local level, as well as strengthening quality, transparency, accountability and legitimacy due to greater possibility for user oversight and participation in decision-making. Such positive outcomes depend critically, however, on the accountability responsibilities and practices of front-line health facility providers and managers, who play a central role in policy implementation at the district and local levels.

### What to expect when you' re evaluating healthcare improvement: a concordat approach to managing collaboration and uncomfortable realities [^7bdd5e31]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2015). Medium credibility.

A possible solution: developing a concordat

By now it will be clear that challenges in conducting programme evaluation should be anticipated with a view to managing them (box 2). But how should this be done? Attempts to answer this question commonly include exhortations for stakeholders to commit to open dialogue and respect for other stakeholders, to have clear founding principles, a shared vision and transparent mechanisms for conflict resolution. While these are all important, guidance on how to achieve them in practice is limited. We propose that one promising solution lies in evaluation partners (evaluators, designers, implementers, funders and others) working together at the outset of a project to produce a concordat. It requires them to develop a set of principles to guide the conduct of the evaluation and agreeing to abide by these principles, consistent with the approach advocated by the Harvard Negotiation Project. We elaborate the rationale behind this proposal by drawing on our experience of developing a concordat for the evaluation of a large, multi-partner patient safety improvement programme.

Box 2
Managing risks of conflict and tension in the evaluation of improvement programmes

All parties should agree on the purpose and scope of the evaluation upfront, but recognise that both may mutate over time and need to be revisited
An explicit statement of roles may ensure that understandings of the division of labour within an evaluation — and the responsibilities and relationships that imply — are shared
The expectations placed on each party in relation to data collection should be reasonable and feasible, and the methodological approach (in its basic principles) should be understood by all parties
Clear terms of reference concerning disclosure, dissemination and the limits of confidentiality are necessary from the start
All efforts should be made to avoid implementers experiencing discomfort about being studied: through ensuring all parties are fully briefed about the evaluation; sharing formative findings and ensuring appropriate levels of anonymity in reporting findings
Commitment to learning for the greatest collective benefit is the overriding duty of all parties involved — it follows from this that all parties should make an explicit commitment to ensuring sincere, honest and impartial reporting of evaluation findings

### Building an integrated methodology of learning that can optimally support improvements in healthcare [^e18b3346]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2011). Medium credibility.

First steps for the improvement science field

Achieving important aims will require vision, leadership and rapid learning. What could work? Those now focused on organisational management and improvement activities will need to learn to address the health of populations, since most clinical priorities require working across an array of delivery system boundaries in order to benefit a population efficiently. The population of interest may well mostly be local, since sick and disabled people tend to have to use services within reach. Of course, we must also discern how to forge the will that will cause leadership to care to benefit the community — and in the USA, to learn how to stretch the limits of community-focused action by multiple self-interested businesses with no local governance.

Organising for responsible advocacy

We also need to learn how to keep, at least those involved in quality improvement, abreast of initiatives arising from healthcare reforms and how to enable us to take action to inform and shape these endeavours. For example, the US Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation has recently asked the public for suggestions as to how to build an inventory of comparative effectiveness research; quality improvement insights need to show up in such an inventory. The US Internal Revenue Service recently asked for comment as to how non-profit hospitals should have to use their community benefit funds; quality improvement interests should have put their point of view. The PPACAestablished a Patient-Centred Outcomes Research Board which is required to support a Methodology Committee on comparative effectiveness research; the insights from quality improvement activities need to be part of that work. The opportunities are legion, but people involved in improved management of healthcare services delivery have no mature organisations monitoring and coordinating responses to these opportunities.

Some older issues will take on renewed importance in the months ahead. The persistently ambiguous scope of application of the US regulations concerning protection of human subjects in research will need to be revisited and clarified. The mandates of the National Institutes of Health, which mostly restrict their funding to generalisable research on prevention and cure, may need to be examined and revised to allow their participation in developing methods to draw insights from context-sensitive improvement work. US antitrust law raises new challenges for initiatives that focus upon local populations and require broad cooperation to succeed. Even copyright and trademark issues have a new layer of complications when multiple parties working in the public interest generate an instrument or protocol worthy of marketing to other localities. Having scholars and managers ready to handle these issues would position the field of improvement science well.

### Position statement on contemporary issues: conflict of interest [^6e436903]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Academy members in leadership positions should understand that they occupy a position of trust and are expected to act at all times in the best interests of the Academy, in good faith, and without bias or favor to outside interest. Whenever outside interests or other responsibilities potentially conflict with duty to the Academy, these must be declared. Members certify that they will act in such manner as to avoid even the appearance of using positions to advance any personal interest. If an actual, potential, or apparent conflict is detected, policies are in place to resolve such conflicts. All authors of Academy publications and speakers at Academy meetings adhere to the same principles of disclosure and avoidance of conflict of interest for the fair and balanced presentation of scientific information that guides practice. Any member who speaks at the annual business meeting or advisory board meeting must verbally disclose any potential conflicts of interest before speaking. The Academy is committed to transparency and objective decision-making at all organizational levels.

### Toddlers' visual exploration during decisions predicts uncertainty monitoring 1 year later [^ce52494c]. Child Development (2024). Medium credibility.

Perceptual task

Participants completed a perceptual discrimination task (Figure 1b), which differed from that used at Time 1 in that images were degraded as in previous studies with this age group (Coughlin et al.). Moreover, preschoolers were asked to provide confidence ratings (touchscreen version only; Figure 1c). Stimuli included 108 line drawings of objects and animals (Cycowicz et al.), that are typically known to children as young as 3 years of age based on previous studies (e.g. Lyons & Ghetti,) and age‐of‐acquisition norms (Morrison et al.). An automated program was used to degrade the line drawings by removing a specific number of pixels from each image. Twenty percent of pixels were removed and the percentage of pixels removed were the same for each drawing. Two sets of 40 drawings were created for counter balancing, 8 images were used for practice trials, and 20 images were used for confidence practice.

### From challenge to opportunity: the power of possibility: 2009 annual report of the policy and planning board [^8ae1c7ea]. The American Psychologist (2010). Low credibility.

The current report of the Policy and Planning Board is not about rethinking the Strategic Plan. Rather, the goal of this report is to reflect on what APA is, who and what it serves, and how it can prepare itself for action to address the changes that are coming-changes initiated from events both outside and inside the Association. As a preface to the Five-Year Report, it raises many more questions than it answers. These are questions for APA governance and members to address, and how we answer these questions in the near term will determine our long-term opportunities. This report is thus about APA's potential for organizational change and benchmarks for success.

### Changing practice paradigms: negotiating your future [^06774b7b]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

There are many recent and ongoing changes in the practice of medicine from a business standpoint as well as in overall practice management. Economic and lifestyle desires have pushed many physicians to a decision point of whether or not to join a large multispecialty group or to sell their practice and become an employee of a hospital system. There are advantages and disadvantages to both options; however, deciding on the most appropriate path for each individual can be a daunting task. At our recent breakfast session at the vascular annual meeting in Chicago, Illinois, in June 2011, we brought to light these topics to try and help enlighten physicians on which option may be right for them. There is no single answer/option that will fit every practice, but discussion for various practice management designs are outlined and critiqued. This article cannot fully discuss each view in the allotted space, but it is designed to encourage thought and discussion among the vascular surgical community as a whole.

### Identifying experts for clinical practice guidelines: perspectives from the ASH guideline oversight subcommittee [^90a3abad]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Practical approach to selecting panelists and ASH's process

We can attempt to identify individuals to serve on guidelines panels by adhering to the theoretical considerations of expertise, particularly domain knowledge and relevant experience. For organizations such as ASH, we can expect that large numbers of people would meet these criteria. How, though, should panelists be selected from a large pool of qualified candidates? At present, most panelists are selected using the word-of-mouth approach. Solicitation of public nominations assures a diverse panel of individuals who meet conflict of interest criteria and wish to serve on the panels. This approach is pragmatic and efficient, yet it risks the exclusion of less prominent content experts and reduces diversity, equity, and inclusion. For these reasons, it is suboptimal.

When an empirical or evidence-based approach is not possible, a transparent and explicit process may provide trust and increase confidence in the panel selection process. For example, noticing the influential role of the chairs and cochairs in the development of guidelines, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence publicly advertises the position for a chair and other applicants with a detailed job/person profile. The chair's responsibility to serve as the chair of the committee rather than a purveyor of a topic or methodological knowledge should be emphasized. All professional organizations can adopt this approach and ask their members to nominate (or, self-nominate) a chair and participants from an eligible pool of members.

We can also endorse good practices from the survey research to help us select qualified individuals fairly and without bias. Many societies keep directories that include the members' areas of expertise. Using a lottery to choose guideline panelists from the eligible membership pool represents a transparent mechanism for ensuring fairness in the process. For example, we can use a directory to identify the target population from which panelists will be drawn (eg, all acute myeloid leukemia experts who are ASH members). Next, we identify the sampling frame (ie, adult acute myeloid leukemia experts who are ASH members potentially enriched with additional experts who may not be ASH members). Finally, we use randomization techniques to generate an unbiased selection of a final sample of 10 or 20 individuals to be invited to serve on the panel. Randomization can be stratified to ensure that panels are diverse and representative. The assumption, here, is that by focusing on a fair process, we will also be able to identify competent individuals who are hypothesized to exist among members of a professional society.

### When is crossover desirable in cancer drug trials and when is it problematic? [^3d7b60c7]. Annals of Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Table 1
An explanation of how crossover can occur or not occur, be desirable or problematic, or any combination of these two

Crossover is desirable in settings where a drug has already proven benefit in a subsequent line of therapy and an attempt is being made to advance it to an earlier line. Such was the case in the KEYNOTE-024 trial, where patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and high expression of PD-L1 received either pembrolizumab or a platinum-based chemotherapy in the front line. Before this study, PD-1 antibody therapy had shown improved overall survival over docetaxel in second line NSCLC, and had become standard of care. Thus, in KEYNOTE-24, participants were allowed to crossover to pembrolizumab, if they had disease progression. KEYNOTE asks the clinical relevant question: is there a survival advantage to administering PD-1 antibody therapy for these patients upfront versus giving the same drug as second line, as is current practice? The trial answered this question with a positive conclusion.

Conversely, other studies have not provided the experimental drug in a later line, despite the fact that such agents represent global best practice or standard of care. In the LATITUDE trial, patients with castrate sensitive prostate cancer received androgen-deprivation therapy with or without abiraterone acetate. The treatment led to an improvement in overall survival. However, trial participants did not receive abiraterone for progressive prostate cancer, as was standard of care in the USA and other nations. In response to LATITUDE, De Bono et al. write, 'the majority of men in the control groups in the STAMPEDE and LATITUDE trials died without exposure to abiraterone or enzalutamide. Thus, the drugs used in these control groups were inconsistent with current prevailing standards of care. This has implications for the conclusions of the trials… '.

They completed four practice trials where they were asked to choose an image and were given feedback on the accuracy of their choice. When they were correct, the experimenter would give positive feedback, (e.g. "Great job! We chose this drawing because we saw that the gorilla was in there!") and when they were incorrect, the experimenter would correct them (e.g. "Oops, the gorilla is actually in here. But that's okay because it's just practice".). After these practice trials, the experimenter would train the preschoolers on using the confidence scale. The confidence scale was a 3‐point pictorial scale with pictures of a child displaying facial and body expressions of low, moderate, or high confidence at each point of the scale (Figure 1c). The same child image was used for each level and could be interpreted as being female or male. The experimenter first verbally described each level of the uncertainty scale. Low‐confidence was described as being "not so sure about your answer", moderate confidence as "kind of sure about your answer", and high confidence as "really sure about your answer". After, the preschoolers completed 10 practice trials where they were asked to find an object or image from two degraded line drawings and then reported their confidence for that answer by selecting one of the confidence scale's images. The experimenter would provide feedback on their confidence scale selection; giving positive feedback when the selection seemed to match the outward expression of uncertainty (e.g. "Great job! You were really sure about that one, so you touched this face".), and prompting them to touch another image when their selection did not match the outward expression of uncertainty (e.g. "Hmm, it seemed like you were not so sure about that one. Remember, if you're not so sure about your answer, this is the face you touch".). After the 10 practice trials, the experimenter verified the preschoolers understanding of each point on the confidence scale and stressed the importance of using all three pictures during the rest of the task. Preschoolers then completed 20 test trials, where no feedback was given. They were asked to first identify a degraded image and immediately after making their choice, they reported their confidence in their choice.

### Evidence-based practices: setting the context and responding to concerns [^eb3d512d]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

After nearly 20 years of progress in general medicine, the evidence-based practice movement is becoming the central theme for mental health care reform in the first decade of 2000. Several leaders in the movement met to discuss concerns raised by six stakeholder groups: consumers, family members, practitioners, administrators, policy makers, and researchers. Recurrent themes relate to concerns regarding the limits of science, diversion of funding from valued practices, increased costs, feasibility, prior investments in other practices, and shifts in power and control. The authors recommend that all stakeholder groups be involved in further dialog and planning to ensure that practices emerge that represent the integration of the best research evidence with clinical expertise and consumer values.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Actions speak louder than louds, but words are a start! [^43dd02c2]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

The advocacy literature is helpful here. Being clear that successful advocacy involves specific key steps enables us to turn our passions and beliefs into practical strategic action. Being analytic about the problem and its possible solutions; gathering relevant evidence and opinions; then deciding on the key issue to aim for, building relationships with potential allies, setting agreed goals, deciding how these may be achieved and also how to identify the people whose voice is most likely to be 'heard' will all strengthen the effectiveness of any practical campaign (see Box 1 for an example).

Box 1.
Example of how a national family medicine organisation might advocate for the key steps of the Seoul Declaration

Agree a programme of work is needed, who will lead and work on it, and how it will report.
Collate some of the key literature and existing messages on why family doctors can contribute to primary care that can deliver cost-effective care in a person-centred way. This could include case studies from their own and other countries.
Decide what the next key issue(s) is for our country to achieve or strengthen equitable healthcare (accessible, affordable and a range of services that achieve the same ends for all).
Discuss whether this view is shared with others and also how to achieve it: these others might include other specialties, other health professional groups and their professional representative bodies, patients and the public, health service funders and providers, and local or national public service sectors.
Agree specific targets that are feasible but also ambitious — for example, 'we shall double the numbers of family doctors in training in the next 3 years: this will be possible if… '.
This may then need another round of discussion with partners to ensure they agree!
Decide how to 'sell' this message publicly or to key decision makers — for example, it may be better to say 'Based on previous evidence, we could increase population screening coverage by x, reduce hospital admissions by y, and save the country z if we had twice as many specialist trained family doctors doing the first line of medical care in 3 years time… ' than to say 'The College of Family Doctors wants more family doctors'. Another option is the patient voice: 'Since I had a family doctor I can xxxx'. These kinds of messages and case studies can then be disseminated through social media, press and professional circles.
Of course any programme of work may need regular review, and this will be needed until the goals are achieved or the timeline of the initiative has run its course. Then it is time to take stock, learn from the experience and consider the next steps!

### It is time for consensus on' consensus statements' [^30d1fdf5]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Do consensus statements deserve the prestige they are afforded?

Expert opinion sits at the base of the evidence pyramid but when those experts gather, and take recent systematic reviews into account, their output — consensus statements — are given great weight. Consensus statements are some of the most downloaded and cited publications. They can inform state and sporting policy, which opens up the potential to impact individual behaviour and eventually patient outcomes. Judging how much to trust consensus statement recommendations can be difficult (see figure 1). How can the research community (consensus creators, Journal editors, media channels) ensure the great weight given to consensus statements is supported by a scientific, rigorous, transparent, replicable and equitable process?

Should you trust this consensus statement? Trustworthy consensus statements should address Key Questions A-D.

### Why questionnaire scores are not measures: a question-raising article [^3669e2d5]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 1
The raw scores from a 0–100 cumulative questionnaire (on the ordinate) are given as a function of the "true" linear measure (on the abscissa) of the variable tackled. Suppose scores are the number of correct responses (or, interchangeably here, the percent of correct answers). The true measure is given in linear logit units from RA. The increase in scores is roughly proportional to the rise in measure only in the "central" portion of the S-shaped (here, logistic) function (heavily hatched area). At the extremes (here, the "ceiling" of the scale, not the "floor", is highlighted), the same increase of 10 score points corresponds to a much higher increase in true measure (lightly hatched area). The scale's capacity to discriminate across subjects is lower the more the scores approach the ceiling of the questionnaire (reprinted with permission from Linacre, Fig. 1 in Wright and Linacre).
