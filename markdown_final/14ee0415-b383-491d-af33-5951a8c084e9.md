## Question

Acyclovir v Valacyclovir for kidneys

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how acyclovir compares to valacyclovir in terms of kidney safety, including mechanisms, risk factors, dosing adjustments, monitoring, and practical recommendations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and how valacyclovir's prodrug status affects acyclovir exposure. Then, I should verify the shared nephrotoxic mechanism and whether both drugs carry the same intrinsic risk. Next, I will examine comparative risk from observational and guideline data, followed by patient-level risk modifiers. After that, I need to check dosing adjustments by renal function and dialysis considerations. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and a concise conclusion that aligns with the evidence and labeling language.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology because it frames the kidney risk discussion. Valacyclovir is a prodrug rapidly converted to acyclovir via first-pass metabolism, yielding higher oral bioavailability of acyclovir and similar renal elimination of the active moiety, so the kidney ultimately handles the same active drug regardless of which agent is prescribed [^116MNW2Z] [^114YutjU].

> I need to verify the shared nephrotoxic mechanism. Both agents can precipitate acyclovir crystals in the renal tubules when intratubular concentrations exceed solubility, causing obstructive nephropathy. This is classically linked to rapid IV infusion, dehydration, and high doses, but can occur with oral therapy as well, particularly in vulnerable patients or with excessive exposure [^1125t8Si] [^114axQnE] [^112dcQ3e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about which drug is "safer". Large observational data in older adults suggest oral acyclovir and valacyclovir are not associated with a higher risk of hospitalization for AKI compared with famciclovir, implying broadly similar renal risk at usual oral doses in routine practice, though under-ascertainment of AKI is possible and risk rises with impaired renal function or interacting drugs [^117EqDaR]. But wait, what if higher bioavailability from valacyclovir increases risk? The FDA labeling for valacyclovir emphasizes dose-related nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity, especially in renal impairment, which underscores that both drugs share the same intrinsic risk profile and that risk is exposure dependent rather than agent dependent per se [^1125t8Si] [^111mkQ2Y].

> Next, I should review patient-level risk modifiers that amplify nephrotoxicity for either drug. Reduced GFR, older age, volume depletion, rapid IV administration, and concomitant nephrotoxins such as NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, or diuretics increase risk; case series and pharmacovigilance data also highlight diabetes, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and loop or potassium-sparing diuretics as additional risk factors for AKI with acyclovir or valacyclovir exposure [^116zYBZA] [^1143xoJC] [^112tSA3S] [^111euVY1].

> I will now examine dosing adjustments because this is where practice meaningfully mitigates risk. For valacyclovir, standard regimens require stepwise reductions as eGFR declines, with specific intervals for herpes zoster and HSV indications and further reduction for eGFR less than 10 mL/min or intermittent hemodialysis; hemodialysis removes about one third of acyclovir per 4-hour session, so doses should be given after dialysis on dialysis days [^114cHBbb] [^114YJRFq] [^117XTdHu]. For acyclovir, both IV and oral regimens have explicit renal dose adjustments by creatinine clearance, and IV administration must be slow with adequate hydration to limit crystalluria and tubular injury [^1133wy5P] [^114axQnE].

> Wait, let me verify neurotoxicity because it often co-travels with nephrotoxicity in impaired renal function. Valacyclovir labeling warns about CNS effects including confusion, delirium, seizures, and encephalopathy, particularly in older adults or those with renal impairment; these neurotoxic effects are mechanistically linked to elevated acyclovir concentrations and typically resolve with drug cessation and renal recovery, reinforcing the need for dose reduction in CKD and vigilance for overlapping symptoms [^1125t8Si] [^117PRYsQ].

> I should double-check pediatric and special populations guidance. In children, both acyclovir and valacyclovir require renal dose adjustment, and high-dose IV acyclovir carries a notable risk of renal injury, prompting routine renal function monitoring during therapy. Ophthalmic guidance also advises caution with systemic antivirals in patients with unknown or impaired renal function, favoring topical therapy when feasible in elderly or renally impaired patients [^113THyxB] [^116L4MMR] [^116jWWHX].

> Let me consider practical prescribing choices. For patients with eGFR below 50 mL/min, I need to ensure renal-adjusted dosing for either agent, avoid rapid IV push, maintain good hydration, and review concomitant nephrotoxins. If prior AKI or high-risk features are present, famciclovir may be a reasonable alternative given its distinct metabolic pathway and lower association with crystal nephropathy, though head-to-head superiority data are limited [^1133wy5P] [^116X83K5]. But wait, I should verify that this does not imply zero risk with famciclovir; it simply lacks the well-described crystalline nephropathy signal seen with acyclovir-class agents, so clinical judgment and monitoring remain essential [^112dcQ3e].

> Next, I should review monitoring recommendations. For high-dose IV acyclovir, check renal function at baseline and at least weekly during treatment. For oral therapy in patients with CKD or in older adults, obtain baseline creatinine and consider periodic checks if therapy is prolonged or doses are high. If neuropsychiatric symptoms emerge, promptly reassess renal function and hold therapy because toxicity is usually reversible with discontinuation and supportive care [^113THyxB] [^116nGCzQ] [^1125t8Si].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion reflects the pharmacology and evidence. Acyclovir and valacyclovir share the same active moiety and the same intrinsic renal risk, driven by acyclovir crystallization and tubular toxicity. Valacyclovir's higher bioavailability can yield higher acyclovir exposure at a given milligram dose, but risk is primarily a function of total exposure, hydration status, renal function, and coadministered nephrotoxins rather than the prodrug versus parent distinction per se. Therefore, neither agent is categorically safer for the kidneys, and safe use hinges on renal dosing, hydration, and vigilant monitoring in at-risk patients [^116MNW2Z] [^1114RCFD] [^1125t8Si] [^117EqDaR].

Both acyclovir and valacyclovir can cause **kidney injury** via crystal nephropathy and tubular toxicity, especially with high doses, rapid IV infusion, dehydration, or pre-existing renal impairment [^112dcQ3e] [^111euVY1]. Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir, so both share the same renal risks; however, valacyclovir's higher oral bioavailability can lead to higher acyclovir exposure if dosing is not adjusted, increasing nephrotoxicity risk [^116MNW2Z] [^114YutjU]. Risk is highest in elderly, dehydrated, or those with CKD; **dose reduction and hydration are essential** [^1125t8Si] [^1133wy5P]. Monitor renal function before and during therapy, and avoid rapid IV infusion or coadministration of nephrotoxic drugs [^116nGCzQ] [^114axQnE] [^1143xoJC].

---

## Mechanisms of renal toxicity

Both drugs cause **renal toxicity** through similar mechanisms:

- **Crystal nephropathy**: Acyclovir can precipitate in renal tubules, causing obstruction and tubular damage, especially with rapid IV infusion, dehydration, or high doses [^112dcQ3e] [^111euVY1].

- **Direct tubular toxicity**: Acyclovir can cause direct tubular epithelial injury, leading to acute tubular necrosis [^112dcQ3e].

- **Neurotoxicity**: Elevated acyclovir levels in renal impairment can cause encephalopathy, seizures, and confusion, indirectly affecting renal function [^1125t8Si] [^117PRYsQ].

---

## Comparative renal toxicity

Acyclovir and valacyclovir have similar renal toxicity profiles because valacyclovir is rapidly converted to acyclovir; however, valacyclovir's higher oral bioavailability (~55%) than acyclovir (~10–20%) can result in higher acyclovir exposure if dosing is not adjusted, potentially increasing nephrotoxicity risk [^116MNW2Z] [^116hFBCw]. Both can cause **acute renal failure**, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, dehydration, or when administered at high doses [^1125t8Si] [^112bhDar].

---

## Risk factors for renal toxicity

Several factors increase the risk of **renal toxicity** with acyclovir and valacyclovir:

- **Pre-existing renal impairment**: Reduced renal function significantly increases the risk of nephrotoxicity [^1125t8Si] [^111euVY1].

- **Dehydration**: Inadequate hydration promotes crystal formation and renal tubular obstruction [^1125t8Si] [^111euVY1].

- **High doses and rapid infusion**: Particularly with IV acyclovir, rapid infusion or high doses increase the risk of crystal nephropathy [^114axQnE] [^111euVY1].

- **Elderly patients**: Age-related renal decline increases susceptibility to nephrotoxicity [^1125t8Si] [^113qF8jH].

- **Concomitant nephrotoxic drugs**: Concurrent use of other nephrotoxic agents (e.g. aminoglycosides, NSAIDs) increases risk [^1143xoJC] [^112tSA3S].

---

## Clinical evidence of renal toxicity

Multiple studies and case reports document **renal toxicity** with both drugs:

- **Acyclovir**: Nephrotoxicity is well-documented, particularly with IV administration. Rapid infusion can cause crystal nephropathy and acute renal failure [^111euVY1] [^114axQnE].

- **Valacyclovir**: Case reports describe acute kidney injury (AKI) due to crystal nephropathy, even with oral administration, particularly in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or dehydration [^114w74ax] [^116zYBZA].

---

## Preventive measures and management

To minimize **renal toxicity**, the following measures are recommended:

- **Dose adjustment**: Adjust dosage based on renal function (creatinine clearance or eGFR) [^1125t8Si] [^1133wy5P].

- **Adequate hydration**: Ensure patients are well-hydrated before and during treatment [^1125t8Si] [^111euVY1].

- **Slow infusion**: Administer IV acyclovir slowly over at least 1 hour to reduce crystal formation risk [^114axQnE] [^112bhDar].

- **Monitor renal function**: Regularly monitor renal function, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment or those receiving high doses [^116nGCzQ] [^1161ygS1].

- **Avoid nephrotoxic drugs**: Minimize concurrent use of other nephrotoxic medications [^1143xoJC] [^112tSA3S].

## Summary of renal toxicity comparison

| **Factor** | **Acyclovir** | **Valacyclovir** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of toxicity | Crystal nephropathy; tubular toxicity | Crystal nephropathy; tubular toxicity |
| Bioavailability | Low (10–20%) | Higher (~55%) |
| Risk of nephrotoxicity | Moderate; higher with IV | Moderate; higher with improper dosing |
| Dose adjustment required | Yes | Yes |
| Hydration required | Yes | Yes |
| Monitoring required | Yes | Yes |

---

Both acyclovir and valacyclovir can cause **renal toxicity** through crystal nephropathy and tubular toxicity. Valacyclovir's higher bioavailability can increase acyclovir exposure if dosing is not adjusted, potentially raising nephrotoxicity risk. Risk is highest in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, dehydration, or when high doses are used. Proper dosing, hydration, and monitoring are essential to minimize renal toxicity.

Question 3: Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
A. Start intravenous acyclovir
B. Switch vancomycin to linezolid
C. Start pulse-dose methylprednisolone
D. Start topical valacyclovir to affected areas
E. Supportive care only

Answers:
A. Start intravenous acyclovir – Correct. Systemic intravenous (IV) nucleoside analogues such as acyclovir are the treatment of choice for EH. IV administration allows greater bioavailability to reduce disease duration and prevent complications. The potential renal toxicity of IV acyclovir is preventable with adequate hydration, and it has few other adverse effects. The mortality rate of EH was 75% before the use of acyclovir, emphasizing treatment importance.
B. Switch vancomycin to linezolid – Incorrect. Although antibiotics are the choice for the treatment and prevention of bacterial superinfection in EH, antiviral treatment is a priority.
C. Start pulse-dose methylprednisolone – Incorrect. Systemic glucocorticoid use should be avoided in EH because it may blunt the immune response and worsen the infection.
D. Start topical acyclovir – Incorrect. Because of the risk of contact sensitization and lack of efficacy, topical antivirals are not recommended for cutaneous EH. Although topical antiviral therapy may be used in EH to treat and prevent ocular complications, systemic therapy is the best treatment choice for cutaneous disease.
E. Supportive care only – Incorrect. EH is potentially life threatening, and antiviral treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. HSV infection has the potential to spread to the eye, causing keratoconjunctivits, and hematogenously to multiple organs, causing meningitis, encephalitis, hepatitis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation, emphasizing the need for rapid treatment and consultation of other specialists when indicated.

Seasonal variations and clustering in close communities suggest an infectious agent as the inciting factor for PR. Although human herpesviruses (HHVs) (HHV-6 and HHV-7) have often been implicated in a causal relationship with PR, the exact cause remains unknown. Additionally, PR-like eruptions have been reported with COVID-19, vaccinations (ie, bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine, influenza, diphtheria, smallpox, hepatitis B, and COVID-19), and medications (ie, gold, barbiturates, captopril, and clonidine).

There are case reports of successful treatment of PR with acyclovir based on the theory of the pathogenic involvement of HHV-6 and HHV-7, particularly when administered within the first week of symptom onset. There are additional but fewer reports of using valacyclovir (known pharmaceutically as Valacyclovir), which is the prodrug of acyclovir. The efficacy of valacyclovir as treatment for PR has so far been reported in 1 case series of 3 patients: while watchful waiting led to worsening symptoms, treatment with valacyclovir 1 g 3 times daily for 1 week led to resolution of the condition within 2 to 3 weeks. The authors have proposed valacyclovir as an alternative therapeutic option due to its less frequent dosing and a more favorable safety profile when compared with those of acyclovir. The dosing schedule of valacyclovir used in this series was adapted from the established treatment regimen for herpes zoster infection (shingles), which consists of oral valacyclovir 1 g 3 times daily for 7 days, which is the standard dose without renal adjustment.

In the emergency department, her vital signs were stable, including her blood pressure of 121/76 mmHg, a heart rate of 75 beats per minute, a temperature of 98.9 F, a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, and an oxygen saturation of 98% on room air. On the physical exam, the patient was alert and oriented, answering questions appropriately. However, at times, the patient was seen responding to internal stimuli. Patient's left eye had crusted lesions over the left V1 dermatome distribution. Initial comprehensive metabolic panel revealed a sodium of 131 mmol/L, chloride of 95 mmol/L, bicarbonate of 18 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 56 mg/dL and creatinine of 6.19 mg/dL, estimated glomerular filtration ratio (eGFR) 6.8 ml/min/1.73 m², lactate 1.8 mmol/L (Table 1). Computed tomography (CT) of the head without contrast was ordered to rule out any hemorrhagic lesions due to a change in mentation, which was negative. Ophthalmology was consulted and recommended renally dosing valacyclovir to 500 mg once daily to complete a 7-day course. Additionally, bacitracin ointment twice per day and artificial tears every 2 hours were recommended for ocular varicella zoster virus. However, due to creatinine function worsening in comparison to her previous laboratory work one month ago, valacyclovir was not started inpatient. The patient was admitted to the hospital for further work up of her elevated creatinine and altered mental status.

Monitoring of response to therapy and adverse events (including IRIS) in HSV management for people with HIV: Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are occasionally associated with nausea or headache, and no laboratory monitoring is needed for people receiving episodic or suppressive HSV therapy unless they have advanced renal impairment. For people receiving IV acyclovir, cidofovir, or foscarnet, monitoring of renal function and dose adjustment as necessary is recommended at initiation of treatment and at least once or twice weekly for the duration of treatment, if stable. Mucocutaneous lesions that are atypical and occasionally recalcitrant to therapy have been reported in individuals initiating ART and have been attributed to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

### Valacyclovir (valacyclovir hydrochloride) [^114YJRFq]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4	Patients with Renal Impairment

Dosage recommendations for adult patients with reduced renal function are provided in Table 1 [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Data are not available for the use of valacyclovir in pediatric patients with a creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min/1.73 m².

Hemodialysis

Patients requiring hemodialysis should receive the recommended dose of valacyclovir tablets after hemodialysis. During hemodialysis, the half-life of acyclovir after administration of valacyclovir tablets is approximately 4 hours. About one-third of acyclovir in the body is removed by dialysis during a 4-hour hemodialysis session.

Peritoneal Dialysis

There is no information specific to administration of valacyclovir tablets in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. The effect of chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration/dialysis (CAVHD) on acyclovir pharmacokinetics has been studied. The removal of acyclovir after CAPD and CAVHD is less pronounced than with hemodialysis, and the pharmacokinetic parameters closely resemble those observed in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) not receiving hemodialysis. Therefore, supplemental doses of valacyclovir tablets should not be required following CAPD or CAVHD.

### Acyclovir for ventilator-associated pneumonia refractory to antibiotics and with high viral herpes simplex load: we are not sure [^114x6k9W]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

We read with great interest the recent paper by Schuierer et al. who conclude that acyclovir treatment was associated with a significantly longer time to death in the intensive care unit (ICU), reduced hazard ratio for ICU death, and improved circulatory and pulmonary oxygenation function in patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) not responding to antibiotic treatment and with high herpes simplex virus (HSV) load. They suggest testing all patients with a diagnosis of antibiotic refractory VAP for HSV replication in respiratory secretions and considering acyclovir treatment if more than 10⁵ copies/mL are detected. We would like to make some comments. First, this area remains controversial as several prospective studies have failed to show an increase in mortality associated with HSV infection and the only prospective therapeutic study is limited by small sample size and prophylactic (rather than treatment) dosing. Also, as clinicians, we need to take into account the side effects of the drugs we prescribe and indeed acyclovir is not a benign drug. Nephrotoxicity is the most important side effect of acyclovir, with an overall incidence of AKI of 13%, half of which are KDIGO grade 2/3. AKI has been found to occur more frequently in patients with pre-existing chronic kidney disease (CKD), diabetes, and in patients treated with higher daily doses of acyclovir. Despite its importance, the acyclovir dose that patients received was not reported in this study. Furthermore, for a study of a drug with known renal toxicity, there is a striking paucity of information regarding renal parameters. There is an upward trend in the incidence of dialysis in those receiving acyclovir, though the difference was not statistically significant, perhaps due to the small number of patients. It should also be noted that acyclovir may be more toxic if given in conjunction with some antibiotics, such as was the case in this study. In a recent study looking at acyclovir-associated AKI, multivariate analysis indicated that the presence of diabetes, concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and vancomycin use were independent risk factors for acyclovir-associated AKI, and higher mortality was observed in AKI patients. Nephrotoxicity associated with IV acyclovir is common and necessitates renal function monitoring. Randomised control trials with more comprehensive data on dose and renal parameters are needed before recommendations regarding acyclovir treatment in the setting of VAP can be made.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^116L4MMR]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) in children with or exposed to HIV — monitoring and adverse events: Primary toxicities of acyclovir are phlebitis (when administered IV), renal toxicity, nausea, vomiting, and rash; toxicities are similar for valacyclovir and famciclovir, except for phlebitis. In infants receiving high- dose acyclovir for neonatal disease, neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm³) occurs in approximately 20% of treated neonates, and among severely ill children who were HIV-uninfected and received high-dose IV acyclovir, renal injury or failure was observed in > 10% of patients. It is recommended that renal function be determined at initiation of IV acyclovir treatment and at least once weekly for the duration of treatment; if possible, avoid other nephrotoxic drugs. IV acyclovir must be diluted adequately and administered slowly over 1 to 2 hours, and since acyclovir is excreted primarily by the kidney, dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance is needed in patients with renal insufficiency or renal failure.

### Antiviral drug-induced nephrotoxicity [^112dcQ3e]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Drug-induced kidney injury is a major side effect in clinical practice, frequently leading to acute renal failure (ARF). It accounts for more than 2% to 15% of cases of ARF in patients admitted to the hospital or in the intensive care unit, respectively. The exact frequency of nephrotoxicity induced by antiviral drugs is difficult to determine. Antiviral drugs cause renal failure through a variety of mechanisms. Direct renal tubular toxicity has been described with a number of new medications with unique effects on epithelial cells of the kidney. These include cidofovir, adefovir dipivoxil, and tenofovir, as well as acyclovir. Additionally, crystal deposition in the kidney may promote the development of renal failure. Several different drugs have been described to induce crystal nephropathy, including acyclovir and the protease inhibitor indinavir. Renal injury associated with antiviral drugs involves diverse processes having effects on the renal transporters, as well as on tubule cells. In this article, we review the pathogenesis of antiviral drug-induced kidney injury, common nephrotoxic renal syndromes, and strategies for preventing kidney injury.

### Valacyclovir-induced neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in an elderly patient with a history of nephrectomy: a case report [^112mpCRU]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Another less common side effect caused by valacyclovir is neurotoxicity, described by multiple case reports. It was first described by Linssen-Schuurmans in 1998. Brandariz-Nunez et al. 2021 did a large systematic review to better understand patients who had valacyclovir-induced neurotoxicity. Common manifestations of valacyclovir-induced neurotoxicity include confusion, hallucination, tremors, and dizziness. Risk factors that predisposes a patient to neurotoxicity while on valacyclovir include acute renal failure, high dose of valacyclovir, and age. Neurotoxicity usually manifests within 24–72 h of taking valacyclovir and completely resolves within 2 to 7 days of cessation as seen with our patient. The range in days for resolution of symptoms essentially depends on renal function. To reach a diagnosis of valacyclovir induced neurotoxicity, herpes simplex virus (HSV) encephalitis should first be ruled out. HSV encephalitis is characterized by insidious onset, presence of fever, neck pain, and headache. Our patient presented with nonspecific symptoms consistent with valacyclovir toxicity that had an abrupt onset and without signs of fever, headache, or meningeal irritation. The patient's clinical improvement of both her AKI and encephalopathy two days after discontinuing the drug also favors our diagnosis of valacyclovir-induced neurotoxicity.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Caution should be exercised to prevent inadvertent overdose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)]. Precipitation of acyclovir in renal tubules may occur when the solubility (2.5 mg/mL) is exceeded in the intratubular fluid. In the event of acute renal failure and anuria, the patient may benefit from hemodialysis until renal function is restored [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Valacyclovir-induced neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in an elderly patient with a history of nephrectomy: a case report [^112SQfB4]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

There have been many proposed mechanisms for the cause of AKI in patients taking valacyclovir. The most common mechanism agreed by various papers include crystal nephropathy causing obstructive and cellular necrosis. Another mechanism involves acyclovir aldehyde effect on tubular dysfunction. Valacyclovir causes direct cell damage, leading to membrane permeability. Destruction of mitochondria inhibits key enzymatic activity leading to cell necrosis.

The patient described in our case studies had multiple risk factors that increased her risk of developing AKI. These factors were underlying CKD, diabetes, and usage of ACE inhibitors. This combined effect in addition to a history of underlying nephrectomy caused the patient to develop risk factors for acute renal failure. Our case is unique in that it is the first paper to date that describes a patient with a history of nephrectomy and use of valacyclovir that developed acute renal failure with neurotoxicity. Our patient fits the demographic of an elderly female patient prone to valacyclovir-induced nephrotoxicity. To rule out other etiologies of acute kidney injury and allow for definitive diagnosis, a kidney biopsy should be performed. Kato et al. describes renal biopsy findings in an elderly woman with nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity induced by valacyclovir, which includes acute tubular injury with eosinophilic material in the tubular lumen as well as arteriosclerosis, without glomerulonephritis or interstitial nephritis. However, a limitation in our case was the inability to obtain a renal biopsy due to the patient's previous history of nephrectomy. Since the 1950s, renal biopsy of solitary kidneys has been contraindicated due to risk of injury, leading to possible nephrectomy.

### Valacyclovir-induced neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in an elderly patient with a history of nephrectomy: a case report [^111JFApZ]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir commonly used in the treatment of varicella zoster and herpes simplex virus. Its mechanism as a guanosine analog antiviral inhibits DNA polymerase via chain termination. Valacyclovir has a greater bioavailability and longer half-life than acyclovir. This allows for less frequent dosing of valacyclovir. Adverse reactions of valacyclovir include acute kidney failure (AKI) and encephalopathy. Hospital admission rate among patients with AKI who received valacyclovir is 0.27%. The incidence of neurotoxicity caused by valacyclovir is less than 1%. Here we discuss a 71-year-old female who had a normal creatinine and mental status one week prior to presenting at the hospital for acute encephalopathy. She was subsequently also found to have an acute kidney injury, which developed after being prescribed valacyclovir one gram three times a day for seven days by her ophthalmologist for ocular shingles.

Case presentation

A 71-year-old Hispanic female with a history of chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 3a, left nephrectomy due to renal agenesis and nephrolithiasis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency department with auditory and visual hallucinations. A week prior to presentation, she developed blisters over her eyes and face on the left side. Patient was seen by an ophthalmologist who prescribed her a seven day course of oral valacyclovir, 1 gram three times a day for shingles for one week, which is the standard for herpes ophthalmicus. After taking the medication for two days, the patient started experiencing dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Three days into her treatment she began hallucinating. Patient's home medications included metformin 1000 mg twice a day, amlodipine 5 mg daily, benazepril 40 mg daily, and rosuvastatin 10 mg nightly.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^115uqMDs]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) antiviral resistance and management: Resistance of HSV to acyclovir occurs in 5% to 10% of immunocompromised patients and should be suspected if lesions do not begin to resolve within 5 to 7 days of initiation of therapy, lesions are atypical, or satellite lesions appear after 3 to 4 days of therapy; if possible, a lesion culture should be obtained and, if virus is isolated, susceptibility testing performed, although therapy changes are often based on clinical observations. All acyclovir- resistant HSV strains are resistant to valacyclovir and it is very rare that they are sensitive to famciclovir; the therapeutic choice for acyclovir- resistant herpes is foscarnet. Foscarnet has significant nephrotoxic potential; up to 30% of patients experience increases in serum creatinine levels, and for patients receiving foscarnet, complete blood count, serum electrolytes, and renal function should be monitored twice weekly during induction therapy and once weekly thereafter, with infusing foscarnet after saline fluid loading to minimize renal toxicity and doses modified in renal insufficiency. IV cidofovir is recommended for patients with HSV resistant to acyclovir and foscarnet, and for disease limited to a small number of indolent, non- healing lesions, topical trifluridine, foscarnet, and cidofovir have been used successfully with prolonged application for 21 to 28 days or longer.

5.1	Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (TTP/HUS)

TTP/HUS, in some cases resulting in death, has occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease and also in allogeneic bone marrow transplant and renal transplant recipients participating in clinical trials of valacyclovir tablets at doses of 8 grams per day. Treatment with valacyclovir tablets should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities consistent with TTP/HUS occur.

5.2	Acute Renal Failure

Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in:

Elderly patients with or without reduced renal function. Caution should be exercised when administering valacyclovir tablets to geriatric patients, and dosage reduction is recommended for those with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
Patients with underlying renal disease who received higher-than-recommended doses of valacyclovir tablets for their level of renal function. Dosage reduction is recommended when administering valacyclovir tablets to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Patients receiving other nephrotoxic drugs. Caution should be exercised when administering valacyclovir tablets to patients receiving potentially nephrotoxic drugs.
Patients without adequate hydration. Precipitation of acyclovir in renal tubules may occur when the solubility (2.5 mg/mL) is exceeded in the intratubular fluid. Adequate hydration should be maintained for all patients.

In the event of acute renal failure and anuria, the patient may benefit from hemodialysis until renal function is restored [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

5.3	Central Nervous System Effects

Central nervous system adverse reactions, including agitation, hallucinations, confusion, delirium, seizures, and encephalopathy, have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients with or without reduced renal function and in patients with underlying renal disease who received higher-than-recommended doses of valacyclovir tablets for their level of renal function. Elderly patients are more likely to have central nervous system adverse reactions. Valacyclovir tablets should be discontinued if central nervous system adverse reactions occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease. It causes small, painful blisters on your genital area. You can spread genital herpes to others, even when you have no symptoms. If you are sexually active, you can still pass herpes to your partner, even if you are taking valacyclovir tablets. Valacyclovir tablets, taken every day as prescribed and used with the following safer sex practices, can lower the chances of passing genital herpes to your partner.

Do not have sexual contact with your partner when you have any symptom or outbreak of genital herpes.
Use a condom made of latex or polyurethane whenever you have sexual contact.

Ask your healthcare provider for more information about safer sex practices.

Who should not take valacyclovir tablets? Do not take valacyclovir tablets if you are allergic to any of their ingredients or to acyclovir. The active ingredient is valacyclovir. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in valacyclovir tablets. Before taking valacyclovir tablets, tell your healthcare provider:

About all your medical conditions, including:

if you have had a bone marrow transplant or kidney transplant, or if you have advanced HIV disease or "AIDS". Patients with these conditions may have a higher chance for getting a blood disorder called thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS). TTP/HUS can result in death.
if you have kidney problems. Patients with kidney problems may have a higher chance for getting side effects or more kidney problems with valacyclovir tablets. Your healthcare provider may give you a lower dose of valacyclovir tablets.
if you are 65 years of age or older. Elderly patients have a higher chance of certain side effects. Also, elderly patients are more likely to have kidney problems. Your healthcare provider may give you a lower dose of valacyclovir tablets.
if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Talk with your healthcare provider about the risks and benefits of taking prescription drugs (including valacyclovir tablets) during pregnancy.
if you are breastfeeding. Valacyclovir hydrochloride may pass into your milk and it may harm your baby. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby if you are taking valacyclovir tablets.
about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Valacyclovir tablets may affect other medicines, and other medicines may affect valacyclovir tablets. It is a good idea to keep a complete list of all the medicines you take. Show this list to your healthcare provider and pharmacist any time you get a new medicine.

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (Valtrex) [^1147n9vK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trial 3 was a single‑dose pharmacokinetic, multiple‑dose safety trial in 28 pediatric subjects aged 1 to less than 12 years with clinically suspected HSV infection. None of the subjects enrolled in this trial had genital herpes. Each subject was dosed with valacyclovir oral suspension 10 mg/kg twice daily for 3 to 5 days. Acyclovir systemic exposures in pediatric subjects following valacyclovir oral suspension were compared with historical acyclovir systemic exposures in immunocompetent adults receiving the solid oral dosage form of valacyclovir or acyclovir for the treatment of recurrent genital herpes. The mean projected daily acyclovir systemic exposures in pediatric subjects across all age‑groups (1 to less than 12 years) were lower (Cmax: ↓20%, AUC: ↓33%) compared with the acyclovir systemic exposures in adults receiving valacyclovir 500 mg twice daily but were higher (daily AUC: ↑16%) than systemic exposures in adults receiving acyclovir 200 mg 5 times daily. Insufficient data are available to support valacyclovir for the treatment of recurrent genital herpes in this age‑group because clinical information on recurrent genital herpes in young children is limited; therefore, extrapolating efficacy data from adults to this population is not possible. Moreover, valacyclovir has not been studied in children aged 1 to less than 12 years with recurrent genital herpes.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of VALTREX, 906 were 65 and over, and 352 were 75 and over. In a clinical trial of herpes zoster, the duration of pain after healing (post-herpetic neuralgia) was longer in subjects 65 and older compared with younger adults. Elderly patients are more likely to have reduced renal function and require dose reduction. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or CNS adverse events [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Dosage reduction is recommended when administering VALTREX to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

### Treatment of acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus with intralesional cidofovir [^113RStgc]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Guanosine analogs including acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir require phosphorylation by HSV-thymidine kinase (TK) to function in viral chain termination during viral replication. Strains of HSV acquire resistance by eliminating TK, decreasing TK activity, or altering DNA polymerase affinity. Decreased cell-mediated immunity permits the survival of these resistant strains.

The prevalence of acyclovir-resistant HSV strains in immunocompromised patients ranges from 4.1%-7.1% versus 0.1%-0.7% in immunocompetent patients. Unlike in immunocompetent hosts, whose cell-mediated immunity typically clears an HSV infection within 4–5 days, the impaired host cell-mediated immune response delays the normal clearance of HSV, which permits increased viral replication, leading to more severe and chronic lesions. Our patient presented with a low CD4 count of 9 cells/mm³ and intermittent use of antiviral therapy, which led to the disfiguring, painful, drug-resistant ulcers. The combination of acyclovir-sensitive and acyclovir-resistant strains suggested the relevance of continued use of acyclovir or valacyclovir for suppressive therapy. Nevertheless, in patients in whom adherence is not reliable, the risk of developing further resistance would typically outweigh the benefit of intermittent suppressive therapy.

Foscarnet and cidofovir are intravenous antiviral medications that do not require viral TK, making them the treatment of choice in acyclovir-resistant HSV. Their nephrotoxic side effects, however, limit their use in patients with ESRD. Topical formulations of cidofovir for the treatment of acyclovir-resistant HSV in immunocompromised patients has been reported with varying success. A report of 2 patients with vulvar and perianal herpes treated with cidofovir gel showed no improvement, along with intolerable irritation from the gel. In another case, topical cidofovir induced acute kidney injury in 2 immunocompromised patients with multidrug resistant HSV. Lastly, in a case of refractory genital HSV, topical cidofovir demonstrated success, but was used as an adjunct to systemic foscarnet, thus making its utility as monotherapy unclear. Our patient's history of ESRD and unreliable adherence to treatment regimens made topical cidofovir an inappropriate option.

### Current aspects on the management of viral uveitis in immunocompetent individuals [^115fpMNm]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Systemic antiviral treatment

As soon as typical clinical findings are present, antiviral treatment needs to be initiated.

Since the causative role of VZV, HSV-1, HSV-2, or CMV can be distinguished, a clear target for therapy is established. As it might be expected, no randomized controlled trials are available; however, a clear treatment strategy is required to cope with this often fatal disorder. The standard of care in ARN remains intravenous (IV) administration of ACV since its gastrointestinal absorption varies significantly. The half-life of ACV lasts ~3 hours only. Therefore, it is initially necessary to apply ACV three times daily at a dosage between 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg. In patients who are likely to be infected with VZV, the higher concentration of ACV should be chosen. IV treatment should be continued for at least 7 days, before medication can be switched to oral administration.

Several small pilot studies (n = 10) suggested the use of oral agents such as Val-ACV (three times daily at a dosage of 1,000 mg) and famciclovir (three times daily 500 mg) instead of initial IV administration.

Since ACV (commonly given at a daily dosage of three to five times 800 mg) is eliminated mainly via the kidneys, patients with impaired renal function have a prolonged half-life in the circulation and higher serum concentrations. This may relate to kidney and central nervous system toxicity. Because VZV is more likely to occur in older patients with already higher risk of renal problems, this needs to be taken into account.

### Antiviral selection in the management of acute retinal necrosis [^112ioqvf]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

There is no consensus on the optimal antiviral regimen in the management of acute retinal necrosis, a disease caused by herpetic viruses with devastating consequences for the eye. The current gold standard is based on retrospective case series. Because the incidence of disease is low, few well-designed, randomized trials have evaluated treatment dosage and duration. Newer oral antiviral agents are emerging as alternatives to high-dose intravenous acyclovir, avoiding the need for inpatient intravenous treatment. Drug resistance is uncommon but may also be difficult to identify. Antiviral drugs have few side effects, but special attention needs to be paid to patients who have underlying renal disease, are pregnant or are immunocompromised.

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (Valtrex) [^115Ticax]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Regarding the use of valacyclovir hydrochloride PO (also known as Valtrex) in patients with peritoneal dialysis:

- Reduce dose.
- Dose as in eGFR < 10 mL/min/1.73 m².
- The removal of acyclovir after CAPD and CAVHD is less pronounced than with hemodialysis, and the pharmacokinetic parameters closely resemble those observed in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) not receiving hemodialysis. Therefore, supplemental doses of VALTREX should not be required following CAPD or CAVHD.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^111FosZu]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus (HSV) in children and adolescents with HIV — foscarnet is the therapy of choice (strong, very low), and ideally, the viral isolate should be tested to determine the antiviral resistance pattern. Resistance of HSV to acyclovir occurs in 5% to 10% of immunocompromised patients. Resistance to antiviral drugs should be suspected if systemic involvement and skin lesions do not begin to resolve within 5 to 7 days after initiation of therapy. The decision to change therapy often is based on clinical observations because virus isolation and testing for resistance take many days. The therapeutic choice for acyclovir-resistant herpes is foscarnet, based primarily on the sensitivity pattern of HSV isolates from HSV infections unresponsive to acyclovir in immunocompromised patients and expert opinion. Patients receiving foscarnet should have electrolytes and renal function monitored twice weekly during induction therapy and once weekly thereafter. The package insert contains an algorithm for drug infusion and dose modification for patients with renal insufficiency.

### Long-term outcomes of pre-emptive valganciclovir compared with valacyclovir prophylaxis for prevention of cytomegalovirus in renal transplantation [^112H9xGS]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Prevention of cytomegalovirus (CMV) is essential in organ transplantation. The two main strategies are pre-emptive therapy, in which one screens for and treats asymptomatic CMV viremia, and universal antiviral prophylaxis. We compared these strategies and examined long-term outcomes in a randomized, open-label, single-center trial. We randomly assigned 70 renal transplant recipients (CMV-seropositive recipient or donor) to 3-month prophylaxis with valacyclovir (n = 34) or pre-emptive valganciclovir for significant CMV viremia detected at predefined assessments through month 12 (n = 36). Among the 55 patients who had a protocol biopsy specimen available at 3 years to allow assessment of the primary outcome, 9 (38%) of 24 patients in the prophylaxis group and 6 (19%) of 31 patients in the pre-emptive therapy group had moderate to severe interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (odds ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.74–8.43; P = 0.22). The prophylaxis group had significantly higher intrarenal mRNA expression of genes involved in fibrogenesis. The occurrence of CMV disease was similar in both groups, but pre-emptive therapy improved 4-year graft survival (92% versus 74%; P = 0.049) as a result of worse outcomes in patients with late-onset CMV viremia. In conclusion, compared with valacyclovir prophylaxis, pre-emptive valganciclovir therapy may lead to less severe interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy and to significantly better graft survival.

### Acyclovir… [^1114RCFD]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

- Acyclovir is a selective antiherpes agent. Its selective activity Is by exploitation of differences between the herpes-specific and host cell enzymes. The major route of elimination of acyclovir Is via the kidney by glomerular filtration and renal tubular secretion. In immunocompromised patients, acyclovir is effective for the prophylaxis and therapy of herpes simplex virus infections and for the treatment of herpes zoster and varicella. In nonimmunocompromised patients, acyclovir is beneficial in the therapy of herpes keratoconjunctivitis and in the therapy of genital herpes, with maximal benefit seen in those patients who have primary genital herpes. There is some benefit from acyclovir administration in patients with herpes zoster who are otherwise normal. The toxic reactions to acyclovir consist of phlebitis, local irritation, and occasionally, reversible renal dysfunction. Dose reduction is recommended in patients with impaired renal function.

### Valacyclovir neurotoxicity: clinical experience and review of the literature [^117PRYsQ]. European Journal of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Valacyclovir (VACV) is used increasingly to treat herpes zoster, although neuropsychiatric symptoms [VACV neurotoxicity (VAN) or acyclovir neurotoxicity], may accompany use of this drug. To promote awareness of this rare condition, we describe here two clinical cases of VAN we previously reported and review 20 cases from the literature. In all cases, chronic or acute renal failure preceded VAN. The symptoms of VAN varied, but disturbances of consciousness and hallucination occurred most commonly. When acute renal failure was due to the drug, recovery from both the disturbance of consciousness and renal failure followed within several days after discontinuation of VACV. Early recognition and diagnosis will ensure effective treatment of VAN.

### Risk of acute kidney injury from oral acyclovir: a population-based study [^117EqDaR]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Intravenous acyclovir-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) from drug crystallization in the renal tubules is described in case reports, review articles, and drug prescribing manuals. Similarly, AKI from oral acyclovir is described in case reports, but the risk in routine practice is unknown.

Study Design

Retrospective population-based cohort study.

Setting & Participants

We studied a large cohort of older patients in Ontario, Canada, receiving new outpatient prescriptions from 1997 to 2011 for oral acyclovir or valacyclovir (which is metabolized to acyclovir). The comparison drug was famciclovir, an antiviral used for indications similar to acyclovir, but with no known renal toxicity.

Predictor

Outpatient prescription for oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was hospital admission with AKI in the 30 days after the initial prescription.

Measurements

We assessed the primary outcome with health care diagnostic codes. In a subpopulation, we assessed AKI using available laboratory serum creatinine measurements.

Results

76,269 patients received acyclovir or valacyclovir and 84,646 received famciclovir. On average, patients were aged 76 [IQR, 71–81] years and prescription duration was 7 days. Acyclovir or valacyclovir use was not associated with a higher risk of hospital admission with AKI (209 [0.27%] events with acyclovir or valacyclovir vs 238 [0.28%] events with famciclovir [relative risk, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81–1.17]). Results were consistent in adjusted analyses, in all subgroups, and in the subpopulation with laboratory measurements.

Limitations

Diagnostic codes had high specificity but low sensitivity and underestimated the incidence of AKI. Only a limited number of patients (n = 2,729) had serum creatinine values available.

Conclusions

In this population-based study of older adults, oral acyclovir use was not associated with a higher risk of AKI compared to famciclovir.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

HIV-associated HSV — monitoring of response to therapy and adverse events (including IRIS) — Acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are occasionally associated with nausea or headache. No laboratory monitoring is needed for patients receiving episodic or suppressive HSV therapy unless they have advanced renal impairment. For patients receiving high-dose IV acyclovir, monitoring of renal function and dose adjustment as necessary are recommended at initiation of treatment and once or twice weekly for the duration of treatment. HSV-2 shedding and genital ulcer disease (GUD) can increase in the first 6 months after initiation of ART, particularly in those with low CD4 counts, and mucocutaneous lesions that are atypical and occasionally recalcitrant to therapy have been reported in individuals initiating ART and have been attributed to immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS).

Acyclovir — preparations, major toxicities, and special instructions for children with HIV are detailed as follows: Oral suspension 40 mg/mL, capsules 200 mg, tablets 400 mg and 800 mg, and IV 500 mg are listed. Indicating need for medical attention, more frequent toxicity is phlebitis (at injection site when given IV) and less frequent is acute renal failure (parenteral use, more common with rapid infusion), with rare parenteral-form events including encephalopathy; hematologic toxicity (leukopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anemia, hemolysis); crystalluria, hematuria; disseminated intravascular coagulation; hypotension; and neuropsychiatric toxicity (with high doses). Indicating need for medical attention if persistent or bothersome, more frequent effects include GI disturbances (anorexia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), headache, lightheadedness, and malaise, while less frequent (more common in adults than children) effects include agitation, alopecia, dizziness, myalgia, paresthesia, and somnolence. Special instructions state: Requires dose adjustment in children with renal impairment; Avoid other nephrotoxic drugs; To avoid renal tubular damage related to crystalluria, administer IV preparation by slow IV infusion over at least 1 hour at a final concentration not to exceed 7 mg/mL and accompany with adequate hydration; Use caution with IV preparation in children with underlying neurological conditions, serious hepatic or electrolyte abnormalities, or substantial hypoxia.

Specific Populations

Patients with Renal Impairment

Reduction in dosage is recommended in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

Following administration of valacyclovir tablets to subjects with ESRD, the average acyclovir half-life is approximately 14 hours. During hemodialysis, the acyclovir half-life is approximately 4 hours. Approximately one-third of acyclovir in the body is removed by dialysis during a 4-hour hemodialysis session. Apparent plasma clearance of acyclovir in subjects on dialysis was 86.3 ± 21.3 mL/min/1.73 m² compared with 679.16 ± 162.76 mL/min/1.73 m² in healthy subjects.

Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Administration of valacyclovir tablets to subjects with moderate (biopsy-proven cirrhosis) or severe (with and without ascites and biopsy-proven cirrhosis) liver disease indicated that the rate but not the extent of conversion of valacyclovir to acyclovir is reduced, and the acyclovir half-life is not affected. Dosage modification is not recommended for patients with cirrhosis.

Patients with HIV-1 Disease

In 9 subjects with HIV-1 disease and CD4+ cell counts less than 150 cells/mm³ who received valacyclovir tablets at a dosage of 1 gram 4 times daily for 30 days, the pharmacokinetics of valacyclovir and acyclovir were not different from that observed in healthy subjects.

After single-dose administration of 1 gram of valacyclovir tablets in healthy geriatric subjects, the half-life of acyclovir was 3.11 ± 0.51 hours compared with 2.91 ± 0.63 hours in healthy younger adult subjects. The pharmacokinetics of acyclovir following single- and multiple-dose oral administration of valacyclovir tablets in geriatric subjects varied with renal function. Dose reduction may be required in geriatric patients, depending on the underlying renal status of the patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

Pediatric Patients

Acyclovir pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in a total of 98 pediatric subjects (aged 1 month to less than 12 years) following administration of the first dose of an extemporaneous oral suspension of valacyclovir [see Adverse Reactions (6.2), Use in Specific Populations (8.4)]. Acyclovir pharmacokinetic parameter estimates following a 20-mg/kg dose are provided in Table 4.

5.1 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (TTP/HUS)

TTP/HUS, in some cases resulting in death, has occurred in patients with advanced HIV disease and also in allogeneic bone marrow transplant and renal transplant recipients participating in clinical trials of valacyclovir hydrochloride at doses of 8 grams per day. Treatment with valacyclovir hydrochloride should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities consistent with TTP/HUS occur.

5.2 Acute Renal Failure

Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in:

Elderly patients with or without reduced renal function. Caution should be exercised when administering valacyclovir hydrochloride to geriatric patients, and dosage reduction is recommended for those with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
Patients with underlying renal disease who received higher than recommended doses of valacyclovir hydrochloride for their level of renal function. Dosage reduction is recommended when administering valacyclovir hydrochloride to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Patients receiving other nephrotoxic drugs. Caution should be exercised when administering valacyclovir hydrochloride to patients receiving potentially nephrotoxic drugs.
Patients without adequate hydration. Precipitation of acyclovir in renal tubules may occur when the solubility (2.5 mg/mL) is exceeded in the intratubular fluid. Adequate hydration should be maintained for all patients.

In the event of acute renal failure and anuria, the patient may benefit from hemodialysis until renal function is restored [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

5.3 Central Nervous System Effects

Central nervous system adverse reactions, including agitation, hallucinations, confusion, delirium, seizures, and encephalopathy, have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients with or without reduced renal function and in patients with underlying renal disease who received higher than recommended doses of valacyclovir hydrochloride for their level of renal function. Elderly patients are more likely to have central nervous system adverse reactions. Valacyclovir hydrochloride should be discontinued if central nervous system adverse reactions occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

### Valacyclovir in the treatment of acute retinal necrosis [^1135sBQH]. BMC Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute retinal necrosis (ARN) is a rare, but potentially devastating, syndrome characterised by progressive peripheral necrotising retinitis. It was first described in 1971, but it took more than a decade later for its herpetic aetiology to be discovered and antiviral therapy to become the mainstay of treatment. The current standard of care for ARN consists of intravenous acyclovir 10 mg/kg (or 1500 mg/m²) every 8 h for 5–10 days, followed by oral acyclovir 400–800 mg 5 times daily for an additional 6–12 weeks, to reduce the risk of second eye involvement. Nevertheless, there is a lack of consensus concerning the treatment of ARN, with an increasing number of groups reporting primary treatment of ARN with oral antiviral therapy alone, although others suggest that intravenous antiviral therapy is superior or even that higher doses of intravenous therapy are indicated in most patients without renal impairment.

Advocates of oral antiviral therapy argue that the adoption of intravenous antiviral therapy predated the discovery of valacyclovir and famciclovir, both of which have superior plasma bioavailability to acyclovir as oral preparations. Both agents have been reported to be successful in the treatment of ARN in small case series. This study adds to this evidence and is, to our knowledge, the largest consecutive case series of patients with ARN treated solely with oral valacyclovir without antecedent intravenous therapy or adjunctive intravitreal therapy.

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (valacyclovir) [^112BBfWU]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

The plasma elimination half-life of acyclovir typically averaged 2.5 to 3.3 hours in all studies of valacyclovir hydrochloride in volunteers with normal renal function.

Specific Populations: Renal Impairment: Reduction in dosage is recommended in patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), (8.6)].

Following administration of valacyclovir hydrochloride to volunteers with ESRD, the average acyclovir half-life is approximately 14 hours. During hemodialysis, the acyclovir half-life is approximately 4 hours. Approximately one third of acyclovir in the body is removed by dialysis during a 4-hour hemodialysis session. Apparent plasma clearance of acyclovir in dialysis patients was 86.3 ± 21.3 mL/min/1.73 m² compared with 679.16 ± 162.76 mL/min/1.73 m² in healthy volunteers. Hepatic Impairment: Administration of valacyclovir hydrochloride to patients with moderate (biopsy-proven cirrhosis) or severe (with and without ascites and biopsy-proven cirrhosis) liver disease indicated that the rate but not the extent of conversion of valacyclovir to acyclovir is reduced, and the acyclovir half-life is not affected. Dosage modification is not recommended for patients with cirrhosis. HIV Disease: In 9 patients with HIV disease and CD4+ cell counts < 150 cells/mm3who received valacyclovir hydrochloride at a dosage of 1 gram 4 times daily for 30 days, the pharmacokinetics of valacyclovir and acyclovir were not different from that observed in healthy volunteers. Geriatrics: After single-dose administration of 1 gram of valacyclovir hydrochloride in healthy geriatric volunteers, the half-life of acyclovir was 3.11 ± 0.51 hours, compared with 2.91 ± 0.63 hours in healthy younger adult volunteers. The pharmacokinetics of acyclovir following single- and multiple-dose oral administration of valacyclovir hydrochloride in geriatric volunteers varied with renal function. Dose reduction may be required in geriatric patients, depending on the underlying renal status of the patient [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.5), (8.6)].

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Acyclovir safety and monitoring, including IRIS considerations: Primary toxicities of acyclovir are phlebitis (when acyclovir is administered IV), renal toxicity, nausea, vomiting, and rash, and in infants receiving high-dose acyclovir for neonatal HSV disease the major side effect was neutropenia (defined as absolute neutrophil count < 1,000/mm3); among severely ill children without HIV receiving high-dose IV acyclovir, renal injury or failure was observed in > 10% of patients; renal function should be assessed upon initiation of acyclovir treatment and at least once weekly during treatment, if possible avoid concomitant administration of other nephrotoxic drugs, and IV acyclovir must be adequately diluted and administered slowly over 1 to 2 hours; since acyclovir is excreted primarily by the kidneys, dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance is needed in patients with renal insufficiency or renal failure; HZ has been considered an IRIS event in numerous reports.

In 2001 valganciclovir was approved by the FDA for treatment of HIV associated retinitis and in 2003 for prevention of post transplant CMV. This review provides an update on the status of its use and areas of controversy: How long should prophylaxis be given? What is the appropriate dose for prophylaxis? Can it be used in children, and at what dose? Can it be used to treat CMV disease? The question of optimal dosing will probably not be settled as the sample size for controlled trials would be prohibitive. Other trials clearly show that extended therapy provides added benefit, the drug is safe and an appropriate dose has been identified in children and oral therapy of CMV disease is effective.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of valacyclovir hydrochloride PO (also known as Valtrex):
- Agitation, hallucinations, acute confusional state, delusion, seizure, encephalopathy: use caution in patients with advanced age and underlying renal disease. Monitor patients for neuropsychiatric symptoms regularly and adjust the dosage. Discontinue Valacyclovir hydrochloride if CNS adverse reactions occur, assess the patient's condition thoroughly, and provide appropriate psychiatric evaluation and management.
- **Renal failure**: use extreme caution in elderly patients (with or without reduced renal function), patients with underlying renal disease who receive higher-than-recommended doses of valacyclovir tablets for their level of renal function, patients who receive concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, or inadequately hydrated patients. Monitor renal function regularly, especially in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, volume depletion, or concurrent use of other nephrotoxic medications. Discontinue Valacyclovir immediately; initiate appropriate supportive measures, including fluid and electrolyte management, and consultation with a nephrologist for further evaluation and management.
- **TTP, HUS**: use extreme caution in patients with advanced HIV disease and those with allogeneic bone marrow transplant and renal transplant. Monitor patients for any signs or symptoms of thrombotic microangiopathy, such as unexplained thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, and neurological changes. Discontinue Valacyclovir immediately; initiate appropriate medical management for thrombotic microangiopathy, including plasma exchange and supportive care; consult a hematologist or nephrologist for specialized management.

### Clinical performance measures for neurocritical care: a statement for healthcare professionals from the Neurocritical Care Society [^116hFBCw]. Neurocritical Care (2020). High credibility.

Herpes simplex virus encephalitis — treatment rationale and adult recommendations state that the mortality of untreated herpes simplex virus encephalitis is approximately 70%, intravenous acyclovir selectively inhibits viral replication and has been shown to reduce mortality and improve functional outcome when compared to vidarabine, and the regimen is generally 10 mg/kg/dose administered intravenously every 8 hours for 14–21 days with doses reduced in patients with renal impairment; enteral acyclovir should be avoided due to its poor bioavailability (10–20%) and treatment with enteral valacyclovir is not recommended; from the 2012 Association of British Neurologists and British Infection Association guidance, intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg three times daily) should be started if cerebrospinal fluid and/or imaging suggest viral encephalitis, or within 6 h of admission if these results will not be available or if the patient is very unwell or deteriorating, acyclovir should still be started within 6 h of admission whilst further diagnostic investigations are awaited when initial tests are normal but suspicion remains, the dose of acyclovir should be reduced in patients with pre-existing renal impairment, and in proven herpes simplex virus encephalitis, intravenous acyclovir treatment should be continued for 14–21 days.

Drug Interaction Studies

When valacyclovir is coadministered with antacids, cimetidine and/or probenecid, digoxin, or thiazide diuretics in patients with normal renal function, the effects are not considered to be of clinical significance (see below). Therefore, when valacyclovir is coadministered with these drugs in patients with normal renal function, no dosage adjustment is recommended.

Antacids: The pharmacokinetics of acyclovir after a single dose of valacyclovir (1 gram) were unchanged by coadministration of a single dose of antacids (Al3+or Mg++).

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (valacyclovir) [^116MNW2Z]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

There is no accumulation of acyclovir after the administration of valacyclovir at the recommended dosage regimens in adults with normal renal function.

Distribution: The binding of valacyclovir to human plasma proteins ranges from 13.5% to 17.9%. The binding of acyclovir to human plasma proteins ranges from 9% to 33%.

Metabolism: Valacyclovir is converted to acyclovir and L -valine by first-pass intestinal and/or hepatic metabolism. Acyclovir is converted to a small extent to inactive metabolites by aldehyde oxidase and by alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Neither valacyclovir nor acyclovir is metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. Plasma concentrations of unconverted valacyclovir are low and transient, generally becoming non-quantifiable by 3 hours after administration. Peak plasma valacyclovir concentrations are generally less than 0.5 mcg/mL at all doses. After single-dose administration of 1 gram of valacyclovir hydrochloride, average plasma valacyclovir concentrations observed were 0.5, 0.4, and 0.8 mcg/mL in patients with hepatic dysfunction, renal insufficiency, and in healthy volunteers who received concomitant cimetidine and probenecid, respectively. Elimination: The pharmacokinetic disposition of acyclovir delivered by valacyclovir is consistent with previous experience from intravenous and oral acyclovir. Following the oral administration of a single 1 gram dose of radiolabeled valacyclovir to 4 healthy subjects, 46% and 47% of administered radioactivity was recovered in urine and feces, respectively, over 96 hours. Acyclovir accounted for 89% of the radioactivity excreted in the urine. Renal clearance of acyclovir following the administration of a single 1 gram dose of valacyclovir hydrochloride to 12 healthy volunteers was approximately 255 ± 86 mL/min which represents 42% of total acyclovir apparent plasma clearance.

### Clinical practice guideline: Bell's palsy [^111PfcaG]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2013). Medium credibility.

Bell's palsy — antiviral monotherapy: Clinicians should not prescribe oral antiviral therapy alone for patients with new-onset Bell's palsy. Strong recommendation (against) based on high-quality randomized controlled trials with a preponderance of benefit over harm. Aggregate evidence quality: Grade A and Level of confidence in evidence: High. Evidence shows that antiviral therapy alone is no better than placebo with regard to facial nerve recovery in Bell's palsy and is inferior to steroid therapy with regard to facial nerve recovery rate, with acyclovir and valacyclovir the most extensively studied antivirals. The most comprehensive randomized controlled trial failed to find an improved rate of facial nerve recovery in 207 patients treated with valacyclovir alone, compared with 209 patients treated with placebo alone. Reported harms note gastrointestinal side effects (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) with rare severe reactions (hives, bronchospasm, angioedema, hepatic or renal failure), no serious adverse events were noted in the Bell's palsy literature, and antiviral therapy may carry an increased risk for pregnant patients. In summary, antiviral therapy alone (acyclovir or valacyclovir) is not recommended in the treatment of Bell's palsy due to lack of effectiveness of currently available drugs, unnecessary cost, and the potential for drug-related complications.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^113YcHCh]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

Several drugs, including acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir, have demonstrated minimal efficacy in terms of pain control for patients with HZ. 17 Additionally, a significant proportion of these patients (∼20‐40% and sometimes more) go on to develop PHN. 3, 18 These drugs require multiple doses of medication each day. 19, 20, 21 Furthermore, doses of these antiviral agents must be modified for patients with renal impairment. It is evident that a drug with greater antiviral activity, better pain relief, and a more simplified dosing regimen represents a significant unmet medical need. Brivudine is also available in some countries for treating shingles. 22

FV‐100 is a prodrug for the bicyclic nucleoside analogue CF‐1743. 23 CF‐1743 demonstrates high potency against clinical VZV isolates (EC₅₀ ~ 440 pM). The inhibitory activity of FV‐100 and CF‐1743 is highly specific for VZV. Renal clearance for FV‐100 and CF‐1743 was demonstrated to be low for all doses tested (100, 200, 400, and 800 mg QD), indicating that renal elimination is not likely to be an important pathway for either compound. In light of these results, a Phase 2 clinical trial was undertaken in patients with HZ in order to evaluate the efficacy of once‐daily (QD) FV‐100 at both the 200 mg and 400 mg doses, compared with valacyclovir 3000 mg administered three times daily (1000 mg TID) in reducing the acute herpes zoster burden of illness (BOI) and reducing the incidence of PHN.

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride [^112tJetn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Trial 3 was a single-dose pharmacokinetic, multiple-dose safety trial in 28 pediatric subjects aged 1 to less than 12 years with clinically suspected HSV infection. None of the subjects enrolled in this trial had genital herpes. Each subject was dosed with valacyclovir oral suspension 10 mg/kg twice daily for 3 to 5 days. Acyclovir systemic exposures in pediatric subjects following valacyclovir oral suspension were compared with historical acyclovir systemic exposures in immunocompetent adults receiving the solid oral dosage form of valacyclovir or acyclovir for the treatment of recurrent genital herpes. The mean projected daily acyclovir systemic exposures in pediatric subjects across all age-groups (1 to less than 12 years) were lower (Cmax: ↓ 20%, AUC: ↓ 33%) compared with the acyclovir systemic exposures in adults receiving valacyclovir 500 mg twice daily but were higher (daily AUC: ↑ 16%) than systemic exposures in adults receiving acyclovir 200 mg 5 times daily. Insufficient data are available to support valacyclovir for the treatment of recurrent genital herpes in this age-group because clinical information on recurrent genital herpes in young children is limited; therefore, extrapolating efficacy data from adults to this population is not possible. Moreover, valacyclovir has not been studied in children aged 1 to less than 12 years with recurrent genital herpes.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the total number of subjects in clinical trials of valacyclovir tablets, 906 were 65 and over, and 352 were 75 and over. In a clinical trial of herpes zoster, the duration of pain after healing (post-herpetic neuralgia) was longer in subjects 65 and older compared with younger adults. Elderly patients are more likely to have reduced renal function and require dose reduction. Elderly patients are also more likely to have renal or CNS adverse events [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.6 Renal Impairment

Dosage reduction is recommended when administering valacyclovir tablets to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

### Valacyclovir-induced neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in an elderly patient with a history of nephrectomy: a case report [^116zYBZA]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Valacyclovir is an antiviral drug used often for the management of herpes simplex and herpes zoster viruses due to its higher bioavailability. Reported side effects of valacyclovir, as described in various case reports by Abuhelwa et al. 2022, Kato et al. 2022, Murakami et al. 2018, and Zhang et al. 2016 with the most common being acute kidney injury and more rare reports including neurotoxicity. However, the side effects of valacyclovir are not very well recognized by clinicians as there are less reported side effects compared to acyclovir.

There have been only two large studies that characterize valacyclovir toxicity. A paper done in Japan by the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency (PMDA) discusses acute kidney injury in patients taking valacyclovir. The paper characterizes patients who developed AKI after taking valacyclovir. Of the 250,000 reported adverse drug reactions using valacyclovir, 514 individuals had concerns of kidney related adverse events. Out of the 514 kidney related adverse events, 344 had AKI. AKI was more common in females older than 40 years. 74.1% did not use any other drugs when taking valacyclovir. Those who took other drugs included valsartan and diclofenac, which contributed to a small portion of AKI. Another study by Lam et al. 2013 in Ontario, Canada discusses risk factors for development of AKI in patients on acyclovir or valacyclovir. The relative risk (RR) of AKI include 4.02 in patients with chronic kidney disease, 1.39 in patients with congestive heart failure, 1.51 in patients with diabetes mellitus, 1.68 in patients taking potassium sparing diuretics, 1.85 in patients using loop diuretics, and 1.39 in patients taking angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

### Randomized trial of valganciclovir versus valacyclovir prophylaxis for prevention of cytomegalovirus in renal transplantation [^117YT3bb]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2015). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Both valganciclovir and high-dose valacyclovir are recommended for cytomegalovirus prophylaxis after renal transplantation. A head-to-head comparison of both regimens is lacking. The objective of the study was to compare valacyclovir prophylaxis with valganciclovir, which constituted the control group.

Design, Settings, Participants, & Measurements

In a randomized, open-label, single-center trial, recipients of renal transplants (recipient or donor cytomegalovirus-seropositive) were randomly allocated (1:1) to 3-month prophylaxis with valacyclovir (2 g four times daily) or valganciclovir (900 mg daily). Enrollment occurred from November of 2007 to April of 2012. The primary end points were cytomegalovirus DNAemia and biopsy-proven acute rejection at 12 months. Analysis was by intention to treat.

Results

In total, 119 patients were assigned to valacyclovir (n = 59) or valganciclovir prophylaxis (n = 60). Cytomegalovirus DNAemia developed in 24 (43%) of 59 patients in the valacyclovir group and 18 (31%) of 60 patients in the valganciclovir group (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 0.71 to 2.54; P = 0.36). The incidence of cytomegalovirus disease was 2% with valacyclovir and 5% with valganciclovir prophylaxis (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.01 to 5.90; P = 0.36). Significantly more patients with valacyclovir prophylaxis developed biopsy-proven acute rejection (18 of 59 [31%] versus 10 of 60 [17%]; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.49; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 5.65; P = 0.03). The incidence of polyomavirus viremia was higher in the valganciclovir group (18% versus 36%; adjusted hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.96; P = 0.04).

Conclusions

Valganciclovir shows no superior efficacy in cytomegalovirus DNAemia prevention compared with valacyclovir prophylaxis. However, the risk of biopsy-proven acute rejection is higher with valacyclovir.

5.1 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (TTP/HUS)

TTP/HUS, in some cases resulting in death, has occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease and also in allogeneic bone marrow transplant and renal transplant recipients participating in clinical trials of valacyclovir at doses of 8 grams per day. Treatment with valacyclovir should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities consistent with TTP/HUS occur.

5.2 Acute Renal Failure

Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in:

- Elderly patients with or without reduced renal function. Caution should be exercised when administering valacyclovir to geriatric patients, and dosage reduction is recommended for those with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

- Patients with underlying renal disease who received higher-than-recommended doses of valacyclovir for their level of renal function. Dosage reduction is recommended when administering valacyclovir to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

- Patients receiving other nephrotoxic drugs. Caution should be exercised when administering valacyclovir to patients receiving potentially nephrotoxic drugs.

- Patients without adequate hydration. Precipitation of acyclovir in renal tubules may occur when the solubility (2.5 mg/mL) is exceeded in the intratubular fluid. Adequate hydration should be maintained for all patients.

In the event of acute renal failure and anuria, the patient may benefit from hemodialysis until renal function is restored [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

Adverse Effects of Antivirals

Whether given intravenously or orally, systemic antivirals have known adverse effects for which patients require routine monitoring. While there is limited systemic absorption when administered via intravitreal injection, there still exists a risk for such adverse effects. Acyclovir, famciclovir, ganciclovir, and valacyclovir all require dose adjustments in geriatric and renal patients and careful attention must be placed on whether the patient is taking other nephrotoxic medications.

Acyclovir and valacyclovir are well tolerated in the oral form, but intravenously administered can cause neurotoxicity and renal toxicity due to a crystalline nephropathy. Patients can commonly experience a headache, rash, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Immunocompromised patients taking valacyclovir are at a higher risk for nephrotoxicity and thrombocytopenia and need to be regularly monitored; these patients are specifically at risk for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome (TTP/HUS).

Famciclovir can be similarly associated with a rash, headaches, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Ganciclovir, when given intravenously, is commonly associated with bone marrow suppression resulting in anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia and renal toxicity. Intravitreal injections of this medication carry the additional risk of endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment. Valganciclovir has a similar adverse effect profile as ganciclovir as it is a prodrug for ganciclovir.

Foscarnet can result in headaches and gastrointestinal symptoms and less likely can result in nephrotoxicity, hypocalcemia, and neurotoxicity. Intravitreal injections of this medication carry the additional risk of endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, and retinal detachment.

While these medications are often given in conjunction with an infectious disease specialist, it is important to understand the potential risks in this particularly susceptible population.

Antiviral-Resistant HSV Infection

If lesions persist or recur in a patient receiving antiviral treatment, acyclovir resistance should be suspected and a viral culture obtained for phenotypic sensitivity testing. Molecular testing for acyclovir resistance is not available. Such persons should be managed in consultation with an infectious disease specialist, and alternative therapy should be administered. All acyclovir-resistant strains are also resistant to valacyclovir, and the majority are resistant to famciclovir. Foscarnet (40–80 mg/kg body weight IV every 8 hours until clinical resolution is attained) is the treatment of choice for acyclovir-resistant genital herpes. Intravenous cidofovir 5 mg/kg body weight once weekly might also be effective. Foscarnet and cidofovir are nephrotoxic medications that require intensive laboratory monitoring and infectious disease specialist consultation. Imiquimod 5% applied to the lesion for 8 hours 3 times/week until clinical resolution is an alternative that has been reported to be effective. Topical cidofovir gel 1% can be applied to lesions 2–4 times daily; however, cidofovir must be compounded at a pharmacy.

Prevention of antiviral resistance remains challenging among persons with HIV infection. Experience with another group of immunocompromised persons (e.g. hematopoietic stem-cell recipients) demonstrated that persons receiving daily suppressive antiviral therapy were less likely to experience acyclovir-resistant HSV infection compared with those who received episodic therapy for outbreaks.

Monitoring guidance states, "It is recommended that renal function be determined at initiation of IV acyclovir treatment and at least once weekly for the duration of treatment", and "If possible, avoid other nephrotoxic drugs". Administration precautions include, "IV acyclovir must be diluted adequately and administered slowly over 1 to 2 hours", and dosing should reflect renal clearance: "dose adjustment based on creatinine clearance is needed in patients with renal insufficiency or renal failure".

### Cytomegalovirus antiviral resistance among kidney transplant recipients in a phase 3 trial of letermovir vs valganciclovir prophylaxis [^113D3SJJ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Participants and Sampling

This phase 3 double-blind multicenter trial (protocol MK-8228–002) based on a randomized controlled design compared 28 weeks (up to 200 days) of CMV disease prophylaxis with letermovir vs valganciclovir in KTRs who were CMV D+R− through 52 weeks posttransplant. Complete details of the trial were reported by Limaye et al. Briefly, from May 2018 to April 2021, participants from 94 global sites were randomized 1:1 to letermovir (480 mg/d) or valganciclovir (900 mg/d), with stratification by receipt of lymphocyte-depleting induction immunosuppression. The letermovir group received acyclovir (400 mg twice daily) for prophylaxis of herpes simplex and varicella zoster virus and a placebo for valganciclovir. The valganciclovir group received placebos for letermovir and acyclovir. Discontinuation of prophylaxis for a lack of efficacy or adverse events was noted.

Protocol-defined dose modifications for valganciclovir and acyclovir were indicated according to creatinine clearance assessments (Cockcroft-Gault formula), as recommended in guidelines and prescribing information. Valganciclovir doses lower than recommended for prophylaxis or dose interruptions due to adverse events were documented. Participants who had ≥ 4 valganciclovir dose modifications due to changes in creatinine clearance during prophylaxis were noted, given an observation from another analysis that ≥ 4 modifications were associated with a higher rate of CMV DNAemia vs < 4 modifications [data on file].

Upon suspicion of CMV infection or disease based on clinical signs and symptoms or upon discontinuation of prophylaxis with the intent to start CMV treatment, investigators obtained plasma samples for analysis of CMV DNA at a central laboratory (Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan assay; lower limit of quantification, 137 IU/mL), although additional testing may have been performed at local laboratories for clinical decision making. CMV antiviral resistance and gB genotyping were also analyzed from the given plasma samples. Additional plasma samples were collected at 2 prespecified subsequent time points (next scheduled study visit and at week 52) and other time points based on the investigators' discretion. All investigator-reported cases of CMV disease were assessed by an external independent blinded clinical adjudication committee and confirmed per the diagnostic criteria specified by the CMV Drug Development Forum.

### FV-100 versus valacyclovir for the prevention of post-herpetic neuralgia and the treatment of acute herpes zoster-associated pain: a randomized-controlled trial [^1111oAMd]. Journal of Medical Virology (2017). Low credibility.

In conclusion, the comprehensive results of the burden of illness, PHN, time to clinically significant pain resolution, and pain score analyses demonstrate a potential role for FV‐100 in the reduction of subacute and chronic pain as well as the prevention of PHN. The safety profile of FV‐100 remains favorable both in isolation and when compared to valacyclovir. Current antiviral medications have limited effectiveness in the reduction of subacute and chronic pain, do not satisfactorily prevent or adequately treat PHN, and require dosing modifications in patients with renal insufficiencies. The efficacy results from this study support further investigation of FV‐100 to address these unmet medical needs.

### Oral acyclovir induced hypokalemia and acute tubular necrosis a case report [^112JzHZL]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Drug-induced kidney injury is a frequent adverse effect seen in clinical practice by different mechanisms that commonly lead to acute kidney injury (AKI). In a large cohort study of patients with community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI), nephrotoxic drugs where assumed in 59.9% of the cases.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) have a major impact on public health. Between 1999 and 2008, the annual number of ADRs increased 76.8%, and a two-fold increase in drug nephrotoxicity was observed.

Antiviral drugs like acyclovir, are known to induce AKI when administrated intravenously. Risk factors for developing acyclovir-induced nephrotoxicity include hypovolemia, rapid intravenous infusion, concurrent AKI prior to drug administration, excess medication dosage in relation to renal function, and concurrent use of other nephrotoxic agents. Severe nephrotoxicity occurs in approximately 12–48% of the cases. However, the potential damage induced by oral administration remains unclear. In one study aimed to assess hospital admission due to AKI within 30 days after prescription of oral acyclovir, it was found that neither the use of acyclovir nor valacyclovir was associated with a higher risk of AKI, in comparison to famcyclovir.

Potassium disturbances are a well-known harmful consequence of drug intake. Drug-induced hypokalemia is most frequently caused by diuretic glucocorticoid, and laxative administration.

Alternatively, it may be the result of an increased intracellular potassium influx induced by the use of sympathomimetic drugs, and insulin.

We report a unique case of oral Acyclovir induced hypokalemia and CA-AKI due to acute tubular necrosis.

POTENTIAL ANTIMICROBIAL TREATMENTS FOR AD CLINICAL TRIALS

Treatment of HSV-1: Acyclovir and valacyclovir

Acyclovir decreases HSV-1-induced Aβ accumulation in cultured neuroblastoma cells. Aβ in cell cultures was reduced by 70% at a 200 μM concentration of acyclovir. In addition, acyclovir inhibits HSV-1-induced abnormal tau phosphorylation in vitro. Abnormal tau phosphorylation was reduced nearly 100% at a 200 μM concentration of acyclovir (Fig. 7). Acyclovir decreased Aβ by reducing cellular viral spreading and decreased tau phosphorylation by interfering with viral replication. Penciclovir and foscarnet, which also inhibit viral DNA replication, were shown to reduce phosphorylated tau and Aβ, with foscarnet being less effective than acyclovir and penciclovir.

Acyclovir is a nucleoside analogue that interferes with HSV-1 replication and reactivation. Viral thymidine kinase is required to convert acyclovir into acyclo-guanosine monophosphate. Subsequently, the monophosphate form is converted to the active tri-phosphate form by cellular kinases. As a substrate, acyclo-guanosine triphosphate is incorporated into viral DNA, resulting in premature chain termination. Acyclovir is able to cross the BBB. The drug would directly target a potential cause of AD, act on infected cells only, and would not affect the normal metabolism of infected neurons.

Acyclovir is FDA approved and widely used for the treatment of HSV infections. The side effect profile is mild; however it would be necessary to monitor renal function. Rarely, treatment is complicated by reversible neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring more frequently in patients with pre-existing renal impairment.

Valacylovir is the biodrug of acyclovir. Following oral administration, valacyclovir is rapidly hydrolyzed to acyclovir via first-pass intestinal and hepatic metabolism. Valacyclovir has better oral absorption than acyclovir and is able to cross the BBB as acyclovir following hydrolysis. Oral valacyclovirhas been used to successfully treat herpes simplex encephalitis. In a multiple sclerosis trial evaluating HHV-6, valacyclovir at a dose of 3 grams per day for 2 years was shown to be safe with no patient discontinuation due to side effects or toxicity. Both acyclovir and valacyclovir have been found safe during long-term use in patients being treated for HSV suppression. Furthermore, resistance rates are low (< 0.5%) among immunocompetent patients.

### Valacyclovir-induced neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in an elderly patient with a history of nephrectomy: a case report [^112qPxWB]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir, both of which are commonly used in the treatment of varicella zoster and herpes simplex viruses. Its mechanism as a guanosine analog antiviral inhibits DNA polymerase via chain termination. It has selective action in infected cells with minimal effect on host cells, lending to fewer side effects, and is a well-tolerated medication often chosen for its better oral bioavailability over acyclovir. Its side effect profile includes thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, and increased transaminases. Common adverse effects include headache, nausea, and vomiting. A rare adverse effect of valacyclovir is acute kidney injury (AKI) due to obstructive crystal-induced nephropathy, tubular dysfunction, or tubulointerstitial nephritis. To date, no case report has cited normal dosing of valacyclovir causing acute kidney injury in a patient status post nephrectomy.

Case present

We present a 71-year-old female with history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), left nephrectomy due to renal agenesis and nephrolithiasis, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presented to the emergency department due to visual and auditory hallucinations after taking two days of valacyclovir for shingles. Laboratory work demonstrates elevated creatinine at 6.19 mg/dL. Patient was monitored throughout hospitalization with cessation of valacyclovir. Patient's creatinine down-trended.

Conclusion

This case report demonstrates a rare case of acute kidney injury due to an exaggerated response to valacyclovir-induced crystal nephropathy, presenting in tandem with valacyclovir-induced neurotoxicity, which has only been described in three case reports. This case highlights the importance of careful history and physical exam to facilitate a more accurate and timely diagnosis, especially in patients with a history of nephrectomy.

### Valacyclovir-induced neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity in an elderly patient with a history of nephrectomy: a case report [^112SbfgX]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

The combination of valacyclovir induced nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity concomitantly has been rarely described. There have been three papers showing simultaneous presentation of renal injury and encephalopathy induced by valacyclovir use: Murakami et al. 2018, Kenzaka et al. 2021, Abuhelwa et al. 2022. In these case reports, cessation of encephalopathic symptoms occurred within days after valacyclovir was discontinued and as renal function improved. As in our patient, advanced age was a common factor contributing to the AKI and encephalopathy in all three case reports. Furthermore, the use of ARBs is another risk factor that contributed to AKI in Murakami et al. as in our patient, who used an ACE inhibitor, which has a similar mechanism of ARB, and a contributing factor to AKI. The patient discussed in Abuhelwa et al. had diabetes, which is similar to our patient, a risk factor for AKI. In Kenzaka et al. the patient received 300 mg per day of valacyclovir. However, in Murakami et al. and Abuhelwa et al. the patient received the same dosage as our patient discussed in the case report, 1 gram three times a day. Even at low dosage of 300 mg per day, neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity was achieved. Our patient should be added to the few case reports of both valacyclovir induced nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity to further help facilitate a more accurate and timely diagnosis, especially since it has never been described in an individual with a unilateral kidney.

To date, there have been no case reports discussing patients who have had nephrectomy and with concurrent use of valacyclovir, which may have exacerbated our patient's symptoms. Although the absolute contraindication for renal biopsy in patients with a solitary kidney makes acyclovir-induced nephropathy difficult to definitively diagnose, especially in patients who present with acute renal failure and encephalopathy, a thorough medication review is critical. In summary, patients with a unilateral kidney who present with an AKI and/or altered mental status on valacyclovir should raise prompt concern for drug induced adverse effects, as they might be more susceptible to having them. These patients should be monitored for recovery of renal function. Future large retrospective studies or meta analysis should help identify if there is a dose-dependent effect with use of valacyclovir toxicity.

### Valacyclovir provides optimum acyclovir exposure for prevention of cytomegalovirus and related outcomes after organ transplantation [^114NBDbF]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

A meta-analysis of 12 randomized trials (1574 patients) examined herpesvirus and related outcomes following organ transplantation over a range of acyclovir exposures (including valacyclovir). Overall, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (odds ratio [OR], 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.34–0.57; P < .001), CMV disease (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.31–0.54; P < .001), death (OR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.40–0.90; p = 0.01), opportunistic infection (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53–0.91; p = 0.009), acute graft rejection (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.52–0.86; P < .001), herpes simplex virus disease (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.12–0.24; P < .001), and varicella-zoster virus disease (OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01–0.25; P < .001) were significantly reduced. Increased acyclovir exposure influenced more end points: Maximum efficacy resulted from valacyclovir (8 g/day). Increasing acyclovir exposure to that achieved with valacyclovir extends benefits of prophylaxis to include impact on graft rejection and opportunistic infections.

Precipitation of acyclovir in renal tubules may occur when the solubility (2.5 mg/mL) is exceeded in the intratubular fluid. In the event of acute renal failure and anuria, the patient may benefit from hemodialysis until renal function is restored [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus (HSV) in adults and adolescents with HIV — resistance pattern and treatment guidance: All acyclovir-resistant strains are also resistant to valacyclovir, and the majority are resistant to famciclovir; the treatment of choice for acyclovir-resistant HSV is IV foscarnet (AI), with IV cidofovir as a potential alternative (CIII). Systemic foscarnet and cidofovir are nephrotoxic medications; treatment should be given in consultation with an infectious diseases specialist (AIII) and with frequent laboratory monitoring. Topical imiquimod, cidofovir, trifluridine, and foscarnet have been used successfully to treat external lesions (BIII), although prolonged application for 21 to 28 days or longer may be required, and topical cidofovir, foscarnet, and trifluridine must be compounded in a pharmacy. A novel oral agent, the helicase-primase inhibitor pritelivir, is currently being tested in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03073967), and there is an Expanded Access Program available for oral pritelivir (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05844436).

5.1 Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura/Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (TTP/HUS)

TTP/HUS, in some cases resulting in death, has occurred in patients with advanced HIV-1 disease and also in allogeneic bone marrow transplant and renal transplant recipients participating in clinical trials of valacyclovir tablets at doses of 8 grams per day. Treatment with valacyclovir tablets should be stopped immediately if clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities consistent with TTP/HUS occur.

5.2 Acute Renal Failure

Cases of acute renal failure have been reported in:

Elderly patients with or without reduced renal function. Caution should be exercised when administering valacyclovir tablets to geriatric patients, and dosage reduction is recommended for those with impaired renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].
Patients with underlying renal disease who received higher-than-recommended doses of valacyclovir tablets for their level of renal function. Dosage reduction is recommended when administering valacyclovir tablets to patients with renal impairment [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].
Patients receiving other nephrotoxic drugs. Caution should be exercised when administering valacyclovir tablets to patients receiving potentially nephrotoxic drugs.
Patients without adequate hydration. Precipitation of acyclovir in renal tubules may occur when the solubility (2.5 mg/mL) is exceeded in the intratubular fluid. Adequate hydration should be maintained for all patients.

In the event of acute renal failure and anuria, the patient may benefit from hemodialysis until renal function is restored [see Dosage and Administration (2.4), Adverse Reactions (6.3)].

5.3 Central Nervous System Effects

Central nervous system adverse reactions, including agitation, hallucinations, confusion, delirium, seizures, and encephalopathy, have been reported in both adult and pediatric patients with or without reduced renal function and in patients with underlying renal disease who received higher-than-recommended doses of valacyclovir tablets for their level of renal function. Elderly patients are more likely to have central nervous system adverse reactions. Valacyclovir tablets should be discontinued if central nervous system adverse reactions occur [see Adverse Reactions (6.3), Use in Specific Populations (8.5, 8.6)].

### Neurologic acyclovir toxicity in the absence of kidney injury [^115soQEC]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Herpes zoster (zoster) also commonly known as "shingles", occurs following re-activation of the varicella zoster virus. It contributes a large cost burden to the U.S. health care system, with an estimated 1 million cases costing $1 billion annually. The current gold standard treatment is acyclovir, which limits viral replication. However, acyclovir has been reported to cause neurotoxicity in patients with acute or chronic kidney disease.

Case Report

This case presents an occurrence of acyclovir-induced toxic encephalopathy in a patient with normal renal function. A 63-year-old male presented to the emergency department with ataxia, tremors, fluctuating aphasia, confusion, agitation, and fatigue. Results of imaging, lumbar puncture, and laboratory studies directed clinicians toward acyclovir toxicity, despite a normal creatinine level. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians will likely be the first point of contact in the health care system following the onset of acyclovir toxicity. With an increasing incidence of zoster disease, such atypical toxic manifestations may increase. Early recognition is important to avoid permanent neurologic compromise.

### What's old is new: valacyclovir for the treatment of pityriasis rosea, a retrospective case series [^114SNdP7]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

It is noted that valacyclovir is the prodrug of acyclovir resulting in similar safety profiles. Some common side effects of valacyclovir include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, and rash (valacyclovir). Severe rash, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome–toxic epidermal necrolysis spectrum, has been described in 1 case report after treatment with acyclovir, but, to our knowledge, there are no reports to date of this severe cutaneous adverse reaction after valacyclovir use. No patient in our case series reported adverse effects or side effects from taking valacyclovir for the specified dose and duration. No patient had to discontinue the week-long course due to medication side effects. No patient required renal dosing adjustment.

All patients in this case series reported either significant improvement (44.4%) or total resolution (55.6%) with the proposed treatment, suggesting that valacyclovir may be considered a reasonable treatment option for PR. Six of 9 patients treated with valacyclovir had complete resolution or significant improvement of their rash in a duration of < 6 weeks, which is shorter than the cited duration of 6 weeks to 6 months with spontaneous resolution. Of 3 patients who were monitored with a rash for longer than 6 weeks, patient 9 suffered with the eruption for 12 weeks before evaluation in our clinic. Despite flaring after COVID-19 vaccination and failing potent topical corticosteroid treatment, her rash and quality of life were greatly improved at her 2-week follow-up.

VACV oral suspension in children ages 1 year to < 12 years old. The major PK findings are presented in the table below. caplet contains valacyclovir HCl equivalent to either 500 mg or 1 g valacyclovir free base. VACV is rapidly converted to acyclovir via first-pass intestinal and/or hepatic metabolism. Due to higher acyclovir bioavailability following oral administration of VACV as compared with acyclovir. identified and measured to assess pharmacokinetic parameters and exposure response relationships. Yes, the sponsor has appropriately measured acyclovir levels in plasma as the primary moiety for PK evaluation. Plasma concentrations of VACV are low and transient, as it is rapidly converted to the active form, acyclovir. VACV typically. the pediatric patients for all three studies.

Apparent Oral Clearance for All Age Groups Across All Three Studies The following information is taken from the Valtrex label: Geriatrics: Acyclovir plasma concentrations are higher in geriatric patients compared to younger adults, in part due to age-related changes in renal function. Dosage reduction may be required in geriatric patients with underlying renal impairment. Adults with Impaired Renal Function: The half-life and total body clearance of acyclovir are dependent on renal function. A dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with reduced renal function. According to the Valtrex label, precipitation of acyclovir in renal tubules. Effect of drug interactions: Acyclovir Cmax and AUC following a single dose of VACV increased by 8% and 32%, respectively, after a single dose of cimetidine or by 22% and 49%, respectively, after probenecid, or by. 30% and 78%, respectively, after a combination of cimetidine and probenecid.

This effect is primarily due to a reduction in renal clearance of acyclovir. However, no dose adjustment is necessary when giving these drugs in combination with VACV in patients with normal renal function.
