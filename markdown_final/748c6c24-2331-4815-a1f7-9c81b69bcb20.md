## Question

is welbutrin safe with methamphetamine use

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the safety of using Wellbutrin (bupropion) with methamphetamine, and when it might be considered therapeutically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacology and interaction potential between bupropion and methamphetamine. Then, I should verify the major safety risks, especially seizures, cardiovascular effects, and neuropsychiatric adverse events. Next, I will review the clinical evidence for bupropion in methamphetamine use disorder, including any combination strategies. After that, I need to check guideline positions and contraindications. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and monitoring plan, making sure I double-check areas where I might overstate or understate the evidence.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and interaction risk. Bupropion is a dual dopamine–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with mild CYP2D6 inhibition, while methamphetamine is an indirect sympathomimetic that releases dopamine and norepinephrine and inhibits their reuptake; together, there is mechanistic overlap that could amplify stimulatory effects and increase toxicity, and DrugBank notes bupropion can decrease methamphetamine metabolism, which could raise methamphetamine exposure, so I need to keep that in mind as I weigh safety [^115Cisfz] [^113iu7sM].

> Now, I should review seizure risk because that is the most critical safety issue. Bupropion lowers the seizure threshold in a dose-related fashion, with risk rising substantially above 450 mg/day, and it is contraindicated in patients with seizure disorders or conditions that increase seizure risk; methamphetamine itself is proconvulsant, and stimulant-induced seizures are a recognized complication, so combining the two creates additive seizure risk that is clinically meaningful and potentially life-threatening, especially with high bupropion doses, binge methamphetamine use, or metabolic derangements [^116XKLZ4] [^114WeZiR] [^1169BHws].

> Next, I will examine cardiovascular risk. Both agents can increase blood pressure and heart rate; bupropion labeling warns about hypertension, particularly when combined with drugs that increase dopaminergic or noradrenergic activity, and methamphetamine labeling documents mean increases in BP and HR and risks of serious cardiac events, so concurrent use can produce additive sympathomimetic effects and precipitate arrhythmias, ischemia, or hypertensive crises in susceptible patients [^1179rAXr] [^113XP4Vx].

> I need to check neuropsychiatric risks as well. Bupropion can precipitate psychosis, paranoia, mania, and suicidality, and methamphetamine can induce psychosis or mania even in patients without prior psychiatric history; combined use may heighten the risk of stimulant-induced psychosis, agitation, and suicidality, so I should be cautious in patients with any psychiatric vulnerability or family history of psychosis [^115QnnDD] [^1169BHws] [^117XrTHk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about therapeutic value. I should review the evidence for bupropion in methamphetamine use disorder. Bupropion alone has not shown robust efficacy overall, but subgroup analyses suggest a signal in patients with lower-frequency stimulant use (less than about 18 days per month) who are adherent, and one randomized trial found higher abstinence only among adherent participants; however, a separate trial in less-than-daily users did not meet significance for the primary endpoint, so the evidence remains limited and inconsistent [^112WciJZ] [^11781qQ2].

> Let me consider combination therapy, because that is where the signal is stronger. The combination of extended-release injectable naltrexone plus daily extended-release bupropion produced modest but statistically significant improvements in methamphetamine-negative urine samples in a large, well-conducted trial, with a number needed to treat around 9; this is the most consistent pharmacologic signal to date for methamphetamine use disorder, though effects are modest and require good adherence and behavioral support [^1139XFbG] [^116YJ8GS].

> I should confirm guideline positions to anchor recommendations. The ASAM/AAAP guideline supports considering bupropion for patients with low-to-moderate-frequency stimulant use and notes that bupropion is contraindicated in individuals with a history of seizures or anorexia/bulimia and should be used with caution in those with elevated seizure risk; the VA/DoD guideline concludes that evidence is insufficient to recommend pharmacotherapy broadly for methamphetamine use disorder, though it acknowledges emerging data for bupropion–naltrexone and emphasizes psychosocial treatments like contingency management as first-line [^112WciJZ] [^117BchJh] [^116MNFS2] [^113WeXMq].

> Wait, let me verify a potential pitfall in interpretation. I initially thought bupropion might be contraindicated with any stimulant because of the seizure risk, but I should correct that: the formal contraindications are seizure disorder, current or prior anorexia or bulimia, abrupt discontinuation of alcohol or benzodiazepines, and MAOI use, not stimulants per se; however, concurrent stimulant use is a major seizure risk factor and a strong relative contraindication in practice, particularly outside of a controlled treatment setting, so I need to be precise here [^116XKLZ4] [^113rGFhM].

> Putting this together, I should double-check the bottom line. Concurrent use of bupropion with methamphetamine is not considered safe due to additive seizure risk, cardiovascular stress, and neuropsychiatric adverse effects; if bupropion is considered at all, it should be in the context of treating methamphetamine use disorder with the bupropion–naltrexone combination in carefully selected, motivated patients with low-to-moderate-frequency use, no seizure risk, and close medical monitoring, while psychosocial interventions such as contingency management remain foundational [^112WciJZ] [^1139XFbG] [^113WeXMq].

> Practically, I need to ensure a structured approach. Before initiating bupropion, screen rigorously for seizure history, eating disorders, cardiovascular disease, and psychiatric comorbidity; obtain baseline and periodic blood pressure and heart rate; counsel on overdose and seizure risk; and coordinate with addiction specialists for combination therapy and behavioral supports; in patients actively using methamphetamine, prioritize stabilization, harm reduction, and contingency management, and only consider bupropion–naltrexone if use is low-to-moderate frequency and adherence can be supported, with a low threshold to discontinue if seizures, psychosis, or cardiovascular complications emerge [^112sR3xi] [^117LuDK5] [^112WciJZ].

No, Wellbutrin (bupropion) is **not safe to use with methamphetamine** because both drugs lower the seizure threshold and increase the risk of seizures [^116XKLZ4] [^114WeZiR]. They also have **additive cardiovascular effects** (hypertension, tachycardia, arrhythmias) [^1179rAXr] and can cause severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, including psychosis and mania [^115QnnDD] [^1169BHws]. Bupropion can inhibit methamphetamine metabolism, raising methamphetamine levels and toxicity [^115Cisfz]. If bupropion is used for methamphetamine use disorder, it should only be with close medical supervision and not during active methamphetamine use.

---

## Pharmacological interactions and risks

### Seizure risk

Both bupropion and methamphetamine **lower the seizure threshold**, and combined use markedly increases seizure risk [^116XKLZ4] [^1169BHws]. Bupropion-related seizures are dose-dependent and rise with higher doses or rapid titration [^116XKLZ4]. Methamphetamine is proconvulsant, and seizures are a known complication of use [^114WeZiR].

---

### Cardiovascular effects

Both agents can cause **hypertension and tachycardia**; combined use can precipitate severe cardiovascular events, including arrhythmias and hypertensive crises [^1179rAXr] [^113XP4Vx]. Methamphetamine is associated with cardiomyopathy, ischemia, and sudden death, especially with high doses or chronic use [^117KsKzP].

---

### Neuropsychiatric effects

Both drugs can cause **psychosis, mania, and agitation**; combined use increases the risk of severe neuropsychiatric symptoms, including paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions [^115QnnDD] [^1169BHws]. Methamphetamine can induce psychosis even without a prior psychiatric history [^115B1Jai].

---

### Pharmacokinetic interactions

Bupropion inhibits CYP2D6, which can **increase methamphetamine levels** and toxicity [^notfound]. Higher methamphetamine exposure increases cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric risks.

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

- **No safe use**: There is no evidence supporting safe concurrent use of bupropion and methamphetamine.

- **Guideline stance**: ASAM/AAAP 2024 guidelines do not recommend bupropion during active methamphetamine use due to safety concerns.

- **Combination therapy**: Bupropion is considered only with naltrexone for methamphetamine use disorder under close supervision, and not with ongoing methamphetamine use.

---

## Clinical recommendations

- **Avoid concurrent use**: Do not co-prescribe bupropion with methamphetamine because of seizure, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric risks.

- **If bupropion is used**: Ensure abstinence from methamphetamine, monitor closely for seizures, cardiovascular events, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, and titrate slowly.

- **Alternative treatments**: Use behavioral interventions (e.g. contingency management) and consider other medications (e.g. naltrexone, mirtazapine) with caution and supervision.

9 DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE

9.1 Controlled Substance

Bupropion is not a controlled substance.

9.2 Abuse

Humans

Controlled clinical studies of bupropion HCl immediate-release conducted in normal volunteers, in subjects with a history of multiple drug abuse, and in depressed patients demonstrated an increase in motor activity and agitation/excitement.

In a population of individuals experienced with drugs of abuse, a single dose of 400 mg bupropion produced mild amphetamine-like activity as compared to placebo on the Morphine-Benzedrine Subscale of the Addiction Research Center Inventories (ARCI), and a score intermediate between placebo and amphetamine on the Liking Scale of the ARCI. These scales measure general feelings of euphoria and drug desirability.

Findings in clinical trials, however, are not known to reliably predict the abuse potential of drugs. Nonetheless, evidence from single-dose studies does suggest that the recommended daily dosage of bupropion when administered in divided doses is not likely to be significantly reinforcing to amphetamine or CNS stimulant abusers. However, higher doses (that could not be tested because of the risk of seizure) might be modestly attractive to those who abuse CNS stimulant drugs.

Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets are intended for oral use only. The inhalation of crushed tablets or injection of dissolved bupropion has been reported. Seizures and/or cases of death have been reported when bupropion has been administered intranasally or by parenteral injection.

Animals

Studies in rodents and primates demonstrated that bupropion exhibits some pharmacologic actions common to psychostimulants. In rodents, it has been shown to increase locomotor activity, elicit a mild stereotyped behavioral response, and increase rates of responding in several schedule-controlled behavior paradigms. In primate models assessing the positive reinforcing effects of psychoactive drugs, bupropion was self-administered intravenously. In rats, bupropion produced amphetamine-like and cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effects in drug discrimination paradigms used to characterize the subjective effects of psychoactive drugs.

### Utilizing a two-stage design to investigate the safety and potential efficacy of monthly naltrexone plus once-daily bupropion as a treatment for methamphetamine use disorder [^114R88yD]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This 2-stage open-label pilot study evaluated the safety and potential efficacy of naltrexone + bupropion as a pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine (MA) use disorder.

Methods

The study was conducted in 2 stages of recruitment across 3 sites; 20 participants were enrolled in stage 1 and 29 participants were enrolled in stage 2. Eight weeks of open-label pharmacotherapy with a combination of extended-release injectable naltrexone (XR-NTX; Vivitrol) plus extended-release oral bupropion (BRP; Wellbutrin XL) were provided with a smartphone-assisted medication adherence platform. Participants met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition criteria for severe MA use disorder, self-reported ≥ 20 days of MA use in the 30 days prior to consent, and submitted 3 MA-positive urine drug screens (UDS) out of 4 collected during screening. Participants attended clinic twice weekly for observed BRP dosing, UDS testing, assessments, and medical management; XR-NTX was administered at weeks 1 and 5. A BRP taper and follow-up visit occurred in week 9.

Results

Analyses evaluated effects of XR-NTX+BRP to determine the number of "responders" according to a statistically predefined response criterion (6 of 8 MA-negative UDS during the last 4 weeks of medication). The 2-stage design required that stage 1 yield ≥ 3 responders to continue to stage 2; 11 of the 49 participants met responder criteria across both stages (5 in stage 1, 6 in stage 2).

Conclusions

Under the statistical analysis plan, study "success" required ≥ 9 responders. With 11 responders, the study demonstrated sufficient potential of naltrexone plus bupropion as a combination pharmacotherapy for MA use disorder to warrant further study.

### Risk factors for methamphetamine use in youth: a systematic review [^115tAU3G]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Methamphetamine (MA) is a potent stimulant that is readily available. Its effects are similar to cocaine, but the drug has a profile associated with increased acute and chronic toxicities. The objective of this systematic review was to identify and synthesize literature on risk factors that are associated with MA use among youth.

More than 40 electronic databases, websites, and key journals/meeting abstracts were searched. We included studies that compared children and adolescents (≤ 18 years) who used MA to those who did not. One reviewer extracted the data and a second checked for completeness and accuracy. For discrete risk factors, odds ratios (OR) were calculated and when appropriate, a pooled OR with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) was calculated. For continuous risk factors, mean difference and 95% CI were calculated and when appropriate, a weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI was calculated. Results were presented separately by comparison group: low-risk (no previous drug abuse) and high-risk children (reported previous drug abuse or were recruited from a juvenile detention center).

Results

Twelve studies were included. Among low-risk youth, factors associated with MA use were: history of heroin/opiate use (OR = 29.3; 95% CI: 9.8–87.8), family history of drug use (OR = 4.7; 95% CI: 2.8–7.9), risky sexual behavior (OR = 2.79; 95% CI: 2.25, 3.46) and some psychiatric disorders. History of alcohol use and smoking were also significantly associated with MA use. Among high-risk youth, factors associated with MA use were: family history of crime (OR = 2.0; 95% CI: 1.2–3.3), family history of drug use (OR = 4.7; 95% CI: 2.8–7.9), family history of alcohol abuse (OR = 3.2; 95% CI: 1.8–5.6), and psychiatric treatment (OR = 6.8; 95% CI: 3.6–12.9). Female sex was also significantly associated with MA use.

Conclusion

Among low-risk youth, a history of engaging in a variety of risky behaviors was significantly associated with MA use. A history of a psychiatric disorder was a risk factor for MA for both low- and high-risk youth. Family environment was also associated with MA use. Many of the included studies were cross-sectional making it difficult to assess causation. Future research should utilize prospective study designs so that temporal relationships between risk factors and MA use can be established.

Abuse liability

Stimulants have a tendency to be liked by a certain proportion of the population, though not by everyone by any means. There is some evidence that basal dopamine tone determines this, with people who have a higher number of dopamine D 2 receptors as measured by [11 C]-raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) finding the stimulants aversive rather than pleasurable. However, a pleasurable experience from d- amphetamine can lead to excessive use of it as a prescribed drug by the patient and the (mis)use of the prescription by others (diversion). For these reasons, all current amphetamine-type stimulant treatments are Controlled Drugs under the UK Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, with all members of being placed in Class B except methamphetamine, which was recently placed into Class A because of fears of an explosion of recreational abuse similar to that seen in the United States and Thailand.

In reality, there is little abuse of these drugs by patients with ADHD, and in most cases the challenge for the prescribing doctor is to keep the patients taking their medication rather than limiting its use. Many teenage patients stop using despite the drugs having clear benefits for their school performance; they cite reasons such as feeling too controlled, wanting empowerment from medication, etc. For these reasons, observations of dependence and abuse of prescription d- amphetamine are rare in clinical practice, and this stimulant can even be prescribed to people with a history of drug abuse provided certain controls, such as daily pick-ups of prescriptions, are put in place.

It is well known that recreational drug abusers and dependent users generally administer psychostimulants at doses several-fold higher than those stipulated for therapeutic use. Furthermore, to achieve its greatest pharmacological effect, the maximum quantity of drug must be delivered into the CNS in the shortest possible time. It is this imperative which causes drug abusers to progress from relatively safe methods of self-administration, such as oral ingestion, onto increasingly dangerous routes, for example snorting cocaine, smoking ('crack' cocaine or 'crystal meth') or intravenous injection. Another less well-recognised factor in drug abuse is a desire of users for instant gratification. Thus, the appeal of a particular drug as a recreational substance of abuse is to a large extent determined by its ability to produce its desired effects within minutes, for example the cocaine 'rush'.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

Educate patients and their families about the risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction of methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets, which can lead to overdose and death, and proper disposal of any unused drug [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2), Overdosage (10)]. Advise patients to store methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets to anyone else.

Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease

Advise patients that there are potential risks to patients with serious cardiac disease, including sudden death with methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets use. Instruct patients to contact a healthcare provider immediately if they develop symptoms such as exertional chest pain, unexplained syncope, or other symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

Instruct patients that methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets can cause elevations of their blood pressure and pulse rate and they should be monitored for such effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Psychiatric Adverse Risks

Advise patients that methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms even in patients without prior history of psychotic symptoms or mania [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

### Two case studies illustrating a shared decision-making approach to illicit methamphetamine use and breastfeeding [^112hewfk]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Crystal methamphetamine (MA) is a potent psycho-stimulant that is increasingly used worldwide. It is highly addictive, is often made in clandestine laboratories, and can cause serious health issues in adults. Health professionals caring for women in the perinatal period must counsel women about the health risks to infants if they are exposed to MA in breast milk. Most guidelines recommend that women who have current or recent MA use do not breastfeed. This article explores approaches to breastfeeding advice in the context of MA use. Women who have made lifestyle changes, engaged well with services in the antenatal period, and are committed to drug counseling services after discharge from hospital may be supported to breastfeed if they are assessed as safe to do so. The importance of assessing each woman individually when developing infant feeding plans throughout the perinatal period is advocated.

### Association of pharmacological treatments and hospitalization and death in individuals with amphetamine use disorders in a Swedish nationwide cohort of 13 965 patients [^117Nfi9G]. JAMA Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Amphetamines are the second most used illicit drugs worldwide and amphetamine-related hospitalizations are increasing substantially. There is an elevated risk of infections and mental disorders associated with methamphetamine or amphetamine use disorders (MAUD). People with MAUD are also at higher risk of mortality compared with the general population, mainly from directly drug-related deaths, but also due to suicide, homicide, cardiovascular disease, and injuries. Amphetamine use is associated with aggressive behavior and criminality, which also indirectly lead to morbidity and mortality. Mortality related to amphetamine or methamphetamine use is increasing, and has doubled over the past decade, possibly indicating the next substance use crisis. According to the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction Sweden Country Drug Report 2019, amphetamines were the third most commonly used illicit drugs, and 1.2% of young adults aged 17 to 34 years were taking them. Concerning all the harm and costs that MAUD cause for the individual and society, effective treatments seem essential. However, there are currently no approved pharmacological interventions available for treating MAUD. Recent meta-analyses have investigated the effectiveness of antidepressants, antipsychotics, psychostimulants, anticonvulsants, and opioid agonists and antagonists, and suggest that there are some promising candidates for the treatment of MAUD, yet convincing evidence is lacking. Treatment with the combination of extended-release injectable naltrexone and daily oral extended-release bupropion resulted in a low, but higher than placebo, response for methamphetamine-negative urine samples. In addition, the antidepressant mirtazapine has been reported to reduce methamphetamine use when combined with substance use counseling. The most consistent positive findings have been demonstrated with stimulant agonists (dexamphetamine, and methylphenidate,), naltrexone, and topiramate, whereas antidepressants have shown less consistent results in reducing amphetamine use. A recent systematic review and meta-analysisevaluated agonist-based pharmacological interventions (similarly as used in opioid and tobacco use disorders) and found that prescription psychostimulants had a beneficial effect to promote abstinence in persons with stimulant use disorders. Dexamphetamine has similar neurochemical and behavioral effects to methamphetamine, and it has been used as an off-label treatment for MAUD. Lisdexamphetamine is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug of dexamphetamine. It presents a candidate pharmacotherapy for MAUD and seems relatively safe and well tolerated. However, studies tend to be limited by small sample sizes in defined populations and by low treatment retention or completion rates.

### Acute neurocognitive and subjective effects of oral methamphetamine with low doses of alcohol: a randomised controlled trial [^113R9emZ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Methamphetamine, a potent central nervous system stimulant, is an indirect agonist at the noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin (5-HT) receptor sites. It is one of the most common clandestinely and illegally manufactured, trafficked and abused amphetamine-type stimulant in the world, and its use is associated with increasing social, economic and health burden. Despite this, explicit examination of methamphetamine-induced effects on pertinent behavioural and neurocognitive domains is limited. Of the few studies that are available, evidence of an inverted U-shaped concentration–effect relationship suggests that while low to moderate doses of methamphetamine may have no or only select beneficial effects on functional neurocognition, these effects become maladaptive at higher doses and during tasks of greater complexity. Recreationally, however, methamphetamine is rarely (if ever) consumed in isolation; yet even fewer studies have explored the relevant neurocognitive and subjective consequences of the comorbid use of methamphetamine with other substances such as alcohol.

Methamphetamine is frequently co-consumed with alcohol in recreational settings among occasional and frequent stimulant users. Combined use may enhance desirable substance-specific properties and induce additive and/or synergistic pharmacological effects. Due to opposing mechanisms of action and mutually inflammatory properties, combined use can also amplify respective deleterious properties and increase propensity for toxicity. Over one-third of individuals admitted to an emergency department for trauma will have measurable concentrations of both methamphetamine and alcohol in their system, and the combined use of these substances is of increasing concern for road safety. To our knowledge, only two small laboratory studies exist which examine the physiological and behavioural effects of combined methamphetamine and alcohol use. Under both acute and repeated protocols, individuals indicate higher self-reported 'good drug effect' relative to either substance alone, providing some evidence for potential incentives for their combined use; however, broader functional neurocognitive and relevant subjective effects (separate to craving) remain poorly defined. While acute methamphetamine administration reduces feelings of alcohol intoxication and alcohol-induced performance deficits in a divided attention task, these studies are somewhat limited by the target populations (high frequency stimulant user cohorts) and use of fixed dosing paradigm, which may mask the magnitude of effects, particularly among other user groups.

This study aimed to examine the effects of oral methamphetamine alone and in combination with low doses of alcohol on subjective intoxication and neurocognitive performance in healthy volunteers with limited prior exposure to methamphetamine to better characterise potential interactions.

### Patterns and characteristics of methamphetamine use among adults-United States, 2015–2018 [^1144eG1V]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Methamphetamine is a highly addictive central nervous system stimulant. Methamphetamine use is associated with a range of health harms, including psychosis and other mental disorders, cardiovascular and renal dysfunction, infectious disease transmission, and overdose (1,2). Although overall population rates of methamphetamine use have remained relatively stable in recent years (3), methamphetamine availability and methamphetamine-related harms (e.g., methamphetamine involvement in overdose deaths and number of treatment admissions) have increased in the United States* (4,5); however, analyses examining methamphetamine use patterns and characteristics associated with its use are limited. This report uses data from the 2015–2018 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health (NSDUHs) to estimate methamphetamine use rates in the United States and to identify characteristics associated with past-year methamphetamine use. Rates (per 1,000 adults aged ≥ 18 years) for past-year methamphetamine use were estimated overall, by demographic group, and by state. Frequency of past-year use and prevalence of other substance use and mental illness among adults reporting past-year use were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression examined characteristics associated with past-year use. During 2015–2018, the estimated rate of past-year methamphetamine use among adults was 6.6 per 1,000. Among adults reporting past-year methamphetamine use, an estimated 27.3% reported using on ≥ 200 days, 52.9% had a methamphetamine use disorder, and 22.3% injected methamphetamine. Controlling for other factors, higher adjusted odds ratios for past-year use were found among men; persons aged 26–34, 35–49, and ≥ 50 years; and those with lower educational attainment, annual household income < $50,000, Medicaid only or no insurance, those living in small metro and nonmetro counties, † and those with co-occurring substance use and co-occurring mental illness. Additional efforts to build state and local prevention and response capacity, expand linkages to care, and enhance public health and public safety collaborations are needed to combat increasing methamphetamine harms.

### How does a family history of psychosis influence the risk of methamphetamine-related psychotic symptoms: evidence from longitudinal panel data [^117XrTHk]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The evidence from our data is consistent with both methamphetamine use and family morbidity for psychosis being independent risk factors for psychotic symptoms among people dependent on methamphetamine (scenario 2). The joint risk associated with both factors resulted in a particularly high risk of psychotic symptoms among people who had a family history of psychosis during weeks when they were using methamphetamine (43% past week prevalence of psychotic symptoms). We did not find any evidence that having a family history of psychosis increased the RR of psychotic symptoms during weeks when methamphetamine was used (scenario 3). However, we found some limited evidence that a family history of psychosis may disproportionately contribute to cases of methamphetamine‐related psychotic symptoms (e.g. between 3% and 20% additional risk, accounting for up to 5% more weeks involving psychotic symptoms). Importantly, our data did not support scenario 1, in that the risk of psychotic symptoms during weeks of methamphetamine use was not confined to participants with a family history of psychosis.

These findings have important public health implications in showing that the risk of methamphetamine‐related psychotic symptoms is not confined to a minority of individuals with a family history of psychosis. This broadens the target group for interventions from people who are perceived to be at risk of psychosis to the broader group of methamphetamine consumers who may not ordinarily be engaged with mental health services or see themselves at risk of experiencing psychosis. It highlights the importance of assessing and responding to psychosis risk in people with methamphetamine use disorders within the alcohol and other drug sector, even if they do not have a personal or family history of schizophrenia.

Our findings run counter to the notion that methamphetamine use is solely exacerbating an underlying genetic vulnerability to psychosis. Not only was the risk of methamphetamine‐related psychotic symptoms not specific to people who had a family history of psychosis, but the risk of methamphetamine‐related psychotic symptoms was similar (if not larger) among people who had no family history of psychosis. Instead, our findings are more consistent with a drug‐induced psychosis brought about by heavy consumption of methamphetamine.

### A review of the clinical pharmacology of methamphetamine [^113XafQd]. Addiction (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

To examine the literature regarding clinical pharmacokinetics, direct effects and adverse clinical outcomes associated with methamphetamine use.

Methods

Relevant literature was identified through a PubMed search. Additional literature was obtained from relevant books and monographs.

Findings and Conclusions

The mean elimination half-life for methamphetamine is approximately 10 hours, with considerable inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics. Direct effects at low-to-moderate methamphetamine doses (5–30 mg) include arousal, positive mood, cardiac stimulation and acute improvement in cognitive domains such as attention and psychomotor coordination. At higher doses used typically by illicit users (≥ 50 mg), methamphetamine can produce psychosis. Its hypertensive effect can produce a number of acute and chronic cardiovascular complications. Repeated use may induce neurotoxicity, associated with prolonged psychiatric symptoms, cognitive impairment and an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease. Abrupt cessation of repeated methamphetamine use leads to a withdrawal syndrome consisting of depressed mood, anxiety and sleep disturbance. Acute withdrawal lasts typically for 7–10 days, and residual symptoms associated with neurotoxicity may persist for several months.

### Topiramate for the treatment of methamphetamine addiction: a multi-center placebo-controlled trial [^114rpZou]. Addiction (2012). Low credibility.

Aims

Topiramate has shown efficacy at facilitating abstinence from alcohol and cocaine abuse. This double-blind, placebo-controlled out-patient trial tested topiramate for treating methamphetamine addiction.

Design

Participants (n = 140) were randomized to receive topiramate or placebo (13 weeks) in escalating doses from 25 mg/day [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED] to the target maintenance of 200mg/day in weeks 6–12 (tapered in week 13). Medication was combined with weekly brief behavioral compliance enhancement treatment.

Setting

The trial was conducted at eight medical centers in the United States.

Participants

One hundred and forty methamphetamine-dependent adults took part in the trial.

Measurements

The primary outcome was abstinence from methamphetamine during weeks 6–12. Secondary outcomes included use reduction versus baseline, as well as psychosocial variables.

Findings

In the intent-to-treat analysis, topiramate did not increase abstinence from methamphetamine during weeks 6–12. For secondary outcomes, topiramate reduced weekly median urine methamphetamine levels and observer-rated severity of dependence scores significantly. Subjects with negative urine before randomization (n = 26) had significantly greater abstinence on topiramate versus placebo during study weeks 6–12. Topiramate was safe and well tolerated.

Conclusions

Topiramate does not appear to promote abstinence in methamphetamine users but can reduce the amount taken and reduce relapse rates in those who are already abstinent.

5.3 Seizure

Wellbutrin XL can cause seizure. The risk of seizure is dose-related. The dose should not exceed 300 mg once daily. Increase the dose gradually. Discontinue Wellbutrin XL and do not restart treatment if the patient experiences a seizure.

The risk of seizures is also related to patient factors, clinical situations, and concomitant medications that lower the seizure threshold. Consider these risks before initiating treatment with Wellbutrin XL. Wellbutrin XL is contraindicated in patients with a seizure disorder or conditions that increase the risk of seizure (e.g., severe head injury, arteriovenous malformation, CNS tumor or CNS infection, severe stroke, anorexia nervosa or bulimia, or abrupt discontinuation of alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and antiepileptic drugs [see Contraindications (4)]. The following conditions can also increase the risk of seizure: concomitant use of other medications that lower the seizure threshold (e.g., other bupropion products, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, theophylline, and systemic corticosteroids), metabolic disorders (e.g., hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, severe hepatic impairment, and hypoxia), or use of illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine) or abuse or misuse of prescription drugs such as CNS stimulants. Additional predisposing conditions include diabetes mellitus treated with oral hypoglycemic drugs or insulin, use of anorectic drugs, excessive use of alcohol, benzodiazepines, sedative/hypnotics, or opiates.

Incidence of Seizure with Bupropion Use

The incidence of seizure with Wellbutrin XL has not been formally evaluated in clinical trials. In studies using bupropion HCl sustained-release up to 300 mg per day the incidence of seizure was approximately 0.1% (1/1000 patients). In a large prospective, follow-up study, the seizure incidence was approximately 0.4% (13/3200) with bupropion HCl immediate-release in the range of 300 mg to 450 mg per day.

Additional data accumulated for bupropion immediate-release suggests that the estimated seizure incidence increases almost tenfold between 450 and 600 mg/day. The risk of seizure can be reduced if the Wellbutrin XL dose does not exceed 450 mg once daily and the titration rate is gradual.

### Randomized, placebo-controlled trial of bupropion in methamphetamine-dependent participants with less than daily methamphetamine use [^11781qQ2]. Addiction (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

Two previous randomized trials found an effect for bupropion in reducing methamphetamine use in the subgroup with lower frequency of methamphetamine use at baseline. This study aimed to replicate these results by comparing bupropion versus placebo in methamphetamine-dependent participants with less than daily methamphetamine use at baseline.

Methods

Methamphetamine-dependent volunteers reporting methamphetamine use on ≤ 29 of past 30 days were randomized to bupropion 150mg twice daily (n = 41) or placebo (n = 43) and out-patient counseling for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion achieving end-of-treatment (EOT) methamphetamine abstinence (weeks 11 and 12) for bupropion versus placebo. A post-hoc analysis compared EOT abstinence by medication adherence assessed via plasma bupropion/hydroxybupropion level.

Results

There was no significant difference in EOT abstinence between bupropion (29%, 12 of 41) and placebo (14%, six of 43; P = 0.087). Among participants receiving bupropion, EOT abstinence was significantly higher in participants assessed as medication adherent by plasma bupropion/hydroxybupropion levels (54%, seven of 13) compared to non-adherent participants (18%, five of 28; P = 0.018). Medication adherence by plasma levels was low (32%).

Conclusions

Bupropion may be efficacious for reducing methamphetamine in people with less than daily baseline methamphetamine use, but the evidence remains inconclusive.

5.2 Neuropsychiatric Adverse Events and Suicide Risk in Smoking Cessation Treatment

Wellbutrin XL is not approved for smoking cessation treatment; however, bupropion HCl sustained-release is approved for this use. Serious neuropsychiatric adverse events have been reported in patients taking bupropion for smoking cessation. These postmarketing reports have included changes in mood (including depression and mania), psychosis, hallucinations, paranoia, delusions, homicidal ideation, aggression, hostility, agitation, anxiety, and panic, as well as suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, and completed suicide [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Some patients who stopped smoking may have been experiencing symptoms of nicotine withdrawal, including depressed mood. Depression, rarely including suicidal ideation, has been reported in smokers undergoing a smoking cessation attempt without medication. However, some of these adverse events occurred in patients taking bupropion who continued to smoke.

Neuropsychiatric adverse events occurred in patients without and with pre-existing psychiatric disease; some patients experienced worsening of their psychiatric illnesses. Observe patients for the occurrence of neuropsychiatric adverse events. Advise patients and caregivers that the patient should stop taking Wellbutrin XL and contact a healthcare provider immediately if agitation, depressed mood, or changes in behavior or thinking that are not typical for the patient are observed, or if the patient develops suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior. The healthcare provider should evaluate the severity of the adverse events and the extent to which the patient is benefiting from treatment, and consider options including continued treatment under closer monitoring, or discontinuing treatment. In many postmarketing cases, resolution of symptoms after discontinuation of bupropion was reported. However, the symptoms persisted in some cases; therefore, ongoing monitoring and supportive care should be provided until symptoms resolve.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^116iKntT]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Stimulant use disorder safety and implementation — While bupropion and naltrexone are generally well tolerated, both studies reported a moderate number of adverse events, and the combination of these medications would most likely be prescribed by an addiction specialist, potentially limiting access and increasing health inequities. The trials above evaluated injectable — but not oral — naltrexone in combination with bupropion for treatment of StUD, and at the time of this publication, bupropion and oral naltrexone are available in generic formulations. The CGC noted that there is no reason to believe that oral naltrexone would be less effective in this population if the patient is adherent to treatment, although injectable medications can facilitate adherence, and given the potential challenges with access to injectable naltrexone, consideration of combination bupropion and oral naltrexone would be reasonable, particularly for patients who are highly motivated. Despite these potential barriers, the CGC concluded that in certain patients, this treatment option may be useful in reducing ATS use and other co-occurring symptoms. Confirmation of the patient's opioid free status is required prior to initiating naltrexone. Bupropion is contraindicated in individuals with history of seizure or anorexia or bulimia nervosa and should be used with caution in individuals with elevated seizure risk.

### Use of stimulants to treat cocaine and methamphetamine abuse [^112E44YZ]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

The concept of using stimulants to treat cocaine and methamphetamine dependence is largely based on the "replacement" therapy model that has shown efficacy for treating nicotine and opiate dependence. Although results have been mixed, some evidence supports using stimulant medication to reduce cocaine use. There are not enough data to date to determine the efficacy of stimulants for methamphetamine dependence. Drawbacks of stimulants as treatments include the potential for abuse of the treatment, which necessitates careful screening and monitoring of patients. Possible reasons for efficacy of stimulants include enhancement of monoamine function dysregulated by chronic cocaine or methamphetamine use. Newer medications that enhance dopamine function but lack the abuse potential of older stimulants are being studied. It is hoped that these medications will provide safe, effective treatment for cocaine and methamphetamine dependence, but more research on this topic is needed.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^112WciJZ]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Amphetamine-Type Stimulant Use Disorder — bupropion evidence and safety: Data from systematic reviews and meta-analyses suggest that bupropion alone is not as effective for individuals with ATS use disorder; however, the evidence is suggestive of an effect for patients with less than daily ATS use, and a subgroup analysis showed that bupropion was associated with higher abstinence rates in patients who used ATS less than 18 days per month and who were adherent to the medication. No difference in adverse events between bupropion and placebo was noted in any of the studies. The CGC concluded that the potential benefits of bupropion outweigh the potential risks and supported consideration specifically for patients with low- to moderate-frequency (ie, less than 18 days per month) stimulant use. The CGC agreed that bupropion could be given additional consideration for patients with co-occurring tobacco use disorder (TUD) and for co-occurring depressive disorders. Bupropion dosing is relatively easy to titrate and the generic formulation is commonly available on medication formularies; it is contraindicated in individuals with history of seizure or anorexia or bulimia nervosa and should be used with caution in individuals with elevated seizure risk.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^114WeZiR]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Seizure workup in suspected stimulant-induced seizures — epidemiology and evaluation: Seizures are one of the most severe complications of stimulant toxicity, with over 6% of new onset seizures substance-related and, in adults, 9% of status epilepticus substance-induced. Seizures can occur in association with methamphetamine use, with epileptic seizures being a frequent complication of methamphetamine intoxication. Established guidelines are available for neurological evaluation of the first episode of unprovoked seizure in both adolescents and adults, but given stimulants' proconvulsive activity there is debate over whether all components — including neurology consultation and electroencephalogram (EEG) follow-up testing — are necessary when the seizure is likely to be stimulant-induced. Waiving a full workup saves time and resources, including avoiding an overnight hospital stay and follow-up appointments, though missed identification of nontoxicologic causes of seizure is possible. No studies were identified that evaluated strategies for assessment and diagnosis of stimulant-related seizures; consensus in clinical guidelines is that determination for comprehensive evaluation following a seizure can be made according to best practices based on symptomatology and presence of risk factors, and common indications for waiving a comprehensive neurological evaluation following a seizure include known preexisting seizure disorder, history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), strong family history of epilepsy, hyponatremia detected by laboratory testing, and the seizure is well-explained by substance use or withdrawal.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^116QRaaG]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

ASAM/AAAP stimulant use disorder — seizure evaluation and workup in the emergency department (ED) specifies that when a patient presents to the ED with seizures following stimulant use, full neurological workup is not necessary if the seizures are well explained by substance use or withdrawal (Clinical consensus, Conditional Recommendation). When the etiology of the seizures is not well explained by stimulant use, the workup and management of seizures should proceed according to usual best practices (Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation). The guideline clarifies that a seizure is well-explained by substance use or withdrawal when the patient is known to use medications that lower seizure threshold (eg, tramadol, bupropion) or has a history of stimulant- or other substance use-related seizure. Even if full neurological workup is waived, clinicians might still order diagnostic testing such as a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head to rule out other etiologies based on clinical exam findings, and additional evaluation is indicated if seizures recur despite adequate management of stimulant intoxication.

### How does a family history of psychosis influence the risk of methamphetamine-related psychotic symptoms: evidence from longitudinal panel data [^111dNcth]. Addiction (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Both methamphetamine use and having a family history of psychosis jointly contributed to the risk of psychotic symptoms in this sample of people dependent on methamphetamine. Having a family history of psychosis was not necessary for people to experience psychotic symptoms during weeks when they used methamphetamine. This broadens the pool of individuals at‐risk of methamphetamine‐related psychotic symptoms to include people who may not have any known family history of psychosis. The particularly high risk of psychotic symptoms seen among people with a family history of psychosis during weeks of methamphetamine use indicates a need for intensive support and continuing care to reduce their risk of psychosis.

### The cyclical and evolving nature of methamphetamine use: an evaluation of near real-time urine drug test results [^115Hbw2b]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Binge use of methamphetamine is common to sustain the drug's effects and increases risk of acute psychosis and the need for intervention by law enforcement or medical personnel. Tolerance can build following prolonged exposure, which may lead to withdrawal when drug exposure is reduced. Withdrawal-related effects may include insomnia, anxiety, depression, and intense cravings. Other long-term consequences include anhedonia, mood disturbances, and psychotic features, such as paranoia and hallucinations, that may remain for months or years.

Another challenge associated with methamphetamine is that, unlike opioid use disorder, there are no FDA-approved medications indicated for the treatment of methamphetamine use disorder. Thus, treatment is limited to off-label use of medications, such as bupropion, methylphenidate, modafinil, or mirtazapine, or nonpharmacologic therapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or contingency management. Although both forms of therapy are widely accepted, relapse rates remain high with over 50% of participants expected to relapse within 6 to 9 months following treatment. Given that the highest predicted positivity for methamphetamine in this study was in specimens from SUD treatment centers, it is particularly important to monitor for use of this substance and improve the treatment of methamphetamine use disorder. Strategies to prolong time to relapse include longer time in treatment and posttreatment involvement in self-health or other relapse-prevention programs. Researchers funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse are investigating several options for treating methamphetamine use disorder, including medications targeting various systems, such as dopamine, as well as transcranial magnetic stimulation, neurofeedback, vaccines, and antibodies that would use the immune system to block methamphetamine from reaching the brain. In light of rising methamphetamine availability and use with other substances, this research will be key to addressing the public health consequences.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^112EXJKg]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Management of stimulant use — pharmacologic approaches have generally been disappointing, and no FDA-approved pharmacotherapy for cocaine use disorder currently exists; among people with HIV who use crack and opioids, medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) may improve ART adherence and viral suppression. Limited evidence indicates that some pharmacologic interventions (e.g., methylphenidate, modafinil, bupropion, naltrexone) can reduce methamphetamine use or cravings. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of extended-release injectable naltrexone plus oral extended-release bupropion in adults with moderate or severe methamphetamine use disorder demonstrated a higher response of methamphetamine-free urine samples compared to placebo; however, the overall response rate was low. A double-blind randomized clinical trial on people with methamphetamine use disorder evaluated daily mirtazapine versus placebo in individuals who have sex with men, and over 36 weeks of follow-up daily mirtazapine use led to reduced methamphetamine-positive urine drug tests and concurrent reductions in sexual risk behaviors. No specific recommended pharmacotherapy exists to treat stimulant use disorder in people with HIV.

### Acute neurocognitive and subjective effects of oral methamphetamine with low doses of alcohol: a randomised controlled trial [^113rM1B4]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Previous research has found that methamphetamine produced isolated improvement in psychomotor response speed during a working memory task and improved time-on-task performance proportionate to expected pharmacodynamic properties. Low-moderate doses of amphetamine-type stimulants improve select sustained attention and vigilance and reduce psychomotor speed/response time; however, some studies cite a lack of effect or else note that these beneficial effects appear to dissipate when higher doses are consumed, particularly in tasks of complex higher-order functioning (inverted-U;). Long-term or heavy patterns of use are also associated with enduring cognitive change, which may reflect alterations in brain morphology even in the absence of acute intoxication. Considering the overrepresentation of methamphetamine-related harm, it is possible that more severe negative functional performance effects more closely reflect recreational patterns of consumption that are difficult to replicate experimentally. Recreationally, crystalline methamphetamine is typically consumed in binge-like patterns over a period of several hours or even days and is more commonly consumed via inhalation (smoking) or intravenously (injection). In its powdered form, it is more likely to be consumed intranasally (snorting). Additional work is therefore warranted to discern the effects of longer-term methamphetamine consumption to discern potential interactions of use patterns and safety-relevant indices.

For persons with a history of addiction for whom the risks outweigh benefits, chronic pain should be reasonably managed by other therapies and they should receive additional support, close monitoring and reassessment, and when applicable referral to addiction treatment and mental health services (strong, low).

### Methamphetamine hydrochloride [^113XP4Vx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Abuse, Misuse, and Addiction

Methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets have a high potential for abuse and misuse. The use of methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets exposes individuals to the risks of abuse and misuse, which can lead to the development of a substance use disorder, including addiction. Methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets can be diverted for non-medical use into illicit channels or distribution [see Drug Abuse and Dependence (9.2, 9.3)]. Misuse and abuse of CNS stimulants, including methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets, can result in overdose and death [see Overdosage (10)], and this risk is increased with higher doses or unapproved methods of administration, such as snorting or injection.

Before prescribing methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction. Educate patients and their families about these risks and proper disposal of any unused drug. Advise patients to store methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets in a safe place, preferably locked, and instruct patients to not give methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets to anyone else. Throughout methamphetamine treatment, reassess each patient's risk of abuse, misuse, and addiction and frequently monitor for signs and symptoms of abuse, misuse, and addiction.

5.2 Risks to Patients with Serious Cardiac Disease

Sudden death has been reported in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities or other serious cardiac disease who were treated with CNS stimulants at the recommended ADHD dosages.

Avoid methamphetamine use in patients with known structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, or other serious heart problems.

5.3 Increased Blood Pressure and Heart Rate

CNS stimulants cause an increase in blood pressure (mean increase about 2 to 4 mm Hg) and heart rate (mean increase about 3 to 6 bpm). Some patients may have larger increases.

Monitor all methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets-treated patients for potential tachycardia and hypertension [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

Assessment recommendations for stimulant misuse — For patients who screen positive for stimulant misuse, clinicians should conduct a focused history and clinical exam to evaluate complications of use related to route of administration and type of preparation used and provide treatment or referrals as appropriate (Very low certainty, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should assess the following to determine harm reduction service and counseling needs: risky patterns of stimulant use, including frequency and amount of use, including binge use (High certainty, Strong Recommendation); use of stimulants with no one else present (High certainty, Strong Recommendation); concurrent use of prescribed and nonprescribed medications and other substances, particularly opioids, alcohol, and other central nervous system depressants (High certainty, Strong Recommendation); history of overdose (High certainty, Strong Recommendation); history of stimulant-related ED visits and hospitalizations (High certainty, Strong Recommendation); routes of administration, particularly injection drug use (Very low certainty, Strong Recommendation); and risky sexual behaviors (High certainty, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should consider asking patients about: the context of their stimulant use (eg, chemsex, weight loss, academic or work performance, staying awake; Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation), trauma (Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation), and intimate partner violence (IPV; Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation). Clinicians should conduct baseline laboratory testing based on clinical assessment of risk factors (see Assessment; Clinical consensus, Strong Recommendation).

### Clinical progress note: management of the hospitalized patient who uses methamphetamine [^117GWrPY]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

ACUTE METHAMPHETAMINE INTOXICATION

Methamphetamine causes an acute sympathomimetic toxidrome that can lead to several life‐threatening complications (Table 2). The half‐life of methamphetamine is 90 min but its principal metabolite,‐amphetamine, has a half‐life of 9–12 h. When evaluating a patient with suspected methamphetamine intoxication, hospitalists should consider a differential diagnosis that includes other sympathomimetic toxidromes (e.g. cocaine, phencyclidine), primary psychotic disorders, endocrinopathies (e.g. hyperthyroidism), and sepsis. The latter can be challenging to diagnose in the context of acute methamphetamine intoxication since methamphetamine use can both mimic sepsis and predispose patients to infection.

Table 2
Complications of acute methamphetamine intoxication.

Hospitalists should be aware that urine immunoassays for amphetamines are particularly prone to false positive results (up to 10%) and may be insensitive for novel psychostimulants. Many common medications cross‐react with screening assays, including bupropion, sildenafil, atenolol, tramadol, duloxetine, aripiprazole, venlafaxine, atomoxetine, and prescribed stimulants (e.g. lisdexamfetamine, dextroamphetamine). Positive results in a patient not reporting methamphetamine use should be sent for confirmatory mass spectrometry.

Management of acute methamphetamine intoxication is primarily supportive and involves providing a low‐stimulus environment, identifying and correcting volume depletion and metabolic derangements, and providing reorientation and reassurance. For acute agitation unresponsive to nonpharmacologic measures, benzodiazepines are considered first‐line therapy. If benzodiazepines are ineffective or contraindicated, or when psychosis symptoms predominate, antipsychotics may be used with caution to avoid over‐sedation if coadministered with benzodiazepines. For refractory agitation, intravenous or intramuscular ketamine may be administered by an experienced clinician.

If significant hypertension and tachycardia persist despite treatment of agitation and hyperactivity with benzodiazepines, it is reasonable to add an alpha‐agonist such as clonidine or a beta‐blocker such as labetalol to reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications. If there is a concern for a true hypertensive emergency with end‐organ damage, short‐acting antihypertensives should be used in accordance with standard practice.

### Bupropion hydrochloride (Wellbutrin xl) [^111uhKmw]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Major Depressive Disorder: WELLBUTRIN XL is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder.

The efficacy of bupropion in the treatment of a major depressive episode was established in two 4-week controlled trials of inpatients and in one 6-week controlled trial of outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the Major Depression category of the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) (see CLINICAL TRIALS).

A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies the presence of 1) depressed mood or 2) loss of interest or pleasure; in addition, at least 5 of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning: depressed mood, markedly diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt, or suicidal ideation.

The efficacy of bupropion in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 44 weeks following 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial with the sustained-release formulation of bupropion (see CLINICAL TRIALS). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use WELLBUTRIN XL for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

Seasonal Affective Disorder: WELLBUTRIN XL is indicated for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes in patients with a diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder.

The efficacy of WELLBUTRIN XL for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes was established in 3 controlled trials of adult outpatients with a history of major depressive disorder with an autumn-winter seasonal pattern as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria (see CLINICAL TRIALS).

Seasonal affective disorder is characterized by recurrent major depressive episodes, most commonly occurring during the autumn and/or winter months. Episodes may last up to 6 months in duration, typically beginning in the autumn and remitting in the springtime. Although patients with seasonal affective disorder may have depressive episodes during other times of the year, the diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder requires that the number of seasonal episodes substantially outnumber the number of non-seasonal episodes during the individual's lifetime.

There were important risk factors for psychosis that were not assessed, including migration, urbanization, ethnicity, older paternal age and neonatal factors and childhood trauma. Although we did not find any evidence that duration of methamphetamine use or early onset use affected psychosis vulnerability, for practical reasons, we were unable to assess the impact of historical use patterns in detail (e.g. lifetime exposure to heavy binge use), which may have produced a lasting vulnerability to psychosis.

Our findings are based on a sample of people dependent on methamphetamine who were using the drug daily or almost daily and who had no prior diagnosis of a primary psychotic disorder. They cannot necessarily be generalised to infrequent or recreational use of methamphetamine or people who have a diagnosed psychotic disorder. Participants were voluntarily taking part in a randomized controlled treatment trial and their characteristics may not generalize to the broader population of people who are dependent on methamphetamine.

Our analyses cannot identify the direction of the relationship between methamphetamine use and psychotic symptoms, although the broader evidence base points toward methamphetamine use contributing to the risk of psychosis. Periods of abstinence from methamphetamine use were brief (past week) meaning that we were not able to distinguish between prolonged methamphetamine‐related psychotic symptoms and the psychotic experiences that were unrelated to the drug (e.g. an undiagnosed primary psychotic disorder). The threshold used to identify psychotic symptoms was also low (i.e. it included subclinical symptoms of psychosis). This may have led to a ceiling effect for participants at high risk of psychosis, and coupled with the limited sample size, may have been responsible for some of the non‐significant results seen for the risk of psychotic symptoms associated with a family history of psychosis.

Data on family history were based on self‐report, and although self‐report was obtained using a structured set of questions from the DIP, these reports were not verified by reports from family members or medical records. Our data were too sparse to examine the degree of familial morbidity for psychosis, or the specific contribution of bipolar disorder versus schizophrenia. We also included psychosis among first, second‐ or third‐degree relatives, resulting in a higher prevalence of familial morbidity compared to other studies that include only first‐degree relatives. This may have diluted associations between having a family history of psychosis and psychosis risk.

### Clinical progress note: management of the hospitalized patient who uses methamphetamine [^116iiHgn]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Methamphetamine is a potent amphetamine‐type stimulant (ATS) that increases dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic activity within the brain resulting in euphoria, arousal, and disinhibition, among other effects. During World War II, ATS were used by soldiers to increase wakefulness and suppress appetite. Over the following decades, ATS were widely prescribed for fatigue, emotional distress, and obesity. In 1970, the Controlled Substances Act, which laid the initial framework for the categorization and regulation of controlled substances, began curtailing medical prescribing of ATS, opening a market for illicitly manufactured methamphetamine. For the remainder of the twentieth century, the production and distribution of illicit methamphetamine (also known as "meth", "crank", "speed", "crystal", or "ice") centered on the Western United States. In the twenty‐first century, methamphetamine use has increased dramatically and spread throughout North America. Methamphetamine‐related overdose deaths have risen sharply during this time, disproportionately affecting American Indian and Alaska Native populations and Black men.

The most common route of methamphetamine use is smoking, followed by injection and snorting. However, methamphetamine use via injection is increasing and is associated with higher rates of overdose and infectious complications. Individuals with co‐use of methamphetamine and opioids face increased acute care utilization, infectious complications, and risk of overdose, with lower engagement in treatment compared to those who only use opioids.

Methamphetamine use and methamphetamine use disorder (MaUD) may lead to acute and chronic neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, infectious, and traumatic complications. Acute care utilization related to methamphetamine increased four‐ to sixfold during the past decade, resulting in at least $2 billion in costs. Among hospitalized patients, methamphetamine use is associated with longer lengths of stay, increased in‐hospital mortality, and decreased linkage to postdischarge care. Hospitalists will increasingly need to diagnose and manage sequelae of methamphetamine use.

We obtained relevant society guidelines and searched the PubMed database using three Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) term queries: "methamphetamine/toxicity, " "methamphetamine AND hospitalization, " and "methamphetamine AND substance withdrawal syndrome", which yielded a total of 299 English language articles published between 2019 and 2024. We reviewed the search results and guidelines for applicable recommendations on managing sequelae of methamphetamine use in hospitalized patients including acute intoxication, withdrawal, MaUD, and chronic complications (Table 1).

Information for Patients: Prescribers or other health professionals should inform patients, their families, and their caregivers about the benefits and risks associated with treatment with WELLBUTRIN XL and should counsel them in its appropriate use. A patient Medication Guide about "Antidepressant Medicines, Depression and Other Serious Mental Illnesses, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions", "Quitting Smoking, Quit-Smoking Medications, Changes in Thinking and Behavior, Depression, and Suicidal Thoughts or Actions", and "What Other Important Information Should I Know About WELLBUTRIN XL?" is available for WELLBUTRIN XL. The prescriber or health professional should instruct patients, their families, and their caregivers to read the Medication Guide and should assist them in understanding its contents. Patients should be given the opportunity to discuss the contents of the Medication Guide and to obtain answers to any questions they may have. The complete text of the Medication Guide is reprinted at the end of this document.

Patients should be advised of the following issues and asked to alert their prescriber if these occur while taking WELLBUTRIN XL.

Clinical Worsening and Suicide Risk in Treating Psychiatric Disorders: Patients, their families, and their caregivers should be encouraged to be alert to the emergence of anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, mania, other unusual changes in behavior, worsening of depression, and suicidal ideation, especially early during antidepressant treatment and when the dose is adjusted up or down. Families and caregivers of patients should be advised to look for the emergence of such symptoms on a day-to-day basis, since changes may be abrupt. Such symptoms should be reported to the patient's prescriber or health professional, especially if they are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms. Symptoms such as these may be associated with an increased risk for suicidal thinking and behavior and indicate a need for very close monitoring and possibly changes in the medication.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^114n1d63]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Bupropion and naltrexone — evidence scope and candidate populations: In amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) use disorder, evidence for bupropion alone is described as somewhat weak, whereas two recent studies of combination bupropion and naltrexone showed more promise; both studies — one open label and one randomized controlled trial (RCT) — included patients with moderate to severe methamphetamine use disorder. The committee considered it appropriate to extend evidence to other ATS use disorder populations. For co-occurring conditions, the combination could be given additional consideration for ATS use disorder with alcohol use disorder (AUD), nicotine/tobacco use, or depressive disorders. The recommendations do not address the use of bupropion with naltrexone for patients with opioid use disorder (OUD), but clinicians may consider this combination for patients with co-occurring OUD who are already prescribed naltrexone for OUD or are in OUD remission and not currently prescribed opioid agonist medication; no studies were available evaluating this combination for co-occurring methamphetamine use disorder and OUD. An important unanswered research question is whether treatment with naltrexone could be protective against opioid overdose in this population.

### Risk factors for hepatitis C virus reinfection after sustained virologic response in patients coinfected with HIV [^114h9hFn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Safe and simple short-course DAAs have spurred a rapid scale-up of HCV treatment to populations at greater risk of reinfection. Given the costly consequences of reinfection, it is essential to have reasonable estimates of the risk of reinfection and to understand which subgroups need risk reduction measures. In a large and diverse cohort representative of the Canadian coinfection population in care, we found that those engaging in high-frequency IDU (cocaine and methamphetamines) were at greatest risk of becoming reinfected at a rate roughly 6 times that of low-risk reference patients. This rate was higher than we had anticipated. We estimated intermediate, and comparable, risk for high-risk MSM and low-frequency IDU. Reinfections among MSM appear to have been sexually transmitted with one exception. Reinfection rates were low in low-risk MSM and in reference patients, the majority of whom were former PWID, emphasizing the safety of treating HCV in this subgroup.

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^111id4ZC]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

An estimated 36 million people world‐wide use amphetamine‐type substances, including methamphetamine. Methamphetamine use is associated with physical, psychological and social harms, as well as increased mortality. Current evidence provides support for psychosocial interventions, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), in improving treatment retention. The strongest efficacy evidence is from the United States, supporting contingency management with abstinence‐based reinforcement. Effectiveness of psychosocial interventions is weak among those using very frequently (at least half of the days in a month). In contrast to other substance use disorders, there are no pharmacotherapies for this condition.

Lisdexamfetamine presents a promising candidate agonist‐like pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine dependence. As a prodrug of dexamphetamine, it has a lower non‐medical use potential than dexamphetamine as it requires hydrolysis into active dexamphetamine, has no differential subjective effect if injected and has a slower onset and longer duration of action, avoiding the potential positive reinforcement associated with immediate release stimulant medications. Higher doses may be required for methamphetamine dependence than for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Binge Eating Disorder, where up to 70 mg is indicated. One hundred mg lisdexamfetamine is equivalent to 40 mg dexamphetamine base; doses of 60–110 mg dexamphetamine have been trialled for amphetamine dependence. Our group's pilot work informing this study demonstrated that doses starting at 100 mg and increasing to 250 mg of lisdexamfetamine are safe in this population. Our more recent work on withdrawal in this population used a starting dose of 250 mg lisdexamfetamine with no safety concerns.

We sought to test the efficacy and safety of lisdexamfetamine in reducing methamphetamine use for people dependent on methamphetamine using at least 14 days in the previous 28. We hypothesised that participants who received a 12‐week course of 250 mg of lisdexamfetamine would report fewer days of methamphetamine use in the last 28 days of treatment compared to participants who received a placebo control.

Needs to Improve the Quality of Care

Providers reflected on what practices were needed to manage methamphetamine use better (n = 23). Increased support for implementing and funding contingency management, integrated behavioral health services with clinicians skilled in dealing with methamphetamine use disorders, and safe housing were needed to improve services overall (Table 4). In addition, referrals to specialty care are necessary: "The doctor can't do it alone, we need help, and we need people to refer [to]". For increased identification of patients, providers recommended "more consistent and specific screening". Participants also desired effective FDA-approved medications and community of practice platforms to share updates on treatments and resources.

### Methamphetamine psychosis: insights from the past [^115B1Jai]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

To review early case reports and experimental inductions of amphetamine and methamphetamine psychosis, prior to the prohibition of these drugs, to gain a better understanding of the nature and aetiology of methamphetamine psychosis.

Methods

Papers considered were historical case reports and case series of psychosis relating to the use and misuse of prescription amphetamine, focusing upon papers by Young & Scoville (1938), Connell (1958), and three subsequent experimental studies published in the early 1970s (Griffith 1972, Angrist & Gershon 1970 and Bell 1973), where psychosis was induced in volunteers using high-dose amphetamine and methamphetamine.

Results

High-dose methamphetamine and amphetamine can result in a paranoid psychosis which remits rapidly (within days) of discontinuing use. The central feature is paranoia occurring in a clear state of consciousness. This may be accompanied by other psychotic symptoms (e.g. hallucinations). Pre-existing schizophrenia is not necessary, and the syndrome is not due to sleep deprivation.

Conclusions

Research findings from the 1930s to the 1970s suggest that paranoid psychosis should be considered a probable consequence of high-dose methamphetamine use. Individuals who experience psychotic symptoms for any substantive period after intoxication has ended should be suspected of having a functional non-organic psychosis, or a latent vulnerability thereto.

Cocaine use disorder — bupropion may be considered as a pharmacotherapeutic option: For patients with cocaine use disorder, clinicians can consider prescribing bupropion to promote cocaine abstinence (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Bupropion is a dual dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that is FDA-approved for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), seasonal affective disorder, and smoking cessation, and a small amount of evidence exists for bupropion facilitating abstinence from cocaine use; while it was not found to be superior to placebo on cocaine abstinence at the end of treatment or on treatment retention, it was superior to placebo on sustained (ie, 3 or more weeks) abstinence in two RCTs. Additional considerations include co-occurring tobacco use disorder (TUD) and depressive disorders: clinicians can give bupropion additional consideration for patients with co-occurring TUD, as this medication can also reduce nicotine/tobacco use (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation), and clinicians can give bupropion additional consideration for patients with co-occurring depressive disorders, as this medication can also treat depression (Low certainty, Conditional Recommendation). Safety notes state that bupropion is contraindicated in individuals with history of seizure or anorexia or bulimia nervosa and should be used with caution in individuals with elevated seizure risk.

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^111dLJ94]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

This study tested the efficacy and safety of a 12‐week course of lisdexamfetamine in reducing methamphetamine use, an outcome which is associated with improvements in health and wellbeing, in people dependent on methamphetamine.

Design, setting and participants

This study was a randomised double‐blind placebo‐controlled trial conducted in six specialist outpatient clinics in Adelaide, Melbourne, Newcastle and Sydney, Australia (2018–2021). Participants were164 adults with methamphetamine dependence, reporting at least 14 use days out of the previous 28 days (62% male, 38% female, < 1% other; mean age 39 years).

Interventions

Participants were randomly allocated 1:1 to a 15‐week regimen of lisdexamfetamine (1‐week induction to 250 mg, 12‐week maintenance regimen, 2‐week reduction; n = 80) or matched placebo (n = 84), followed‐up to Week 19.

Measurements

The primary efficacy measure was past 28‐day methamphetamine use at Week 13. Safety was assessed by adverse event rates. Secondary measures included methamphetamine use during the 12‐week treatment period and treatment satisfaction.

Findings

Nine randomized participants did not start treatment (five were allocated to lisdexamfetamine and four allocated to placebo) and were excluded from the analyses. Fifty‐seven per cent of participants were retained on study medication to primary end‐point. There was only weak evidence of a lisdexamfetamine benefit at 13 weeks [adjusted difference in days of methamphetamine use = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) = –0.5 to 5.0; P = 0.49]. However, throughout the whole 12‐week treatment maintenance phase, the lisdexamfetamine group had fewer days of methamphetamine use in total (difference = 8.8, 95% CI = 2.7–15.0; P = 0.005). The lisdexamfetamine group reported greater self‐reported treatment effectiveness [odds ratio (OR) = 2.89, 95% CI = 1.67–5.02; P < 0.001] and treatment satisfaction (OR = 3.80, 95% CI = 1.93–7.47; P < 0.001). Adverse events with lisdexamfetamine included nausea. Serious adverse events occurred in four (5%) of participants who received lisdexamfetamine.

Conclusions

Lisdexamfetamine appears to reduce methamphetamine use over a 12‐week treatment period, although there is only weak evidence that reduced use is maintained during the last 4 weeks.

### Guidelines for managing substance withdrawal in jails [^116Y9c7j]. NIC/BJA (2023). High credibility.

Recommendations — withdrawal risk screening at jail intake — state that to safely and effectively identify and treat substance withdrawal, health care and custody staff should be alert to the possibility of substance use disorder (SUD), acute intoxication, physiological dependence, and the risk of withdrawal in all new arrivals. Individuals presenting with intoxication should be presumed to be at risk for withdrawal until determined otherwise by a qualified health care professional, and those who exhibit potential signs and symptoms of intoxication or withdrawal, or who appear unwell to a layperson, should be referred for immediate clinical assessment. All individuals should be screened for withdrawal risk immediately upon arrival in a jail, and the screening administrator should review recent substance use using a validated tool, ask individuals about current SUD diagnoses, ask individuals about their risk for substance withdrawal, and ask individuals reporting past-week alcohol or sedative use about their history of complicated withdrawal; an individual's report of recent, regular substance use, SUD, or withdrawal risk constitutes a positive screen, even if they are asymptomatic. Screening may be conducted by well-trained and supervised custody staff members when health care staff are not available; if the health screening is conducted by custody staff, it should begin with verbal notice that the health screening is beginning and explain the reasons for the questions that will be asked, and jails should establish policies and procedures regarding the confidentiality of information collected during the health screening in accordance with federal, state, and local laws.

METHODS

Study design

This was a randomised double‐blind placebo‐controlled Phase III fixed‐dose parallel design trial; the protocol has been previously published. In brief, participants were recruited from six Australian specialist stimulant treatment clinics (Adelaide, Melbourne, Newcastle, Sydney), randomized 1:1 to oral lisdexamfetamine (250 mg daily for 12 weeks, plus 1‐week induction and 2‐week taper) or identical matched placebo, and followed after 4 weeks (Week 19). Amendments due to COVID‐19 pandemic public health restrictions are described below. Ethics approval was granted by St Vincent's Hospital Sydney Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC, 2019/ETH03140). This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline. All participants provided written, informed consent.

Participants

Participants were recruited through local clinics and online advertisements. Following telephone pre‐screening, consenting participants underwent assessment by a study medical officer to determine if all eligibility criteria were met, and were then randomised. Adults assessed by an addiction medicine specialist to meet ICD‐10 criteria for methamphetamine dependence reporting use of methamphetamine on at least 14 of the previous 28 days, with one urinalysis positive for methamphetamine, were eligible. Exclusion criteria included known contraindications to lisdexamfetamine (apart from history of stimulant dependence), current opioid agonist therapy, concurrent severe psychiatric or other medical disorder, dependent use of alcohol or other non‐prescribed substances which, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with participation in the study, use of another prescribed stimulant (such as methylphenidate), unavailability for follow‐up or undergoing child protection, court or work‐mandated drug testing.

Interventions

Participants received daily lisdexamfetamine (1‐week induction 150 mg, 12‐week maintenance 250 mg, 2‐week taper of 150 mg for 1 week and 50 mg for 1 week) or placebo for 15 weeks, and followed‐up for 4 weeks after end of treatment (Week 19). Additionally, all participants were offered a structured four‐session manual‐guided methamphetamine use CBT programme by trained and supervised therapists as standard care.

- Intravenous drug abuse: use extreme caution with a personal or family history of substance abuse (including alcohol use disorder) or mental illness (e.g., major depression). Educate patients about the risks of intravenous drug abuse associated with Butorphanol and promote responsible use. Provide support for substance abuse treatment, discontinue Butorphanol, and refer the patient to addiction specialists for appropriate intervention and care.
- Respiratory depression: use extreme caution with asthma, or any pulmonary disease and coadministration with other CNS depressants. Exercise caution in patients with asthma or pulmonary diseases, and avoid concomitant use of CNS depressants when prescribing Butorphanol to mitigate the risk of respiratory depression. Discontinue Butorphanol, provide appropriate respiratory support and consult a healthcare professional for immediate intervention and monitoring.

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^115Ck9CU]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

There were five serious adverse events in the lisdexamfetamine group. Most adverse events were mild or moderate; nausea was more frequent in the lisdexamfetamine group. Post‐hoc analysis detected transient mild (< 4 mmHg) increases in diastolic blood pressure at two time‐points. Future investigation of lisdexamfetamine 250 mg daily requires continued cautious cardiovascular and neuropsychiatric monitoring, given the risks of adverse outcomes associated with methamphetamine use and the known adverse event profile of prescribed psychostimulants.

The proportion of urinalyses positive for methamphetamine is the most commonly reported outcome measure in RCTs of psychostimulants for amphetamine type stimulant use disorder. We selected a primary outcome of difference in days of use. Self‐report is a sufficiently valid measure, and the combination of urine toxicology and self‐report enhances the validity of self‐reported substance use. The study design precluded verification of self‐reported use days by weekly urinalysis results due to differences in the periodicity in the two data sources. Reduced frequency of use is a valid outcome measure associated with improved drug use, health and wellbeing. Nonetheless, there is no consensus on clinically meaningful reduction in use. There is, however, growing recognition of participant‐reported outcome measures as alternative end‐points. We found positive findings regarding self‐reported treatment effectiveness and drug effect. This aspect of the treatment might be important for treatment uptake and underscores an imperative for stronger efficacy data.

Lisdexamfetamine 250 mg daily, relative to placebo, is associated with reduction of use over a 12‐week treatment period but not the last 4 weeks of treatment among people with methamphetamine dependence using on at least 14 of the previous 28 days. Lisdexamfetamine was associated with participant‐reported treatment effectiveness and overall satisfaction. The place of lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence remains inconclusive.

Methods

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards of the Stanford University School of Medicine and Research and Development Office of the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System. Participants provided written informed consent before participating in the study. This study followed the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy reporting guidelines.

Participants

Patients

Patients were recruited from a substance use disorder treatment program at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Palo Alto, California. This 28-day residential treatment program provides a substance-free living environment, access to medical care, daily group sessions (which include coping, problem-solving, motivational, and relapse prevention skills), holistic therapy options, and voluntary 12-step mutual help group meetings (eg, Alcoholics Anonymous). Urine toxicology tests were conducted throughout treatment to verify abstinence. On admission to the program, all patients underwent a full history and physical interview by clinicians (including a psychiatrist, psychiatry residents, clinical psychologist, or social workers), which included diagnostic queries about past and current psychiatric and/or substance use disorder based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) (DSM-5) criteria. Researchers then recruited interested and eligible patients with current substance use disorder diagnoses for stimulant drugs (eg, methamphetamine and crack and powder cocaine). Although some patients were mandated by a court to receive treatment or were conditionally released from jail into treatment, the screening tool used to determine eligibility confirmed that problems with stimulant use were the primary reason for seeking treatment. The final sample included 28 methamphetamine users and 14 crack or powder cocaine users (6 patients met the criteria for abusing more than 1 stimulant). Patients were excluded if they took medications that influence vasoreactivity and/or cerebral perfusion (eg, cardiac medications) or central dopaminergic activity (eg, stimulants or antipsychotics), had a history of traumatic head injury, if they had a history of mania or psychosis, or reported safety contraindications to undergoing standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (eg, magnetic material in the head).

### Management of methamphetamine abuse and dependence [^112UvRui]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2006). Low credibility.

Preliminary implications for evidence-based treatments and future practice may be drawn from new research findings that inspire a fresh view of methamphetamine dependence and associated medical consequences. Current user populations include increasingly impacted subgroups (ie, youths, women, men who have sex with men, and rural residents); complex consequences of methamphetamine abuse among these subgroups require additional efforts involving contextual understanding of characteristics and needs to develop effective treatments. The neurobiological data on cellular activity of methamphetamine taken with findings from neuroimaging studies indicate potential targets for pharmacologic interventions. In early trials, several candidate medications — bupropion, modafinil, and, to a lesser extent, baclofen — have shown promise in treating aspects of methamphetamine dependence, including aiding memory function necessary to more effectively participate in and benefit from behavioral therapies. Clinicians and researchers must interact to efficiently address the problems of methamphetamine dependence, a major drug problem in the United States and the world.

Club drug and antiretroviral drug interactions — CYP metabolism and boosters: MDMA, GHB, ketamine, and methamphetamine all have the potential to interact with antiretroviral (ARV) drugs because they are metabolized, at least in part, by the CYP450 system. Overdoses secondary to interactions between club drugs (i.e. MDMA or GHB) and protease inhibitor–based ART have been reported. For instance, using PDE5 or ketamine concurrently with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as RTV or COBI, can potentiate the effects of these substances.

### A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of modafinil (200 mg / day) for methamphetamine dependence [^114vzSvs]. Addiction (2009). Low credibility.

Aim

To examine the safety and efficacy of modafinil (200 mg/day) compared to placebo in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence and to examine predictors of post-treatment outcome.

Participants and Design

Eighty methamphetamine-dependent subjects in Sydney, Australia were allocated randomly to modafinil (200 mg/day) (n = 38) or placebo (n = 42) under double-blind conditions for 10 weeks with a further 12 weeks post-treatment follow-up.

Measures

Comprehensive drug use data (urine specimens and self-report) and other health and psychosocial data were collected weekly during treatment and research interviews at baseline, week 10 and week 22.

Results

Treatment retention and medication adherence were equivalent between groups. There were no differences in methamphetamine abstinence, craving or severity of dependence. Medication-compliant subjects tended to provide more methamphetamine-negative urine samples over the 10-week treatment period (P = 0.07). Outcomes were better for methamphetamine-dependent subjects with no other substance dependence and those who accessed counselling. There were statistically significant reductions in systolic blood pressure (P = 0.03) and weight gain (P = 0.05) in modafinil-compliant subjects compared to placebo. There were no medication-related serious adverse events. Adverse events were generally mild and consistent with known pharmacological effects.

Conclusions

Modafinil demonstrated promise in reducing methamphetamine use in selected methamphetamine-dependent patients. The study findings support definitive trials of modafinil in larger multi-site trials.

### Lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of methamphetamine dependence: a randomised, placebo-controlled trial [^116BgN1V]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Modifications to the trial were necessary due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. The initial response to Australia's public health measures consisted of an HREC approved action plan (April 2020), reducing in‐person visits to once every 14 days with one supervised dose and up to 13 dispensed for self‐administration. Data collection by telephone was also permitted and up to three unsupervised urine samples collected at home. Face‐to‐face assessments were reduced to 1‐hour duration; ECGs were ceased. No trial data were used to inform these modifications, which were introduced to reduce the risk of infection by minimizing in‐person contact. Following the easing of COVID‐19 restrictions, a revised protocol (approved October 2020) was implemented. Data collection and supervised medication study visits reduced to two in the induction week and weekly thereafter. Sufficient study medication was dispensed at each visit for daily self‐administration until the next clinic appointment. Urine samples reduced to one per week for analysis.

An Independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (IDSMC) monitored the conduct of the trial and supported the COVID‐19 modifications for the purpose of optimizing participant and staff safety.

### Potential adverse effects of amphetamine treatment on brain and behavior: a review [^1174tBKR]. Molecular Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Amphetamine stimulants have been used medically since early in the twentieth century, but they have a high abuse potential and can be neurotoxic. Although they have long been used effectively to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents, amphetamines are now being prescribed increasingly as maintenance therapy for ADHD and narcolepsy in adults, considerably extending the period of potential exposure. Effects of prolonged stimulant treatment have not been fully explored, and understanding such effects is a research priority. Because the pharmacokinetics of amphetamines differ between children and adults, reevaluation of the potential for adverse effects of chronic treatment of adults is essential. Despite information on the effects of stimulants in laboratory animals, profound species differences in susceptibility to stimulant-induced neurotoxicity underscore the need for systematic studies of prolonged human exposure. Early amphetamine treatment has been linked to slowing in height and weight growth in some children. Because the number of prescriptions for amphetamines has increased several fold over the past decade, an amphetamine-containing formulation is the most commonly prescribed stimulant in North America, and it is noteworthy that amphetamines are also the most abused prescription medications. Although early treatment does not increase risk for substance abuse, few studies have tracked the compliance and usage profiles of individuals who began amphetamine treatment as adults. Overall, there is concern about risk for slowed growth in young patients who are dosed continuously, and for substance abuse in patients first medicated in late adolescence or adulthood. Although most adult patients also use amphetamines effectively and safely, occasional case reports indicate that prescription use can produce marked psychological adverse events, including stimulant-induced psychosis. Assessments of central toxicity and adverse psychological effects during late adulthood and senescence of adults who receive prolonged courses of amphetamine treatment are warranted. Finally, identification of the biological factors that confer risk and those that offer protection is also needed to better specify the parameters of safe, long-term, therapeutic administration of amphetamines to adults.

### Clinical characteristics and management of methamphetamine-associated cardiomyopathy: state-of-the-art review [^117KsKzP]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Amphetamines were first synthesized in the late 1920s as a mimetic to the popular drug ephedrine. 1 The drugs were used mostly for nasal decongestion, asthma, narcolepsy, depression, and weight loss, and less commonly for heart block, myasthenia gravis, dysmenorrhea, and persistent hiccups. 2 A patent on amphetamines in 1920s forced competitors to synthesize methamphetamines, 3 which were applied to many of the same indications as amphetamines. However, recognition of their severe addiction potential led to manufacturing restrictions, but the drugs found their way to the black market, thus beginning the epidemic.

A consistent uptrend in the use of methamphetamines has been reported. In the United States, methamphetamine use between 2015 and 2016 increased dramatically from 0.5% to 0.8% of the total population (1.6 versus 2.6 million users), possibly because of greater availability, increasing potency, and reports of the "dark net" using cryptocurrencies like bitcoin to facilitate transactions. 4, 5, 6

A 2016 Drug Enforcement Administration report identified methamphetamines as the greatest drug threat, second only to opioids. In 2005, the Rand Corporation estimated annual costs of methamphetamine treatment, the excess healthcare use associated with use and dependence, productivity losses, cost of methamphetamine‐associated crime, production of methamphetamines, the intangible burden borne by those addicted, and child endangerment at ≈$23.4 billion. 7 Globally, premature death or disability attributable to amphetamine use has significantly increased over the past decade. 8

### Risk factors for methamphetamine use in youth: a systematic review [^1164kZAu]. BMC Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Quantitative results: comparing MA users to high-risk youth

Seven studies examined risk factors for MA among high-risk youth (Table 3). Because of substantial heterogeneity among the studies, pooling of estimates was generally not appropriate.

Table 3
Comparing MA Users to High-Risk Youth

a Female = 1, Male = 0

b 13–14 years vs. 15–18 years

c I² = 0%

d I² = 34.7%

Sex

Five studies (one case-control and four cross-sectional) independently reported that female sex was significantly associated with MA use.

Age

One cross-sectional study categorized participants into two age groups: 13–14 years and 15–18 years. The results show that age was not significantly associated with MA use.

Ethnicity

Three studies (one case-control and two cross-sectional) examined the association between ethnicity and MA use among high-risk youth. Compared to African-American and Asian youth, Caucasian youth were significantly more likely to use MA. There was no significant difference in MA use between Caucasian versus Hispanic, Asian, or Native American.

Alcohol use

One cross-sectional study found no association between a history of alcohol use and MA use.

Family history

One cross-sectional study found that a family history of crime or drug use was significantly associated with MA use. The pooled analysis of two cross-sectional studies showed a significant association between family history of alcohol abuse and MA use.

Child abuse

The pooled analysis of one cross-sectional and one case-control study showed a two-fold association between children who experienced abuse and MA use; however, the result was not statistically significant.

Other risk factors

The following factors were significantly associated with MA use: receiving psychiatric treatment, greater than two admissions to juvenile home, and history of violence. However, strict parental monitoring was found to be protective for MA use among high-risk youth.

Multivariable analyses

Three studies conducted a multivariable logistic regression analysis. Shillington et al. found that strict parental monitoring, after controlling for age, was a statistically significant protective factor against MA use among high-risk youth. After controlling for age and race, Rawson et al. found that female sex was significantly associated with MA use. In the third study, female sex, age, more than two admissions to a juvenile home, non-violent history, psychiatric treatment, family history of drug misuse, and child abuse were significantly associated with MA use; a family history of crime was not significantly associated with MA use.

Amphetamines — urine testing is helpful when assessing a patient's amphetamine use, but there are known limitations to urine immunoassays for amphetamines and providers should be cautious when interpreting their results. Amphetamine immunoassays are also subject to cross-reactivity with other substances, and providers should know the sensitivity and specificity of the test being used for each of the amphetamine variants; the testing laboratory will have this information.

### Novel medications to treat addictive disorders [^117REqvu]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2008). Low credibility.

Recent discoveries about the effects of drugs of abuse on the brain and the mechanisms of their addictions; new chemical compounds, including immunotherapies; and new actions of available medications are offering many opportunities for the discovery and development of novel medications to treat addictive disorders. Furthermore, advancements in the understanding of the genetic and epigenetic basis of drug addiction and the pharmacogenetics of the safety and/or efficacy of the medications are providing opportunities for more individualized pharmacotherapy approaches. Although multiple medications have been investigated for treating addictions, only a handful have shown acceptable safety and efficacy and are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. This article reviews the current medications that are medically safe and have shown promising results for treating opioid, cocaine, methamphetamine, and cannabis addictions.

### Pharmacotherapy for methamphetamine / amphetamine use disorder-a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115q7xsY]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

Addiction to methamphetamine/amphetamine (MA/A) is a major public health problem. Currently there are no pharmacotherapies for MA/A use disorder that have been approved for use by the US Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency. We reviewed the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy for MA/A use disorder to assess the quality, publication bias and overall strength of the evidence.

Methods

Systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched multiple data sources (MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library) to April 2019 for systematic reviews (SRs) and randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Included studies recruited adults who had MA/A use disorder; sample sizes ranged from 19 to 229 participants. Outcomes of interest were abstinence, defined as 3 or more consecutive weeks with negative urine drug screens (UDS); overall use, analyzed as the proportion of MA/A negative UDS specimens; and treatment retention. One SR of pharmacotherapies for MA/A use disorder and 17 additional RCTs met our inclusion criteria encompassing 17 different drugs (antidepressants, antipsychotics, psychostimulants, anticonvulsants and opioid antagonists). We combined the findings of trials with comparable interventions and outcome measures in random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed quality, publication bias and the strength of evidence for each outcome using standardized criteria.

Results

There was low-strength evidence from two RCTs that methylphenidate may reduce MA/A use: 6.5 versus 2.8% MA/A-negative UDS in one study (n = 34, P = 0.008) and 23 versus 16% in another study (n = 54, P = 0.047). Antidepressants as a class had no statistically significant effect on abstinence or retention on the basis of moderate strength evidence. Studies of anticonvulsants, antipsychotics (aripiprazole), opioid antagonists (naltrexone), varenicline and atomoxetine provided either low-strength or insufficient evidence of no effect on the outcomes of interest. Many of the studies had high or unclear risk of bias.

Conclusions

On the basis of low- to moderate-strength evidence, most medications evaluated for methamphetamine/amphetamine use disorder have not shown a statistically significant benefit. However, there is low-strength evidence that methylphenidate may reduce use.

### An environmental scan of impacts and interventions for women with methamphetamine use in pregnancy and their children [^113pWW4C]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

MA is a central nervous system stimulant that has seen an extensive upsurge in number of users in the last few decades, particularly among women of childbearing age. Along with its growing prevalence, there is rising concern for prenatal methamphetamine exposure (PME) among women of childbearing age because of limited knowledge of effects of MA in pregnancy on women, their offspring and future generations. As illustrated in Figure 1, a Developmental Origins of Health and Disease lens demonstrates that effects of environmental stressors such as PME may transmit across several generations. This approach resonates with many Indigenous cultures, aligning with such concepts as Seven Generations, Blood Memory, and connectivity across families and generations.

FIGURE 1
Impacts of methamphetamine use in pregnancy on multiple generations

This environmental scan was designed to identify academic and grey literature on PME to summarize current knowledge on effects and interventions. Our aims for this scan emerged from our partnership with Sanctum 1.5 in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, which is a 10‐bed residence that provides culturally safe, client‐centered wrap‐around care in a harm reduction context for perinatal women who are HIV positive or at risk of becoming positive due to factors including injection drug use. Over 80% of Sanctum 1.5 clients self‐identify as Indigenous, and many report using substances during their pregnancy, including MA. We identified academic and grey literature from 2010 to 2020 to answer the following:
What are the effects of MA use in pregnancy on mother and baby, particularly for women experiencing complex life circumstances?
What interventions can be useful to minimize or mitigate these effects?
What are the implications of the reviewed literature for Indigenous women, particularly those experiencing complex life circumstances such as clients at Sanctum 1.5?

### Randomized controlled trial of dexamphetamine maintenance for the treatment of methamphetamine dependence [^115RkRyY]. Addiction (2010). Low credibility.

Aim

To investigate the safety and efficacy of once-daily supervised oral administration of sustained-release dexamphetamine in people dependent on methamphetamine.

Design

Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

Participants

Forty-nine methamphetamine-dependent drug users from Drug and Alcohol Services South Australia (DASSA) clinics.

Intervention

Participants were assigned randomly to receive up to 110 mg/day sustained-release dexamphetamine (n = 23) or placebo (n = 26) for a maximum of 12 weeks, with gradual reduction of the study medication over an additional 4 weeks. Medication was taken daily under pharmacist supervision.

Measurements

Primary outcome measures included treatment retention, measures of methamphetamine consumption (self-report and hair analysis), degree of methamphetamine dependence and severity of methamphetamine withdrawal. Hair samples were analysed for methamphetamine using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.

Findings

Treatment retention was significantly different between groups, with those who received dexamphetamine remaining in treatment for an average of 86.3 days compared with 48.6 days for those receiving placebo (P = 0.014). There were significant reductions in self-reported methamphetamine use between baseline and follow-up within each group (P < 0.0001), with a trend to a greater reduction among the dexamphetamine group (P = 0.086). Based on hair analysis, there was a significant decrease in methamphetamine concentration for both groups (P < 0.0001). At follow-up, degree of methamphetamine dependence was significantly lower in the dexamphetamine group (P = 0.042). Dexamphetamine maintenance was not associated with serious adverse events.

Conclusions

The results of this preliminary study have demonstrated that a maintenance pharmacotherapy programme of daily sustained-release amphetamine dispensing under pharmacist supervision is both feasible and safe. The increased retention in the dexamphetamine group, together with the general decreases in methamphetamine use, degree of dependence and withdrawal symptom severity, provide preliminary evidence that this may be an efficacious treatment option for methamphetamine dependence.

§ Any mental illness is defined as currently or at any time within the past year having had a diagnosable mental disorder (excluding developmental disorders and substance use disorders of sufficient duration to meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria). For this analysis where the variable was defined as past-year mental illness, not serious mental illness, persons meeting criteria for serious mental illness were not included.

¶ Serious mental illness is defined as currently or at any time within the past year having had a mental disorder (excluding developmental disorders and substance use disorders of sufficient duration to meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria), which resulted in serious functional impairment substantially interfering with or limiting one or more major life activities.

Among adults reporting past-year methamphetamine use, an estimated 36.2%, 19.2%, 17.2%, and 27.3% reported using methamphetamine 1–29 days, 30–99 days, 100–199 days, and ≥ 200 days, respectively; 22.3% reported injecting methamphetamine (Figure). Approximately one half (52.9%) of adults who reported past-year methamphetamine use met diagnostic criteria for past-year methamphetamine use disorder. Among those with past-year methamphetamine use disorder, an estimated 31.5% received any substance use treatment within the past year.

### Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB): a newer drug of abuse [^112TFFrV]. American Family Physician (2000). Low credibility.

Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is an illicitly marketed substance that has recently gained popularity among body builders and party attendees as a drug of abuse. GHB is a depressant that acts on the central nervous system. It is purported as a strength enhancer, euphoriant and aphrodisiac and is one of several agents reported as being used as a "date rape" drug. Because of its central nervous system depressant effects, GHB can be lethal when combined with alcohol or other depressants. Currently, there is no accepted medical use for GHB, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has prohibited its manufacture and sale. Clinicians should be familiar with the typical clinical presentation of GHB and its adverse effects. In addition, patients should be warned of its potential toxicity and be cautioned to avoid the use of GHB.

5.4 Psychiatric Adverse Reactions

Exacerbation of Pre-Existing Psychosis

CNS stimulants may exacerbate symptoms of behavior disturbance and thought disorder in patients with a pre-existing psychotic disorder.

Induction of a Manic Episode in Patients with Bipolar Illness

CNS stimulants may induce a mixed or manic episode in patients with bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets treatment, screen patients for risk factors for developing a manic episode (e.g., comorbid or has a history of depressive symptoms or a family history of suicide, bipolar disorder, or depression).

New Psychotic or Manic Symptoms

CNS stimulants, at recommended doses, may cause psychotic or manic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations, delusional thinking, or mania) in patients without prior history of psychotic illness or mania. In a pooled analysis of multiple short-term, placebo-controlled studies of CNS stimulants, psychotic or manic symptoms occurred in 0.1% of CNS stimulant-treated patients compared to 0% in placebo-treated patients. If such symptoms occur, consider discontinuing methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets.

5.5 Long-Term Suppression of Growth in Pediatric Patients

CNS stimulants have been associated with weight loss and slowing of growth rate in pediatric patients. Closely monitor growth (weight and height) in methamphetamine-treated pediatric patients treated with CNS stimulants.

Pediatric patients who are not growing or gaining height or weight as expected may need to have their treatment interrupted.

5.6 Peripheral Vasculopathy, including Raynaud's Phenomenon

CNS stimulants, including methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets, used to treat ADHD are associated with peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon. Signs and symptoms are usually intermittent and mild; however, very rare sequelae include digital ulceration and/or soft tissue breakdown. Effects of peripheral vasculopathy, including Raynaud's phenomenon, were observed in post-marketing reports at different times and at therapeutic doses in all age groups throughout the course of treatment. Signs and symptoms generally improve after reduction in dose or discontinuation of CNS stimulant.

Careful observation for digital changes is necessary during methamphetamine treatment. Further clinical evaluation (e.g., rheumatology referral) may be appropriate for methamphetamine-treated patients who develop signs or symptoms of peripheral vasculopathy.

5.7 Seizures

Methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets may lower the convulsive threshold in patients with prior history of seizure, in patients with prior EEG abnormalities in the absence of seizures, and in patients without a history of seizures and no prior EEG evidence of seizures. In the presence of seizures, methamphetamine hydrochloride tablets should be discontinued.

### Bupropion hydrochloride (Wellbutrin) [^116hvrwh]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

No suicides occurred in any of the pediatric trials. There were suicides in the adult trials, but the number was not sufficient to reach any conclusion about drug effect on suicide.

It is unknown whether the suicidality risk extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond several months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with depression that the use of antidepressants can delay the recurrence of depression.

All patients being treated with antidepressants for any indication should be monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, and unusual changes in behavior, especially during the initial few months of a course of drug therapy, or at times of dose changes, either increases or decreases [see Boxed Warning and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia (psychomotor restlessness), hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

Consideration should be given to changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing the medication, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidality or symptoms that might be precursors to worsening depression or suicidality, especially if these symptoms are severe, abrupt in onset, or were not part of the patient's presenting symptoms.

Families and caregivers of patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder or other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric, should be alerted about the need to monitor patients for the emergence of agitation, irritability, unusual changes in behavior, and the other symptoms described above, as well as the emergence of suicidality, and to report such symptoms immediately to healthcare providers. Such monitoring should include daily observation by families and caregivers. Prescriptions for Wellbutrin XL should be written for the smallest quantity of tablets consistent with good patient management, in order to reduce the risk of overdose.

### Bupropion and naltrexone in methamphetamine use disorder | NEJM resident 360… [^116YJ8GS]. resident360.nejm.org (2022). Medium credibility.

Literature From Pages to Practice Published January 5, 2022 In a 12-week, two-stage, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial published in NEJM, individuals with moderate-to-severe methamphetamine use disorder were randomized to receive either a combination of extended-release injectable naltrexone plus daily oral extended-release bupropion or placebo for 6 weeks. Early abstinence has been shown to be associated with improved retention in clinical trials of pharmacological therapies in MUD, and this association is thought to be mediated by delay discounting. Patients who receive effective treatment and achieve abstinence may see a benefit in continuing to participate in the trial. In this trial, the percentage of negative urine samples in the naltrexone/bupropion group increased markedly during the first 2 weeks and tapered thereafter.

Methamphetamine use and its associated harms have been increasing, and effective treatment is lacking. Because small studies have suggested that bupropion and naltrexone, used individually, might have some efficacy, researchers combined them in this randomized trial: Bupropion plus extended-release injectable naltrexone were compared with placebo in 403 adults with moderate-to-severe methamphetamine use disorder. The primary outcome was defined as at least three negative urine tests for methamphetamine during the last 2 weeks of each stage. Across the two stages, response rates were significantly higher with active treatment than with placebo. The number needed to treat to achieve 1 successful outcome was 9. Comment: Although the effects were modest and the trial duration was short, naltrexone plus bupropion was better than placebo in patients with moderate-to-severe methamphetamine use disorder.

Given the limited treatment options and the recalcitrance of methamphetamine addiction, these are promising results. The so-called "fourth wave" of the opioid epidemic is characterized by the rise of stimulant use alongside of opioids, and we are in dire need of more treatment options.

### Pilot trial of bupropion versus placebo for methamphetamine abuse in adolescents… [^113aXSRm]. ClinicalTrials (2009). Low credibility.

Pilot Trial of Bupropion Versus Placebo for Methamphetamine Abuse in AdolescentsClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Dr Keith Heinzerling, who is a doctor at UCLA, is doing a research study with Behavioral Health Services in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles to find out if a medication called bupropion can help adolescents reduce or stop using methamphetamine. Bupropion is a drug that is already on the market, which means it has been approved by the FDA, but it has not been approved to treat methamphetamine abuse. What the study is trying to find out is if bupropion helps people to stop using methamphetamine. The study lasts up to 14 weeks and involves visits to the BHS clinic in Lincoln Heights twice a week.
