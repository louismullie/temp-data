## Question

Lymphocytic colitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about lymphocytic colitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining lymphocytic colitis and its place within microscopic colitis. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and clinical presentation. Next, I will review pathophysiology and risk factors. After that, I need to confirm the diagnostic criteria and biopsy strategy. Then, I will examine the differential diagnosis and special contexts like immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis. Finally, I will appraise treatment options, prognosis, and follow-up, and close with a concise synthesis that ties these elements together with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and classification so I don't jump to conclusions: lymphocytic colitis is a subtype of microscopic colitis characterized by chronic watery, non-bloody diarrhea with normal or near-normal endoscopy and diagnostic histology showing increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) without a thickened subepithelial collagen band, distinguishing it from collagenous colitis, which has the thickened band; both share lamina propria inflammation and preserved crypt architecture, and guidelines specify ≥ 20 IELs per 100 surface epithelial cells as the threshold for lymphocytic colitis, with a normal collagen band, typically < 10 μm, to separate it from collagenous colitis [^1161rc9g] [^1138E9xS].

> Wait, let me verify the epidemiology before I overgeneralize: microscopic colitis is now recognized as common in high-income settings, with lifetime prevalence estimates around 1 in 115 women and 1 in 286 men in Sweden, and a female predominance of roughly 2–3:1; incidence rises with age and peaks in the sixth to seventh decades, though it can occur at younger ages, and population-based data show increasing recognition over time, with incidence estimates ranging from about 3–6 per 100,000 person-years in some regions to higher figures in others, reflecting ascertainment differences [^1138E9xS] [^116PGqHB] [^114uzcPY].

> I need to check the clinical phenotype carefully: the hallmark is chronic watery, non-bloody diarrhea, often with urgency, nocturnal stools, abdominal pain, bloating, fecal incontinence, and weight loss; importantly, endoscopy is typically normal or only subtly abnormal, so clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion and obtain biopsies even when the mucosa looks unremarkable, as symptoms can be disabling and substantially impair quality of life [^113EWrwC] [^112iN6sR] [^1138E9xS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology; I should review pathophysiology and risk factors: the prevailing model is an aberrant immune response to luminal antigens in genetically susceptible hosts, with HLA associations such as the 8.1 ancestral haplotype reported, and emerging single-cell data implicating clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells rather than bystander activation; risk factors include female sex, older age, smoking, alcohol, autoimmune disease (notably celiac disease and thyroid disease), prior GI infections, and medications such as NSAIDs, PPIs, SSRIs, and entacapone, with drug withdrawal sometimes improving symptoms; seasonal clustering has been described, suggesting possible infectious triggers in a subset [^113y6WbD] [^114inwWy] [^115emfLG] [^116NZtmn] [^111wKLUe].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic criteria and ensure I'm precise: histology is the gold standard, requiring ≥ 20 IELs per 100 surface epithelial cells, increased lamina propria inflammation, and a collagen band that is not significantly thickened (< 10 μm), with preserved crypt architecture; incomplete forms exist with 10–19 IELs and are termed microscopic colitis incomplete, which can still respond to therapy; because distribution is patchy but generally pancolonic, guidelines recommend obtaining multiple biopsies from ascending, transverse, and descending/sigmoid colon, and flexible sigmoidoscopy with left-sided biopsies can detect most cases, though right-sided sampling improves yield; fecal calprotectin can be normal or mildly elevated and should not be used to exclude disease [^1161rc9g] [^112EFiYF] [^112iN6sR] [^114wvqbZ] [^114ERFpv].

> Let me consider the differential diagnosis and avoid premature closure: IBD (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) shows architectural distortion and chronicity not typical of microscopic colitis; infectious colitis has acute neutrophilic features; celiac disease can coexist and should be screened; bile acid diarrhea is common and may coexist; importantly, immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis can mimic lymphocytic colitis histologically but often shows more acute features and may require escalation to biologics; drug-induced microscopic colitis patterns are well described with agents like entacapone and olmesartan, and medication review with withdrawal trials is essential [^116kaPp9] [^115emfLG] [^1177a3xj] [^116NZtmn] [^1169CmX7].

> I will now examine treatment, and I should double-check the strength of evidence: budesonide is first-line for induction and maintenance, with randomized trials and meta-analyses showing high clinical and histologic response rates for induction and benefit for maintenance, though relapse is common after cessation; antidiarrheals like loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate can help mild cases; mesalamine has supportive but lower-quality evidence and may be less effective than budesonide; for budesonide-refractory or dependent disease, immunomodulators and biologics such as azathioprine, infliximab, adalimumab, or vedolizumab are reasonable, with growing case series and mechanistic rationale for α4β7 integrin blockade; throughout, remove potential medication triggers and address bile acid diarrhea when present [^111W5CGh] [^114TUn6w] [^116amkP3] [^112Kcakg] [^112dP6yd] [^116pVaky] [^115emfLG].

> But wait, what about prognosis and follow-up; I should confirm that I'm not overstating risks: microscopic colitis is generally benign and non-progressive, with no increased risk of colorectal cancer compared with the general population, and most patients achieve symptom control; histologic evolution can occur, with lymphocytic colitis more likely to change subtype than collagenous colitis, and histologic resolution is more likely with budesonide and, interestingly, with aspirin or PPI use in observational cohorts; persistent symptoms may reflect coexisting functional disorders or incomplete histologic response, so individualized follow-up and retreatment strategies are prudent [^114RLuvo] [^113kfYZg] [^115cKwLG] [^112iN6sR].

> Let me reconsider special populations and contexts so I don't miss nuances: pediatric microscopic colitis is rare, more often lymphocytic, and may have atypical endoscopic features or immune dysregulation; immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis can present with microscopic colitis patterns but may behave more aggressively and require early steroid escalation to biologics; rare polypoid presentations of lymphocytic colitis have been described and should not distract from the underlying diagnosis when biopsied appropriately [^114fKjNr] [^1177a3xj] [^116Lz521].

> In summary, I need to ensure the clinical message is clear: lymphocytic colitis is a common, immune-mediated cause of chronic watery diarrhea in older adults, especially women, with normal endoscopy but diagnostic colonic biopsies showing ≥ 20 IELs per 100 epithelial cells without collagen band thickening; management centers on budesonide for induction and maintenance, removal of medication triggers, evaluation for celiac disease and bile acid diarrhea, and escalation to immunosuppressants or biologics for refractory disease; prognosis is favorable, with no increased colorectal cancer risk, though relapse is common and histology may evolve over time, warranting longitudinal follow-up and symptom-targeted retreatment [^1138E9xS] [^1161rc9g] [^111W5CGh] [^114RLuvo].

---

Lymphocytic colitis is a **histologic diagnosis** characterized by chronic watery, non-bloody diarrhea with normal-appearing colonic mucosa on endoscopy and increased intraepithelial lymphocytes on biopsy [^114QmQ3A]. It predominantly affects older women and is associated with autoimmune diseases and certain medications [^114vXnfM]. Diagnosis requires colon biopsies from multiple segments, as endoscopy is typically normal [^116nBEnT]. Budesonide is **first-line therapy** for induction and maintenance of remission, with antidiarrheals and mesalamine as alternatives; most patients have a benign course, though relapse is common after stopping therapy [^111W5CGh] [^114TUn6w] [^116amkP3].

## Clinical presentation

- **Symptoms**: Chronic watery, non-bloody diarrhea, urgency, nocturnal stools, abdominal pain, bloating, and occasional fecal incontinence [^113EWrwC].
- **Demographics**: Predominantly affects older adults, with a female predominance; median age at diagnosis is around 60–70 years [^112X53E8].
- **Associations**: Strong links with autoimmune diseases (celiac disease, thyroid disorders, rheumatoid arthritis) and medication use (NSAIDs, PPIs, SSRIs, immune checkpoint inhibitors) [^115emfLG].

---

## Pathophysiology

The **etiology** is multifactorial, involving immune-mediated inflammation triggered by luminal antigens, genetic susceptibility (e.g. HLA-DQ2/DQ8), and dysbiosis [^1138E9xS]. The **histology** shows increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (≥ 20 per 100 epithelial cells), normal or mildly thickened subepithelial collagen, and preserved crypt architecture [^1161rc9g].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and methods

- **Endoscopy**: Normal or mildly abnormal colonic mucosa; multiple biopsies are essential [^112iN6sR].
- **Histology**: Increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (≥ 20 per 100 epithelial cells), normal or mildly thickened subepithelial collagen, and preserved crypt architecture [^1161rc9g].
- **Differential diagnosis**: Infectious colitis, IBD, drug-induced colitis, bile acid diarrhea, and IBS [^111Q296c].

## Treatment strategies

| **Treatment** | **Indication** | **Efficacy** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Budesonide | First-line for induction and maintenance | High response; relapse common after cessation | Preferred corticosteroid [^111W5CGh] [^1171gNGi] |
| Antidiarrheals (loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropine) | Mild symptoms | Moderate efficacy | Symptomatic control [^115f7UKB] |
| Mesalamine | Alternative therapy | Moderate efficacy | Option if budesonide contraindicated [^notfound] |
| Immunomodulators (azathioprine, methotrexate) | Refractory cases | Limited evidence | Reserved for severe cases [^1138E9xS] |
| Biologics (adalimumab, vedolizumab) | Refractory cases | Limited evidence | Case reports suggest benefit [^116pVaky] |

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

The **prognosis** is excellent, with a benign course and no increased risk of colorectal cancer [^116C24E3]. Recurrence is **common after stopping therapy**, especially budesonide, but retreatment is effective [^116amkP3].

---

## Complications and associated conditions

Complications are rare; **severe disease** may cause dehydration, electrolyte disturbances, and malnutrition. Associated conditions include **celiac disease, thyroid disorders, rheumatoid arthritis**, and drug-induced cases (NSAIDs, PPIs, SSRIs, immune checkpoint inhibitors) [^115emfLG].

---

## Current research and emerging therapies

Current research and emerging therapies include studies of **microbiome modulation**, novel biologics, and small-molecule inhibitors for refractory disease [^1138E9xS]. Early trials of **fecal microbiota transplantation** and targeted immunotherapies are underway [^114vXnfM].

---

Lymphocytic colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease with a benign course, characterized by chronic watery diarrhea and specific histological findings. Budesonide is the **most effective treatment**, with antidiarrheals and mesalamine as alternatives.

## References

### Colon lesions: pathology specific to women [^113C7wuR]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis represent two conditions that fall under the category of microscopic abnormalities within the lamina propria of the colon. Patients are predominantly women in the sixth decade of life who present with non-bloody watery diarrhea. Few other symptoms exist. Diagnosis is based upon finding characteristic abnormalities in the colonic mucosa, more likely to be found on the right side of the colon than the left. Treatment is symptomatic, although some newer therapies suggest regression of the lesion. Other autoimmune associations have been described, including celiac disease, and appropriate work-up for this condition should be considered for the patient who has seemingly refractory colitis. The natural history is benign, and most patients experience resolution of their symptoms.

### Microscopic colitis: pathophysiology and clinical management [^113EWrwC]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Microscopic colitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon that frequently causes chronic watery diarrhoea that might be accompanied by abdominal pain, nocturnal diarrhoea, urgency, and faecal incontinence. These symptoms lead to poor quality of life and increased health-care costs. Diagnosis relies on histological examination of multiple biopsy samples from the colonic mucosa, which often show no or only few abnormalities on endoscopy. Two major histological subtypes can be distinguished-collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis-but incomplete and variant forms with fewer characteristic features have been reported. Here we summarise the latest evidence on epidemiology, pathogenesis, and risk factors, and discuss established and novel therapeutic options for clinical remission. Finally, we propose an updated treatment algorithm. Further prospective studies are needed to clarify the natural history of microscopic colitis, supported by validated criteria for the assessment of disease activity.

### Lymphocytic colitis: clinical features, treatment, and outcomes [^115f7UKB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

There are no reports of the clinical features or treatment outcomes in large series of patients with lymphocytic colitis, and it is not known whether treatments that appear to be beneficial in patients with collagenous colitis are also beneficial in lymphocytic colitis. We sought to analyze these issues in our patients with lymphocytic colitis.

Methods

All patients with biopsy-proven lymphocytic colitis evaluated at our institution between January 1, 1997, and December 31, 1999, were identified. Clinical features on presentation and treatment outcomes were abstracted from the medical records.

Results

A total of 170 patients with lymphocytic colitis were identified (median age 67 yr, 61% female). Diarrhea, bloating, rectal urgency, fecal incontinence, weight loss, concomitant autoimmune disorders, and aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use were common. Loperamide, diphenoxylate/atropine, and bismuth subsalicylate were effective therapies and were well tolerated. However, no therapy produced a complete response in more than 40% of patients.

Conclusions

Lymphocytic colitis typically presents in elderly patients as chronic diarrhea. Nocturnal stools, urgency, and abdominal pain occur frequently, as do weight loss, fecal incontinence, and concomitant autoimmune disorders. Many empiric treatment options are used, but overall response rates are disappointing. Randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the optimum therapeutic approach to these patients.

### Microscopic colitis: lymphocytic colitis, collagenous colitis, and beyond [^114m6hHC]. Human Pathology (2023). Medium credibility.

Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of colon with clinical presentations of chronic, watery, nonbloody diarrhea, and normal or almost normal endoscopic findings. Confirmation of a diagnosis of MC requires microscopic examination on colon biopsy to identify characteristic morphological features, in which 2 main subtypes of MC, lymphocytic colitis (LC) and collagenous colitis (CC), have been described. Although the pathogenesis of MC is still unclear, studies have revealed associations of MC with many risk factors and other diseases such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and medication use. Meanwhile, variants of MC, MC incomplete, or MC-like changes in other conditions are still diagnostic dilemmas for pathologists. The goal of this paper is to systemically introduce the clinicopathologic features of MC and focus on unusual features of MC and its associations with other conditions.

### Lymphocytic and collagenous colitis: an overview of so-called microscopic colitis [^113ELBjs]. Nature Reviews: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2012). Medium credibility.

The entity of 'microscopic colitis' is being diagnosed with increasing frequency and is a well-established clinicopathological diagnosis that is underpinned by a triad of watery diarrhea, normal results on endoscopy and characteristic microscopic findings. Careful histopathological evaluation and awareness of its numerous associations (especially with drugs and celiac disease) and mimics will lead to the correct diagnosis of microscopic colitis. The etiology of microscopic colitis remains enigmatic and is multifactorial with different elements being more influential in different individuals. Treatment includes antidiarrheal agents and anti-inflammatory drugs (including steroids). The purpose of this article is to provide some clarity on nomenclature, discuss the multitude of conditions that can occur synchronously or metachronously with microscopic colitis and their role in the etiopathogenesis of this condition, provide a detailed review of the pathological aspects of the disease and to briefly discuss treatment trends.

### Histology of microscopic colitis-review with a practical approach for pathologists [^111Q296c]. Histopathology (2015). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis has emerged as a major cause of chronic watery non-bloody diarrhoea, particularly in elderly females. The term is used as an umbrella term to categorize a subgroup of colitides with distinct clinicopathological phenotypes and no significant endoscopic abnormalities. Lymphocytic colitis is defined by an increased number of surface intraepithelial lymphocytes, and collagenous colitis by a thickened collagen band underneath the surface epithelium. There is increased inflammation in the lamina propria, but only little or no crypt architectural distortion. Incomplete and variant forms showing less characteristic features have been reported under different names. The differential diagnosis mainly includes resolving infectious colitis and changes related to the intake of drugs such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Substantial clinical and histological overlap between lymphocytic and collagenous colitis has been described, raising the suspicion that the conditions are two histological manifestations of the same entity, possibly representing different manifestations during the disease course or different stages of disease development. In this review, we provide a practical approach for pathologists, with a focus on diagnostic criteria and differential diagnosis, and discuss recent insights into the pathogenesis of disease and the relationship with classic chronic inflammatory bowel disease, i.e. Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

### Recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of microscopic colitis [^112VsCmo]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic diarrhea, reported by 4–5% of individuals of a Western population, is a common cause for consulting a physician in general practice or in internal medicine and for referral to a gastroenterologist. Microscopic colitis (MC), previously regarded as rare, and certainly overlooked, now has emerged as a common cause of chronic diarrhea, especially in elderly females. The condition is characterized clinically by chronic watery diarrhea and a macroscopically normal or almost normal colonic mucosa, where microscopic examination of mucosal biopsies reveals characteristic histopathological changes. MC comprises two entities: collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC), which have indistinguishable clinical presentations but are separated by histopathological characteristics. This review will present recent advances in the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of MC.

### The atypical colitides [^116pPGse]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis are atypical colitides that should be considered in elderly patients with unexplained diarrhea. The lack of natural history data and apparent underreporting of these disorders have made the determination of true incidence difficult. Better insight into the pathogenesis and heightened awareness of these conditions will lead to earlier diagnosis and more effective treatment.

### Microscopic colitis: what Do we know about pathogenesis? [^113wq3Uy]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis (MC) is a common cause of chronic diarrhea. The 2 most frequent forms of MC are collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis. Over the past years, the incidence and prevalence of microscopic colitis are rising and this is largely attributed to a greater awareness, and concomitantly an increasing number of diagnoses. Patients with microscopic colitis report watery, nonbloody diarrhea of chronic course, abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue that may impair patient's health-related quality of life. The underlying mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of microscopic colitis remain unspecified but is probably multifactorial. Collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis may represent specific mucosal responses to different luminal agents in predisposed individuals, resulting in an uncontrolled immune response. Genetic predisposition, altered modulation of cytokines and miRNAs, and aberrant response to drugs seem to be involved in the development of MC. Despite the progress of knowledge, still many questions remain unsolved regarding the etiology, pathophysiology, and optimal management of MC. This review gives an update on the immunological aspects of collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis.

### Clinicopathological significance of lymphocytic colitis / collagenous colitis in inflammatory bowel disease [^1165jAvY]. Human Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may occasionally present with lymphocytic colitis/collagenous colitis (LC/CC) either before or after the onset of IBD. Although a few reports have described a small number of such cases, the relationship between these 2 disorders is still unclear. We evaluated 27 patients with diagnosis of either ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn disease (CD) and LC/CC. Clinical, endoscopic, and pathological features were reviewed. Ten patients with initial diagnoses of LC (n = 2)/CC (n = 8) evolved into UC (n = 7) or CD (n = 3) after a median interval of 14 months (range, 2–44 months). Among these, 4 patients with LC/CC evolving into IBD also had recurrent CC in a quiescent phase of IBD. Seventeen patients with initial diagnosis of UC (n = 11) or CD (n = 6) developed LC (n = 6)/CC (n = 11) after a median interval of 108 months (range, 15–548 months). IBD patients with initial presentation of LC/CC were significantly older than those who developed LC/CC after onset of IBD (66.5 versus 34.0 years old, P = 0.001). The interval time between LC/CC to IBD was significantly shorter than that of IBD to LC/CC (14 versus 108 months, P = 0.007). Quiescent UC with superimposed CC was the most common pattern (n = 8). Patients with CD had shorter interval time to develop LC/CC than UC patients, although it was not statistically significant (60.5 versus 139 months, P = 0.14). Endoscopically, most patients that started with LC/CC had unremarkable findings, but 11 of 17 patients who developed LC/CC after IBD showed quiescent chronic colitis. Histologically, LC/CC patients with diagnosis of IBD, either before or after, more frequently show active inflammation. Chronicity was more commonly seen in biopsy of LC/CC patients with a history of IBD. Our study found that IBD patients with initial presentation of LC/CC tend to occur in older age, with shorter interval time and frequent active inflammation in initial LC/CC. These findings suggest that LC/CC may be a spectrum of IBD as the initial presentation in a subset of older IBD patients. On the other hand, IBD patients can develop LC/CC associated with chronic mucosal injury many years after the onset of IBD (typically with > 10 years interval time while patients are in remission phase), for which these 2 processes seem unrelated to each other.

### Microscopic colitis: an update [^113sJGgz]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis is an increasingly common cause of chronic diarrhea, and often causes abdominal pain and weight loss. The colonic mucosa appears normal or nearly normal endoscopically, and the diagnosis is made in the appropriate clinical setting when there is intraepithelial lymphocytosis and a mixed lamina propria inflammatory infiltrate. The 2 subtypes, collagenous and lymphocytic colitis, are similar clinically and histologically, and are distinguished by the presence or absence of a thickened subepithelial collagen band. Many potential pathophysiologic mechanisms have been proposed, but no convincing unifying mechanism has been identified. There are many anecdotal reports on treatment, but few controlled trials have been performed in these patients, although a systematic approach to therapy often leads to the satisfactory control of symptoms.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for microscopic colitis, more specifically with respect to histological criteria, EMCG/UEG 2021 guidelines recommend to use the following histopathologic criteria to diagnose lymphocytic colitis (H&E-stained slides):

- increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes ≥ 20 per 100 surface epithelial cells

- increased inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria

- not significantly thickened collagenous band (< 10 mcm).

### Microscopic colitis: a review [^117VomEv]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis is a relatively common cause of chronic watery diarrhea, often accompanied by abdominal pain and weight loss. The colonic mucosa appears normal grossly, and the diagnosis is made when there is an intraepithelial lymphocytosis and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria. The two main subtypes, collagenous and lymphocytic colitis, are similar clinically and histologically, distinguished by the presence or absence of a thickened subepithelial collagen band. Many potential pathophysiological mechanisms have been described, although none have been conclusively proved. There is a paucity of randomized treatment trials in these patients, although a rational approach to therapy often leads to satisfactory control of symptoms.

### Interventions for treating lymphocytic colitis [^112Kcakg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphocytic colitis is a cause of chronic diarrhea. It is a subtype of microscopic colitis characterized by chronic, watery, non-bloody diarrhea and normal endoscopic and radiologic findings. The etiology of this disorder is unknown. Therapy is based mainly on case series and uncontrolled trials, or by extrapolation of data for treating collagenous colitis, a related disorder. This review is an update of a previously published Cochrane review.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of treatments for clinically active lymphocytic colitis.

Search Methods

The MEDLINE, PUBMED and EMBASE databases were searched from inception to 11 August 2016 to identify relevant papers. Manual searches from the references of included studies and relevant review articles were performed. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were also searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. The trial registry web site www. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify registered but unpublished trials. Finally, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized Trials Register were searched for other studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials assessing medical therapy for patients with biopsy-proven lymphocytic colitis were considered for inclusion DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data was independently extracted by at least two authors. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis. The primary outcome was clinical response as defined by the included studies. Secondary outcome measures included histological response as defined by the included studies, quality of life as measured by a validated instrument and the occurrence of adverse events. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous outcomes. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary outcome and selected secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Data were combined for analysis if they assessed the same treatments. Dichotomous data were combined using a pooled RR along with corresponding 95% CI. A fixed-effect model was used for the pooled analysis.

Main Results

Five RCTs (149 participants) met the inclusion criteria. These studies assessed bismuth subsalicylate versus placebo, budesonide versus placebo, mesalazine versus mesalazine plus cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate versus mesalazine. The study which assessed mesalazine versus mesalazine plus cholestyramine and the study which assessed beclometasone dipropionate versus mesalazine were judged to be at high risk of bias due to lack of blinding. The study which compared bismuth subsalicylate versus us placebo was judged as low quality due to a very small sample size and limited data. The other 3 studies were judged to be at low risk of bias. Budesonide (9 mg/day for 6 to 8 weeks) was significantly more effective than placebo for induction of clinical and histological response. Clinical response was noted in 88% of budesonide patients compared to 38% of placebo patients (2 studies; 57 participants; RR 2.03, 95% CI 1.25 to 3.33; GRADE = low). Histological response was noted in 78% of budesonide patients compared to 33% of placebo patients (2 studies; 39 patients; RR 2.44, 95% CI 1.13 to 5.28; GRADE = low). Forty-one patients were enrolled in the study assessing mesalazine (2.4 g/day) versus mesalazine plus cholestyramine (4 g/day). Clinical response was noted in 85% of patients in the mesalazine group compared to 86% of patients in the mesalazine plus cholestyramine group (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.28; GRADE = low). Five patients were enrolled in the trial studying bismuth subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks versus placebo). There were no differences in clinical (P = 0.10) or histological responses (P = 0.71) in patients treated with bismuth subsalicylate compared with placebo (GRADE = very low). Forty-six patients were enrolled in the trial studying beclometasone dipropionate (5 mg/day or 10 mg/day) versus mesalazine (2.4 g/day). There were no differences in clinical remission at 8 weeks (RR 0.97; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.24; GRADE = low) and 12 months of treatment (RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.40 to 4.18; GRADE = very low). Although patients receiving beclometasone dipropionate (84%) and mesalazine (86%) achieved clinical remission at 8 weeks, it was not maintained at 12 months (26% and 20%, respectively). Adverse events reported in the budesonide studies include nausea, vomiting, neck pain, abdominal pain, hyperhidrosis and headache. Nausea and skin rash were reported as adverse events in the mesalazine study. Adverse events in the beclometasone dipropionate trial include nausea, sleepiness and change of mood. No adverse events were reported in the bismuth subsalicylate study.

Authors' Conclusions

Low quality evidence suggests that budesonide may be effective for the treatment of active lymphocytic colitis. This benefit needs to be confirmed by a large placebo -controlled trial. Low quality evidence also suggests that mesalazine with or without cholestyramine and beclometasone dipropionate may be effective for the treatment of lymphocytic colitis, however this needs to be confirmed by large placebo-controlled studies. No conclusions can be made regarding bismuth subsalicylate due to the very small number of patients in the study, Further trials studying interventions for lymphocytic colitis are warranted.

### Diagnosis and management of microscopic colitis [^112WHNmu]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis (MC) is a relatively common cause of chronic watery diarrhea, especially in older persons. Associated symptoms, including abdominal pain and arthralgias, are common. The diagnosis is based upon characteristic histological findings in the presence of diarrhea. The two types of MC, collagenous and lymphocytic colitis, share similar clinical features, with the main difference being the presence or absence of a thickened subepithelial collagen band. There are several treatment options for patients with MC, although only budesonide has been well studied in multiple controlled clinical trials. This review will describe the clinical features, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnostic criteria, and treatment of patients with MC.

### New insights and challenges in microscopic colitis [^116TKF6a]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis (MC) is described as an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic, bloodless diarrhea with normal or close to normal endoscopic findings. Histopathological examination reveals two subtypes: collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC), which are indistinguishable clinically. The disease debuts typically in middle-aged patients, but can occur at all ages, including children. A female predominance is found in both CC and LC, but is not confirmed by others in LC. The etiology is unclear, but the disease has been assumed to be of autoimmune origin. However, several etiologies may render a microscopic inflammation in the mucosa; this is a common, universal reaction to a variety of irritants in contact with the intestinal lumen. Furthermore, some patients with a microscopic inflammation in their colonic mucosa have no symptoms, or are suffering from constipation or abdominal pain, rather than diarrhea. Recently, a discussion was initiated calling into question the overdiagnosing of symptoms and pointing out the danger of exacerbating people's perception of their ailments, of weakening their eligibility in health insurance, of overprescription of drugs, and thus the increasing cost to the society of health care. In the light of this discussion, this review will highlight histopathological and clinical features of MC, and discuss the diagnosis and management of this disease. Perhaps, the intestinal mucosa has no other mode by which to react than an inflammatory response, irrespective of the presence or absence of autoimmunity. Thus, to better identify and classify subgroups of MC, and to clarify and correctly handle the inflammatory changes, this field of research stands to benefit from a review of the results and experience gained to date.

### Microscopic colitis: a missed diagnosis? [^113LtmRU]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

Collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis, collectively designated microscopic colitis, have until recently been considered as rare gastrointestinal disorders. New data suggest, however, that these disorders are relatively common, and to reach the correct diagnosis both the gastroenterologist and the pathologist must be aware of these diagnoses when evaluating patients with persistent watery non-bloody diarrhoea.

Starting Point

In an epidemiological study of a well-defined Swedish population, Martin Olesen and colleagues show that microscopic colitis needs to be considered as a common gastrointestinal disorder (Gut 2004; 53: 346–50). In colonic biopsy specimens from 1018 patients who had a colonoscopy because of non-bloody diarrhoea in 1993–98, 97 patients (9.5%) were found to have microscopic colitis. In about a third of these cases, the diagnosis was missed in the primary histological evaluation. Median age at diagnosis was 64 years for collagenous colitis and 59 years for lymphocytic colitis. The annual incidence of the diseases was higher than previously considered and matched the incidence of Crohn's disease, and in combination they approached the incidence of ulcerative colitis.

Where Next

The high regional incidence of microscopic colitis means that both clinicians and pathologists need to be more aware of the diagnosis, especially in the elderly female population with a clinical picture of watery non-bloody diarrhoea. Because of the potentially disabling symptoms, clinicians need to develop and evaluate new therapies.

### Recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of microscopic colitis [^115UWCLC]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis, comprising collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis, is a common cause of chronic diarrhea. It is characterized clinically by chronic watery diarrhea and a macroscopically normal colonic mucosa where diagnostic histopathological features are seen on microscopic examination. The annual incidence of each disorder is 4–6/100,000 inhabitants, with a peak incidence in individuals 60–70 years old and a noticeable female predominance in collagenous colitis. The etiology is unknown. Chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, fatigue, and fecal incontinence are common symptoms that impair the health-related quality of life of the patient. There is an association with other autoimmune disorders, such as celiac disease, thyroid disorders, diabetes mellitus, and arthritis. Budesonide is the best-documented treatment, both short-term and long-term. Recurrence of symptoms is common after withdrawal of successful budesonide therapy, and the optimal long-term treatment strategy needs further study. The long-term prognosis is good, and the risk of complications including colon cancer is low. We review the epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of microscopic colitis.

### Focus on immune checkpoint inhibitors-related intestinal inflammation: from pathogenesis to therapeutical approach [^111oFa3A]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

In addition, these features may appear simultaneously with active colitis or develop gradually thereafter, and overlapping patterns may exist in the microscopic presentation of ICI colitis. In approximately 10%-12% of cases, microscopic colitis (ie, lymphocytic colitis [LC]) and collagenous colitis (CC) are observed. According to some authors, this condition is associated with a more aggressive disease, with more difficulties in treatment than microscopic colitis developed in the absence of ICIs. Figure 3 shows a histological examination of ICIs colitis.

Figure 3.
Histological features of ICIs colitis. Colonic section in which preserved architecture, moderate lympho-plasma cellular and neutrophilic granulocytic infiltrate of the lamina propria and areas of cryptitis are observable.

Rarely, patterns of ischemic colitis, increased apoptosis, and nonspecific inflammatory reactive changes have been described. Interestingly, Isidro et al reported medication-specific histological changes; in their study, patients on ipilimumab therapy were more likely to show a pattern of diffuse active colitis without chronic features. Lymphocytic colitis and CC were more common in patients treated with nivolumab and pembrolizumab, while chronic active colitis was more frequent in long-term treatment with nivolumab. Surprisingly, although nivolumab and pembrolizumab belong to the same drug class, they may be associated with different histological pictures. Notably, there is currently no single criterion that confirms the diagnosis, as none of the histological features are pathognomonic, and there is a wide range of pathological findings that can be observed. Rather, histopathology must be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context, excluding other potential aetiologies.

### Lymphocytic colitis pattern of injury presenting as endoscopic polyps: a case series [^116Lz521]. Human Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Lymphocytic colitis (LC) is characterized by chronic watery diarrhea and unremarkable endoscopic findings. Only one case of LC presenting as multiple colonic polyps has been reported. We report a case series of histologic LC pattern of injury (LCPI), presenting as endoscopic polyps, and compare them with typical LC cases. Eighteen archived (2009–2019) polypoid LCPI cases without an associated cause of polyp, such as adenoma, hyperplastic change, or lymphoid aggregate, were retrieved from 17 (12 female and 5 male) patients. The clinical history and endoscopic findings were noted. A total of 40 conventional LC cases were used as controls. Fisher's exact test was performed to evaluate associations between two variables. The mean age of the patients was 61.1 years. The indication for colonoscopy was chronic watery diarrhea (56%), screening/surveillance (33%), and rectal bleeding (11%). The mean number and size of the polyps was 1.6 and 2.9 mm, respectively. Seventy-six percent were located in the left colon, and 48% were sessile. When biopsied (14/18; 78%), the background colonic mucosa showed LCPI. There was no significant difference in age, gender, and the average number of lymphocytes in the two groups. Hypertension and history of malignancy was more common in the polypoid LCPI group than in the control LC group (P < 0.05). LCPI may present as endoscopic polyps, frequently in patients with hypertension and history of malignancy. Polypoid LCPI may be a harbinger of LCPI in the background nonpolypoid colonic mucosa. A subset of polypoid LCPI (56%) cases represents true LC.

### Microscopic colitis: a review [^114vUH4r]. Colorectal Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Aim

In recent years, microscopic colitis has been increasingly diagnosed. This review was carried out to evaluate demographic factors for microscopic colitis and to perform a systematic assessment of available treatment options.

Method

Relevant publications up to December 2013 were identified following searches of PubMed and Google Scholar using the key words 'microscopic colitis', 'collagenous colitis' and 'lymphocytic colitis'. Two-hundred and forty-eight articles were identified.

Results

The term microscopic colitis includes lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis. Both have common clinical symptoms but are well defined histopathologically. The clinical course is usually benign, but serious complications, including death, may occur. A peak incidence from 60 to 70 years of age with a female preponderance is observed. Although most cases are idiopathic, associations with autoimmune disorders, such as coeliac disease and hypothyroidism, as well as with exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and proton-pump inhibitors, have been observed. The incidence and prevalence of microscopic colitis is rising and good-quality epidemiological research is needed. Treatment is currently largely based on anecdotal evidence and on results from limited clinical trials of budesonide. Long-term follow-up of these patients is not well established.

Conclusion

The review synthesizes work on the definition of microscopic colitis and the relationship between collagenous and lymphocytic colitis. It reviews the international epidemiology and work on aetiology. In addition, it critically considers the efficacy of a range of treatments.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^112X53E8]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

The overall prevalence of microscopic colitis ranges from about 50 to 200/100 000. Both forms are commoner in women (collagenous colitis 77%, lymphocytic colitis 68%) and the mean age at presentation is around 60. However, microscopic colitis can present in much younger patients with 25% of cases being under 45. The incidence of collagenous and lymphocytic colitis has been increasing in parallel, possibly related to greater awareness of the need to look for this diagnosis. There are overlapping histological features and the two forms cannot be distinguished on the basis of symptoms, although they may be less severe in lymphocytic compared with collagenous colitis. Nocturnal diarrhoea and incontinence are frequently present.

In a meta-analysis of studies of patients meeting the criteria for diarrhoea-dominant IBS, the prevalence of microscopic colitis was 9.8% (95% CI 4.4% to 17.1%). Other reviews have also quoted a prevalence in patients being investigated for chronic diarrhoea of around 7.5–10%. Other functional bowel disorders, including constipation-predominant or mixed IBS, may also coexist with microscopic colitis. In patients with a diagnosis of microscopic colitis, about one-third have symptoms compatible with IBS, but this is a similar proportion to patients with other causes of chronic diarrhoea.

### SARS-CoV-2-triggered lymphocytic colitis [^116dpptL]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

The ability of SARS-CoV-2 to infect the gastrointestinal tract is well described. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are believed to represent a disorganised immune response in genetically predisposed individuals, which are triggered by various environmental factors, notably infections. Here we report a case of chronic watery diarrhoea that was triggered by a SARS-CoV-2 infection. The work-up confirmed a new diagnosis of lymphocytic colitis, and the patient responded favourably to a course of oral budesonide. Clinicians should become vigilant to the possibility of triggered IBD in patients with persistent diarrhoea following a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

### Diagnosis and management of microscopic colitis syndrome [^116ykwsE]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis syndrome consists of chronic watery diarrhea, a normal or near-normal gross appearance of the colonic mucosa, and a specific histologic picture described as either lymphocytic colitis or collagenous colitis. The cause of microscopic colitis is unknown, but recent work suggests some immunologic similarities to celiac disease, suggesting that luminal antigens may be important in its pathogenesis. Diarrhea in microscopic colitis seems to be directly related to the extent of inflammation, suggesting that inflammatory mediators are responsible for reduced water absorption by the colon. Microscopic colitis is a frequent diagnosis in patients with chronic diarrhea seen at referral centers. It is often associated with other immune-mediated conditions and frequently is complicated by fecal incontinence. The differential diagnosis is broad, comprising all causes of watery diarrhea. Evaluation is straightforward with the key aspect being review of colon biopsy specimens by an experienced pathologist. Treatment is still being defined: symptomatic management with antidiarrheal agents, 5-aminosalicylate drugs, corticosteroids, especially budesonide, bile acid-binding resins, and bismuth subsalicylate all can be effective. The prognosis is good with no evidence of conversion to classic inflammatory bowel disease or of development of neoplasia over time.

### American Gastroenterological Association institute guideline on the medical management of microscopic colitis [^112iN6sR]. Gastroenterology (2016). Medium credibility.

Microscopic colitis — epidemiology and evaluation: Microscopic colitis is characterized by chronic watery diarrhea caused by inflammation in the colon and diagnosed by colon biopsy, with a predilection for those 60 years of age or older and comprising 2 subtypes, lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis. The reported prevalence of microscopic colitis ranges from 48 to 219 per 100,000, and unlike other inflammatory colitides there is no evidence that the persistence of histological inflammation portends long-term unfavorable outcomes such as colorectal cancer or need for surgery. Because outcomes did not differ between lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis in the technical review, the recommendations in this guideline do not distinguish between subtypes of microscopic colitis. Because microscopic colitis occurs in 7.5% of patients undergoing evaluation for chronic diarrhea, it would be prudent when assessing these patients with endoscopy to perform colonoscopy with biopsies of multiple segments of the colon; if flexible sigmoidoscopy is performed instead of colonoscopy, it is important to obtain biopsy specimens from the descending colon in addition to those from the rectosigmoid colon because biopsy specimens from the latter may not reveal the disease in some cases. When evaluating for microscopic colitis, coexisting causes of chronic diarrhea such as celiac disease should be considered, persistence of residual bowel symptoms may also reflect coexisting or postinflammatory functional bowel disorders, and patients with refractory symptoms should also avoid potential medication triggers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

### Increasing incidence of microscopic colitis in a population-based cohort study in Switzerland [^114uzcPY]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon that presents with chronic, nonbloody watery diarrhea and only few or no endoscopic abnormalities. Histologic examination discriminates lymphocytic colitis (LyC; presence of ≥ 20 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 surface epithelial cells) and collagenous colitis (CC; colonic subepithelial collagen band > 10 μm in diameter). 1, 2 MC not otherwise specified describes a subgroup of patients who do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for either CC or LyC. 1, 2 Population-based epidemiologic data regarding MC are scarce. We aimed to evaluate the clinical presentation at diagnosis, incidence, and prevalence of MC in Cantons of Vaud and Fribourg, Switzerland.

### Colorectal normal histology and histopathologic findings in patients with chronic diarrhea [^114f89s7]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis are common causes of chronic watery diarrhea that are characterized by distinct histopathologic abnormalities without endoscopically visible lesions and are summarized as microscopic colitis. Several variants of microscopic colitis have been described, although their clinical significance still has to be defined. Preserved mucosal architecture is a histologic hallmark of microscopic colitis and distinguishes the disease from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In addition to architectural abnormalities, the diagnosis of IBD rests on characteristic inflammatory changes. Differential diagnosis of IBD mainly includes prolonged infection and diverticular disease-associated colitis, also known as segmental colitis associated with diverticulosis.

### Undiagnosed microscopic colitis: a hidden cause of chronic diarrhoea and a frequently missed treatment opportunity [^114ERFpv]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Microscopic colitis (MC) is a treatable cause of chronic, non-bloody, watery diarrhoea, but physicians (particularly in primary care) are less familiar with MC than with other causes of chronic diarrhoea. The colon in patients with MC is usually macroscopically normal. MC can only be diagnosed by histological examination of colonic biopsies (subepithelial collagen band > 10 µm (collagenous colitis) or > 20 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells (lymphocytic colitis), both with lamina propria inflammation). The UK National Health Service exerts downward pressure to minimise colonoscopy referrals. Furthermore, biopsies are often not taken according to guidelines. These factors work against MC diagnosis. In this review, we note the high incidence of MC (comparable to ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and its symptomatic overlap with irritable bowel syndrome. We also highlight problems with the recommendation by National Health Service/National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for inflammatory bowel diseases that colonoscopy referrals should be based on a faecal calprotectin level of ≥ 100 µg/g. Faecal calprotectin is < 100 µg/g in over half of individuals with active MC, building into the system a propensity to misdiagnose MC as irritable bowel syndrome. This raises important questions — how many patients with MC have already been misdiagnosed, and how do we address this silent burden? Clarity is needed around pathways for MC management; MC is poorly acknowledged by the UK healthcare system and it is unlikely that best practices are being followed adequately. There is an opportunity to identify and treat patients with MC more effectively.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diarrhea and colitis: an overview [^114GTVjV]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Histology

The common histologic features of ICI-induced colitis include acute colitis indicators, such as increased lamina propria cellularity, intraepithelial neutrophilic infiltrates, cryptitis, crypt abscesses, and apoptotic cells, which may precede diarrhea onset. Chronic colitis features, such as intraepithelial lymphocytes, basal lymphocytes, and crypt distortion, may also be present. The pattern of ICI-induced colitis can vary by drug, with ipilimumab linked to diffuse active colitis and nivolumab associated with lymphocytic colitis and, with long-term treatment, chronic active colitis. No single criterion confirms the diagnosis, emphasizing the need for contextual interpretation in clinical assessments.

Imaging

Limited data suggests that imaging, particularly computed tomography (CT), may serve as an alternative for diagnosing ICI-induced colitis. Recent studies have shown that CT has suboptimal sensitivity (74%) and specificity (50%) when correlating radiologic findings with correct histological diagnosis of enterocolitis. Despite these limitations, CT scans remain helpful for excluding complications and assessing disease severity, especially if toxic megacolon, perforation, abscess, or obstruction is suspected. Further exploration of pathognomonic radiological signs is needed to consider CT as part of the standard of care for diagnosing ICI-induced colitis as it offers the advantage of being less invasive than endoscopy with biopsy.

Differential diagnosis

In patients receiving ICI therapy, the initial step of the differential diagnosis involves ruling out infectious causes (viral, bacterial, or parasitic) of diarrhea and abdominal pain. Microbiological studies and stool cultures are crucial in this context, considering these patients' increased risk of infection. Distinguishing between infectious and ICI-induced colitis can be challenging, but specific features caused by pathogens can aid in differentiation. Opportunistic infections like Cytomegalovirus, diagnosed by characteristic cellular and intranuclear inclusions, can complicate ICI-induced colitis and impact steroid response. C. difficile infections overlaid on ICI-induced colitis have been documented in patients receiving ICI therapy.

Furthermore, gastrointestinal metastases as a potential cause of colitis must be excluded, particularly in patients with clinical signs of peritonitis, which warrants evaluation with CT to rule out colonic perforation.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can induce conditions like lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis, which can mimic ICI-induced colitis. The harm these conditions impose on the colon includes erosions and ulcers, with distinct histological findings.

Distinguishing between ICI-induced colitis and IBD is crucial, and distinctive histological features favor either diagnosis. ICI-induced colitis often presents with a rapid onset of symptoms, whereas IBD has an insidious onset, and specific lesions like fistulas may suggest C. difficile in patients with IBD.

### Single-cell transcriptomic characterization of microscopic colitis [^114inwWy]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

This study provides a seminal resource for cellular shifts in MC and helps to place this condition on the spectrum of gut inflammatory diseases. There are currently no FDA-approved treatments for MC. Therefore, these data will help build a much-needed mechanistic model to identify disease-specific biomarkers and therapeutic options. This study identified T cell subtypes responsible for the lymphocytic infiltration in MC and suggested that CD8 T cells likely expand through TCR-driven cycling rather than bystander activation or recruitment from other tissues. Finally, evidence of anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling that might limit epithelial damage was presented. We highlighted similarities and differences between colitides with the hope of improving our understanding of the mechanistic differences across the colitis spectrum.

### Autoimmune hepatitis in association with lymphocytic colitis [^115zeC9a]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare, chronic inflammatory disorder which has been associated with a number of other auto-immune conditions. However, there are no reports in the medical literature of an association with microscopic (lymphocytic) colitis. We report the case of a 53-year-old woman with several autoimmune conditions, including lymphocytic colitis, who presented with an acute hepatitis. On the basis of the clinical features, serology, and histopathology, we diagnosed autoimmune hepatitis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of autoimmune hepatitis in association with lymphocytic colitis, and lends support to the theory of an autoimmune etiology for lymphocytic colitis.

### Lymphocytic and collagenous colitis in children and adolescents: comprehensive clinicopathologic analysis with long-term follow-up [^114fKjNr]. Human Pathology (2020). Medium credibility.

Microscopic colitis (MC) is characterized by chronic watery diarrhea, endoscopically normal findings, and abnormal histology. While mostly encountered in adults, pediatric cases are rare and may show varying presentations. Our pathology data system was searched from 1984 to 2019 for patients ≤ 18 years of age with a lymphocytic colitis (LC) or collagenous colitis (CC) pattern of injury. Twenty-seven cases (23 LC and 4 CC) were retrieved. LC was more prevalent than CC (85% vs 15%, respectively) and affected slightly younger individuals (mean, 9.8 years versus 12.25 years). Immune dysregulation was documented in 11 (41%) patients. Most patients presented with watery diarrhea (n = 26, 96%) and either abdominal pain (n = 18, 67%), nausea/vomiting (n = 5, 19%), flatulence (n = 6, 22%), and/or weight loss (n = 1, 4%). A subset of patients (n = 10, 37%) demonstrated endoscopic abnormalities. Histologically, some patients with LC and CC displayed focal cryptitis or crypt abscess formation (n = 7, 26%) and focally increased crypt apoptosis (n = 9, 33%) in the absence of chronic injury. Clinical follow-up data were available for 23 (85%) patients with variable clinical responses recorded. Only 8 patients experienced complete symptom resolution. Twelve patients (11 LC and 1 CC) had subsequent biopsy material; of which, one developed histologic features of inflammatory bowel disease and another was found to have a CTLA-4 deficiency. Our study shows that pediatric patients with MC may have atypical clinical, histologic, and endoscopic findings and variable clinical responses. Underlying inflammatory and/or genetic conditions may be eventually unmasked, and genetic testing may be helpful in a small subset of patients.

### Lymphocytic colitis: pathologic predictors of response to therapy [^112USAKk]. Human Pathology (2018). Low credibility.

Although the presence of intraepithelial lymphocytosis with surface epithelial damage is a unifying feature of lymphocytic colitis, there are nonclassical features that create morphologic heterogeneity between cases. Limited data on the significance of these secondary histologic features are available. Cases of lymphocytic colitis diagnosed between 2002 and 2013 were identified using the Research Patient Data Registry of a tertiary referral center. Diagnostic biopsy slides were reviewed and evaluated for histologic features of lymphocytic colitis. Clinical data including type of therapy and response to treatment were collected. χ² Test (or Fisher exact test) and logistic regression analysis were used where appropriate. Thirty-two cases of lymphocytic colitis with complete clinical data and slides available for review were identified. The mean age was 56.4 years, and the female-to-male ratio was 3:2. Eleven patients improved with minimal intervention (group 1), 14 patients responded to steroid therapy (group 2), and 7 patients responded to mesalamine, bismuth subsalicylate, and/or cholestyramine therapy (group 3). Histologic differences in the characteristics of the subepithelial collagen table (P = 0.018), the severity of lamina propria inflammation (P = 0.042), and the presence of eosinophil clusters (P = 0.016) were seen between groups 2 and 3. Patients in group 1 were more likely to have mild crypt architectural distortion in their biopsies than patients in groups 2 and 3. Lymphocytic colitis is a heterogeneous disease, and the evaluation of histologic factors may help identify various subtypes and predict therapy response.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for microscopic colitis, more specifically with respect to histological criteria, EMCG/UEG 2021 guidelines recommend to use the following histopathologic criteria to diagnose incomplete microscopic colitis (H&E-stained slides):

- > 5 but < 10 mcm thickened subepithelial collagenous band for incomplete collagenous colitis

- > 10 but < 20 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 surface epithelial cells and a normal collagenous band for incomplete lymphocytic colitis

- mild inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria.

### Microscopic colitis: epidemiology and treatment [^116C24E3]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis, a chronic diarrheal condition, is characterized by colonic intraepithelial lymphocytosis, expansion of the lamina propria with acute and chronic inflammatory cells, and preserved crypt architecture. These changes, in association with a thickened subepithelial collagen band, are termed collagenous colitis, whereas changes occurring without a thickened collagen band are classified as lymphocytic colitis. Population-based epidemiologic studies confirm that microscopic colitis is most frequently diagnosed in middle-aged or elderly women and that its incidence is rising. Although these disorders diminish patients' quality of life, they are not associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and survival is not diminished. Clinical and histologic improvement after therapy have been noted in one randomized trial of bismuth subsalicylate and three randomized clinical trials of oral delayed-release budesonide. A treatment algorithm for microscopic colitis is proposed.

### Impact of the gut microbiota on immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated toxicities [^114uA4YK]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

CTLA-4 inhibition leads to a more similar presentation to IBD in terms of clinical severity when compared with the gastrointestinal toxicities that may be observed with PD-1 inhibition. Colitis, which exists as diarrhea associated with abdominal pain, rectal bleeding or mucus, or with large bowel inflammation on imaging, is seen in both IBD and in patients treated with ICI.

Although ipilimumab-induced colitis and IBD may share some similar clinical features, they have distinct histopathologies. In both cases often a pattern of patchy areas of inflammation is observed in the intestinal mucosa along with a lymphocytic infiltrate. With ipilimumab-induced colitis, there is usually involvement of the descending colon. Endoscopic assessment may be normal or range from mild colitis to severe inflammatory changes including: exudates, granularity, erythema, loss of vascularity, and erosions/ulcerations. A dense, predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate may be seen with neutrophilic inflammation. Granulomas, which are associated with Crohn's disease, are not observed in ICI-mediated colitisand increased crypt apoptosis along with crypt atrophy/dropout, which may be seen in recurrent ICI colitis, is rare in IBD.

There are also differences in the serologic markers of inflammation that have been observed between patients with IBD and those with ipilimumab-induced colitis. In a study that included assessment of serologic markers typical of IBD, there were distinct features identified in ipilimumab-treated patients. The pattern of antibody positivity with the presence of both anti- Saccharomyces antibody (ASCA) and perinuclear-staining antineutrophil cytoplastic antibody (p-ANCA) was unique to ipilimumab-treated patients. ASCA or p-ANCA positivity, which is highly predictive for IBD, were found in 50% of ipilimumab-treated patients that had no gastrointestinal immune-mediated toxicities. The fluctuations in antibody titers observed in ipilimumab-treated patients differed from the stability of these titers generally observed in patients with Crohn's disease.

Comparison of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4-associated colitis has revealed similar histopathologic features including increased crypt epithelial cell apoptosis, crypt atrophy/dropout, and lymphocytic colitis. However, in contrast with anti-CTLA-4 colitis, with anti-PD-1 colitis, there are usually no features of chronic mucosal injury including neutrophilic inflammation and neutrophilic crypt abscesses.

### Update on the epidemiology and management of microscopic colitis [^114vXnfM]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Microscopic colitis is an inflammatory bowel disease that commonly presents with debilitating chronic watery diarrhea. Recent epidemiologic studies and randomized trials of therapeutics have improved the understanding of the disease. Medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, proton pump inhibitors, and antidepressants, have traditionally been considered as the main risk factors for microscopic colitis. However, recent studies have challenged this observation. Additionally, several epidemiologic studies have identified other risk factors for the disease including older age, female sex, smoking, alcohol use, immune-mediated diseases, and select gastrointestinal infections. The diagnosis of microscopic colitis requires histologic assessment of colon biopsies with findings including increased in intraepithelial lymphocytes with or without expansion of the subepithelial collagen band. The pathophysiology is poorly understood but is thought to be related to an aberrant immune response to the luminal microenvironment in genetically susceptible individuals. Antidiarrheal medications, such as loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate, may be sufficient in patients with mild symptoms. In patients with more severe symptoms, treatment with budesonide is recommended. Maintenance therapy is often necessary and several potential treatment strategies are available. Biologic and small molecule treatments seem to be effective in patients who have failed budesonide. There is an unmet need to further define the pathophysiology of microscopic colitis. Additionally, trials with novel therapies, particularly in patients with budesonide-refractory disease, are needed.

### Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis. evaluation of clinical and histological features, response to treatment, and long-term follow-up [^115Q2f7j]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Data on collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) have been based on retrospective studies of registries of patients from multiple hospitals. Such studies may induce a selection of patients with severe forms of the disease, and conclusions about the clinical spectrum of the disease and treatment efficacy are difficult to be drawn. The aim of this study was to compare the clinical features, response to treatment, and long-term follow-up of CC and LC in a large group of patients prospectively diagnosed in a single center.

Methods

A specific program was undertaken to prospectively diagnose all patients with microscopic colitis from those referred for a full colonoscopy because of recurrent or chronic diarrhea. Detailed clinical and histological features, response to treatment, and long-term follow-up were compared in patients with confirmed CC and LC.

Results

Thirty-seven patients with CC and 44 with LC were included. Patients with CC were significantly younger and had a significantly longer duration of diarrhea before diagnosis than those with LC. Otherwise, clinical presentation was similar. Drug-induced disease was suspected for ticlopidine, flutamide, gold salts, and bentazepam in LC. Complete resolution of diarrhea was achieved in all patients, spontaneously occurring in nearly 20% of them. Response to salicylates (mainly, mesalazine) was significantly better in LC than in CC (86% vs 42%, p = 0.005). Cholestyramine was highly effective in patients of both groups with concomitant bile acid malabsorption. Patients with CC required prednisone more often than those with LC (30% vs 4.5%, p = 0.005). Both prednisone and budesonide controlled ileal release were highly effective in patients with CC (82% and 89% efficacy). After cessation of diarrhea, 25% of patients with LC and 30% of those with CC relapsed after a mean follow-up of around 3 yr.

Conclusions

CC and LC share a similar clinical picture and have a benign course with long-term cessation of diarrhea in more than 70% of patients. Mesalazine and budesonide seem to be good options as first-line treatment in LC and CC, respectively. Cholestyramine may be a good alternative in patients with concomitant bile acid malabsorption.

### Cutaneous IgG4-related disease associated with lymphocytic colitis [^112s7Ruq]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cutaneous IgG4-related disease (lgG4-RD) is a rare and emerging clinical entity. It predominantly affects middle-aged and older Asian men, especially those with a history and/or exposure to hepatitis B. Lesions display an IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrate that drives the fibroinflammatory process within the dermal and subdermal components. Lesions often affect the face, neck, upper extremities, and torso, whereas the buttocks and waist each represent 1.25% of cutaneous presentations. Although elevated levels of IgG-subtype 4 in blood/serum alone may not necessarily be indicative of disease activity in internal organs, studies suggest that the presence of cutaneous IgG4-RD heralds internal organ involvement within 4 years after the skin lesions are identified. Thus, we present a rare case of cutaneous IgG4-RD in a young adult Indian American man with exclusively lower-body involvement in the setting of lymphocytic colitis (LC).

### Predominant antibody deficiency and risk of microscopic colitis: a nationwide case-control study in Sweden [^113y6WbD]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Microscopic colitis (MC) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the large intestine that includes two histologic subtypes, collagenous colitis (CC), and lymphocytic colitis (LC). Diagnosis of MC requires histologic confirmation of an inflammatory infiltrate in the colon. Criteria are partitioned by MC subtype, with LC defined by the presence of > 20 lymphocytes/100 epithelial cells and CC by an expansion of subepithelial collagen fiber (> 10 µm in diameter) with lymphocytic infiltration. MC predominantly affects older individuals accounting for up to 20% of chronic watery diarrhea. Its pathogenesis is largely unknown but is associated with HLA ancestral haplotype 8.1, pathologic T cell activation, and intestinal dysbiosis. Risk of MC is increased in those with prior gastrointestinal (GI) infection, autoimmunity, or who take certain medications. Individuals with MC have increased infection-related mortality, further demonstrating the impact of a dysregulated immune response in this disease.

Predominant antibody deficiencies (PAD) are defined by low levels or low function of circulating antibodies. Within this classification, common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is the most common symptomatic primary immunodeficiency worldwide. The prevalence of CVID is up to 1:25,000, and it most frequently affects those aged 20–40 years, with an equal sex predisposition, although earlier age of onset and more severe disease course have been reported in males as compared to females. CVID is a disorder of increased infectious risk that results from impaired and dysregulated immunity. Diagnosis requires low IgG combined with low IgA/IgM, impaired vaccine response, and the exclusion of secondary causes. While individuals with CVID typically present with recurrent or atypical infections, more than 30% demonstrate non-infectious, autoinflammatory GI manifestations.

### Cryptal lymphocytic coloproctitis: a new phenotype of lymphocytic colitis? [^112eCCia]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2002). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

Lymphocytic colitis is a clinicopathological entity characterised by protracted watery diarrhoea and an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) in the surface epithelium of the colonic mucosa. This report describes two patients with symptoms similar to those of lymphocytic colitis and an increased number of IELs, but within the cryptal epithelium.

Methods

The numbers of IELs were assessed in colorectal biopsies from the two patients. Sections were stained immunohistochemically for CD3, CD8, CD20, and TIA1.

Results

The colorectal biopsies had an abnormally high number of IELs in the epithelium of the crypts but not in the surface epithelium. The IELs in the crypts were CD3+++, CD8+, TIA1+, and CD20-.

Conclusions

The histological diagnosis in these two patients was cryptal lymphocytic coloproctitis. Patients with similar symptoms and an increased number of IELs in the surface epithelium are now filed at this department as having surface lymphocytic coloproctitis. Immunohistochemistry showed that the cryptal IELs were cytotoxic suppressor T cells. Interestingly, a case of cryptal lymphocytic colitis was recently recorded in a non-human primate dying after years of protracted chronic diarrhoea. It is possible that antigens present in the lumen of the crypts elicit a lymphocytic reaction within the cryptal cells.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^116nBEnT]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

In a series of 264 patients where 53% had bile acid diarrhoea, 44% failed to respond to cholestyramine alone. Half of these non-responders derived benefit from colesevelam (unlicensed but used with extended indication). Thus, lack of response to cholestyramine does not constitute exclusion of bile acid diarrhoea, hence therapeutic trials of bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colesevelam) are not recommended. Pooled data from 15 studies show a dose-response relationship between the severity of malabsorption and the effect of treatment with a bile acid sequestrant: clinical response to cholestyramine occurred in 96% of patients with < 5% retention of SeHCAT, 80% at < 10% retention and 70% at < 15% retention.

There are also logistic considerations for high throughput nuclear medicine departments as other concurrent studies may result in background radiation which could affect the 7-day SeHCAT retention value; individual departmental protocols should be in place to circumvent this issue.

Bile acid diarrhoea should no longer be missed given the available option to test with either SeHCAT or serum C4. Other emerging serum and urine tests may soon be available. Once diagnosed, treatment is simple and effective.

5.2 Microscopic colitis

Collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis are two forms of microscopic colitis, both commonly presenting with chronic, non-bloody watery diarrhoea and with few or no endoscopic abnormalities. They were first described around 1980. Histological features are distinct from ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease and are not reliably detected on macroscopic examination at colonoscopy. Microscopic examination shows an increased number of intraepithelial and lamina propria lymphocytes (> 20/100 cells) in both forms of microscopic colitis, together with a thickened subepithelial collagen band (> 10 µm) in collagenous colitis.

These conditions have been the subject of several recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses and data from these have been used to inform the current guidance. The clinical presentation, risk factors, pathology, disease course and response to treatment have been reviewed and compared for lymphocytic and collagenous colitis. The epidemiology and trendsand the diagnostic overlaps with IBS and functional GI disease have been reviewed. The American Gastroenterology Association has developed guidelines on the medical management of microscopic colitis.

### Microscopic colitis: an update [^1171gNGi]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Microscopic colitis (MC) causes chronic diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea, and weight loss. Colonic mucosa appears normal on endoscopy; however, biopsies show abnormalities such as intraepithelial lymphocytosis in lymphocytic colitis, and a thickened subepithelial collagen band in collagenous colitis. Epidemiologic data demonstrates that MC is a more common cause of diarrhea than previously shown. Although the etiology of this condition is unclear, certain well-defined risk factors exist. Recently there has been more research on the pathophysiology of MC, and studies on treatment have demonstrated budesonide to be most effective, although other treatments also hold promise.

### Seasonal pattern of onset in lymphocytic colitis [^111wKLUe]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The etiology of lymphocytic colitis, a microscopic colitis syndrome, has remained elusive. Because 1) many infectious enteritides exhibit seasonal variability in incidence and 2) a few investigators have proposed some infectious mechanism in lymphocytic colitis, our aim was to determine if any variability in symptom onset existed among lymphocytic colitis patients diagnosed at our institution.

Study

We identified 71 nonduplicated, consecutive patients with lymphocytic colitis over a 4-year period using rigorous clinicopathologic inclusion criteria: 1) chronic watery diarrhea, 2) endoscopically normal colon, 3) no evidence for celiac sprue or drug-induced colitis, 4) diffuse colitis with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes of at least 10 lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells, 5) evidence of surface epithelial damage, and 6) no significant neutrophilic infiltrates, architectural distortion of the mucosa, or subepithelial collagen deposits. The date of diagnosis was corrected for month of onset of symptoms.

Results

The distribution of month of onset of symptoms showed a statistically significant (chi test of homogeneity, P = 0.0008) temporal variability and seasonal incidence pattern with excess cases during summer and fall and a paucity of cases during colder months.

Conclusions

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine systematically and report a significant seasonal incidence pattern of lymphocytic colitis. Our observations may support a potential link to an infectious source in lymphocytic colitis.

### Undiagnosed microscopic colitis: a hidden cause of chronic diarrhoea and a frequently missed treatment opportunity [^114tQJXE]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

MC diagnosis requires histological examination of colonic biopsies

Histological assessment of MC needs to be based on stepped biopsies of the colon, with a minimum of two biopsies taken from each of the ascending, transverse and descending/sigmoid colon in separate specimen containers. MC occurs in two histologically distinct forms: collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC). In both CC and LC, inflammation in the lamina propria is present throughout the entire colon. The key histological feature distinguishing CC is the presence of a broad subepithelial collagen band, > 10 µm in thickness, immediately underneath the surface epithelium. The key histological feature that distinguishes LC is an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL), with > 20 IELs per 100 epithelial cells generally considered diagnostic. Another MC group may also exist, referred to variably in the literature as MC not otherwise specified, paucicellular LCor, most recently, MC incomplete (MCi). In patients with MCi, the collagen layer (> 5 µm) or number of IELs (> 5 per 100 epithelial cells) is abnormal, but below the threshold for CC or LC, though there is still inflammation in the lamina propria.

Patients with CC, LC and MCi cannot be distinguished from each other based on their demographic features, clinical characteristics or symptom presentation. Treatment guidelines do not distinguish between CC and LC, because differences in treatment outcomes have not been observed between these subgroups. In addition, uncontrolled data from a retrospective analysis indicate that MCi has a similar response to treatment compared with CC and LC. Interestingly, in patients with CC, the degree of lamina propria inflammation has been found to be a significant predictor of the degree of symptom response, leading to speculation that this feature may be of more diagnostic value than the criteria used to distinguish CC, LC and MCi. It is important to note that patients with MCi currently do not receive a diagnosis of MC. If randomised, controlled data can confirm that the response of MCi to treatment is similar to CC and LC, then it seems clear that patients with MCi should be classified as MC and treated accordingly. This would also simplify diagnosis, because pathologists have more trouble consistently discriminating MCi from CC and LC than they do discriminating between MC/MCi and non-MC.

### Cancer risk in microscopic colitis: a retrospective cohort study [^114RLuvo]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic, inflammatory colitis that commonly presents as watery diarrhea and is a source of morbidity, particularly in older individuals. The incidence of MC has been reported to be between 1 and 24 per 100,000 person-years in North America and Europe from population-based studies. It comprises two subtypes, collagenous colitis (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC) that share many clinical and epidemiological characteristics including female predominance and a normal colonoscopic mucosal appearance. However, they are distinguished by their characteristic histologic features; an increase in intra-epithelial lymphocytosis (> 20/100 epithelial cells) in LC and a thickened sub-epithelial collagen band (> 10 μm) in CC. Both conditions may be associated with a mixed infiltrate of acute and chronic inflammatory cells in the lamina propria.

Traditionally considered relapsing but non-progressive diseases, the long-term natural history of MC is not well defined. Simple anti-diarrheal therapy with anti-motility agents are considered equally a first line for treatment of MC as inflammation directed therapies such as budesonide and systemic steroids. As a recognition of its non-progressive nature, resolution of histologic inflammation is not necessary or aimed for as a therapeutic target. It is well established that for various chronic inflammatory diseases involving the gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary tracts including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD; Crohn's disease (CD), ulcerative colitis (UC), celiac disease, or primary sclerosing cholangitis, there is an increase in risk of cancer in the target organ that may be independently associated with persistent histologic activity. In addition, such inflammatory diseases have also been associated with an increased risk of various extra-intestinal malignancies, the mechanisms of which have not been robustly defined. Whether persistent chronic inflammation in microscopic colitis is associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasms (CRN) including cancer (CRC) has not been well established. The few studies that have examined this have been limited by small cohort size, short duration of follow-up, and lack of adjustment for severity of MC. Additionally, whether there is an increase in risk of extraintestinal cancers in MC has not been previously established.

The aims of our study were as follows: (1) to examine the life-time risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in patients with MC when compared to the general population in the United States (US) or to similar patients undergoing colonoscopic screening; and (2) to define if there is an increase in life-time risk of extracolonic cancers in patients with MC.

### Microscopic colitis [^1138E9xS]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2021). High credibility.

Microscopic colitis (MC) is an inflammatory disease of the large intestine associated with urgent watery diarrhoea. MC may occur in people of all ages, although the disease primarily affects older women. Once believed to be rare, MC is now known to be a common cause of chronic watery diarrhoea in high-income countries, affecting 1 in 115 women and 1 in 286 men during their lifetime in Swedish population-based estimates. An inappropriate immune response to disturbances in the gut microenvironment is implicated in the pathogenesis of MC. Evidence also supports an underlying genetic basis for disease. The diagnosis of MC relies on clinical symptoms and microscopic assessment of colonic biopsy samples. MC is categorized histologically into collagenous colitis, lymphocytic colitis and their incomplete forms. The mainstay of treatment includes the use of budesonide, with or without adjunctive therapies, and withdrawal of offending drugs. Emerging studies suggest a role for biologicals and immunosuppressive therapies for the management of budesonide-refractory or budesonide-dependent disease. MC can have a substantial negative effect on patient quality of life. The outlook for MC includes a better understanding of the immune response, genetics and the microbiome in disease pathogenesis along with progress in disease management through robust clinical trials.

### The colitis may be microscopic, but the diarrhea is not: update on the treatment of microscopic colitis and immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis [^111wmqnu]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Microscopic colitis is an inflammatory disease of the colon that presents as watery diarrhea with minimal to normal endoscopic changes on colonoscopy. It encompasses two common subtypes, lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis, which are both treated similarly. Immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis is among the most common immune-related adverse events. Endoscopic and histological findings range from normal colonic mucosa to inflammatory bowel like changes. This review article provides update in treatment and management of microscopic colitis and immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis (ICPi colitis).

Recent Findings

Recent studies on microscopic colitis have focused on the successful use of immunomodulators such as biologics for treatment of budesonide refractory microscopic colitis cases. Microscopic colitis does not confer an added risk for colorectal cancer. With the increasing usage of immunotherapy agents, immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis is becoming more common. ICPi colitis can be successfully managed with steroids, with treatment stepped up to biologics for moderate to severe cases or for mild cases that do not respond to steroids. Immunotherapy agents can be carefully re-introduced in mild cases, after treatment of ICPi colitis.

Summary

Biologics can be used to treat budesonide refractory microscopic colitis. ICPi colitis can be managed with steroids and biologics in moderate to severe cases.

### Increased colonic levels of CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated mediators in patients with microscopic colitis [^112i9Tvh]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Microscopic colitis (MC) is an inflammatory bowel condition with symptoms including watery, non-bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Microscopic colitis is divided into 2 subtypes: lymphocytic colitis (LC) and collagenous colitis (CC). Microscopic colitis is most prominent in older females and one study reports an incidence of 14.2 cases per 100 000 person-years. The pathogenesis of MC is not yet fully known but, in genetically predisposed individuals, a dysregulated immune response may be invoked following exposure to certain components in the intestinal lumen. Endoscopic findings in patients with MC are macroscopically mostly normal, but histologic examination of colonic biopsies reveals abnormalities such as a thickened subepithelial collagen layer (> 10 μm) in patients with CC and increased numbers of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs; > 20 per 100 epithelial cells) in patients with LC. A diagnosis of incomplete MC (MCi) is sometimes made if patients show typical signs of MC but fail to completely meet the diagnostic criteria.

Chronic colonic inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD), both forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer (CRC), yet patients with MC paradoxically do not have an increased risk of developing CRCand, for unknown reasons, instead display a decreased risk compared to matched reference individuals. However, some studies have found an increase in lymphomaand lung cancer, in patients with MC, indicating that local factors affect the decreased risk of CRC. One protective mechanism against tumor development is the detection and elimination of malignantly transformed cells, a process called immune surveillance in which CD8 + T cells participate. We have previously demonstrated higher proportions of CD8 + IELs in LC patients compared to controls, CC, and UC patients. Furthermore, we found decreased numbers of CD4 + IELs in CC patients compared to controls and, in the lamina propria, CD4 + lymphocytes were decreased in LC and CC compared to controls. In contrast, in IBD, the differences in T cell subsets in comparison to controls were decreases in CD8 + and increases in CD4 + T cells. Another positive contributor to immune surveillance may be the augmented numbers of IELs observed in MC. If patients with MC possess enhanced capabilities to utilize this process, it may partially explain their decreased risk of CRC.

### Recent advances in diagnosis and treatment of microscopic colitis [^114QmQ3A]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Diagnosis

The diagnosis of MC relies solely on findings of typical microscopic changes in colonic mucosal biopsies. In CC a thickening of the subepithelial collagen layer is seen, together with a chronic mononuclear inflammation in the lamina propria, and epithelial cell damage with occasionally increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (Fig. 2). The thickened subepithelial collagen layer in CC is ≥ 10µm on well-orientated sections, in contrast to a normal basal membrane of < 3µm. The thickening of the collagen layer may be variable and is most prominent in the ascending or transverse colon, and may be absent in biopsies from the sigmoid colon or rectum, emphasizing the importance of obtaining biopsies from the proximal colon when diagnosing CC. Generally, the histopathologic changes are restricted to the large bowel, but a thickened collagen layer has infrequently been found in the stomach, duodenum, or terminal ileum. In addition to conventional histological staining, the use of tenascin immunostaining has been suggested in uncertain cases of CC (Fig. 3).

Figure 2
Biopsy from colon showing (A, B) typical findings of collagenous colitis - increased subepithelial collagen layer, inflammation of lamina propria, and epithelial cell damage with intraepithelial lymphocytes; (C) typical findings of lymphocytic colitis - epithelial cell damage with intraepithelial lymphocytes, inflammation in the lamina propria but no increased collagen layer

Figure 3
Tenascin immunostaining in collagenous colitis

The diagnostic features of LC (Fig. 2) are an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (≥ 20/100 surface epithelial cells) in conjunction with surface epithelial cell damage and an infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria, but the collagen layer is normal, in contrast to CC. In uncertain cases, immunostaining of CD3+ T-lymphocytes facilitates the assessment of intraepithelial lymphocyte count (Fig. 4).

### Interventions for treating lymphocytic colitis [^117BU933]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Lymphocytic colitis is a cause of chronic diarrhea. Therapy is based mainly on case series and uncontrolled trials, or by extrapolation of data for treating collagenous colitis, a related disorder. This review was performed to identify therapies for lymphocytic colitis that have been proven in randomized controlled trials.

Objectives

To determine effective treatments for patients with clinically active lymphocytic colitis.

Search Strategy

The MEDLINE, PUBMED and EMBASE databases were searched using the search criteria "microscopic colitis" or "lymphocytic colitis" and "treatment" or "therapy" or "management" to identify relevant papers published between 1970 and December 2007. Manual searches from the references of identified papers and relevant review papers were performed. Abstracts from major gastroenterological meetings were searched to identify research submitted in abstract form only. The trial registry website www. ClinicalTrials.gov was searched to identify registered but unpublished trials. Finally, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Functional Bowel Disorders Group Specialized Trials Register were searched for other studies.

Selection Criteria

Five randomized controlled trials were identified. Three of these studies, which assessed bismuth subsalicylate vs. placebo, budesonide vs. placebo, and mesalazine vs. mesalazine vs. cholestyramine in treating active disease, are included in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Data were extracted independently by each author onto 2x2 tables (treatment versus placebo or active comparator and response versus no response). For therapies assessed in one trial only, P values were derived using the chi-square test.

Main Results

Forty-one patients were enrolled in the trial studying budesonide (9 mg/day for 6 weeks versus placebo). Budesonide was more effective than placebo at inducing both clinical (P = 0.004; NNT = 3) and histological responses (P = 0.04; NNT = 3). Forty-one patients were enrolled in the study assessing mesalazine versus mesalazine plus cholestyramine. A high proportion of patients in each group responded to treatment. However, no statistically significant difference in clinical response was found between the two treatment groups (P = 0.95). Five patients were enrolled in the trial studying bismuth subsalicylate (nine 262 mg tablets daily for 8 weeks vs. placebo). There were no differences in clinical (P = 0.10) or histological responses (P = 0.71) in patients treated with bismuth subsalicylate compared with placebo.

Authors' Conclusions

A single trial studying budesonide suggests that it may be effective for the treatment of active lymphocytic colitis. An ongoing placebo-controlled trial may confirm the benefit of budesonide. There is weaker evidence that mesalazine with or without cholestyramine may be effective for the treatment of lymphocytic colitis, but this benefit needs to be confirmed in a placebo-controlled study. No conclusions can be made regarding bismuth subsalicylate. These agents require further study before they can be recommended as treatment options for lymphocytic colitis. Further trials studying interventions for lymphocytic colitis are warranted.

### Cutaneous IgG4-related disease associated with lymphocytic colitis [^114u5Axt]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case highlights an unusual presentation of cutaneous IgG4-RD due to the patient's young age, lack of head and neck involvement, and concurrent LC. LC is an inflammatory disease of the colon and a common cause of chronic watery diarrhea with weight loss. The pathophysiology of IgG4-RD and LC is yet to be elucidated. However, genetic predisposition, environmental triggers, and infections are thought to prompt aberrant immune pathways to perpetuate disease in both. Exposure to hepatitis B > C > A is a well-established risk factor for IgG4-RD. In our case, hepatitis serologies were negative. His uncontrolled diabetes mellitus 1 is also a well-established risk factor for LC. Given that his LC preceded his cutaneous IgG4-RD, it is possible that it prompted aberrant immune dysregulation leading to cutaneous IgG4-RD. Cutaneous IgG4-RD should be considered in Asian patients with a persistent pruritic papular eruption, especially in the presence of certain clinical features, such as older age, male sex, presence of other autoimmune conditions, and history of hepatitis.

Although inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn, Ulcerative Colitis) at times presents with cutaneous manifestations, such as erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum, these are predominantly neutrophilic dermatoses, which differ from the lymphocytic infiltrate observed in our patient's skin and colon biopsy samples. Similarly, case reports have associated other forms of microscopic colitis, such as the collagenous subtype, with neutrophil-predominant dermatoses. However, to our knowledge, LC is yet to be associated with cutaneous manifestations to date. In our patient, cutaneous IgG4-RD appeared to worsen during periods of colitis activity, which suggests that his intestinal and cutaneous manifestations may be related, to a phenomenon previously observed in collagenous colitis. We also observed that cutaneous and intestinal, symptoms resolved after steroid therapy, further suggesting an association between the skin and intestinal processes in our patient.

Overall, our case report highlights the role of dermatologists in recognizing cutaneous IgG4-RD as part of the differential diagnosis of pruritic papules. Prompt management can prevent the detrimental consequences of irreversible end-organ fibrosis, especially if systemic involvement is present. Further studies are needed to characterize the potential cutaneous manifestations of LC.

### The natural history of histological changes in microscopic colitis [^115cKwLG]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the colon, causing watery diarrhea. Endoscopic findings are minimal or essentially normal making it a disease entity that relies on histopathology for its diagnosis. Based on the histological findings, MC is subdivided into two subtypes, namely lymphocytic colitis (LC), characterized by > 20 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 surface epithelial cells, and collagenous colitis (CC), with a thickened subepithelial collagen band (> 7 µm) in addition to intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltrates. Since its first description in 1985, the prevalence of MC has been increasing. Population-based studies from Olmsted County, Minnesota, showed that the incidence of MC increased from 1985 to 2001 but stabilized from 2002 to 2019 with an overall increased prevalence in the most recent time period. –

The precise pathophysiology of MC is unknown, and treatment for the disease includes avoidance of risk factors and use of antidiarrheals or other treatments. Akin to other diseases such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease, the natural histological progression of the disease is yet to be explored. Understanding the histological evolution of the subtypes of MC could potentially aid in guiding the management of the disease and in determining the endpoints of treatment. This change includes changing from one MC subtype to another and resolution of histological abnormalities. In addition, the relationship between treatment and these histological changes also needs to be established.

Given the paucity of data on this topic, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine the natural histological evolution of MC and its subtypes, along with understanding the association of treatment with these histological changes.

Context

A variety of inflammatory disorders may affect the colon, with widely differing clinical outcomes and management. These conditions encompass a spectrum of acute and chronic conditions.

Objective

Review the pathology of the major colitides and highlight the most diagnostically useful features.

Data Sources

Review of recent literature supplemented with personal experience in the field of gastrointestinal pathology.

Conclusions

The etiologies associated with the various types of colitis are diverse and the range of histologic changes is somewhat limited. Nevertheless, the combination of clinical and endoscopic data coupled with histopathology allows for accurate classification in the majority of cases.

### Microscopic colitis – a common cause of diarrhoea in older adults [^113aUqBF]. Age and Ageing (2010). Low credibility.

Diarrhoeal diseases are common in older populations and often markedly affect their quality of life. Although there are numerous potential causes, microscopic colitis (MC) is increasingly recognised as a major diagnostic entity in older individuals. MC is comprised of two distinct histological forms - collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis, both of which frequently occur in older populations. Recent studies suggest that between 10 and 30% of older patients investigated for chronic diarrhoea with an endoscopically normal appearing colon will have MC. It is unclear why MC is more common in older populations, but it is associated with both autoimmune disorders and several drugs that are commonly used by seniors. A definitive diagnosis can only be made with colonic biopsies. Since MC was first described in 1976 and only recently recognised as a common cause of diarrhoea, many practising physicians may not be aware of this entity. In this review, we outline the epidemiology, risk factors associated with MC, its pathophysiology, the approach to diagnosis and the management of these individuals.

### Pathology of immune-mediated tissue lesions following treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors [^112ww7rq]. Rheumatology (2019). Medium credibility.

A microscopic colitis-like pattern of disease is being increasingly described. Classical microscopic colitis encompasses lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis, both of which exhibit a normal endoscopic appearance and are differentiated by histology. There is some evidence that compared with classical microscopic colitis, CPI-microscopic colitis induces a more aggressive disease course requiring more intensive immunosuppression and a greater need for hospitalization.

Additional findings in the upper GI tract include lymphocytic gastritis (> 30 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells). In the duodenum, as well as chronic inflammation with a neutrophil, lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrate, villus blunting and atrophy have also been described.

It is worth highlighting that insights into pathology of lesions mainly stem from mucosal biopsies. Because colectomy is a rare event, data examining pathology across the colonic walls is sparse. In one case of anti-PD-1 perforating colitis, multiple ulcerations, transmural inflammation and necrosis were described. In four colectomy specimens from patients with anti-CTLA-4 enterocolitis, all showed extensive acute severe colitis with abrupt transition between ulcerations and normal mucosae.

There are only a few studies that have characterized histological and immunological features in parallel, but predictably an abundance of CD3 + T cells (and not B cells) are commonly reported. In one study of nine ipilimumab-treated patients with CPI enterocolitis, colonic mucosal expression of the major T helper-1 (Th-1) and Th-17 pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-17A, were significantly upregulated (> 10-fold and > 5-fold, respectively). IL-17 has a critical role in regulating colonic neutrophil recruitment, which may account for the neutrophilic infiltrate frequently seen in this disease. Patients with CPI-enterocolitis also have increased levels of IL-17A in blood suggesting the IL-17 axis, like in IBD, may be a key driver of inflammation.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis and hepatitis: expert review [^111PM54b]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Checkpoint inhibitor hepatitis — incidence, pathology, and monitoring: Abnormal liver enzymes are less commonly observed with ICI therapy than enterocolitis, with an incidence of < 5% in clinical trials of ICI monotherapy, but the incidence rises with combination treatments, with approximately one-quarter of patients on ipilimumab and nivolumab combination therapy developing hepatitis and hepatitis also more common with chemotherapy or targeted therapy combinations. The majority of ICI hepatitis cases are associated with either a lymphocytic or granulomatous pattern of hepatocellular injury, and plasma cell infiltration commonly observed in autoimmune hepatitis appears to be less common in ICI hepatitis. Routine monitoring of liver blood tests (ie, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, and ALT) is standard of care for patients treated with immunotherapy, generally at the time of ICI initiation and each treatment cycle, and patients should have pre-treatment testing for hepatitis B virus infection with measurement of surface antigen, surface antibody, and core antibody. Hepatitis is often detected incidentally in asymptomatic patients through routine liver testing, but can present with jaundice, fevers, and malaise; many patients are managed by oncology teams according to CTCAE-based management guidelines that use ALT/AST thresholds to direct diagnostic testing and treatment recommendations.

### Clinical characteristics of colitis induced by taxane-based chemotherapy [^116X1zcR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Endoscopic and histologic features

Patients' endoscopy reports were reviewed. A spectrum of endoscopic findings of colitis was described, from the presence of mucosal ulcerations, to nonulcerative inflammation (erythema, exudate, loss of vascular pattern, edema, erosions), or a normal appearance (Fig. 2). The distribution of colitis was classified as left colon only, right colon only, both left and right colon, or ileum. We used extensive colitis to describe inflammation in more than 1 segment of colon. The pattern of inflammation was categorized as diffuse, patchy or segmental. Pathology reports for each colonoscopy were reviewed as well. Inflammation patterns were categorized as active, chronic or lymphocytic (Fig. 3). Features of active inflammation included neutrophilic or eosinophilic infiltrate, cryptitis and crypt abscess. Features of chronicity were basal lymphocytic infiltrate, cryptic architecture distortion, apoptosis and Paneth cell metaplasia. Lymphocytic colitis was reported separately as showing the classical histological features of increased intraepithelial lymphocyte infiltration.

Treatment and outcomes of toxic GI effects

For all patients who received taxane therapy and developed colitis, we noted whether or not they received treatment for their colitis symptoms. If patients received colitis treatment, the type and duration of such treatment, including start and end dates, were recorded. The antibiotic treatment recorded in our cohort was exclusively for empirical purpose, as we excluded patients with a confirmed GI infection. The outcomes of colitis were defined as duration of colitis symptoms, requirement of hospitalization or intensive care unit (ICU) admission, duration of hospitalization, and recurrence of GI symptoms. Complications of colitis, such as colonic perforations, were also noted. Colitis resolution was defined as the return of clinical symptoms to baseline clinical presentation before the colitis event.

### Collagenous colitis in patients treated for cancer: role of immune checkpoint inhibitors. clinical, histological and immunological features in 15 cases [^113KZsiR]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Collagenous colitis is a form of microscopic colitis characterized by chronic watery, non‐bloody diarrhoea and absence of significant mucosal alterations at endoscopy contrasting with suggestive histopathological features at biopsy, including a sub‐epithelial band of thickened extracellular matrix and an expansion of the immune compartment in the lamina propria. These histopathological features distinguish collagenous colitis from lymphocytic colitis, the other form of microscopic colitis, characterized by an increase in intra‐epithelial lymphocytes and the absence of a sub‐epithelial collagenous band. Collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis are independent, but related diseases, which may coexist in the same patient, either as mixed lesions or at different times.

The aetiology and pathogenesis of collagenous colitis remain poorly understood. It is usually assumed that collagenous colitis is an immune‐mediated disorder triggered by various stimuli in a predisposed patient, but the mechanisms responsible for the characteristic histopathological lesions are still unclear. Various drugs have been associated with an increased risk of collagenous colitis, especially non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs and proton pump inhibitors, but also serotonin reuptake inhibitors, levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitors, statins and anti‐hypertensive drugs. Recently, the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) used in various types of cancer have been added to this list. Two main types of ICI are currently used in oncology: anti‐CTLA4 antibodies (such as ipilimumab and tremelimumab) and anti‐PD1/PD‐L1 antibodies (including the anti‐PD1 nivolumab and pembrolizumab and the anti‐PD‐L1 atezolimumab and durvalumab). ICI‐based immunotherapy has proven its efficacy and is gaining large indications in oncology. However, it also induces numerous side effects, among which gastrointestinal adverse events are particularly frequent. Various types of colitis have been described, including acute colitis, chronic active colitis mimicking inflammatory bowel disease and microscopic colitis, including both lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis.

Figure 4
Immunostaining of CD3+ T-lymphocytes in lymphocytic colitis

Barium enema and colonoscopy are usually normal, although subtle mucosal changes can be seen, such as edema, erythema, and abnormal vascular pattern. Tears of colonic mucosa have occasionally been seen during colonoscopy, which might be a sign of increased risk of colonic perforation during the procedure. In the future, the use of confocal laser microscopy may enable in vivo diagnosis of MC.

Laboratory tests are non-diagnostic and only non-specific abnormalities, such as moderately elevated C-reactive protein, ESR, or mild anemia are found. Stool tests generally reveal no pathological microorganisms. The diagnostic accuracy of fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin is low. In a small pilot study, fecal eosinophil markers such as eosinophil cationic protein (F-ECP) and eosinophil protein X (F-EPX) were positive in 92% and 67%, respectively, of 12 patients with active CC, and a rapid fall of both markers was seen after budesonide treatment.

"Atypical" microscopic colitis

In addition to CC and LC, other rare subtypes of MC have been described, including microscopic colitis with giant cells, paucicellular lymphocytic colitis, cryptal lymphocytic colitis, pseudomembranous collagenous colitis, microscopic colitis with granulomatous inflammation, and microscopic colitis not otherwise specified. The clinical features of these conditions are similar to classical MC, but histopathologic appearance differs. Further studies are required to address the relationship and clinical significance of these "atypical" types of MC.

### Clinical features and treatment responses in pediatric lymphocytic and collagenous colitis [^1177VikQ]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Microscopic colitis (MC) is prevalent in adults investigated for chronic watery diarrhea, yet characterization of pediatric MC is limited.

Methods

Our pathology database was searched from 1995 to 2011 for pediatric cases of lymphocytic colitis (LC) or collagenous colitis (CC). Those with diarrhea persisting for > 2 weeks and visually normal colonoscopy were accepted as cases. Demographics, laboratory results, medication use within 3 months of presentation, medical and family history of autoimmune disease, and response to treatment were abstracted.

Results

A total of 27 cases were histologically consistent with MC on biopsy; 5 with concomitant enteric infection or isolated abdominal pain were excluded. Twenty-two cases of MC (female patients, 59%; median age at diagnosis, 15.3 years) were included (19 LC and 3 CC). Two had type 1 diabetes mellitus, 2 were anti-nuclear antibody positive, and 2 had common variable immunodeficiency. Of 20 patients who underwent an esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 1 had collagenous sprue and 4 had celiac disease. One presented after the clearance of recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. Previous drug exposures included nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n = 7), proton pump inhibitors (n = 6), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (n = 3). Common symptoms in addition to diarrhea included abdominal pain (77.3%) and weight loss (27.3%). Of 17 patients with follow-up, all of the 8 treated with steroids had some response: 57.1% (4/7) responded to mesalamine and 42.9% (3/7) responded to bismuth subsalicylate.

Conclusions

In this cohort of pediatric patients, LC was much more common than CC. As described in adults, we observed associations with celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and medications; we additionally saw an association with immunodeficiency. Our patients showed greater response to steroids than mesalamine or bismuth.

### Clinicopathological characteristics and management of colitis with anti-PD1 immunotherapy alone or in combination with ipilimumab [^112JSPTM]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Thirteen patients (13/64, 21%) in our cohort had an endoscopically 'normal' colon despite clinical symptoms of colitis. Of note, in the infliximab-refractory group, 22% had no visible area of involvement of colon despite higher grade colitis (grade 3–4, 92%) similar to other case series. Further invasive investigations may be considered in this subgroup of patients to rule out other pathology such as enteritis. Therefore, caution should be taken when interpreting 'normal' endoscopic findings that reinforce the importance of clinical severity of symptoms at presentation for evaluation and optimization of therapy. Histopathological characterization of immune-mediated colitis still largely based on features described in the inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) spectrum. Interestingly the majority of immune-mediated colitis cases showed no chronic architectural changes in the crypts, a key diagnostic feature of IBD. A few case series have described a pattern of acute and chronic inflammatory changes on histopathology with significant overlap induced by Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) similar to microscopic colitis. The pattern of acute, chronic lymphocytic, or chronic inflammation has a significant overlap between patients and does not seem to correlate with the type of ICI used. The most common finding is an increased chronic inflammatory infiltrate (86% of cases). We noted significantly increased neutrophilic infiltration in lamina propria and neutrophilic crypt abscess in steroid-refractory cases that may be used as a marker of severity in conjunction with endoscopic and clinical findings for an earlier switch to infliximab treatment. An influx of acute inflammatory cells such as neutrophils is regarded as a key marker of disease activity in IBD. An ongoing area of major research is to investigate whether immune colitis represents/shares similar pathogenesis to IBD, wherein active inflammation is postulated to be due to loss of tolerance to gut microbiota due to the reduction of regulatory T cell activity. Translational research delineating the detailed make-up of inflammatory infiltrates in this setting is required.

### Collagenous colitis in patients treated for cancer: role of immune checkpoint inhibitors. clinical, histological and immunological features in 15 cases [^114jVHv2]. Histopathology (2025). Medium credibility.

The cases of ICI‐associated collagenous colitis collected in our series presented all the key diagnostic features of the disease. Clinically, chronic watery diarrhoea was constantly present, while of various grades, from mild to severe; other symptoms were rare and severe complications were not observed. All patients required treatment, usually with corticosteroids, including budesonide, prednisone or prednisolone; no second‐line treatment was required. Histologically, the typical lesions, including the sub‐epithelial thickening of the extracellular matrix and the expansion of the immune compartment in the lamina propria consisting mainly of lymphocytes associated with plasma cells, were present. In five cases, the sub‐epithelial collagenous band was only discontinuous. Interestingly, focal or segmental sub‐epithelial thickening of the extracellular matrix has been frequently noted in some series of ICI‐associated colitis, even in cases resembling other types of inflammatory bowel disease. We observed a certain degree of heterogeneity in the composition and distribution of the immune infiltrates. Intra‐epithelial lymphocytosis was present in three cases, suggesting a mixed form of microscopic colitis: indeed, pure lymphocytic colitis was diagnosed in the previous biopsies of one of these patients. Macrophages were present in variable numbers, usually within the sub‐epithelial compartment. Eosinophils and mast cells were inconstantly present, but could be observed in significant numbers. Immunologically, the landscape was variable. Most cases were rich in CD8+ T‐lymphocytes and poor in CD20+ B‐lymphocytes, as expected in collagenous colitis, but also as described in anti‐PD1/PD‐L1‐related colitis. However, CD4+ T‐lymphocytes predominated in two cases of ICI‐associated collagenous colitis. PD1 was expressed only by rare lymphocytes scattered in the lamina propria; PD‐L1 was detected on immune cells, mainly macrophages, in the lamina propria and also on some epithelial cells. As previously reported in conventional collagenous colitis, we could not find any correlation between clinical features and histopathological or immunological characteristics.

### Granulomatous colitis in a patient with metastatic melanoma under immunotherapy: a case report and literature review [^112G6DoC]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

ICPIs have transformed the therapeutic strategy for many malignancies and physicians have to face various aspects of their widespread oncological implication in everyday clinical practice. Among them, ir-toxicity is of major importance since it requires immediate recognition and treatment. In case of ir-colitis, endoscopy with biopsy collection is the initial fundamental step in the diagnostic work-up followed by a careful histological evaluation.

Histological features of anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1-induced colitis overlap significantly. According to a recent review four distinct histological patterns can be attributed to ipilimumab-induced colitis: active colitis, active colitis with prominent epithelial apoptosis, chronic active colitis mimicking idiopathic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and lymphocytic colitis. Lamina propria infiltration by lymphocytes, plasma cells and a varying number of neutrophils and eosinophils is constantly present. Cryptitis and crypt micro-abscesses are also common findings. Increased epithelial apoptotic bodies at the base of the crypts is characteristic feature of the "active colitis with prominent epithelial apoptosis". An IBD-like pattern with signs of chronicity such as basal plasmacytosis, significant crypt architectural distortion and Paneth cell metaplasia in the distal colon seems to evolve if ipilimumab-colitis is left untreated, immunosuppressive treatment proves to be ineffective or after recurrent episodes of colitis. A histological subtype mimicking lymphocytic colitis with increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, surface epithelial injury and minimal neutrophilic infiltration has also been described. In a previous study from our department ipilimumab-related inflammation always involved the sigmoid colon showing pathologic features mostly resembling to IBD. Anti-PD1-associated colitis usually appears as active colitis showing cryptitis and neutrophilic crypt abscesses accompanied by increased apoptosis and crypt atrophy/dropout. Another histological pattern is "lymphocytic colitis" similar to the one observed in ipilimumab-related injury, while recurrent anti-PD1 colitis can result in IBD-like chronic active colitis. Few cases of ICPIs-induced collagenous colitis have also been reported. Concerning lymphocytic subsets, T cell population prevails in ICPIs-associated colitis. CD8 + T-cells predominate in the lamina propria and epithelium of anti-PD1 related colitis, whereas CD4 + T-cells are more numerous in anti-CTLA4-induced colitis. Our case does not fulfill the histological features of the above-mentioned colitis subtypes and seems to represent a distinctive colitis pattern determined by intracryptal granulomas.

### Unusual case of immune-related colitis [^114293DW]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

The cancer immunotherapy field has had many promising developments in recent years. Checkpoint inhibitors are good examples of that. This new class of medications comes with a new constellation of side effects that require early recognition and management. Here we present a patient with metastatic adenocarcinoma on pembrolizumab who was admitted to the hospital for colitis. This was found to be an immune-related adverse event from pembrolizumab. We discuss our work-up and approach to the diagnosis, then highlight important treatment pearls for internal medicine physicians who are increasingly taking care of such patients.

### Collagenous colitis with mucosal ulcerations in a patient without nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or lansoprazole use [^111hoURr]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Chronic diarrhea is defined as at least three loose stools a day of at least four weeks duration. Roughly 4–5% of the Western population reports chronic watery diarrhea, with microscopic colitis (MC) accounting for 10–20%. Chronic watery diarrhea combined with normal-appearing colonic mucosa at endoscopy with abnormal histopathology is classified as MC. MC encompasses both collagenous (CC) and lymphocytic colitis (LC). CC typically presents in the 5 th -8 th decade with a female predominance and is characterized by a thick sub-epithelial collagen band (> 10 μm) in the basal membrane. Patients with CC do not typically present with colonic mucosal ulcerations, but, instead, historically present with few or no endoscopic findings. We report a rare case of CC accompanied by mucosal ulcerations in the absence of known culprits of mucosal ulcerations, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or lansoprazole (LPZ) use.

### The disease course in microscopic colitis may be influenced by hormonal factors [^115U87cu]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Microscopic colitis (MC) is a chronic, inflammatory bowel disease with watery, non-bloody diarrhea predominantly affecting elderly women. Since the diagnosis is based on typical histological alterations the term MC is logical. It is divided into collagenous colitis (CC) presenting with a thickened subepithelial collagen band and lymphocytic colitis (LC) which is characterized by an increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes. The pathogenesis is obscure, but MC is generally considered to be an immune mediated disease. Especially in the subtype collagenous colitis an association with HLA DQ2 has been found. A barrier dysfunction, as well as an increased number of intraepithelial T lymphocytes in combination with a prompt response after treatment with local steroids also indicate that the disease is immune driven. However, the criteria for classical autoimmunity are not fulfilled, e.g. auto-antibodies have not yet been identified.

Among risk factors smoking, female gender and age are established. High alcohol intake, GI infections and medication (NSAIDs, PPIs or SSRIs) are associated with enhanced risk for disease.

Hormonal changes affect immune function and the disease onset and course of immune driven diseases. Pregnancy influences mucosal barrier function and induces immune tolerance based on hormonal alterations, illustrating the impact of hormonal modifications in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Female sex hormones, especially estrogen, are associated with many autoimmune and immune driven diseases, and especially SLE has been studied extensively in this respect. When it comes to IBD, previous studies have shown an association between the use of oral contraceptives and enhanced risk of Crohn's disease (CD), and the use of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and increased risk of UC. These associations are thought to be mediated by alterations in permeability, a shift in the T helper cell subsets balance and changes in the gut microbiota.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced diarrhea and colitis: an overview [^117UJJyT]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as an integral component of the management of various cancers and have contributed to significant improvements in overall survival. Most available ICIs target anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (anti-CTLA4), and anti-programmed cell death 1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (anti-PD1/PDL1). Gastrointestinal immune-related adverse events remain a common complication of ICIs. The predominant manifestations include diarrhea and colitis, which often manifest concurrently as immune-mediated diarrhea and colitis (IMDC). Risk factors for developing these side effects include baseline gut microbiota, preexisting autoimmune disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease, and type of neoplasm. The hallmark symptom of colitis is diarrhea which may be accompanied by mucus or blood in stools. Patients may also experience abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and nausea. If not treated rapidly, ICI-induced colitis can lead to serious life-threatening complications. Current management is based on corticosteroids as first-line, and immunosuppressants like infliximab or vedolizumab for refractory cases. Microbiota transplantation and specific cytokines and lymphocyte replication inhibitors are being investigated. Optimal patient care requires maintaining a balance between treatment toxicity and efficacy, hence the aim of this review is to enhance readers' comprehension of the gastrointestinal adverse events associated with ICIs, particularly IMDC. In addition to identifying the risk factors, we discuss the incidence, clinical presentation, workup, and management options of IMDC.

### Vedolizumab blocks α 4 β 7 integrin-mediated T cell adhesion to MAdCAM-1 in microscopic colitis [^112dP6yd]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) comprise several entities of chronic immune-mediated disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition to Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), microscopic colitis (MC) has recently attracted increasing attention.

MC describes disease entities marked by chronic watery, non-bloody diarrhea and often unremarkable endoscopic findings, but specific histopathological alterations. More precisely, it is an umbrella term for lymphocytic colitis (LC) and collagenous colitis (CC), which are characterized by increased intraepithelial lymphocytes and a thickened subepithelial collagen band, respectively. Despite these morphological differences, MC is often treated as a single entity in clinical practice, due to similar clinical appearance and management of LC and CC.

The standard treatment for MC is budesonide, which has proven efficacy for the induction, and maintenance of remission. – However, it is not effective in all patients and the long-term use of corticosteroids is controversial.

### The natural history of histological changes in microscopic colitis [^113kfYZg]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Microscopic colitis (MC) causes chronic diarrhea. It has two histologic subtypes: lymphocytic colitis (LC) and collagenous colitis (CC). Little is known about the natural progression of disease with time and with treatment.

Objectives:

We aimed to assess histological changes over time.

Design:

We designed a retrospective study including adults diagnosed with MC from January 1992 to January 2020 at Mayo Clinic.

Methods:

Pathology reports were reviewed until 31 October 2020. Histological assessments at least 8 weeks apart were considered as adequate follow-up. Histological change from one subtype to the other and resolution were tracked with univariate and multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.

Results:

Overall, 416 patients with a median age at diagnosis of 63.9 years with > 1 histopathological assessment were identified. Histology at initial diagnosis was CC in 218 (52.4%) patients and LC in 198 (47.6%). No medications were associated with a histological change. However, histological resolution was more likely with the use of aspirin [hazard ratio (HR): 2.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.34–3.31, p = 0.001) and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs; HR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.34–3.02, p = 0.001). Histological resolution was more likely with budesonide treatment (HR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.16–3.00, p = 0.010) and less likely with mesalamine (HR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.19–0.83, p = 0.014), compared to medications such as prednisone, loperamide, and bismuth. Patients with CC were less likely to change their histology compared to patients with LC (HR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.14–0.42, p < 0.001). There was no difference in histological resolution between the two subtypes (HR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.47–1.05, p = 0.084).

Conclusion:

Patients with LC have a higher chance of changing their histology as compared to CC. However, histological resolution was associated with the use of PPIs and aspirin, and treatment with budesonide.

### Checkpoint inhibitor-induced colitis [^1177a3xj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized treatment and overall survival for several different types of cancer. Antibodies to cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 and to programmed cell death protein 1 and its ligand enhance cytotoxic T-cell survival, thus augmenting antitumor action and consequently inducing immune-related adverse events, of which the most relevant is diarrhea and colitis. This review compiles recent data on pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and treatment of immune-mediated colitis (IMC). The pathogenesis of IMC is not completely understood, but recent studies have focused on the role of regulatory T cells and interactions with the gut microbiome. While sharing similarities with inflammatory bowel disease, IMC is considered a distinct form of colitis with acute onset and rapid progression leading to potential complications including bowel perforation and death. Prompt recognition and management of IMC is imperative for optimal outcomes. Although prospective clinical trials are lacking to guide therapy, recent guidelines recommend early endoscopic evaluation to establish the diagnosis and prompt initiation of corticosteroids. Response to first-line therapy should be assessed early to determine the need of escalation to biologic agents. With treatment, most patients will experience full resolution of symptoms, and subsequent rechallenge with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 or anti-programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitors can be considered.

### Incidence and management of toxicity associated with ibrutinib and idelalisib: a practical approach [^111bDFve]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Incidence and severity

Diarrhea can occur at any time after initiation of idelalisib and its incidence is higher in treatment-naïve patients (42%)than in patients with relapsed/refractory disease (4–18%). Diarrhea that occurs within the first 8 weeks of idelalisib use is usually grade 1–2 (i.e. an increase in stools of up to six stools per day over baseline).

Late-onset diarrhea is generally grade ≥ 3, with a median time to onset of 7.1 months and there are no accompanying symptoms such as cramps, blood or mucus. Colonoscopy shows macroscopic, in some cases ulcerative, colitis, and histology shows lymphocytic colitis in combination with characteristic epithelial cell apoptosis and neutrophilic cryptitis. Idelalisib-induced intestinal perforation is rare (< 0.5%).

Although a definitive underlying mechanism for idelalisib-associated diarrhea is unknown, PI3K δ inhibition has been associated with immune dysregulation resulting in inhibition of regulatory T cells and increased damage via CD8 + cytotoxic T cells.–

### Incidence of microscopic colitis in the netherlands. A nationwide population-based study from 2000 to 2012 [^116PGqHB]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Incidence rates of microscopic colitis are mainly based on regional data from a limited number of countries. To evaluate geographical differences and changes over time, more nationwide incidence rates are needed.

Aims

The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the incidence rate of microscopic colitis in the Netherlands in a nationwide cohort.

Methods

A search was performed in the Dutch pathology registry, covering records of all approximately 16.5 million inhabitants. Incident cases were defined as a first diagnosis of microscopic colitis (collagenous or lymphocytic colitis) between 2000 and 2012.

Results

In total, 7228 incident cases were identified with a mean annual incidence rate of 3.4 per 100,000 person years. Collagenous colitis was present in 3741 cases and lymphocytic colitis in 2718 cases, with a mean annual incidence rate of 1.8 and 1.3 per 100,000 person years, respectively. Remaining 769 cases were described as undefined microscopic colitis. Collagenous and lymphocytic colitis incidence rates increased significantly over time (p < 0.001) with a male:female ratio of 1:3 and 1:2, respectively.

Conclusion

The Dutch mean annual incidence rates of collagenous and lymphocytic colitis were considerably lower than previously reported by other countries. However, incidence rates increased gradually over time, with a clear female predominance.

(f) After vedolizumab therapy, chronic active colitis with basal plasmacytosis and Paneth cell metaplasia. In the top right corner, there are focal areas of active colitis with focal ulceration and granulation tissue

Histologic evaluation

All patients underwent biopsies of the colon, terminal ileum, and duodenum (when EGD evaluation was done), irrespective of endoscopic evidence of inflammation. Histopathologic presentation before and after vedolizumab therapy is shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Upon initial histologic evaluation, 28 patients (100%) had features of active inflammation and 14 (50%) had features of chronic inflammation. Two major patterns of inflammation were observed, one with active colitis superimposed on chronic colitis, and a second pattern characterized by inflammation in the spectrum of lymphocytic colitis and collagenous colitis. Fourteen patients had features of chronicity such as architecture distortion, basal lymphoplasmacytosis, and Paneth cell metaplasia. Granulomatous inflammation was not observed. Ten patients had a microscopic inflammation pattern in the spectrum of lymphocytic colitis (eight patients) or collagenous colitis (two patients). Biopsies from eight patients also showed terminal ileitis evidenced by focal villitis and architectural distortion. Markedly increased mitotic activity and apoptosis of epithelial cells were observed in nine patients.

### Budesonide treatment for microscopic colitis: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116amkP3]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Microscopic colitis (MC), encompassing lymphocytic and collagenous colitis, is a common cause for chronic nonbloody diarrhoea, which impacts significantly on the quality of life for patients. Despite increasing awareness of the condition and its treatment, there is considerable variation in therapeutic approaches. To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy and safety of budesonide in the treatment of MC. We searched Medline, Embase and Central databases using predefined search methodology for randomised trials using budesonide in the treatment of MC. We extracted data, on the efficacy and safety of budesonide, from studies identified that met the feasibility for analysis criteria. These data were pooled with a fixed effects model. Nine studies met the inclusion criteria for analysis. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) for a response to budesonide therapy at induction and maintenance were 7.34 [95% confidence interval (CI): 4.08–13.19] and 8.35 (95% CI: 4.14–16.85) respectively. Histological response rates were superior in budesonide-treated patients compared to placebo following induction (OR: 11.52; 95% CI: 5.67–23.40) and maintenance treatment (OR: 5.88; 95% CI: 1.90–18.17). There was no difference in adverse events. Significant relapse rates (> 50%) were observed following treatment cessation with no difference noted between the budesonide or the placebo-treated patients. Budesonide is an effective treatment option for MC for achieving induction and maintenance of both clinical and histological response. High relapse rates on treatment cessation were observed.

### Bowel histology of CVID patients reveals distinct patterns of mucosal inflammation [^115CFM8m]. Journal of Clinical Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Features assessed in biopsies from all sites were (i) lymphoid hyperplasia and (ii) presence of plasma cells. For colonic biopsies, features were (i) cryptitis (= two or more granulocytes/crypt-diameter), crypt abscesses, crypt distortion/increased inflammatory cells in the lamina propria (inflammatory bowel disease pattern, with or without acute component), (ii) increased subepithelial collagen (collagenous colitis pattern) or lymphocytic colitis (pure intraepithelial lymphocytosis), and (iii) pure acute colitis. For duodenal/ileal biopsies, patterns were (i) flattened villi, (ii) increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (if i and ii present, coeliac-like pattern), (iii) cryptitis (= two or more granulocytes/crypt-diameter), and (iv) acute inflammation, acute duodenitis/ileitis.

We define acute duodenitis, ileitis, or colitis as a pattern of injury characterized by neutrophilic inflammation in the mucosa. If in addition to the lamina propria, neutrophils entered the crypt or surface epithelium, then the term acute cryptitis or surface epitheliitis is used as a correlate of epithelial damage. If the inflammation is more severe, crypt abscesses may form, where neutrophilic inflammation lies free as exudate within crypt lumina. Acute enteritis is most commonly seen in bacterial infection or in exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease. There is no fundamental distortion of underlying colonic crypt architecture.

Crypt architectural injury arises as a result of prolonged mucosal injury, as in inflammatory bowel disease or chronic colitis of other causes. The defining histological feature of chronic injury is crypt architectural distortion, wherein crypts become shortened, branched, or destroyed. There may be Paneth cell metaplasia of crypt cells. If there is chronic active colitis, the changes of acute colitis may be superimposed on architectural changes. Granulomatous inflammation is a feature of chronic injury, and may be seen in Crohn's disease, in addition to other architectural changes of chronicity.

By contrast, intraepithelial lymphocytosis in gut mucosa implies an immunological or, less commonly, viral etiology. In the duodenum, it is frequently accompanied by villous atrophy to give rise to the characteristic changes of coeliac disease. In the colon, lymphocytic infiltration of surface and crypt epithelium without alteration of mucosal architecture is a diagnostic feature of lymphocytic colitis in immunocompetent patients.

CVID patients provided written informed consent under study protocols approved by NHS Research Ethics Committees (REC 04/Q0501/119).

### Severe spruelike enteropathy and collagenous colitis caused by olmesartan [^1169CmX7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Olmesartan, which is an angiotensin II receptor blocker, reportedly causes spruelike enteropathy, with intestinal villous atrophy as its typical histopathological finding. Interestingly, collagenous and/or lymphocytic gastritis and colitis occur in some patients. We report the case of a 73-year-old Japanese man with a 2-month clinical history of severe diarrhea and weight loss. There were few reports in which spruelike enteropathy and collagenous colitis were both observed and could be followed up.

Case presentation

We report a case of a 73-year-old man with a 2-month clinical history of severe diarrhea and weight loss. He had taken olmesartan for hypertension treatment for 5 years. Endoscopic examination with biopsies revealed intestinal villous atrophy and collagenous colitis. Suspecting enteropathy caused by olmesartan, which was discontinued on admission because of hypotension, we continued to stop the drug. Within 3 weeks after olmesartan discontinuation, his clinical symptoms improved. After 3 months, follow-up endoscopy showed improvement of villous atrophy but not of the thickened collagen band of the colon. However, the mucosa normalized after 6 months, histologically confirming that the preexistent pathology was finally resolved.

Conclusions

This report presents a case in which spruelike enteropathy and collagenous colitis were both observed and could be followed up. In unexplained cases of diarrhea, medication history should be reconfirmed and this disease should be considered a differential diagnosis.

### A case of checkpoint inhibitor-induced celiac disease [^113niB5d]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of celiac disease is due to gluten-mediated activation of intestinal CD4+ T cells in the lamina propria. Gliadin peptides from gluten are converted by tissue transglutaminase (TTG) to a form that increases their affinity for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules and results in enhanced antigen presentation. Antigen presenting cells activate CD4+ T-helper cells in the lamina propria, causing expansion of cells that produce antibodies to gliadin and TTG. The histologic hallmarks of celiac disease on small bowel biopsies are intraepithelial lymphocytosis, lymphoplasmacytic inflammation of the lamina propria, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia.

While the pathogenesis of immune-mediated colitis is not well understood, CTLA-4 blockade leads to T-cell activation that increases secretion of CD4 T-helper cell cytokines and cytolytic CD8 T-cell tissue infiltration. In contrast to celiac disease, ICI-induced colitis usually presents with an array of histologic findings. Usually biopsies demonstrate features of acute active colitis such as intraepithelial neutrophilic infiltrates or crypt abscesses, increased mononuclear cells in the lamina propria. Both celiac disease and ICI colitis show increased apoptotic cells in crypts. Interestingly a subset of ICI colitis patients may demonstrate intraepithelial or basal lymphocytes, excess plasma cells in the lamina propria, and lymphocytic cryptitis on colonic biopsy, which is more consistent with findings in chronic colitis.

As histologic features may overlap, clinical features are crucial for differentiation of distinct diseases. This patient tested positive for tissue transglutaminase antibodies; the serum ELISA anti-TTG test has 93% sensitivity and 98% specificity for a celiac diagnosis. Typically celiac disease is diagnosed by biopsy when there are greater than forty lymphocytes per hundred epithelial nuclei in the villi. Thus, although the patient's histology showed less than thirty lymphocytes per hundred epithelial nuclei, a diagnosis of early celiac disease can be made in conjunction with a positive serology. Gastroenterologists must consider histologic and endoscopic features, clinical symptoms, and laboratory findings such as celiac serology and genetic testing to arrive at the correct diagnosis.

Our patient was able to continue treatment with ICIs with dietary modifications, suggesting correct diagnosis is critical for optimal patient outcome. As highlighted by this case, active inflammation can affect the small bowel and/or upper GI tract alone. For a patient with symptomatic diarrhea, evaluation shouldn't be limited to colonoscopy alone, and biopsies should be done to look for microscopic evidence of inflammation even if the mucosa of the GI appears normal.

### Recommendations for standardizing biopsy acquisition and histological assessment of immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated colitis [^113c2tuW]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Given the composition of the expert panel, we restricted the statements to those most relevant to pathologists. However, several other pertinent questions, such as appropriate selection of patients for endoscopy, timing of procedures, and the use of biomarkers to aid in diagnosis and/or monitoring, warrant discussion. Generally, these are clinical decisions that are made by gastroenterologists or oncologists, falling outside the scope of this specific RAND. Most of these decisions are based on clinical assessment and include consideration of symptom severity, patient comorbidities, potential risks of endoscopy, endoscopy availability, and response to empiric therapy. Recognizing that endoscopy is a limited resource, biomarkers may play a useful adjunctive role in identifying which patients would benefit most from endoscopic and histological evaluation. For example, fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin are stool-based assays that reflect colonic neutrophil activity and have a high sensitivity and specificity for endoscopic inflammation in patients with IBD. Similar associations have been suggested in ICIC. For example, in a retrospective cohort of 77 patients with ICIC, Zou et al reported that mean fecal calprotectin concentrations were significantly higher in patients with endoscopic ulcerations (641 µg/g) or inflammation (438 µg/g) than in patients with normal endoscopy (263 µg/g, p = 0.008). Similarly, patients with acute active colitis histologically had the highest fecal calprotectin concentrations, and among responders to therapy, calprotectin concentrations decreased significantly. The sensitivity and specificity of fecal biomarkers for ICIC will vary depending on the cut-off chosen, and additional research is required to determine optimal thresholds for defining response. In clinical practice, patients with complete symptom resolution and very low calprotectin concentrations (ie, < 50–80 µg/g) could potentially defer endoscopy, whereas those patients with equivocal biomarker results or atypical presentations may benefit more from endoscopy and histopathology data.

### Lymphocytic colitis treated with proctocolectomy and ileal J-pouch-anal anastomosis: report of a case [^113crfP4]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We present a case of severe diarrhea caused by lymphocytic colitis and concurrent celiac sprue in a patient who did not respond to maximal medical therapy and required surgery.

Methods

The patient was initially treated with fecal diversion via an end ileostomy. Six months later, she underwent colectomy and one-stage ileal J-pouch-anal anastomosis.

Results

Notably, the characteristic microscopic changes of lymphocytic colitis were still present at the time of colectomy despite diversion.

Conclusion

Colectomy with continent reconstruction is an option for treatment of patients with lymphocytic colitis refractory to medical therapy.

### Carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone [^116NZtmn]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.8 Diarrhea and Colitis

In clinical trials of entacapone, diarrhea developed in 60 of 603 (10.0%) and 16 of 400 (4.0%) of patients treated with 200 mg of entacapone or placebo in combination with levodopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, respectively. In patients treated with entacapone, diarrhea was generally mild to moderate in severity (8.6%) but was regarded as severe in 1.3%. Diarrhea resulted in withdrawal in 10 of 603 (1.7%) patients, 7 (1.2%) with mild and moderate diarrhea and 3 (0.5%) with severe diarrhea. Diarrhea generally resolved after discontinuation of entacapone. Two patients with diarrhea were hospitalized. Typically, diarrhea presents within 4 to 12 weeks after entacapone is started, but it may appear as early as the first week and as late as many months after the initiation of treatment. Diarrhea may be associated with weight loss, dehydration, and hypokalemia.

Postmarketing experience has shown that diarrhea may be a sign of drug-induced microscopic colitis, primarily lymphocytic colitis. In these cases diarrhea has usually been moderate to severe, watery and non-bloody, at times associated with dehydration, abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypokalemia. In the majority of cases, diarrhea and other colitis-related symptoms resolved or significantly improved when entacapone treatment was stopped. In some patients with biopsy confirmed colitis, diarrhea had resolved or significantly improved after discontinuation of entacapone but recurred after retreatment with entacapone.

If prolonged diarrhea is suspected to be related to Carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone tablets, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy considered. If the cause of prolonged diarrhea remains unclear or continues after stopping entacapone, then further diagnostic investigations including colonoscopy and biopsies should be considered.

### Entacapone (Comtan) [^116hxgTL]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

Diarrhea and Colitis

In clinical studies, diarrhea developed in 60 of 603 (10%) and 16 of 400 (4%) of patients treated with 200 mg Comtan and placebo, respectively. In patients treated with Comtan, diarrhea was generally mild to moderate in severity (8.6%) but was regarded as severe in 1.3%. Diarrhea resulted in withdrawal in 10 of 603 (1.7%) patients, 7 (1.2%) with mild and moderate diarrhea and 3 (0.5%) with severe diarrhea. Diarrhea generally resolved after discontinuation of Comtan. Two patients with diarrhea were hospitalized. Typically, diarrhea presents within 4 weeks to 12 weeks after entacapone is started, but it may appear as early as the first week and as late as many months after the initiation of treatment. Diarrhea may be associated with weight loss, dehydration, and hypokalemia.

Postmarketing experience has shown that diarrhea may be a sign of drug-induced microscopic colitis, primarily lymphocytic colitis. In these cases, diarrhea has usually been moderate to severe, watery, and non-bloody, at times associated with dehydration, abdominal pain, weight loss, and hypokalemia. In the majority of cases, diarrhea and other colitis-related symptoms resolved or significantly improved when Comtan treatment was stopped. In some patients with biopsy confirmed colitis, diarrhea had resolved or significantly improved after discontinuation of Comtan but recurred after retreatment with Comtan.

If prolonged diarrhea is suspected to be related to Comtan, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy considered. If the cause of prolonged diarrhea remains unclear or continues after stopping entacapone, then further diagnostic investigations including colonoscopy and biopsies should be considered.

Dyskinesia

Comtan may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia. Although decreasing the dose of levodopa may ameliorate this side effect, many patients in controlled studies continued to experience frequent dyskinesia despite a reduction in their dose of levodopa. The incidence of dyskinesia was 25% for treatment with Comtan and 15% for placebo. The incidence of study withdrawal for dyskinesia was 1.5% for 200 mg Comtan and 0.8% for placebo.

### Microscopic colitis: a population-based case series over a 9-year period in Northern Ireland [^1175j26a]. Colorectal Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

We report clinicopathological experience of microscopic colitis (MC) in a population-based case series in Northern Ireland over a 9-year period.

Method

The pathology laboratory information system within a large teaching centre serving two healthcare trusts was interrogated for cases coded between 2008 and 2016 as collagenous colitis (CC) or lymphocytic colitis (LC). Demographic, clinical and follow-up information was collected from healthcare records.

Results

A total of 326 new diagnoses of MC were identified, an average annual incidence of 6.7 per 100 000 population. The average annual incidence of CC and LC was 5.0 and 1.7 per 100 000 population, respectively. For coding reasons it is likely that LC data are incomplete. Of 191 cases diagnosed by specialist gastrointestinal pathologists, 141 patients had CC and 50 patients had LC. Both CC and LC predominantly involved women aged 60–79. Some 15% demonstrated endoscopic abnormalities. Endoscopic sampling protocols varied widely: 30% of individuals with CC and 32% of those with LC had the right and left colon sampled separately, with histology concordant in 95% of cases. Of the 191 cases, only one case (of LC) was refractory to treatment; the rest exhibited a clinical response. Only 35 patients had follow-up endoscopy and biopsies, and three of each diagnosis showed persistent disease on histology.

Conclusion

Overall, CC and LC are benign conditions with similar demographics, clinical associations, management and outcomes. Separate sampling of the right and left colon is advised at colonoscopy if this diagnosis is being considered, but left colonic sampling, which can be performed at flexible sigmoidoscopy, will diagnose the vast majority of cases.

### Guidelines for the investigation of chronic diarrhoea in adults: British society of gastroenterology, 3rd edition [^115emfLG]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Conditions associated with microscopic colitis include autoimmune diseases such as rheumatic disease, thyroid disease and coeliac disease (in around 5–7%). Bile acid diarrhoea (diagnosed by SeHCAT testing) has been reported to be prevalent in both collagenous colitis (41%; 37–45%) and lymphocytic colitis (29%; 24–34%). Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, proton pump inhibitors and sertraline is also high and withdrawal of these can be associated with improvement in symptoms.

Diagnosis of microscopic colitis is made by histological examination of colonic mucosal biopsies. Multiple biopsies should be taken and examined to detect the histological changes of lymphocyte infiltration and a possible collagenous subepithelial band. It needs to be stressed that the colonoscopic macroscopic appearances may be essentially normal, but biopsies are still needed. Right-sided biopsies, taken at colonoscopy, have a greater yield than rectal biopsies, but most patients will have changes detectable in the distal colon and so can be diagnosed by biopsies taken at flexible sigmoidoscopy. There is no reliable biomarker for microscopic colitis, although a raised faecal calprotectin may be found, which will suggest the need for further colonoscopic assessment. A scoring system has been developed which has a good negative predictive value (97%) to exclude microscopic colitis. This may have a role in avoiding unnecessary colonoscopic biopsies in some patients.

Making the diagnosis of microscopic colitis in a patient with chronic diarrhoea is important as specific and effective treatment for the condition is now available. Budesonide, in controlled release preparations, has been shown to induce remission in active disease for both forms of microscopic colitis, and these trials have recently been reviewed. There is also good evidence for budesonide in the maintenance of remission in collagenous colitis. Up to 70% can relapse and require further treatment, but others can remain symptom-free. Other drugs have been used, including prednisolone, bile acid sequestrants in appropriate patients with demonstrated bile acid diarrhoea and, in steroid-refractory patients, immunosuppressives.

3 Ulcerative colitis

3.1 Diagnosis

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by mucosal inflammation starting distally in the rectum, with continuous extension proximally for a variable distance, often with an abrupt demarcation between inflamed and non-inflamed mucosa. Typically, patients with UC experience periods of relapse and remission. Up to 90% will have one or more relapses after the first attack, and early relapse or active disease in the first 2 years is associated with a worse disease course subsequently.

Statement 1. Where ulcerative colitis is diagnosed by sigmoidoscopy, we recommend a full ileocolonoscopy to delineate disease extent, severity of inflammation and to exclude Crohn's disease (GRADE: strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 100%).

In patients presenting with suspected UC, stool cultures and Clostridium difficile toxin assay should always be performed to rule out infective causes. While UC is often initially diagnosed at flexible (or rigid) sigmoidoscopy, it is important to confirm the diagnosis, extent and severity of disease by means of full ileocolonoscopy, usually within the first year, as this can more definitively confirm the diagnosis of UC versus Crohn's disease and give information that may help to predict future disease course, including potential and risk stratification for dysplasia, and thus will influence treatment choices. For histological assessment at least two biopsy specimens should be taken from five sites throughout the examined bowel, including the ileum and rectum, during the initial endoscopic evaluation.

Rectal sparing in UC has been described in up to > 3% of patients, but more frequently patchy inflammation of the rectum may be seen in those who have been given empirical topical therapy. The presence of a 'caecal patch', isolated peri-appendiceal inflammation and backwash ileitis can occur in UC, but if the histology and clinical pattern are not otherwise typical of UC, then small bowel evaluation is required to exclude Crohn's disease (see Section 4.1.3.1: Crohn's disease, Cross-sectional imaging: CT, MR and small bowel ultrasound). Backwash ileitis has been reported in up to 20% of patients with extensive colitis.

3.1.1 Histology

No histological feature is diagnostic of UC, but the combination of basal plasmacytosis, diffuse crypt atrophy and distortion, villous surface irregularity and mucus depletion are suggestive of a diagnosis of UC in the correct clinical context. Uneven distribution of inflammation within the colon or within biopsies can occur in patients with long-standing disease, or after treatment.

### Quantifying intraepithelial lymphocytes and subepithelial collagen band in microscopic colitis, extracting insights into the interrelationship of lymphocytic and collagenous colitis [^117ScrmE]. Annals of Diagnostic Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Microscopic colitis (MC) is the umbrella term for the conditions termed lymphocytic colitis (LC) and collagenous colitis (CC). LC with thickening of the subepithelial collagen band or CC with increased number of intraepithelial T- lymphocytes (IELs) is often seen in MC and may lead to difficulties in correct histological classification. We investigated the extent of overlapping features of CC and LC in 60 cases of MC by measuring the exact thickness of the subepithelial collagen band in Van Gieson stained slides and quantifying number of IELs in CD3 stained slides by digital image analysis. A thickened collagen band was observed in nine out of 29 cases with LC (31%) and an increased number of IELs in all 23 cases of CC (100%). There was no correlation between the thickness of the collagen band and number of IELs. Due to the increased number of IELs in all cases of CC we consider the lymphocytic inflammatory infiltration of the mucosa to be the essential histopathological feature of MC. However, although LC and CC are related due to the lymphocytic inflammation, the non-linear correlation of number of IELs and thickness of the collagenous band indicate differences in their pathogenesis.

In some patients with biopsy confirmed colitis, diarrhea had resolved or significantly improved after discontinuation of entacapone but recurred after retreatment with entacapone.

If prolonged diarrhea is suspected to be related to entacapone, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy considered. If the cause of prolonged diarrhea remains unclear or continues after stopping entacapone, then further diagnostic investigations including colonoscopy and biopsies should be considered.

Dyskinesia

Entacapone may potentiate the dopaminergic side effects of levodopa and may cause or exacerbate preexisting dyskinesia.

### Sigmoidoscopy in diagnosing microscopic colitis… [^114wvqbZ]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

One of the causes of chronic diarrhea is microscopic colitis; its etiology is unknown. Collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis are considered to be two histologically and clinically similar types of microscopic colitis. Histologic examination of a biopsy specimen is the only way to diagnose this entity because the colon appears normal during endoscopy. In addition, distribution of the lesions is nonuniform and has a relevant clinical implication. Is colonoscopy with biopsies from multiple sites the preferred method of diagnosing microscopic colitis, or is flexible sigmoidoscopy with biopsies limited to the left colon sufficient. Matteoni and associates conducted this study to determine if biopsies from the left colon could detect microscopic colitis, precluding the need for colonoscopy. Of 98 patients identified with microscopic colitis, 58 met inclusion criteria for analysis of distribution of disease; 24 patients had collagenous colitis and 34 had lymphocytic colitis.

Of the 58 participants, 28 had previously undergone a barium enema or a colonoscopy as part of an evaluation of chronic diarrhea; the results were normal. The current colonoscopy was being performed in this group to obtain biopsy specimens. Collagenous colitis was diagnosed from left colon biopsy specimens in all 24 patients with that diagnosis. Overall, the mean number of biopsies performed was 1. 8 ±
0. 8 from the descending colon, 1. 1 ±
0. 6 from the sigmoid colon and 1. 0 ±
0. 7 from the rectum. Lymphocytic colitis was diagnosed from left colon biopsy specimens in 33 of 34 patients. The mean number of biopsies performed was 1. 3 ±
0. 7 from the descending colon, 0. 9 ±
0. 5 from the sigmoid colon and 1. 4 ±
0. 8 from the rectum. This patient had a single left colon biopsy, and the authors suggest that it is likely the diagnosis would have been made by obtaining more biopsy specimens from the left side.

The authors conclude that the results of this study support the concept that microscopic colitis affects the entire colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy with multiple biopsy sites from the left colon will detect almost all patients with microscopic colitis and may preclude the need for a colonoscopy.
