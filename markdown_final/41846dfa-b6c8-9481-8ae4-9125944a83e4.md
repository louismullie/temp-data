## Question

Can it be discontinued in a 45 year old male with LDL of 70

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether statin therapy can be discontinued in a 45-year-old man with an LDL cholesterol of 70 mg/dL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline ASCVD risk and how age 45 influences risk estimation. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about statin discontinuation in primary prevention and whether any exceptions apply at this age. Next, I will examine the evidence on outcomes with statin discontinuation, especially in younger adults. After that, I need to check whether an LDL-C of 70 mg/dL changes the indication or intensity of therapy. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like intolerance, shared decision-making, and monitoring, and then synthesize a clear recommendation with caveats.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. A 45-year-old man with LDL-C 70 mg/dL is in the 40–75 year primary prevention population where statin decisions are driven by 10-year ASCVD risk and risk enhancers, not by a single LDL-C value alone, so I need to calculate his 10-year risk using the Pooled Cohort Equations before concluding anything about discontinuation [^111QWr6D] [^116XWZ95].

> Wait, let me verify the risk-based thresholds. For adults 40–75 years without diabetes or clinical ASCVD and with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL, guidelines recommend moderate-intensity statin when 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 7.5% and consider it when 5% to < 7.5% if risk enhancers are present; high-intensity statin is reserved for those with ≥ 20% risk or with diabetes, so I should not jump to conclusions about stopping just because LDL-C is 70 mg/dL [^111QWr6D] [^116XWZ95] [^1156932H].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about discontinuation. I initially thought that achieving LDL-C 70 mg/dL might imply the job is done and allow stopping, but that would be a mistake; guidelines emphasize treating based on risk and percent LDL-C reduction rather than treating to a single LDL-C target, and they do not provide a rationale for stopping effective therapy solely because a certain LDL-C level is reached in primary prevention, so I should correct that assumption and keep the indication anchored to risk and percent reduction rather than an absolute LDL-C value [^111QWr6D] [^116XWZ95].

> Next, I should review the evidence on stopping statins. Observational data consistently associate statin discontinuation with higher risks of cardiovascular events and mortality, and a systematic review suggests roughly a 30% increase in ASCVD events after stopping, though confounding is possible; importantly, these signals are not limited to older adults, so in a 45-year-old with decades of remaining life expectancy, the potential harm from stopping is magnified over time [^111Kradz] [^117SNfHH].

> I need to ensure I am not missing guideline-supported reasons to stop. The ACC/AHA framework supports discontinuation considerations mainly in older adults with functional decline, frailty, multimorbidity, or limited life expectancy, and even there it is framed as a shared decision rather than a blanket rule; for a 45-year-old, these end-of-life or frailty-based rationales do not apply, so routine discontinuation is not supported by guidelines in this scenario [^114RZ5j1] [^113AGTW2].

> But wait, what if the patient has side effects or intolerance. I should double-check the approach to statin-associated muscle symptoms; most patients can ultimately tolerate some statin regimen with strategies like dose reduction, switching agent, alternate-day dosing, or adding nonstatins, and complete cessation should be a last resort after a structured rechallenge and shared decision-making, not a first move when LDL-C is at goal but the indication remains [^111Fv2Jw] [^115ycwqh].

> Let me consider monitoring and targets pragmatically. Even though the ACC/AHA moved away from hard LDL-C targets, in practice we still track LDL-C to ensure the percent reduction and risk-appropriate intensity are achieved; if a patient on a moderate-intensity statin has LDL-C around 70 mg/dL and is tolerating therapy, that generally reflects good efficacy and supports continuation rather than discontinuation, especially given the long horizon for benefit in a 45-year-old [^111QWr6D] [^116XWZ95].

> I should confirm whether any special primary prevention exceptions would change this. Coronary artery calcium can refine risk in borderline or intermediate-risk adults, but even a CAC score of zero in intermediate risk leads to deferring statins rather than stopping an already-prescribed, well-tolerated statin; thus, CAC is not a rationale to discontinue effective therapy in a 45-year-old who already meets treatment criteria [^111QWr6D] [^115YMVov].

> Putting this together, I should conclude clearly. No, statin therapy should not be discontinued solely because a 45-year-old man has achieved LDL-C 70 mg/dL; the indication for statin therapy in primary prevention is risk-based and anchored to percent LDL-C reduction, and stopping effective therapy exposes him to higher long-term cardiovascular risk without a compensating benefit, absent intolerance or a compelling change in clinical status [^111QWr6D] [^111Kradz] [^117SNfHH].

> Practical next steps: I need to check his 10-year ASCVD risk, confirm adherence and tolerance, reinforce lifestyle, and if he is on moderate-intensity therapy with LDL-C around 70 mg/dL and no side effects, continue the statin; if there are adverse effects, I should troubleshoot with dose changes, a different statin, or add-on nonstatins rather than stopping outright, documenting shared decision-making if any modification is considered [^111QWr6D] [^111Fv2Jw] [^115ycwqh].

In most cases, **statin therapy should not be discontinued** in a 45-year-old male with LDL-C of 70 mg/dL, as this level meets guideline targets and ongoing therapy maintains cardiovascular risk reduction. Discontinuation is only reasonable if there is **statin intolerance** [^111Fv2Jw] or a **life-limiting illness** with limited life expectancy [^113RMg2D]. Otherwise, continue the statin and monitor LDL-C every 6–12 months [^11732gEi], adjusting therapy as needed to maintain LDL-C < 70 mg/dL in high-risk patients [^113yXKw7] or < 100 mg/dL in lower-risk patients [^1156932H].

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines from the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society (ESC/EAS) provide clear recommendations on statin therapy management:

- **ACC/AHA guidelines**: For adults aged 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD or diabetes, statin therapy is recommended based on LDL-C levels and estimated 10-year ASCVD risk. For LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL, moderate-intensity statins are recommended if the 10-year ASCVD risk is ≥ 7.5% [^111QWr6D] [^116XWZ95].

- **ESC/EAS guidelines**: For primary prevention, target LDL-C levels are < 1.8 mmol/L (69.6 mg/dL) for high-risk patients and < 2.6 mmol/L (100.5 mg/dL) for moderate-risk patients [^113J9Lbn].

Given these guidelines, an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL is at or below the recommended target for high-risk primary prevention patients, indicating effective lipid-lowering therapy.

---

## Risks associated with discontinuation

Discontinuing statin therapy in a patient with well-controlled LDL-C levels can lead to **significant increases in LDL-C** and a corresponding rise in cardiovascular risk [^111Kradz]. Observational studies have consistently shown that statin discontinuation is associated with increased cardiovascular events and mortality, particularly in patients with established cardiovascular disease or high-risk profiles [^117SNfHH].

---

## Clinical scenarios warranting discontinuation

While maintaining statin therapy is generally recommended, certain clinical scenarios may warrant consideration of discontinuation:

- **Statin intolerance**: Patients experiencing significant side effects such as myalgias, hepatotoxicity, or rhabdomyolysis may require discontinuation or switching to alternative lipid-lowering agents [^111Fv2Jw].

- **Life-limiting illness**: In patients with advanced illness, limited life expectancy, or severe frailty, the benefits of statin therapy may be outweighed by the lack of meaningful clinical benefit [^115H7CKJ].

- **Patient preference**: After thorough counseling and shared decision-making, some patients may prefer to discontinue therapy due to personal reasons or concerns about long-term medication use.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

If statin therapy is continued, regular monitoring of **LDL-C levels** and clinical assessment for side effects are essential. The ACC/AHA recommends monitoring **LDL-C** every 6–12 months [^11732gEi] to ensure continued efficacy and adherence to therapy.

---

## Alternative therapies

In cases where statin therapy is discontinued due to intolerance or patient preference, alternative lipid-lowering agents such as **ezetimibe**, **PCSK9 inhibitors**, or **bempedoic acid** may be considered based on individual patient risk profiles and clinical judgment [^1118ufqD].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

In summary, **statin therapy should generally be continued** in a 45-year-old male with an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL, as this aligns with current guideline targets and provides ongoing cardiovascular risk reduction. Discontinuation should only be considered in specific clinical scenarios such as statin intolerance or life-limiting illness. Regular monitoring and shared decision-making are essential to ensure optimal patient outcomes.

European and American risk-based LDL-C targets — thresholds and actions: According to the European Society of Cardiology guidance, individuals aged 50 to 69 years with a 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk of ≥ 10% and those under 50 years with a 10-year CVD risk of ≥ 7.5% should aim to reduce their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to < 1.4 mmol/L (54.1 mg/dL). Individuals under 50 years with a CVD risk between 2.5% and 7.5% and those aged 50–69 years with a 10-year CVD risk between 5% and < 10% should target an LDL-C level of < 1.8 mmol/L (69.6 mg/dL). In line with American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidance, individuals aged 40–75 years with LDL-C levels ≥ 1.8 mmol/L (69.6 mg/dL) are recommended to assess their 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk; if the ASCVD risk is between 7.5% and 19%, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% to 49%, while an ASCVD risk ≥ 20% warrants a reduction of 50%. In Australia, individuals aged 45–79 years with a 5-year CVD risk of ≥ 5% are recommended to initiate LMAs to reduce their LDL-C levels to 1.8 mmol/L (69.6 mg/dL).

The use of statin therapy in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has demonstrated substantial improvement in morbidity and mortality of the aging population. Despite exhaustive studies demonstrating the benefits of statin therapy linking lower cholesterol levels to decreased vascular events, statin guidelines vary greatly with age, and recommendations are unclear regarding initiation and discontinuation of statin therapy in patients 65 years and older. Data suggest that statins are highly effective at secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events and development of coronary heart disease in patients with a history of vascular disease or risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or smoking. Therefore, patients who meet these criteria, regardless of age, should begin statin therapy. There is also some evidence to suggest that statin therapy may be beneficial in primary prevention of major cardiovascular events, although these data are not as well studied as secondary prevention use of statin therapy, and should therefore be individualized for each patient.

### Statins for all? [^116p6how]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for cholesterol management proposed by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) recommended statin therapy for most men in their 60s and most women in their 70s. If these guidelines are followed in the United States, most adults will eventually take statins. A companion article in this journal goes a step further by proposing statin initiation for mostly everyone about 10 years earlier. Treatment in ACC/AHA guidelines does not depend on cholesterol levels, for either statin initiation or treatment goals. Selection of patients for statin therapy depends instead on multifactorial risk assessment derived from prospective studies in subgroups of the US population. Because of expansion of statin therapy, the issue of the reliability of risk assessment has come to the fore. Some evidence suggests that the ACC/AHA risk algorithm overestimates risk in many persons; if so, this would lead to statin therapy beyond what was intended. Some investigators favor assessment of risk based on presence or absence of categorical risk factors or higher risk conditions. Others propose selection of individuals for statin therapy grounded in measurement of atherosclerosis burden. Finally, an alternate approach to cholesterol management is to establish cholesterol goals for secondary and primary prevention. Cholesterol levels, and not global risk assessment, here define the intensity of therapy. The use of cholesterol goals allows more flexibility in treatment by taking advantage of lifestyle therapies and various drugs and their doses to attain defined goals.

Coronary artery calcium measurement — selected candidates and caveats — Patients reluctant to initiate statin who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely and those concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms are listed, as are older patients (men 55–80 y of age; women 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factors who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy and middle-aged adults (45–55 y of age) with pooled cohort equations (PCE)–calculated 10-year risk for ASCVD 5% to < 7.5% with factors that increase their ASCVD risk. Caveats include that if patient is at intermediate risk and if a risk decision is uncertain and a CAC score is obtained, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy unless higher-risk conditions are present and to reassess the CAC score in 5 to 10 years, and that, if CAC is recommended, it should be performed in facilities with current technology and expertise to deliver the lowest radiation possible.

### Statinopause [^115kh8SZ]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Statins are the cornerstone of lipid-lowering therapy for cardiovascular disease prevention. The 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines represent a fundamental shift in how statins will be prescribed. The new guidelines recommend statins for nearly all older patients up to age 75 years, including healthy adults with low normal lipid levels and no atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors other than age. Under the 2013 guidelines, age becomes a main determinant for initiating statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults. Specifically, according to the new guidelines, white males aged 63–75, white females aged 71–75, African American males aged 66–75, and African American females aged 70–75 with optimal risk factors would be recommended for statin treatment for primary prevention. Based on the new guidelines, one could term these older adults as having "statin deficiency", a condition warranting statin treatment. We call this putative condition of age-related statin deficiency "statinopause". After careful examination of the trial evidence, we find very little support for the new recommendations for primary prevention. The lack of evidence underscores the need for clinical trials to determine the risks and benefits of statin therapy for primary prevention among older adults.

### Predictors of first-year statin medication discontinuation: a cohort study [^117HdFhU]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Despite well-documented benefits of statins, discontinuation of statin medication is common among primary and secondary prevention patients.

Several predictors of discontinuation are readily assessable and can provide information with which to identify those with an increased risk of nonadherence.

In clinical practice, many patients for whom statins are prescribed discontinue the use of the drug within a year, which is likely to reduce any benefit of medication and increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Increased efforts to motivate treatment adherence in risk groups could reduce discontinuation and cardiovascular events.

### Cholesterol management: ACC / AHA updates guideline… [^114mpP3Y]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

- Moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated without calculating a 10-year ASCVD risk for patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus.
- Patients without diabetes at intermediate risk of ASCVD with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin for a goal of 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. SECONDARY PREVENTION Based on high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-intensity statin therapy should be instituted with a goal of lowering LDL-C levels by 50% or more in patients with ASCVD up to 75 years of age. If treatment is not tolerated, then moderate-intensity therapy should be used with a goal of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. High-quality evidence from RCTs recommends that patients 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes who are at intermediate risk with LDL-C levels of 70 to 189 mg per dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin.

A 30% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels is recommended, and in high-risk patients a 50% or greater reduction is recommended. Selected Moderate-Strength Recommendations Based on moderate-quality evidence from RCTs, the addition of nonstatin drug therapy should be considered at a threshold LDL-C level of at least 70 mg per dL on maximal statin therapy in patients with ASCVD at very high risk. Based on moderate-quality evidence from nonrandomized studies, the 10-year risk of a first ASCVD event can be assessed in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes and an LDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg per dL. Patients with diabetes who have multiple ASCVD risk factors should be treated with high-intensity statin therapy with a goal of reducing LDL-C levels by 50% or more, according to data from RCTs.

Based on moderate-quality evidence from nonrandomized trials, it is reasonable to obtain a coronary artery calcium score for patients 40 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg per dL and a 10-year ASCVD risk of 7. 5% to
19. 9% if a decision about statin therapy is uncertain.

Important research questions in cholesterol-lowering therapy — spanning secondary prevention, primary prevention, and statin/PCSK9/ezetimibe roles — are enumerated, including whether "a lower limit for LDL-C attainment" exists in secondary prevention and the "indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy". The questions also ask if, in ASCVD with "statin-associated side effects", PCSK9 inhibitors are "an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins", and, in primary prevention for adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L])" with or without diabetes, what "incremental risk reduction" is imparted by "high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins". Further items address adults "45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L])" comparing "moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe" versus "moderate-intensity statins alone", the efficacy and safety of statins in "older patients (> 75 years of age)", the "efficacy and net benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors as add-on treatment to maximal statin therapy" in severe hypercholesterolemia, and the efficacy of "moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy in patients with risk-enhancing factors (eg, chronic inflammatory disease, CKD, metabolic syndrome)".

### Prevention of cardiovascular disease: highlights for the clinician of the 2013 American college of cardiology / American Heart Association guidelines [^113e2uhq]. Clinical Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

Prevention of cardiovascular disease, undoubtedly an emphasis of clinical care in 2014, will provide both opportunities and challenges to patients and their healthcare providers. The recently-released ACC/AHA guidelines on assessment of cardiovascular risk, lifestyle management to reduce cardiovascular risk, management of overweight and obesity, and treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk, have introduced new concepts and revised prior conventional strategies. New to risk assessment are the Pooled Cohort Equations, targeting the expanded concept of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and focusing not solely on mortality but as well on major nonfatal events. The lifestyle management focuses on diet and physical activity for lipid and blood pressure control. The cholesterol guideline identifies four high-risk groups with the greatest benefits from statin therapy: preexisting ASCVD, primary LDL-C elevations ≥ 190 mm/dl, those 45–75 years with diabetes and LDL-C 70–189 mm/dl without clinical ASCVD, and those 40–75 years without clinical ASCVD with an LDL-C 70–189 mg/dl with a 7.5% or greater 10-year ASCVD risk. Eliminated are arbitrary LDL-C treatment targets, with individual patient risk status guiding who should take statins and the appropriate intensity of statin drugs. Patient-physician discussions of individual benefits and risks are paramount. Management of high blood pressure remains controversial, with two different expert panels offering varying treatment targets; there is general agreement on a < 140/90 mmHg goal, but substantial disagreement on blood pressure targets for older adults. Clinicians and their patients deserve a well-researched concensus document.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in adults with coronary artery disease in the US… [^113VZ6C2]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Primary outcomes were the percentages of participants not achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at guideline-recommended goals, defined as at least 70 mg/dL and at least 55 mg/dL. 1, 2 We also evaluated the percentage of participants not achieving LDL-C levels at higher thresholds, including at least 100 mg/dL and at least 130 mg/dL. Among adults with reported CAD, 67. 9% were receiving statin therapy and
6. 4% were receiving ezetimibe. The age-adjusted mean LDL-C level among adults with CAD receiving statin therapy was 82. 2 mg/dL, with
65. 2% having an LDL-C level greater than or equal to 70 mg/dL and 83. 3% having an LDL-C level greater than or equal to 55 mg/dL. Among adults reporting CAD not receiving statin therapy, 10.

9% were receiving ezetimibe. The age-adjusted mean LDL-C level was 120. 4 mg/dL, with
91. 0% having an LDL-C level greater than or equal to 70 mg/dL and 98. 2% having an LDL-C level greater than or equal to 55 mg/dL. Even among adults receiving statins, rates of achieving guideline goals for LDL-C were low. This is concerning because evidence suggests LDL-C levels are improving in the overall population. 4 Factors contributing to low rates of attaining guideline goals may include inadequate statin treatment intensification, 5 insufficient add-on therapy use, and low use of novel therapies. 6 Low rates of statin use and intensification may relate to prescriber or patient hesitation.

### Predictors of first-year statin medication discontinuation: a cohort study [^112D8Phg]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions and implications for practice and future research

In clinical practice, many patients for whom statins are prescribed discontinue the use of the drug within a year, which is likely to reduce any benefit of medication and increase the risk of cardiovascular events. Our study suggests that statin discontinuation is common, but several predictors of discontinuation are readily assessable and can provide information with which to identify those with an increased risk of nonadherence. Further intervention studies are needed to assess whether increased efforts to motivate treatment adherence in risk groups would reduce discontinuation and cardiovascular events.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116WNmHi]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

USPSTF response to public comment — Initial risk stratification required the presence of 1 or more cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, and the magnitude of benefit was considered proportional to estimated risk, such that a 10-year CVD risk of 7.5% to less than 10% provides at least a small net benefit and 10% or greater provides at least a moderate net benefit; the recommendation concerns initiating statins, and in adults 76 years or older the evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins; these recommendations do not pertain to adults with familial hypercholesterolemia or a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level greater than 190 mg/dL (4.92 mmol/L).

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

2018 AHA/ACC/AACVPR/AAPA/ABC/ACPM/ADA/AGS/APhA/ASPC/NLA/PCNA cholesterol guideline — primary prevention in older adults: In adults older than 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.7 to 4.8 mmol/L), initiating a moderate-intensity statin may be reasonable (IIb, B-R). In adults older than 75 years of age, it may be reasonable to stop statin therapy when functional decline (physical or cognitive), multimorbidity, frailty, or reduced life-expectancy limits the potential benefits of statin therapy (IIb, B-R). In adults 76 to 80 years of age with an LDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.7 to 4.8 mmol/L), it may be reasonable to measure coronary artery calcium (CAC) to reclassify those with a CAC score of zero to avoid statin therapy (IIb, B-R).

LDL-C goal attainment and comparative levels by risk and adherence — A quarter of the cohort on LMAs achieved the recommended LDL-C below 1.8 mmol/L (69.6 mg/dL), and nearly one-fifth achieved ≥ 50% reduction of LDL-C. Individuals with a 10-year ASCVD risk of < 7.5% (low and borderline risk groups) had higher average LDL-C levels compared to those with a risk of 7.5% or greater (intermediate and high-risk groups), and individuals who discontinued LMAs early had higher average LDL-C levels across ASCVD risk groups compared to those who gradually reduced their adherence over time.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Secondary atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention — statin therapy recommendations: In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical ASCVD, high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD in whom high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or who experience statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and considered for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy should include maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and who are on maximally tolerated LDL-C– lowering therapy with LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or a non–HDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add a PCSK9 inhibitor following a clinician– patient discussion about the net benefit, safety, and cost. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are on maximally tolerated statin therapy and are judged to be at very high risk and have an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy.

### Recommendations for (discontinuation of) statin treatment in older adults: review of guidelines [^115128CK]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Up to the age of approximately 75 years, the effectiveness of cardiovascular preventive medication is undisputed and, together with lifestyle interventions, significantly reduces the impact of cardiovascular disease. 1, 2, 3 Also, for vital adults aged 75 to 85 years, there is evidence that the benefits of statins generally outweigh the risks, especially in secondary prevention. 4, 5 However, when confronted with declining health status and the development of complex health problems, the use of preventive medications with long‐term effects might become of questionable benefit; on the one hand, treatment priorities shift and life expectancy shortens, while on the other hand, the risks of adverse effects increase due to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, polypharmacy, and multimorbidity, 6, 7, 8, 9 especially in old age. These risks can be influenced positively by decreasing medication prescriptions. In addition, high‐quality evidence is not yet available for either primary or secondary statin‐based prevention in people aged 85 years and older or in those with complex health problems (as they are currently excluded from trials). 10 In a recent meta‐analysis of the efficacy and safety of statins for primary cardiovascular disease prevention in older adults, which included data from 28 trials, only 8% of all patients were aged older than 75 years at enrollment. 5 As statins are one of the most commonly used drugs in the older population, with a prevalence ranging between 18% and 45%, 11, 12 with concerns about the benefits, they have been identified as possible candidates for deprescribing (the process of tapering or stopping inappropriate medication) by both clinicians and patients. 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 In a modified Delphi approach, physicians, pharmacists, and nurses prioritized statins in the top three of a list of medication classes where evidence‐based deprescribing guidelines would be of benefit to clinicians because of concerns about benefit given the lack of older patients in trials, the lack of clarity around ongoing indication and when they can be stopped, as well as an emerging recognition of adverse effects and overtreatment of low‐risk patients. 14

Cardiovascular events after discontinuation of statin therapy

Some studies have tried to specifically address the value of statins in the elderly population. The PROSPER (Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) trialevaluated the effect of pravastatin 40 mg on the risk of cardiovascular events in people aged 70–82 years (mean age 75 years). In the primary prevention subgroup of 3239 patients, statin therapy did not significantly reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke vs. placebo.

Based on data from the JUPITER (Justification for Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial, comparing Rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. placebo in patients with no history of cardiovascular disease and high C-reactive protein and low low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, subgroup analysis in the 5695 participants aged 70 years or older (median age 74 years) showed a significant reduction of cardiovascular events (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46–0.82), but not all-cause mortality (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–1.04).

The meta-analysis of primary prevention by Savarese et al.based on eight trials including 24 674 people over the age of 65 years with a mean age of 73 years concluded that statins vs. placebo significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction by 39.4% (95% CI 15.3–56.6%) and the risk of stroke by 23.8% (95% CI 7.4–37.4%), but statins did not provide any significant benefit on the risk of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.

The recent meta-analysis by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration, based on 28 trials, included a subgroup of 6449 primary prevention patients older than 75 years. Within this subgroup, cardiovascular incidence rates of 2.7 and 2.8 per 100 patient-years were found for the patient groups 'statin or more intensive treatment' and 'controls or less intensive treatment', respectively, corresponding to a rate ratio per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol of 0.92 (95% CI 0.73–1.16).

### Recommendations for (discontinuation of) statin treatment in older adults: review of guidelines [^114AArwt]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

Qualitative studies have shown that both physicians and patients are generally open to statin deprescription in the case of older adults. 19, 20, 21, 22 Nevertheless, medications, including statins, are often continued until death. 17, 23 It has been reported that physicians do not feel confident about deprescribing cardiovascular preventive medication and survey studies have found considerable treatment variation in the advice regarding discontinuation of preventive medication. 22, 24, 25 A likely contributing factor and an acknowledged barrier to deprescribing medications is the lack of evidence and clear guidance in clinical practice guidelines. 10, 21, 25 Therefore, the primary objective of this systematic review was to provide insight into the available recommendations regarding statin treatment discontinuation in older adults as provided by international guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in the general population. To explore the context of recommendations for discontinuation applicable to older adults, we additionally analyzed which other recommendations were formulated concerning statin treatment in older adults.

Randomized controlled trials — limitations and knowledge gaps: The guideline notes that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD and that most RCT data are with statin therapy, with limited add-on nonstatin data, leading to several priority questions including thresholds and indications for PCSK9 inhibitor use and statin intensity comparisons in primary prevention. Key statements include: "They have established that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD"; "Most of the data from RCTs have been obtained with statin therapy"; and questions such as "In secondary prevention, does a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exist, beyond which the incremental benefit attained is worth neither the risks nor the cost of additional therapy?", "In secondary prevention, what are the indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins?", "In primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe as compared with moderate-intensity statins alone?", and "Is statin therapy efficacious and safe in older patients (> 75 years of age)?".

Top 10 take-home messages to reduce risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease through cholesterol management — In all individuals, emphasize a heart-healthy lifestyle across the life course. In young adults 20 to 39 years of age, an assessment of lifetime risk facilitates the clinician–patient risk discussion and emphasizes intensive lifestyle efforts. In patients with clinical ASCVD, reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with high-intensity statin therapy or maximally tolerated statin therapy. Use a maximally tolerated statin to lower LDL-C levels by ≥ 50%. In very high-risk ASCVD, use a LDL-C threshold of 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) to consider addition of nonstatins to statin therapy. In very high-risk ASCVD patients, it is reasonable to add ezetimibe to maximally tolerated statin therapy when the LDL-C level remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L).

Patient Characteristics

Table 1 shows characteristics of patients recommended for statins for either primary or secondary prevention stratified by statin use: current users, discontinued, declined, and never offered. Current statin users were more likely to be male (60.6%) than those who discontinued (42.5%) or declined (41.8%) statin therapy. Current statin users also had the highest rate of any atherosclerotic disease (62.6%), followed by those who discontinued statins (52.2%) and those who declined a statin (37.9%). Education levels were similar between current users and those who discontinued or declined statins (63.6% versus 66.4% and 58.3%, respectively, with at least some college; P = 0.24 and P = 0.18). There was no statistically significant difference in income levels among current users, those who discontinued, and those who declined statins. However, those who declined statins were more likely to have private insurance (67.3%) than current statin users (57.3%, P = 0.02) or former statin users (55.3%, P = 0.0002). There was no significant difference in use of nonstatin lipid‐lowering medications between current and former statin users (26.9% versus 28.6%, P = 0.43), but those who declined statins were more likely than current users to use nonstatin therapy (35.8%, P = 0.02). Total cholesterol and LDL‐C levels were highest in former statin users. Among the primary prevention population, estimated 10‐year ASCVD risk was similar for those on a statin and those who discontinued, declined, or reported never having been offered a statin (14.4–14.5% 10‐year ASCVD risk; Table 1).

Conclusion and Future Directions

Although clinically relevant, the subject of statin discontinuation in older adults gets little attention in current international cardiovascular prevention guidelines, resulting in a lack of clear guidance for physicians reconsidering statin treatment in older adults with complex health problems. In this population, physicians will have to decide to continue or discontinue statins based on personal judgment, since evidence concerning the optimal duration of statin treatment in older frail adults or adults with multimorbidity is currently lacking. 46, 49, 50, 53 Grants to develop randomized trials on deprescribing in older adults will probably result in more evidence for deprescribing. Until higher‐level evidence becomes available, we suggest that new guidelines strive to combine available evidence with expert opinion and consensus techniques, to accommodate the need among physicians for more detailed recommendations regarding the implementation of deprescription of statins in practice. Issues, such as declining health status and short life expectancy, can already be discussed in guidelines as considerations for deprescription.

### Cardiovascular effect of discontinuing statins for primary prevention at the age of 75 years: a nationwide population-based cohort study in France [^115mnyu4]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The use of statin therapy for secondary prevention has been clearly established in all age groups. However, the role for statin therapy in primary prevention in the elderly remains a subject of debate, with little evidence for or against its benefit.

The available evidence is mainly derived from subgroup and post hoc analyses of the data of randomized trials. The results of these analyses in elderly individuals treated for primary prevention are inconsistent in terms of the effect on cardiovascular morbidity, while most studies reported a non-significant effect of statin therapy on all-cause mortality. Two relevant interventional studies have recently been launched, but their findings are expected only after 2020.

Consequently, the European guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemias and on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice, respectively, provide no recommendation for or against statin use for primary prevention in persons older than 75 years and the 2018 American College of Cardiology–American Heart Association (ACC-AHA) guidelines simply recommend a shared decision-making process between clinicians and these patients that targets individualized decisions, with regular reassessments over time. However, for older adults with a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score of 0, the likelihood of benefits from statin therapy does not outweigh the risks, according to the ACC-AHA guidelines. The three guidelines underline that in older patients lipid-lowering medication should be started at a lower dose than in younger subjects.

A particularly relevant practical question is whether existing statin therapy can be stopped in older people with no history of cardiovascular disease. This issue currently concerns a large proportion of the population over the age of 75 years as well as large numbers of people under the age of 75 years currently taking evidence-based treatment with statins and reaching ages for which only limited evidence of efficacy is available. None of the above mentioned guidelines provide specific recommendations for statin discontinuation for primary prevention in persons older than 75 years, except in older adults with severe age-related management complexities. To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated the impact of discontinuing primary prevention with statin therapy in older people.

We therefore conducted a study to assess the effect of statin discontinuation on cardiovascular outcomes in patients who turned 75 in 2012–14, previously adherent to statin therapy for at least 2 years with no history of cardiovascular disease, using the French healthcare databases.

### Discontinuation versus continuation of statins: a systematic review [^111Kradz]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians and patients often face a decision to continue or discontinue statins. We examined the impact of discontinuation of statins compared with continuation on clinical outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular [CV] mortality, CV events, and quality of life).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case-control studies, and quasi-randomized studies among people ≥ 18years were eligible. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Registry (inception to August 2023). Two independent reviewers performed screening and extracted data. Quality assessment was performed by one author and verified by another. We summarized results narratively, performed meta-analysis for a subset of studies, and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. We summarized findings in the subgroup of persons ≥ 75years.

Results

We retrieved 8369 titles/abstracts; 37 reports from 36 studies were eligible. This comprised 35 non-randomized studies (n = 1,708,684) and 1 RCT (n = 381). The 1 RCT was conducted among persons with life expectancy < 1year and showed there is probably no difference in 60-day mortality (risk difference = 3.5%, 90% CI -3.5 to 10.5) for statin discontinuation compared with continuation. Non-randomized studies varied in terms of population and setting, but consistently suggested that statin discontinuation might be associated with a relative increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.92, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.44, nine studies), CV mortality (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.10, five reports), and CV events (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.39, eight reports). Findings in people ≥ 75years were consistent with main results. There was a high degree of uncertainty in findings from non-randomized studies due to methodological limitations.

Conclusions

Statin discontinuation does not appear to affect short-term mortality near end-of-life based on one RCT. Outside of this population, findings from non-randomized studies consistently suggested statin discontinuation may be associated with worse outcomes, though this is uncertain.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in older adults and ezetimibe add-on — It is reasonable to consider continuation of high-intensity therapy in patients > 75 years of age with ASCVD if they are tolerating the statin and have a low risk of competing morbidities. It may be reasonable to add ezetimibe to moderate-intensity therapy in patients with ASCVD for whom high-intensity therapy is indicated but cannot be used, provided their LDL-C level remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) on moderate-intensity therapy; the same reasoning holds for any patient whose LDL-C level remains ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated statin therapy.

Conclusion

The results of this study suggest potential cardiovascular risk reduction associated with continuing statin therapy after the age of 75 years in persons already taking these drugs for primary prevention. However, due to the observational nature of this study, residual confounding cannot be excluded. Future studies, including interventional randomized studies, are needed to confirm these findings and support updating and clarification of guidelines on the use of statins for primary prevention in the elderly.

### Lifetime effects and cost-effectiveness of statin therapy for older people in the United kingdom: a modelling study [^112o3NEv]. Heart (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Statins are widely available generically and a cornerstone in cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. High-quality randomised evidence has shown that statins reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and ischaemic stroke by about one quarter for every 1 mmol/L reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). More intensive statin regimens achieve larger reductions in LDL-C and prevent more atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. However, there is less definitive evidence for statin benefit among older patients without CVD historyand guidelines stop short of making specific recommendations on initiating statins for primary CVD prevention in older people. Despite the growing proportion of older people (people ≥ 70 years old make up about 30% of those over the age of 40 years in the UK) and the markedly higher cardiovascular risk with increasing age, lower statin use is reported.

Evidence for treatments' long-term effects and cost-effectiveness guides healthcare decisions in many countries and healthcare systems, including in the UK. Such evidence ensures that by implementing cost-effective treatments, healthcare systems efficiently use their resources to maximise population health. Previous evidence has indicated that statin therapy is likely to be cost-effective for older people, but the estimates were sensitive to further adverse effects of statins or lower statin effectiveness. A recent individual participant data meta-analysis of large statin trials strengthened the evidence for efficacy and safety of statins in older people. Therefore, we set out to reassess the lifetime effects and cost-effectiveness of statin therapy in people ≥ 70 years old in the contemporary UK population, in categories by prior CVD, sex and LDL-C level, using this evidenceand a new UK CVD microsimulation model.

### Recommendations for (discontinuation of) statin treatment in older adults: review of guidelines [^1153SP4B]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES

As a person's age increases and his/her health status declines, new challenges arise that may lead physicians to consider deprescribing statins. We aimed to provide insight into recommendations available in international cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines regarding discontinuation of statin treatment applicable to older adults.

DESIGN

We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, EMCARE, and the websites of guideline development organizations and online guideline repositories for cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines aimed at the general population. We selected all guidelines with recommendations (instructions and suggestions) on discontinuation of statin treatment applicable to older adults, published between January 2009 and April 2019. In addition, we performed a synthesis of information from all other recommendations for older adults regarding statin treatment. Methodological quality of the included guidelines was appraised using the appraisal of guidelines for research & evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument.

RESULTS

Eighteen international guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention in the general adult population provided recommendations for statin discontinuation that were applicable to older adults. We identified three groups of instructions for statin discontinuation related to statin intolerance, and none was specifically aimed at older adults. Three guidelines also included suggestions to consider statin discontinuation in patients with poor health status. Of the 18 guidelines included, 16 made recommendations regarding statin treatment in older adults, although details on how to implement these recommendations in practice were not provided.

CONCLUSION

Current international cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines provide little specific guidance for physicians who are considering statin discontinuation in older adults in the context of declining health status and short life expectancy. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:417–425, 2020

Secondary ASCVD prevention — In patients who are 75 years of age or younger with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), high-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 50% or greater reduction in LDL-C levels; if high-intensity statin therapy is contraindicated or leads to statin-associated side effects, moderate-intensity statin therapy should be initiated or continued with the aim of achieving a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C levels. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are judged to be very high risk and considered for PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy should include maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe. For very high risk patients on maximally tolerated LDL-C lowering therapy with LDL-C 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) or a non-HDL-C level of 100 mg/dL or higher (≥ 2.6 mmol/L), it is reasonable to add a PCSK9 inhibitor following a clinician-patient discussion about the net benefit, safety, and cost, and in those on maximally tolerated statin therapy who are judged to be at very high risk and have an LDL-C level of 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it is reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy. At mid-2018 list prices, PCSK9 inhibitors have a low cost value (> $150,000 per QALY) compared to good cost value (< $50,000 per QALY). In patients older than 75 years of age with clinical ASCVD, it is reasonable to initiate moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy after evaluation of the potential for ASCVD risk reduction, adverse effects, and drug-drug interactions, as well as patient frailty and preferences, and in those older than 75 years who are tolerating high-intensity statin therapy, it is reasonable to continue high-intensity statin therapy after similar evaluation. In patients with clinical ASCVD who are receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy and whose LDL-C level remains 70 mg/dL or higher (≥ 1.8 mmol/L) it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe therapy, and in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction attributable to ischemic heart disease who have a reasonable life expectancy (3 to 5 years) and are not already on a statin because of ASCVD, clinicians may consider initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy to reduce the occurrence of ASCVD events.

### Reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after myocardial infarction in older individuals, levels versus change: can observational studies answer the questions? [^114h8VCU]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Observational studies have certain limitations for interpreting the efficacy of drug therapies compared with a clinical trial. This is especially important in policy decisions that affect large numbers of individuals. What are the problems with this study? First, 61% of the participants in the study had LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL and 25% had LDL‐C < 50 mg/dL at the first measurement after their heart attack and had already reached the proposed low levels of LDL‐C. These individuals cannot effect change in LDL‐C after heart attack and reduction of events. Second, there are no LDL‐C measurements before the heart attack so that measure of change in LDL‐C before and after starting statin therapy, an important variable in determining reduction in morbidity and mortality (ie, secondary prevention) is missing from the analysis. For example, individuals in this study who had low LDL‐C levels may include participants who had low LDL‐C levels most of their life because of either specific genetic polymorphisms of LDL‐C metabolism or lifestyle characteristics, such as diet (probably unlikely). 12 A small sample of individuals with low LDL‐C levels over their lifetime could develop progressive atherosclerosis and subsequent heart attacks at an older age. They may be at risk for a recurrent event, despite their low LDL‐C level.

Second, inflammation is also associated with lower levels of LDL‐C. Individuals with inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, have an increased risk of CVD, despite lower LDL‐C. There is also increased inflammation with aging. 13

Third, another group with low LDL‐C levels may be individuals who had higher LDL‐C levels much of their lifetime but have had a substantial decline in LDL‐C with aging, a well‐known phenomenon that is associated with increasing morbidity and mortality. 14 Similar declines occur in blood pressure and body weight with increasing aging and are associated with increasing morbidity and mortality. 15

Fourth, the lower LDL‐C levels for those receiving drug therapy may be because of use of more intense versus moderate drug therapy or the greater responsiveness of the individual to the drug therapy. The latter may be partly a genetic determinant and, in part, related to other lifestyles or drug therapies and, most important, to adherence to the drug therapies, a function, in part, of prevalence of adverse effects of drug therapy. The authors report an average number of statin prescriptions over time but not measures of adherence to drug therapies or whether the individuals actually took the medications.

### Assessment and management of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS): a clinical perspective from the National Lipid Association [^111Fv2Jw]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). High credibility.

National Lipid Association statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) management — many patients ultimately tolerate statins, and strategies include lower-dose statin, different statin, supplementation, and/or non-statins with defined low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) effects at specific doses and in combination therapy. The text states that approximately 60–80% of patients with SAMS are eventually able to tolerate some statin regimen and lists management strategies consisting of 1) same statin but lower dose, 2) different statin, 3) supplementation, and/or 4) non-statins. LDL-C lowering with statins is greatest at the lowest daily dose, which may achieve 2/3 of maximum effect with an additional 5–6% reduction from baseline with each doubling of dose; starting with atorvastatin 10 mg or rosuvastatin 5 mg offers a moderate intensity response that can result in a 33–45% reduction in LDL-C. Over 50% reduction in LDL-C can be achieved by adding ezetimibe or other non-statin pharmacotherapies to low to moderate-intensity statin treatment. In RACING, rosuvastatin 10 mg daily plus ezetimibe 10 mg daily versus rosuvastatin 20 mg daily was associated with lower drug discontinuation (4.8% vs 8.2%, p < 0.0001) and greater achievement of LDL-C < 70 mg/dL at years 1, 2, and 3 (73%, 75%, 72% vs 55%, 60%, 58%, all p < 0.0001). For persistent intolerance during low-dose therapy, intermittent (non-daily) dosing may be needed, and it is recommended to use statins with a longer half-life; there are accounts of 20–40% LDL-C lowering depending on dose and dosing interval.

Limitations and knowledge gaps — randomized controlled trials (RCTs) priorities: The guideline notes that it is based largely on RCT outcomes and that most RCT data are from statin therapy, with limited nonstatin add-on data; more data are needed and several questions remain for additional RCTs, including in secondary prevention whether a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exists beyond which incremental benefit is not worth risks or cost; what indications justify adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy; in patients with ASCVD who have statin-associated side effects whether PCSK9 inhibitors are an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins; in primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age with LDL-C < 90 mg/dL [< 2.3 mmol/L] with or without diabetes mellitus what incremental risk reduction high-intensity statins provide versus moderate-intensity statins; and in primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age with LDL-C < 190 mg/dL [< 4.9 mmol/L] with or without diabetes mellitus what the value is of ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors as an adjunct to maximally tolerated statin therapy.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Statin-associated side effects (SASEs) — evaluation and statin rechallenge: The most-encountered SASE in clinical practice is statin-associated muscle symptoms, which may occur in 5% to 20% of patients, and in the SAMSON trial, 90% of the adverse symptom effects experienced with drug therapy can be attributed to what is seen with a blinded placebo; for patients with SASEs who meet evidence-based guideline criteria for statin therapy, avoiding complete discontinuation of statin treatment is strongly recommended. The approach to SASEs should include discontinuation of statin therapy until resolution of symptoms and subsequent rechallenge to verify recurrence of muscle-related symptoms, and most experts recommend documentation of unacceptable muscle-related symptoms that resolve and recur on at least 2 (and preferably 3) statins, with differing metabolic pathways/lipophilicity and one prescribed at the lowest approved dose. Although not studied in RCTs nor FDA approved, alternative statin regimens may include alternate-day dosing with a long half-life statin (atorvastatin or rosuvastatin), de-escalation dosing (reducing 40-mg daily dosing to alternating between a 40- and a 20-mg statin every other day), or a lower daily dose (from 40 mg daily to 20 mg daily), and the majority of patients who experience SASEs are able to tolerate statin rechallenge with an alternative statin or dose reduction with the same statin.

### Key recommendations on managing dyslipidemia for… [^116nDcCL]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Prevention For secondary prevention, we recommend moderate-dose statins as the mainstay of treatment. This is consistent with trial evidence, and evidence is insufficient to show improved cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with higher-intensity treatment over moderate-dose statins. 11 Moderate-dose statins have fewer adverse effects than high-dose statins; therefore, we strongly recommend them as the first step in therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 1, 6 The ACC/AHA recommends intensive therapy in secondary prevention unless medications cannot be tolerated.
2. We recommend offering more intensive therapy to patients who wish to further reduce their risk. 1 Switching to high-dose statins and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statins reduces nonfatal cardiovascular events more than moderate-dose statins alone, each to a similar extent.

11 All were studied primarily in higher-risk populations, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, recurrent cardiac events, or tobacco use. Because of the uncertain long-term effects and high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, we recommend increasing the statin dose and adding ezetimibe before considering the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

1. Lipid Testing Although the ACC/AHA recommends treating to LDL-C targets, this paradigm has not been prospectively studied. 1, 2 All primary and secondary prevention trials compared medication doses, most often a medication compared with placebo. Although post-hoc meta-analyses show that higher-intensity medications correlate with lower LDL-C levels and lower event rates, these secondary analyses do not add any specificity to existing trial results. 12 We recommend treatment based on medication intensity to match the evidence, which also simplifies monitoring.

After starting medication based on treatment intensity, further measurement of cholesterol is unnecessary. Even while making primary prevention decisions, we find the evidence supports infrequent lipid monitoring. Risk calculators demonstrate that patient factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use influence risk scores significantly more than cholesterol values. Cholesterol levels are stable for up to 10 years, with most change between measurements due to testing variability. 13 There is no need to repeatedly measure cholesterol more than once a decade for risk calculations. Using previous cholesterol values to calculate risk every two to five years offers the opportunity to decrease unnecessary testing. When cholesterol levels are measured, nonfasting samples have equivalent accuracy and should be used routinely. Indications for fasting samples are limited, such as verifying hypertriglyceridemia if considering icosapent ethyl.

In 2016, an expert consensus panel from the ACC recommended the use of nonstatin therapies (ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors) in addition to maximally tolerated statin therapy in individuals whose LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol levels remained above certain thresholds after statin treatment. Given the substantial benefits of statin therapies in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, their long-term safety has become a concern. The potential harmful effects of statin therapy on muscle and liver have been known for some time, but new concerns have emerged regarding the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus, cognitive impairment and haemorrhagic stroke associated with the use of statins and the risks of achieving very low levels of LDL cholesterol. The increased media attention on the adverse events associated with statins has unfortunately led to statin therapy discontinuation, nonadherence to therapy or concerns about initiating statin therapy. In this Review, we explore the safety of statin therapy in light of the latest evidence and provide clinicians with reassurance about the safety of statins. Overwhelming evidence suggests that the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh any real or perceived risks.

### Discontinuation of lipid-modifying agents and failure to achieve target LDL cholesterol levels across cardiovascular risk groups [^11732TKQ]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) control remains suboptimal, with limited evidence on how adherence to lipid-modifying agents (LMAs) varies by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk.

Objective

To examine the relationship between LDL-C levels, adherence to LMAs, and ASCVD risk.

Methods

Adults (n = 4,262) prescribed LMAs between 2013 and 2023 (median age 60 years, 49% male) were categorised into low (< 5%), borderline (5% to < 7.5%), intermediate (7.5% to < 20%), and high (≥ 20%) 10-year ASCVD risk groups. Adherence was defined as having ≥ 1 prescription of LMA every 6 months, with adherence trajectories identified over 5 years using group-based trajectory analysis: gradual decline, rapid decline, and early discontinuation.

Results

Average LDL-C decreased from 3.6 ± 1.1 mmol/L (139.2 ± 42.5 mg/dL) to 2.7 ± 1.1 mmol/L (104.4 ± 42.5 mg/dL) across all risk groups, with only 23% achieving < 1.8 mmol/L (69.6 mg/dL) and 18% achieving ≥ 50% reduction. LDL-C was highest in the early discontinuation trajectory, across all ASCVD risk groups, averaging 2.9 mmol/L (112.1 mg/dL) in the low ASCVD risk group (42%), 2.8 mmol/L (108.3 mg/dL) in the borderline (13%), 2.5 mmol/L (96.7 mg/dL) in the intermediate (33%), and 2.3 mmol/L (88.9 mg/dL) in the high-risk group (11%). Higher LDL-C was associated with younger age, being male, non-smoking status, absence of diabetes, untreated blood pressure, early LMA discontinuation, higher total cholesterol ratio, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Conclusion

Long-term adherence to LMAs remains a challenge, particularly in low-risk. Target achievement was poor, highlighting gaps in therapeutic optimization, patient engagement, and monitoring.

### Recommendations for (discontinuation of) statin treatment in older adults: review of guidelines [^112ofkr7]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this systematic review of international guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention in the general population, we searched for recommendations concerning statin discontinuation applicable to older adults. We found that 18 (55%) of the 33 eligible guidelines provided one or more recommendations for discontinuation of statin treatment. Remarkably, the other 15 guidelines (45%) did not include any recommendations regarding statin discontinuation applicable to older adults, not even discontinuation for reasons such as contraindications. All the 18 included guidelines provided recommendations related to statin intolerance; however, none of these was exclusively for older adults. Sixteen guidelines contained instructions and three guidelines provided recommendations formulated as suggestions to consider statin discontinuation in (older) patients with poor health status. In addition, 16 of the included guidelines also provided other recommendations for statin treatment in older adults. Safety considerations were the most common recommendations, mostly formulated in general terms.

In a systematic review of guidelines and recommendations concerning primary cardiovascular disease prevention for older adults (search dates between April and December 2013), Jansen and colleagues noted that none of the included guidelines considered discontinuation of medication in older adults. 48 We noticed that some progress has been made since 2013. We found three guidelines that reported at least some recommendations regarding poor health in the context of statin discontinuation. 30, 31, 32 The latter were not exclusive to but were at least more prominent in older adults. Furthermore, the most recently updated guideline included in our study, the 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guideline on management of blood cholesterol, is the first guideline to include an extensive discussion on statin discontinuation and age‐related complexities in the preventive treatment of older adults. 32 It was unique in using the terms "deprescribing", "frailty", and "functional decline" in the context of statin discontinuation. However, in our view, the recommendations regarding statin discontinuation in this guideline were still formulated as suggestions ("it may be reasonable to"). Although factors are mentioned in the guideline that limit the potential benefits of statin treatment in older adults, such as frailty and functional decline, actually, these factors still do not have a clear circumscription. Therefore, it remains the physician's personal judgment to interpret to what extent the recommendations are applicable on an individual patient.

### Familial hypercholesterolaemia in children and adolescents: gaining decades of life by optimizing detection and treatment [^112ZXJQB]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Management

Early treatment of FH can reduce LDL-C burden (Figure 4), improve endothelial function, substantially attenuate the progression of atherosclerosis (Figure 3 B and C), and improve coronary outcomes (Figure 5),– all of which emphasizes the rationale for greater long-term benefit with initiation of treatment earlier rather than later in life. Furthermore, long-term follow-up from statin trials, albeit not specifically in FH patients, suggests a legacy effect, i.e. better CHD outcomes in those initially randomized to statin treatment. Table 4 summarizes key points related to FH management.

Figure 4
Impact of statin treatment on cholesterol burden in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Early initiation of statin treatment reduces the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol burden* in subjects with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Reproduced with permission from Vuorio et al.(A): Cumulative low-density lipoprotein cholesterol burden by age of 18 years is 15% lower in familial hypercholesterolaemia subjects treated with low dose statin from age 10 years (70 mmol) than in untreated familial hypercholesterolaemia subjects (80 mmol). (B) Cumulative low-density lipoprotein cholesterol burden of a 55-year-old non-familial hypercholesterolaemia subject is 160 mmol. In an untreated familial hypercholesterolaemia subject, this is attained by age 35 years, but is delayed in familial hypercholesterolaemia patients treated from age 18 years (48 years), and further delayed in those treated from age 10 years (53 years). *For calculation of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol burden, the following assumed mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values were used. Non-familial hypercholesterolaemia subjects: 2.0 mmol/L for the age range of 0–15 years; 2.5 mmol/L for 15–24 years; 3.0 mmol/L for 25–34 years; 3.5 mmol/L for 35–44 years; and 3.5 mmol/L for 45–54 years. Familial hypercholesterolaemia subjects: 4.5 mmol/L in untreated familial hypercholesterolaemia patients; 3 mmol/L in familial hypercholesterolaemia patients treated during the age range of 10–18 years, and 2.5 mmol/L in familial hypercholesterolaemia patients with treatment started at the age of 18 years.

Statin treatment — primary prevention in adults with diabetes: For people with diabetes aged 40–75 years without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), "use moderate-intensity statin therapy in addition to lifestyle therapy. A". For ages 20–39 years with additional ASCVD risk factors, "it may be reasonable to initiate statin therapy in addition to lifestyle therapy. C". For ages 40–75 years at higher cardiovascular risk, high-intensity statin therapy "is recommended to reduce LDL cholesterol by ≥ 50% of baseline and to obtain an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). A". In those 40–75 years at higher risk with "LDL cholesterol ≥ 70 mg/dL (≥ 1.8 mmol/L), it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy. B". In adults aged > 75 years already on statins, "it is reasonable to continue statin treatment. B", and for those aged > 75 years, "it may be reasonable to initiate moderate-intensity statin therapy after discussion of potential benefits and risks. C". For statin intolerance, "treatment with bempedoic acid is recommended to reduce cardiovascular event rates as an alternative cholesterol-lowering plan. A". Regarding pregnancy and contraception, "lipid-lowering agents should be stopped prior to conception and avoided in sexually active individuals of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception. B" and "statin therapy may be continued when the benefits outweigh risks. E".

Research needs and gaps — Priority evidence gaps include determining the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statins for primary prevention in adults 76 years or older; establishing the efficacy and safety of long-term statin use in adults younger than 40 years and the effects of earlier vs delayed initiation in persons with an estimated high long-term (longer than 10 years, lifetime) risk of CVD; conducting trials that directly compare titration to target lipid levels vs fixed-dose therapy and higher- vs lower-intensity statins powered for clinical outcomes; definitively determining whether statin therapy is associated with increased risk of diabetes in primary prevention populations; and clarifying the role of patient preferences across the spectrum of CVD risk.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^113mhgJf]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Clinician–patient risk discussion — thresholds and content states that "In those with a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥ 7.5%, it is recommended that the discussion occur before a statin prescription is written". The discussion "should consider whether ASCVD risk factors have been addressed, evaluate whether an optimal lifestyle has been implemented, and review the potential for statin benefit versus the potential for adverse effects and drug–drug interactions", after which "a risk decision about statin therapy can be made (Table 7)". It specifies that "Clinicians should indicate that as ASCVD risk increases, so does benefit of evidence-based LDL-C–lowering therapy", and that "for those at intermediate-risk, especially those > 55 years of age, risk-enhancing factors or CAC can be used to clarify risk if the risk decision is uncertain". The text notes risk-enhancing factors, such as "family history of premature ASCVD or an LDL-C of 160 to 189 mg/dL (4.1–4.8 mmol/L)", in the context of intermediate-risk decisions.

### Patient-reported reasons for declining or discontinuing statin therapy: insights from the PALM registry [^115VgKgE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Results

Of the 5693 adults in the PALM registry who met ACC/AHA guidelines for statin therapy, 3184 (55.9%) had prior ASCVD and 2509 (44.1%) had an ACC/AHA indication for primary prevention statin use. The median ages of these primary and secondary prevention populations were 66 and 70 years, respectively; 51.9% and 36.3%, respectively, were female; and 17.7% and 10.1%, respectively, self‐identified as black race.

Overall, 26.5% (n = 1511) of adults recommended for treatment were not on treatment, including 37.7% (n = 945) of those recommended for primary prevention and 17.8% (n = 566) of those recommended for secondary prevention. Of the 1511 adults recommended for but not on statin therapy, 894 (59.2%) reported never having been offered a statin, 464 (30.7%) reported having previously taken a statin but discontinuing therapy, and 153 (10.1%) had been offered statin therapy but declined (Figure 1).

### Reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after myocardial infarction in older individuals, levels versus change: can observational studies answer the questions? [^112T4wMN]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The likelihood of either a placebo or statin clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of intense statin therapy versus moderate or no statin therapy in the very elderly or the use of PCSK9 inhibitors with or without statin therapy in this very old age group (aged ≥ 80 years) with long‐term follow‐up efficacy for multiple end points would be an important contribution, extremely unlikely to occur at least in the United States.

The current article by Alter et al 10 in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) was an observational study and not a clinical trial that evaluated the potential efficacy of intensive versus moderate statin therapy in elderly individuals. The study followed up the participants for up to 8.8 years, but median follow‐up was only 2.5 years, a major limitation in interpreting the results of the study. 11 They focused on secondary prevention (ie, individuals had an MI, evaluation of risk of recurrent MIs, other CHD, CVD, and total mortality) ≥ 30 days after initial MI in relation to the level of LDL‐C measured after the heart attack for individuals receiving statin therapy. Individuals not receiving statin therapy were excluded from the study. Their result suggested little further reduction in the number of subsequent heart attacks, other CVD, stroke, CVD, or total mortality if a greater percentage of older individuals, either 65 to 74 or ≥ 75 years, had LDL‐C levels reduced to either 70 or 50 mg% by statin therapy after MI. The study does not compare the use of statins with no statin therapy in elderly individuals nor does it measure the change in LDL‐C level before and after statin therapy.

Life years and QALYs gained (A) and cost-effectiveness (B) of lifetime statin therapy in categories by prior cardiovascular disease, sex and pre-treatment LDL cholesterol level. Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER) is the ratio of the incremental costs divided by the incremental QALYs with costs and QALYs discounted at 3.5% per year. CVD, cardiovascular disease; LDL, low density lipoprotein; QALY, quality-adjusted life years.

Probability that lifetime statin therapy is cost-effective in categories by prior cardiovascular disease, sex and pre-treatment LDL cholesterol level. The probability that the treatment scenario provides the highest QALYs gain at the particular threshold of cost-effectiveness plotted. CVD, cardiovascular disease; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; QALY, quality-adjusted life years.

These cost-effectiveness results remained robust in a wide range of sensitivity analyses (figure 4, online supplemental table 5) with higher sensitivity noted for a higher intensity statin at a five times higher price. In particular, although reduced gains in QALYs were projected, standard statin therapy remained cost-effective in people ≥ 70 years old if relative risk reductions after age 75 were equal to those reported in the subgroup of participants > 75 years old, or indeed in the subgroup of participants > 75 years old without CVD at randomisation, in the CTTC meta-analysis (figures4 5 and online supplemental figure 1). Higher intensity statin therapy remained cost-effective among older people with pretreatment cholesterol levels 3.4 mmol/L or higher. In these scenario analyses with lower CVD risk reductions with statin therapy, the probability of standard or higher intensity statin therapy being cost-effective remained higher than no statin therapy in all categories of older people but was substantially reduced among older women with lower LDL-C levels.

### Does lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with statin restore low risk in middle-aged adults? Analysis of the observational Mesa study [^116L96L9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

MESA is a high‐quality CVD cohort study, with in‐person assessment of CVD risk factors and close follow‐up for CVD events. Of note, much of what is known about the role of CAC scoring in CVD risk assessment has been derived from analyses conducted within the MESA study. Thus, we have a high degree of confidence in the quality of exposure and outcome data used in this analysis. However, several limitations should be noted as well. First, to be included in this analysis, individuals must have been enrolled in MESA at the baseline exam. Thus, individuals who died or developed CVD before the age of 50 years were not included in the sample. Consequently, survival bias could be present, but this would likely bias our results toward the null, meaning that the effects reported above may in fact be an underestimate of the true effects of prevalent CAC on residual ASCVD risk. Second, CAC scoring does not detect noncalcified, "soft" plaque. Although a similar amount of residual risk could be present in participants with noncalcified plaque, these data do not directly address this question; thus, such an inference should be made with caution. Third, statin therapy assignment was not randomized in MESA; thus, unmeasured confounders could explain the residual risks seen in patients with CAC who were treated with statins. For example, MESA participants treated with statins may have been perceived to be at higher risk by clinicians; thus, the initiation of statin therapy, not CAC, may be a marker of increased risk. However, similar patterns of higher risk were seen in MESA participants with CAC who were not on statin therapy, suggesting that CAC, not statins, is the marker of risk. Furthermore, although confounding by indication may weaken the statin treatment effect observed in this analysis, individuals with CAC treated to LDL‐C < 70 mg/dL had lower risk point estimates than were observed in participants with CAC who were treated to an LDL‐C > 70 mg/dL. Further, statin treatment to LDL‐C < 100 mg/dL was not associated with higher risk than was observed in the reference group when CAC was not considered in the analysis despite higher predicted risks in these groups, again suggesting that the expected effects of statin therapy were present.

### Predictors of first-year statin medication discontinuation: a cohort study [^114VuWyi]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Statins are one of the most widely studied and evidence-based medicationsand are an essential component of cardiovascular disease prevention. Statins are well tolerated, safe, and inexpensive (when following the generic substitution). Despite these well-documented benefits, poor adherence to statins and an extreme form of it, discontinuation — that is, quitting statin medication use — is common among primary and secondary prevention patients. In clinical trials, the discontinuation rates range from 4% to 11%, but in routine care, the rates are much higher; between 11% and 53%. According to studies using electronic medical records, approximately 25% to 50% of patients discontinue statin use within six months to one year after initiating their use. The number of patients continuing therapy falls sharply in the first few months of treatment, followed by a more gradual decline.

Discontinuation is commonly attributed to statin-related adverse events, but, because most patients who reinitiate statin use can tolerate this medication long-term, many of these events may have had other etiologies. Previous studies on the determinants of discontinuation have reported mixed results. Some found a greater tendency to discontinue statin treatment among the young (< 50 years) or old (> 70 years), with high co-payment, for primary prevention patients, and intensive dose therapy. An increased risk of statin discontinuation has also been found for smokers, and patients with diabetes, despite the current guidelines recommending statin medication for nearly all patients with type 2 diabetes. On the contrary, one study found diabetes to be associated with the continuation of lipid-lowering drugs (of which statins accounted for 69%). However, other studies have shown no association between discontinuation and age, diabetes, or smoking.

This study was aimed at identifying patient groups with an increased likelihood to discontinue statins in a large prospective cohort linked to prescription registers. A better understanding of the determinants of adherence to statin treatment is important because discontinuation is common, and it significantly increases both the incidence of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular eventsand, among high-risk patients, also all-cause mortality. Because the decision concerning the continuation of statin-use is commonly made during the first year of treatment, we restricted our analysis to predictors of discontinuation during the first year of medication.

Visit 3 — follow-up and potential initiation: If goal levels of atherogenic cholesterol have been attained, responses to therapy should be monitored at intervals of 6 to 12 months. Moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy should be considered for very high-risk patients irrespective of atherogenic cholesterol levels, and if goal levels have not been attained and the patient's levels remain above the threshold for consideration of drug therapy, drug treatment might be initiated.

Adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy and CAC use: In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), if statin therapy is chosen after a risk discussion, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended; in this group LDL-C should be reduced by 30% or more, and for high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) levels should be reduced by 50% or more. In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated. In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended. In diabetes with multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more. In intermediate-risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) adults, risk-enhancing factors favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy, and in patients at borderline risk (5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk) risk-enhancing factors may justify initiation of moderate-intensity statin therapy. When coronary artery calcium (CAC) is measured to guide treatment in intermediate-risk or selected borderline-risk adults: if the CAC score is zero, it is reasonable to withhold statin therapy and reassess in 5 to 10 years absent higher-risk conditions; if CAC is 1 to 99, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy for patients ≥ 55 years of age; if CAC is 100 or higher or in the 75th percentile or higher, it is reasonable to initiate statin therapy.

### Recommendations for (discontinuation of) statin treatment in older adults: review of guidelines [^116nsXFv]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

A total of 9502 records were identified by database searching, 3368 of which were duplicate records. Of the 6134 remaining records, 6060 were found to be irrelevant (not guidelines or of different topics) based on title or abstract. We identified an additional 60 records from other websites from which we excluded 37 as duplicate records. These searches finally yielded 97 potentially relevant records to be screened for eligibility, of which 64 were excluded for reasons described in Figure 1 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses flow chart). 27 During the consensus meetings, the investigators agreed that summary documents, which provide guidelines without the full scientific background, were also to be excluded.

The remaining 33 records were guidelines containing recommendations for statin treatment in the general adult population that originated from 11 different countries/regions (Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, United Kingdom, United States, and Qatar). Of these 33 guidelines, 15 (45%) did not include recommendations regarding statin discontinuation applicable to older adults at all, not even discontinuation for reasons such as contraindications, and were, therefore, excluded from the study.

The remaining 18 international guidelines were included in this study, and the primary characteristics of these guidelines are described in Table 1. With the exception of one guideline, 31 none of the guidelines included an upper age limit in the description of the population covered. Four guidelines stated that recommendations for certain populations, such as people with limited life expectancy, were not included. 30, 31, 42, 44 Sixteen guidelines (excluding two 19, 46) included recommendations for both primary and secondary prevention. One guideline 46 did not include a quality grading system for assessment of the level of evidence supporting the recommendations. All guidelines included one or more expert or consensus‐based recommendations.
