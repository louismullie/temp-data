## Question

management of pancreatitis that is getting worse

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about management of acute pancreatitis that is getting worse. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define and verify that the patient is truly "getting worse". Then, I should decide when to escalate the level of care and assemble the right multidisciplinary team. Next, I will reassess fluids with goal-directed endpoints and correct an older tendency toward aggressive hydration. After that, I will organize organ support priorities, evaluate for infected necrosis and use antibiotics appropriately, establish early enteral nutrition, plan timed intervention with a delayed step-up approach, and build in scheduled reassessment and de-escalation. Finally, I should address etiology and secondary prevention, document key metrics, and acknowledge evidence gaps that require judgment and verification at each step [^112dtrSj].

> Let me first confirm what constitutes clinical deterioration in acute pancreatitis so I do not jump to conclusions; persistent organ failure beyond 48 hours, ongoing SIRS, rising hematocrit or BUN suggesting inadequate resuscitation, new or worsening hemodynamic instability, and clinical concern for infected necrosis are the red flags that should trigger urgent bedside reassessment of vitals, urine output, oxygen needs, and mental status, while I calculate dynamic risk with BISAP and APACHE II to quantify severity and trajectory [^114JVgj1] [^112hfCU3] [^115d2Swf] [^116wGGZL] [^112dtrSj].

> Hold on, I should verify the level of care and team; deterioration or persistent organ failure warrants ICU or a high-dependency monitored setting, and I should activate a multidisciplinary group including gastroenterology, critical care, interventional radiology, surgery, infectious diseases, and nutrition, arranging transfer if a tertiary center is needed to access endoscopy and IR capabilities [^112dtrSj] [^116of1Zt] [^111hcDxc].

> Wait, let me verify the fluid strategy because this is easy to overdo; I initially thought early aggressive hydration was beneficial, but the NEJM trial showed more fluid overload without outcome benefit compared with a moderate, goal-directed approach, so I should correct toward measured resuscitation with a small bolus only for hypovolemia, a baseline rate around 1.5 ml/kg/hr, and frequent reassessment within 6 hours and over the next 24–48 hours aiming for falling BUN, adequate urine output, and avoidance of hemodilution or overload [^115n3A9i] [^114EjzNE] [^114kcCwV] [^114989z9] [^1139JBPT].

> Let me think about organ support next; for respiratory compromise, I will escalate oxygen, consider noninvasive ventilation or intubation when indicated, for circulatory instability I will start norepinephrine if hypotension persists after conservative fluids and monitor perfusion, for renal dysfunction I should consider early continuous renal replacement when oliguria persists, and for analgesia I will use a multimodal plan and consider epidural as an adjunct when expertise is available while I confirm that no specific opioid restriction is supported by evidence [^1178vF9v] [^111iKwLG] [^114zjbSo].

> I need to check for infected necrosis because that is a critical pivot; I should avoid prophylactic antibiotics, rely on rising procalcitonin as a sensitive signal of bacterial infection risk, obtain contrast-enhanced CT optimally at 72–96 hours to assess local complications and look for gas in collections, and recognize that CT-guided FNA can confirm infection but is no longer routine; if clinical suspicion is high with deterioration and sepsis physiology, then I will start antibiotics that penetrate pancreatic tissue and de-escalate or stop if cultures are negative and the patient stabilizes [^112dtrSj] [^1138wSCP] [^114M78xD] [^115DZ8Sg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should not delay nutrition unnecessarily; early enteral feeding within 24–48 hours via nasogastric or nasojejunal routes is preferred over parenteral feeding, polymeric formulas are acceptable, and this strategy helps preserve gut integrity and reduce infectious complications, which is particularly relevant if necrosis is present or evolving [^1169EYhx] [^1178vF9v] [^11261Tni].

> Next, I should review the timing and type of intervention for necrosis and verify exceptions; the default is to delay until walled-off necrosis at or beyond 4 weeks, start with percutaneous or endoscopic drainage in a step-up sequence, proceed to minimally invasive necrosectomy only if necessary, and reserve open surgery as a last resort, but I must not miss urgent exceptions such as abdominal compartment syndrome, uncontrolled bleeding despite endovascular therapy, bowel ischemia or necrosis, or bowel fistula into a collection that require emergent surgical input [^117MehMN] [^116oPMiR] [^116of1Zt].

> I should double-check my reassessment cadence; within 24–48 hours of any intervention or major change, I will repeat focused clinical examinations for fever and organ function trends, reassess labs including WBC and procalcitonin to consider stopping antibiotics if improving, and if there is no clinical progress I will obtain interval imaging, often a repeat contrast-enhanced CT at about 7–10 days, to guide further drainage or step-up decisions and to exclude missed complications such as pseudoaneurysm or fistula [^111qLgrq] [^112hfCU3] [^116of1Zt].

> But wait, what if I am missing the precipitant and secondary prevention; after stabilization I should address etiology with early cholecystectomy for biliary pancreatitis, timed before discharge in mild disease and within weeks for necrotizing disease when feasible, institute alcohol cessation support, treat hypertriglyceridemia, and screen for exocrine insufficiency to start enzyme replacement when indicated to reduce recurrent morbidity and nutritional compromise [^111gjZ9m] [^1154LBGw] [^114JVgj1].

> Hold on, I should verify documentation and quality markers because they drive safer care; I will record serial BISAP or APACHE II scores, fluid balance and reassessment endpoints, antibiotic indications and days, timing and type of interventions within the step-up pathway, and I will schedule follow-up at 4–6 weeks to evaluate for duct disruption, pseudocyst, or persistent pain requiring additional endoscopic or surgical planning [^115d2Swf] [^116wGGZL] [^11261Tni].

> Let me reconsider two common pitfalls to ensure I am not repeating them; first, I used to favor empiric prophylactic antibiotics in severe disease, but current guidance advises against this unless there is high suspicion or confirmation of infection, so I should correct that habit, and second, I previously leaned toward early debridement, but delaying to a walled-off phase with a step-up strategy reduces complications and can obviate surgery in many patients [^112dtrSj] [^115DZ8Sg] [^117MehMN].

> I should confirm one last point about uncertainty; across guidelines, many strong recommendations rely on moderate or low-quality evidence, so I need to maintain vigilant self-checks, tailor decisions to patient trajectory and local expertise, and convene multidisciplinary review when the pathway is unclear, particularly in deteriorating patients where rigid algorithms may not fit [^114Cp5Kd] [^114pR8Di].

For worsening pancreatitis, prioritize **early ICU transfer** for persistent organ failure or rapid deterioration [^112dtrSj] [^1112MVtk], alongside **moderately aggressive fluid resuscitation** with lactated Ringer's [^115n3A9i] and frequent reassessment to avoid overload [^114989z9]. Initiate **early enteral nutrition** within 24–48 hours [^112posCB]; reserve broad-spectrum antibiotics for suspected or confirmed infected necrosis [^111DcXgA] [^114gcKy5]. Obtain contrast-enhanced CT at 72–96 hours [^1138wSCP] to assess necrosis and complications, and apply a **step-up approach** starting with percutaneous or endoscopic drainage for infected necrosis [^117MehMN], reserving surgery for refractory cases or complications such as abdominal compartment syndrome [^116oPMiR]. Management should be **multidisciplinary** [^116of1Zt], with transfer to a tertiary center if needed [^111hcDxc].

---

## Clinical assessment and monitoring

- **Severity assessment**: Use the Revised Atlanta Classification [^113a3JmH] and Determinant-Based Classification to guide management [^111LhFVs].

- **Risk factors**: Elevated BUN, hematocrit, obesity, comorbidities, and SIRS increase risk of severe disease [^1155pwXc] [^112hfCU3].

- **Monitoring**: Frequent reassessment of hemodynamics, organ function, and laboratory parameters (BUN, hematocrit, CRP, procalcitonin) is essential [^114kcCwV] [^112hfCU3].

---

## Fluid resuscitation

Use **moderate fluid resuscitation** [^115n3A9i] with lactated Ringer's and frequent reassessment to avoid overload [^114kcCwV]. Goals include maintaining **urine output ≥ 0.5 mL/kg/h** [^1139JBPT], normalizing BUN [^114kcCwV], and avoiding fluid overload.

---

## Nutritional support

Initiate **early enteral nutrition** within 24–48 hours to reduce complications and mortality [^112posCB] [^11261Tni]. The preferred **route** is nasogastric or nasojejunal feeding; avoid parenteral nutrition unless enteral feeding is not feasible.

---

## Antibiotic therapy

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are indicated only for suspected or confirmed **infected necrosis** [^115DZ8Sg] or **extrapancreatic infections**. Prophylaxis with routine antibiotics is **not recommended**.

---

## Imaging and intervention

Obtain **contrast-enhanced CT or MRI at 72–96 hours** to assess necrosis and complications [^1138wSCP]. Use a **step-up approach**, beginning with percutaneous or endoscopic drainage for infected necrosis [^117MehMN] and reserving surgery for refractory cases or complications (e.g. abdominal compartment syndrome) [^116oPMiR].

---

## Multidisciplinary care and transfer

A **multidisciplinary team** should include gastroenterologists, surgeons, interventional radiologists, intensivists, infectious disease specialists, and nutritionists [^116of1Zt]. Transfer patients with **extensive necrosis** or **persistent organ failure** to tertiary centers with advanced capabilities [^111hcDxc].

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^114gcKy5]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are always recommended to treat infected severe acute pancreatitis. However, the diagnosis is challenging due to the clinical picture that cannot be distinguished from other infectious complications or from the inflammatory status caused by acute pancreatitis. Serum measurements of procalcitonin (PCT) may be valuable in predicting the risk of developing infected pancreatic necrosis. A CT-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) for Gram stain and culture can confirm infected severe acute pancreatitis and drive antibiotic therapy, but it is no longer in routine use.

- **Discussion**: Antibiotics are always recommended to treat infected acute pancreatitis. However, the diagnosis of infected pancreatitis is challenging due to the clinical picture that cannot be distinguished from other infectious complications or from the inflammatory status caused by acute pancreatitis. The timing of infection in pancreatic necrosis is variable and unpredictable, peaking in the second to fourth week after the onset of pancreatitis. Clinical signs may be very sensitive yet are not specific enough.

A limited number of smaller studies evaluated C-reactive protein (CRP). Conversely, PCT has been investigated as an effective predictor for the severity of acute pancreatitis and the risk of developing infected pancreatitis. PCT is the inactive 116 amino acid propeptide of the biologically active hormone calcitonin, which was first described to have significantly increased concentrations in patients with bacterial and fungal infections.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^1112MVtk]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

- **Diagnosis**: The criteria to establish the diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis include persistent organ failure (cardiovascular, respiratory, and/or renal) and high mortality. Imaging work-up for suspected severe acute pancreatitis involves using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound (US), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and other ancillary tests. Laboratory parameters essential in the diagnostic process should be considered. It is also important to examine how different etiologies affect the diagnostic workup. Appropriate scores for risk assessment must be identified, alongside determining the timing and suitable test for early follow-up imaging.

- **Statements (severity grading)**: Severe acute pancreatitis is closely linked to persistent organ failure and a high risk of mortality. The Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant-based Classification are both effective in diagnosing and assessing the severity of acute pancreatitis. Patients suffering from persistent organ failure with infected necrosis face the highest risk of death. Admission to an intensive care unit is recommended for patients with organ failures whenever possible.

- **Discussion**: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a condition featuring acute inflammation of the pancreas with acinar cell destruction. Diagnosing AP requires at least two of the following three criteria: (i) abdominal pain consistent with the disease, (ii) biochemical evidence of pancreatitis, such as serum amylase and/or lipase levels greater than three times the upper limit.

### American Gastroenterological Association clinical practice update: Management of pancreatic necrosis [^116of1Zt]. Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of acute pancreatitis, specifically in the context of care settings, the AGA 2020 guidelines recommend a multidisciplinary approach. This approach should include gastroenterologists, surgeons, interventional radiologists, and specialists in critical care medicine, infectious disease, and nutrition for optimal management of patients with pancreatic necrosis due to substantial morbidity and mortality. It is advisable to transfer patients with significant pancreatic necrosis to an appropriate tertiary care center when clinical expertise may be limited.

### What's new in the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^112posCB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

What is new in therapy?

Several interventions have been identified as critical within the first 48 hours, particularly fluid resuscitation, analgesia, and nutritional support.

- **Fluid therapy**: Sustainable scientific and clinical data on guiding fluid therapy in this disease are still scarce. A recent review highlighted the concept of early aggressive resuscitation, guided by clinical estimation and the assessment of BUN and hematocrit levels. Recent results from a small retrospective single-center cohort study seem to support such an aggressive approach in severe AP, whereas data from another prospective study reported that excessive hydration (10–15 ml/kg/h), aimed at obtaining a hematocrit of 35%, resulted in increased organ failure, respiratory insufficiency, and mortality. Whether guiding fluid therapy by cardiac output measurements and/or assessment of fluid responsiveness will improve the management of this important therapeutic action with positive effects on outcomes, as shown in recent experimental studies, needs to be confirmed in clinical settings.

- **Analgesia**: Due to the severity of pain in severe AP, opioids are widely used. However, there is uncertainty whether their side effect of inducing spasms of smooth muscles may obscure the resolution of the disease or induce additional pain. Data from a recent Cochrane analysis do not support these concerns, but, as stated by the authors, this analysis is based on a very limited number of heterogeneous trials [Cochrane Database Syst Rev Jul 26;7:CD00].

### Aggressive or moderate fluid resuscitation in acute pancreatitis [^115n3A9i]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Early aggressive hydration is widely recommended for the management of acute pancreatitis, but evidence for this practice is limited.

- **Methods**: At 18 centers, we randomly assigned patients who presented with acute pancreatitis to receive goal-directed aggressive or moderate resuscitation with lactated Ringer's solution. Aggressive fluid resuscitation consisted of a bolus of 20 mL per kilogram of body weight, followed by 3 mL per kilogram per hour. Moderate fluid resuscitation consisted of a bolus of 10 mL per kilogram in patients with hypovolemia or no bolus in patients with normovolemia, followed by 1.5 mL per kilogram per hour in all patients in this group. Patients were assessed at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours, and fluid resuscitation was adjusted according to the patient's clinical status. The primary outcome was the development of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis during the hospitalization. The main safety outcome was fluid overload. The planned sample size was 744, with a first planned interim analysis after the enrollment of 248 patients.

- **Results**: A total of 249 patients were included in the interim analysis. The trial was halted owing to between-group differences in the safety outcomes without a significant difference in the incidence of moderately severe or severe pancreatitis (22.1% in the aggressive-resuscitation group and 17.3% in the moderate-resuscitation group; adjusted relative risk, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.78 to 2.18; P = 0.32). Fluid overload developed in 20.5% of the patients who received aggressive resuscitation and in 6.3%.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^116oPMiR]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to general principles, the WSES 2019 guidelines recommend performing surgical interventions as a continuum in a step-up approach after percutaneous or endoscopic procedures. These should follow the same indications or be considered in patients with any of the following conditions:

- **Abdominal compartment syndrome**: Surgical intervention is advised under this condition.

- **Acute ongoing bleeding**: If the endovascular approach is unsuccessful, surgical intervention is recommended.

- **Bowel ischemia or acute necrotizing cholecystitis during acute pancreatitis**: These conditions warrant surgical consideration.

- **Bowel fistula extending into a peripancreatic collection**: Surgical intervention is suggested in this scenario.

Regarding medical management for acute pancreatitis, particularly in terms of antibiotic therapy, the BPIGS 2016 guidelines recommend a step-up approach. This includes the use of antibiotics, followed by image-guided drainage, and surgical intervention if necessary. This approach is suggested for patients with FNA-confirmed infections of acute necrotic collections or walled-off pancreatic necrosis.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^112QfvGG]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Although most patients with acute pancreatitis have the mild form of the disease, about 20–30% develop a severe form, often associated with single or multiple organ dysfunction requiring intensive care. Identifying the severe form early is one of the major challenges in managing severe acute pancreatitis. Infection of the pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis occurs in about 20–40% of patients with severe acute pancreatitis and is associated with worsening organ dysfunctions. While most patients with sterile necrosis can be managed nonoperatively, patients with infected necrosis usually require an intervention that can be percutaneous, endoscopic, or open surgical.

These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis from a collaboration of a panel of experts meeting during the World Congress of Emergency Surgery from June 27–30, 2018, in Bertinoro, Italy. The main topics of these guidelines include:

- **Diagnosis**: Early and accurate identification is crucial.
- **Antibiotic treatment**: Best practices for preventing infections.
- **Management in the intensive care unit**: Strategies for handling severe cases.
- **Surgical and operative management**: Indications for interventions.
- **Open abdomen**: Guidelines for managing complex cases.

### American College of Gastroenterology guideline: Management of acute pancreatitis [^111DcXgA]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

This guideline presents recommendations for the management of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP). During the past decade, there have been new understandings and developments in the diagnosis, etiology, and early and late management of the disease. As the diagnosis of AP is most often established by clinical symptoms and laboratory testing, contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pancreas should be reserved for patients for whom the diagnosis is unclear or who fail to improve clinically. Hemodynamic status should be assessed immediately upon presentation, and resuscitative measures begun as needed. Patients with organ failure and/or the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) should be admitted to an intensive care unit or intermediary care setting whenever possible. Aggressive hydration should be provided to all patients, unless cardiovascular and/or renal comorbidities preclude it. Early aggressive intravenous hydration is most beneficial within the first 12–24 hours and may have little benefit beyond. Patients with AP and concurrent acute cholangitis should undergo endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) within 24 hours of admission. Pancreatic duct stents and/or postprocedure rectal nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) suppositories should be utilized to lower the risk of severe post-ERCP pancreatitis in high-risk patients. Routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in patients with severe AP and/or sterile necrosis is not recommended. In patients with infected necrosis, antibiotics known to penetrate effectively should be considered.

---

### Position paper: Timely interventions in severe acute pancreatitis are crucial for survival [^116F9dGS]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

If prophylactic antibiotics are not given, the empiric use of antibiotics is encouraged in patients who develop organ dysfunctions, due to the high risk of bacteremia during the first week. Patients with severe pancreatitis fulfill the criteria of severe sepsis in case of infection, and there is no rapid and reliable diagnostic method available to rule out infection. Delayed administration of antibiotics has been shown to worsen survival in patients with severe sepsis, with or without septic shock. After the end of the second week, empiric antibiotics may be needed for treating infected pancreatic necrosis if sepsis continues or the patient does not recover. Empiric antibiotics at this stage should cover potential pathogens including gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci. The role of empiric antifungals is unclear. Fine needle aspiration for microbiological samples should be taken if infected necrosis is suspected, although negative samples do not rule out infection. Positive samples help in selecting antimicrobials and initiating possible antifungal therapy. Prophylactic or empiric antibiotics should be discontinued when the patient recovers from organ dysfunctions and there is no evidence of infection.

- **Surgery for infected necrosis**: Infected pancreatic or peripancreatic necrosis has traditionally been considered an indisputable indication for surgical debridement. Infected necrosis is a significant source of sepsis, and the removal of devitalized tissue is believed to be necessary for control of sepsis. However, infection usually continues after necrosectomy.

Regarding medical management for acute pancreatitis, and more specifically with respect to supportive care and fluid therapy, the AGA 2018 guidelines recommend considering the use of goal-directed therapy for fluid management in patients with acute pancreatitis.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^115RGnS9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

- **Intensive care unit**: Questions regarding intensive care unit (ICU) admission include: Which are the indications for ICU admission? When is fluid resuscitation indicated, and which fluid should be used? What is the optimal fluid infusion rate, and how should response to initial resuscitation be measured? What is the preferred pharmacologic approach to persistent shock? What is the correct approach for pain control? What are the indications for mechanical ventilation? What is the medical approach to the abdominal compartment syndrome? What role do medications such as Gabexate Mesilate and somatostatin analogues play? Regarding enteral nutrition, what are the indications, what type of nutrition should be used, and what is the best method for administering enteral nutrition?

- **Statement (monitoring)**: Continuous vital signs monitoring in the high dependency care unit is necessary if organ dysfunction occurs. Persistent organ dysfunction or organ failure despite adequate fluid resuscitation is an indication for ICU admission (1C).

- **Discussion**: Worldwide heterogeneity in intensive and intermediate care unit settings complicates the definition of universal pathways. There is no single marker capable of defining the severity of the illness. Instead, several scoring systems should be used to assess severity at different phases, places, and patient conditions. Extensive fluid administration, adequate pain management using potentially harmful strategies, and organ function evaluation during initial treatment underscore the importance of continuous vital signs monitoring, regardless of the setting. Persistent organ dysfunction despite adequate fluid resuscitation highlights this necessity.

### American College of Gastroenterology guidelines: Management of acute pancreatitis [^112dtrSj]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for acute pancreatitis, more specifically with respect to risk assessment, ACG 2024 guidelines recommend obtaining hemodynamic status and risk assessment to stratify patients into higher-risk and lower-risk categories. This stratification assists in considering admission to either a non-monitored bed or a monitored bed setting, including the intensive care setting.

### Current concepts in severe acute and necrotizing pancreatitis: An evidence-based approach [^114TnKi1]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

The incidence of acute pancreatitis continues to rise, inducing substantial medical and social burden, with annual costs exceeding $2 billion in the United States alone. Although most patients develop mild pancreatitis, 20% develop severe and/or necrotizing pancreatitis, requiring advanced medical and interventional care. Morbidity resulting from local and systemic complications, as well as invasive interventions, results in mortality rates historically as high as 30%.

There has been substantial evolution of strategies for interventions in recent years, from open surgery to minimally invasive surgical and endoscopic step-up approaches. In contrast to the advances in invasive procedures for complications, early management still lacks curative options and consists of adequate fluid resuscitation, analgesics, and monitoring. Many challenges remain, including comprehensive management of the entire spectrum of the disease, which requires close involvement of multiple disciplines at specialized centers.

Further, there were no recommendations highlighted in the palliation domain across the different clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Although acute pancreatitis (AP) is often considered a self-limiting condition, patients with severe or necrotizing disease may experience a high symptom burden, prolonged hospital stays, and significant morbidity. In such cases, a palliative approach that is focused on symptom management, quality of life, and supportive care may be needed.

For instance, pain management remains a cornerstone of treatment, particularly in patients with persistent abdominal pain despite the resolution of the acute episode. In addition to opioids and adjunctive analgesics, multimodal pain relief strategies, including regional anesthesia and non-pharmacological interventions, should be considered. Nutritional support also plays a role in palliation, especially for patients who develop pancreatic insufficiency or experience recurrent episodes of AP that impact their nutritional status.

Early enteral feeding is recommended in severe cases, but in patients with long-term complications, dietary modifications, and enzyme supplementation may be required to maintain nutritional balance and prevent weight loss. In rare cases where acute pancreatitis progresses to multisystem organ failure, discussions regarding goals of care and end-of-life decision-making may be necessary. For patients with refractory AP or those at high risk of mortality, palliative care services can provide holistic support, addressing not only symptom relief but also psychological and family-centered concerns.

### Management of acute pancreatitis: current knowledge and future perspectives [^1157Wmck]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

As in other diseases, the pathophysiological aspects of acute pancreatitis should guide our therapeutic approach, taking into account that treatment needs to be tailored to individual patients and the available resources of each institution.

Since 1994, many papers have suggested good medical therapy for patients with acute pancreatitis, but unfortunately, there is no congruence in the various guidelines regarding the stratification of severity, diagnosis, treatment, and the presence of Pancreas Units. Additionally, there are no homogeneous evidence levels in these guidelines, which is surprising as most participants are the same experts involved in developing them. As suggested by Bradley, there is a need to unify the guidelines to ensure consistency.

For example, the UK guidelines released in 1998 were revised in 2005, and some researchers requested further changes shortly afterward. A significant problem is that many clinical practitioners in the same country follow different guidelines, and others do not fully apply them in practice. Moreover, most guidelines do not report basic management such as pain control and the management of nausea, vomiting, and ileus.

### Clinical practice guideline: Management of acute pancreatitis [^116jZKQF]. Canadian Journal of Surgery (2016). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for acute pancreatitis, specifically with respect to risk assessment, the BPIGS 2016 guidelines recommend diagnosing severe acute pancreatitis in patients who meet any of the following criteria:

- **CRP levels**: CRP ≥ 14,286 nmol/L (150 mg/dL) at baseline or within the first 72 hours.

- **APACHE II score**: APACHE II score ≥ 8 at baseline or within the first 72 hours.

- **Signs of organ failure**: Signs of persistent organ failure for more than 48 hours despite adequate IV fluid resuscitation.

### Staged multidisciplinary step-up management for necrotizing pancreatitis [^112cRiGA]. The British Journal of Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Some 15 percent of all patients with acute pancreatitis develop necrotizing pancreatitis, which can have potentially significant consequences for both patients and healthcare services.

This review summarizes the latest insights into the surgical and medical management of necrotizing pancreatitis, discussing general management strategies for the treatment of complications in relation to the stage of the disease.

- **Methods**: Frequent clinical evaluation of the patient's condition remains paramount in the first 24–72 hours of the disease. Liberal goal-directed fluid resuscitation and early enteral nutrition should be provided. Urgent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is indicated when cholangitis is suspected, although there is uncertainty regarding its appropriateness in patients with predicted severe biliary pancreatitis without cholangitis. Antibiotic prophylaxis does not prevent infection of necrosis, so antibiotics are not indicated as part of initial management. Bacteriologically confirmed infections should receive targeted antibiotics. With the more conservative approach currently advocated for necrotizing pancreatitis, fine-needle aspiration culture of pancreatic or extrapancreatic necrosis will less often lead to a change in management and is therefore indicated less frequently.

- **Results**: Optimal treatment of infected necrotizing pancreatitis consists of a staged multidisciplinary 'step-up' approach. The initial step is drainage, either percutaneous or transluminal, followed by surgical or endoscopic transluminal debridement only if needed. Debridement is delayed until truly necessary.

### Classification of the severity of acute pancreatitis: How many categories make sense [^111GVchf]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

There is an ongoing effort to revise the 1992 Atlanta classification of acute pancreatitis in light of emerging evidence. The categorization of the severity of acute pancreatitis is one of the key elements of the classification. This paper aims to define the optimal number of categories and provide their definitions on sound clinical grounds.

### Gaps and uncertainties in the management of acute pancreatitis: A scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines [^114pR8Di]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

There was a disconnect between the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence supporting them. Many of the guidelines recommend strong actions, yet the quality of the underlying evidence is often only moderate or low. This is particularly concerning for in-hospital management, where the majority of strong recommendations (48.4%, n = 337/696) are not evidenced by high-quality evidence. For clinicians, this creates a challenge in balancing guideline adherence with clinical judgment, especially in the absence of robust supporting data.

A recent national cohort study highlighted variable adherence to evidence-based practice across 2580 patients in the United Kingdom. Discrepancies between the strength of recommendations and the underlying evidence quality are not unique to guidelines on acute pancreatitis but are seen across various medical fields, including sepsis and critical care medicine. Common reasons for this variation include reliance on expert consensus, poor methodology used in its development, and absence of high-quality randomized trials.

Therefore, future guideline development should incorporate more robust methodologies, such as adaptive trial designs and real-world evidence, to strengthen the reliability of recommendations. Policymakers and researchers must focus on generating high-quality evidence to strengthen the foundation of these recommendations.

In the past few years, several new therapeutic options have changed the management of acute pancreatitis; for example, therapeutic ERCP with endoscopic sphincterotomy in severe biliary pancreatitis, the use of early antibiotic treatment in necrotizing pancreatitis, and the demonstration that enteral feeding is able to decrease the inflammatory response. In this paper, we describe new therapeutic treatments which could modify the approach to acute pancreatitis in the near future. This is possible only because we have new information to better understand the pathophysiological processes of the disease.

- **Clinical phases**: We can distinguish three clinical phases regarding the pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis. There is not very much information on the initial phase of acute pancreatitis in humans and, for the most part, it comes from experimental studies. It is obvious that good therapeutic results can only be obtained if pancreatitis is treated as soon as possible. In the early stage of acute pancreatitis, within the first week of the start of the inflammatory process, there is an inappropriate activation of proteases which, together with microcirculatory disorders, leads to the appearance of necrosis.

	- Subsequently, these events may be associated with macrophage activation and progress to necrosis. This is a very dangerous stage because gut and biliary bacteria can infect the necrosis during the third to fourth week of acute pancreatitis. Mortality is approximately 32% in the early stage (mainly from organ failure) and 12% in the middle stage (5% from infection).

### What's new in the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^117H4hUV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Recent advancements in assessing the severity of acute pancreatitis have emerged. The original Ranson criteria from 1974, which were last modified in 2012, have been succeeded by several new and, in part, more complex scoring systems. However, these new systems have only modestly increased diagnostic performance, with the area under the curve (AUC) improving from 0.57 to 0.74. Recent findings suggest that factors such as the presence of underweight or overweight conditions, the development or persistence of organ failure, and the assessment of biomarkers like cytokine levels might further improve the identification of high-risk patients.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^1128STCb]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis from the collaboration of a panel of experts. The document contains 55 statements on diagnosis, management in the ICU, surgical and operative management, open abdomen, and antibiotic treatment. For some of the statements, such as severity grading, imaging, use of prophylactic antibiotics, and most aspects of management in the ICU, the evidence is strong. For others, such as laboratory diagnostics and surgical strategies, the evidence is quite weak, requiring further studies. With accumulating knowledge, the statements need to be regularly updated.

### Management of severe acute pancreatitis [^11261Tni]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

The risks, measurements of severity, and management of severe acute pancreatitis and its complications have evolved rapidly over the past decade. Evidence suggests that initial goal-directed therapy, nutritional support, and vigilance for pancreatic complications represent best practices. Patients can develop pancreatic fluid collections, including acute pancreatic fluid collections, pancreatic pseudocysts, acute necrotic collections, and walled-off necrosis. Several randomized controlled trials and cohort studies have recently highlighted the advantage of managing these conditions with a progressive approach, starting with initial draining for infection followed by less invasive techniques. Surgery is no longer an early intervention and may not be necessary. Instead, interventional radiologic and endoscopic methods appear to be safer, with at least as good survival outcomes. Newly developed evidence-based quality indicators are available to assess and improve performance. Development and clinical testing of drugs targeting the mechanisms of disease are necessary for further advancements.

### Severe pancreatitis multidisciplinary working group: Exploratory analysis to optimize care and cost [^115TLApE]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Low credibility.

The minimally invasive step-up approach to pancreatitis improves outcomes. Multidisciplinary working groups may best facilitate this approach. However, support for these working groups requires funding. We hypothesize that patients requiring surgical debridement generate sufficient revenue to sustain these working groups. Furthermore, patients selected for surgical debridement by the working group will have a higher rate of percutaneous and endoscopic intervention in adherence to the step-up approach.

- **Methods**: We conducted an observational cohort study of all patients with severe acute and/or necrotizing pancreatitis whose care was overseen by our multidisciplinary working group from October 2015 through January 2019. Patient demographics, hospital treatments, and outcomes data were compared between those who underwent surgical debridement and those who did not. Hospital billing data were also collected from those undergoing surgical debridement and compared to institutional benchmarks for financial sustainability.

- **Results**: A total of 108 patients received care overseen by the working group, 10 of whom progressed to surgical debridement. The mean contribution margin percentages for each patient in the surgical debridement group were higher than the threshold value for financial sustainability, at 39% (60.34% ± 16.66%; P = 0.004). Patients in the surgical debridement group were more likely to undergo intervention by an interventional radiologist (odds ratio, 1.58; P = 0.005). The mortality was higher in the nonsurgical debridement group (odds ratio, 15; P = 0).

### Initial management of acute pancreatitis: critical issues during the first 72 hours [^1164wTc2]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Although most patients with acute pancreatitis have a mild course, almost a quarter will develop complications. It has become clear that the early management of these patients will likely affect outcomes. Too often, patients are admitted to the hospital with what appears to be mild disease, only to later deteriorate into severe disease. This review focuses on the early management of patients with acute pancreatitis in an attempt to prevent severe disease, complications, and death.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^114JVgj1]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition of the pancreas most commonly caused by bile stones or excessive use of alcohol. In most patients, the disease takes a mild course where moderate fluid resuscitation, management of pain and nausea, and early oral feeding result in rapid clinical improvement.

The severe form, comprising about 20–30% of the patients, is a life-threatening disease with hospital mortality rates of about 15%. The most commonly used classification system for acute pancreatitis is the 2012 revision of the Atlanta classification and definitions based on international consensus. This classification identifies two phases (early and late). Severity is classified as mild, moderate, or severe. The mild form (interstitial edematous pancreatitis) has no organ failure, or local or systemic complications, and usually resolves in the first week. If there is transient (less than 48 hours) organ failure, local complications, or exacerbation of co-morbid disease, it is classified as moderate. Patients with persistent (more than 48 hours) organ failure have the severe form of the disease.

Infection of the pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis occurs in about 20–40% of patients with severe acute pancreatitis and is associated with worsening organ dysfunctions. In a systematic review and meta-analysis totaling 6970 patients, the mortality rate in patients with infected necrosis and organ failure was 35.2%, while concomitant sterile necrosis and organ failure was associated with a mortality of 19.8%.

### Management of severe acute pancreatitis [^1158GTM4]. The British Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Management guidelines are sometimes equivocal, particularly in relation to the surgical treatment of severe disease. This review assesses available investigative and treatment strategies to allow the development of a formalized management approach.

- **Methods**: A literature review of diagnosis, staging, and management of acute pancreatitis was performed.

- **Results and conclusion**: Recent evidence has helped to clarify the roles of computed tomography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, prophylactic antibiotics, enteral feeding, and fine-needle aspiration for bacteriology in the management of acute pancreatitis. Despite a relative shortage of prospective randomized trials, there has been a significant change in the surgical management of acute pancreatitis over the past 20 years. This change has been away from early aggressive surgical intervention towards more conservative management, except when infected necrosis is confirmed. A formalized approach, with appropriate use of the various non-surgical and surgical options, is feasible in the management of severe acute pancreatitis.

### Gaps and uncertainties in the management of acute pancreatitis: A scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines [^114Cp5Kd]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

This study's strengths lie in its comprehensive scope and the rigorous methodology employed. By focusing on multiple facets of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), including the strength and quality of recommendations, we provide a thorough evaluation of guidelines. Additionally, the use of a patient and public involvement (PPI) group ensures that our findings are relevant and meaningful to those with lived experience of the disease.

However, several limitations should be noted. First, the exclusion of non-English language guidelines may limit the generalizability of the findings, particularly for non-English-speaking regions where the burden of acute pancreatitis is high. Second, while this review highlights gaps in recovery recommendations, it does not delve into the specific barriers to implementing these recommendations in clinical practice, such as disparities in regional service provision. Third, a potential methodological limitation of our study is related to the use of the AGREE-II instrument, published in 2017. Evaluators' awareness of the publication date and the standards introduced by AGREE-II could have introduced unintentional bias, potentially favoring guidelines published after 2017 that inherently align more closely with reporting standards. Consequently, earlier guidelines might have scored lower due to reporting styles and expectations prevalent at the time rather than their actual methodological rigor.

To mitigate this bias, we employed multiple independent evaluators, rigorous training, and calibration to ensure scoring consistency. Despite these measures, the potential for bias remains.

### Position paper: Timely interventions in severe acute pancreatitis are crucial for survival [^1139JBPT]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Aggressive fluid therapy during the early phase of acute pancreatitis has traditionally been the cornerstone of treatment. The rationale of fluid therapy is to correct hypovolemia caused by third space fluid loss. High admission hematocrit (above normal reference limits) may serve as a marker of hemoconcentration, and it is present in up to 60% of patients who develop organ failure; however, the marker is too unspecific for predictive purposes. Fluid resuscitation decreases hematocrit, which could be used as a resuscitation end-point. Too aggressive resuscitation may lead to inappropriate hemodilution, and very low hematocrit values (< 30%) may be harmful to the patients by increasing the risk of sepsis and death. Moreover, excess volume loading may increase intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and lead to the development of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome. In patients with acute pancreatitis, hematocrit and central venous pressure as resuscitation end-points are poor indicators of volume depletion. Urine output (≥ 0.5 ml/kg/h) may serve as another resuscitation end-point, but other modalities are needed for volume management if oliguria persists after initial volume loading. According to a recent systematic review, there is little evidence concerning the rate of infusion, optimal resuscitation end-point, and the type of fluid in patients with acute pancreatitis.

In those patients with pancreatitis who develop shock, the same management guidelines as for septic shock patients can be applied, which include initial fluid challenge with appropriate measures.

### Risk assessment in acute pancreatitis [^115xyXTy]. The British Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis has a variable natural history and, in a proportion of patients, is associated with severe complications and a significant risk of death. The various tools available for risk assessment in acute pancreatitis are reviewed.

- **Methods**: Relevant medical literature from PubMed, Ovid, Embase, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library websites up to May 2008 was reviewed.

- **Results and conclusion**: Over the past 30 years, several scoring systems have been developed to predict the severity of acute pancreatitis in the first 48–72 hours. Biochemical and immunological markers, imaging modalities, and novel predictive models may help identify patients at high risk of complications or death. Recently, there has been a recognition of the importance of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome and organ dysfunction.

### Gaps and uncertainties in the management of acute pancreatitis: A scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines [^111eZgdF]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

To bridge this knowledge gap, we performed a scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for adult patients with acute pancreatitis. The objectives of this scoping review were: (i) to develop a conceptual framework of key pathway domains; (ii) to assess the representation of pathway domains in CPGs; (iii) to evaluate the strength of recommendations and quality of evidence related to these domains; and (iv) to appraise the quality of CPGs and the process measures in their development. Understanding differences between various CPGs will help generate new areas of future research efforts and policymaking both nationally and regionally towards standardized management of patients with acute pancreatitis.

### Acute pancreatitis with an emphasis on infection [^112bbasE]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory disease that is mild and self-limiting in about 80% of cases. However, severe necrotizing disease still has a mortality rate of up to 30%. Differentiated multimodal treatment concepts are needed for these patients, including a multidisciplinary team of intensivists, gastroenterologists, interventional radiologists, and surgeons. The primary therapy is supportive. Patients with infected pancreatic necrosis who are septic undergo interventional or surgical treatment, ideally not before the fourth week after the onset of symptoms. This article reviews the pathophysiologic mechanisms of acute pancreatitis and describes clinical pathways for diagnosis and management based on the literature and guidelines.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^112wr2Qt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

During almost 20 years, the 1992 Atlanta Classification has been used, but some of the definitions and classifications have been confusing. In a revision of 447 articles, Bollen et al. found that alternative definitions of the 1992 Atlanta Classification were used in more than half of the studies and that definitions are often used erroneously.

Important insights on the management of acute pancreatitis (AP), better understanding of the pathophysiology of organ failure and necrotizing pancreatitis, improved diagnostic imaging, minimally invasive techniques, and studies showing that patients in the severe group of the 1992 Atlanta Classification comprise subgroups with very different outcomes, were indications that a more accurate classification is warranted.

In a review in 2004, Johnson et al. reported that persistent organ failure (POF) for more than 48 hours in the first week is strongly associated with the risk of death or local complications. They used a previous database of 290 patients with predicted severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) recruited from 78 hospitals through 18 centers in the UK and also cited that resolution of organ failure within 48 hours suggests a good prognosis.

A retrospective study of 759 patients with AP performed by the University of Edinburgh found that 25.4% of the patients with persistent systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) died, compared with 8% with transient SIRS and 0.7% without SIRS.

These and other studies showed that organ failure is central to the definition of SAP. If organ failure persists for more than 48 hours, the patient is at high risk of death (one out of three).

### Acute pancreatitis: Current clinical approaches, molecular pathophysiology, and potential therapeutics [^1155SZET]. Pancreas (2023). Low credibility.

Currently, there are no validated models to predict acute pancreatitis (AP) severity early on, and therapeutic options are limited to supportive care. However, several diagnostic tools exist that attempt to classify patients into subgroups to determine whether admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is probable.

- **Diagnostic tools**: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography is the preferred imaging technique for determining the extent of pancreatic inflammation and identifying complications such as (peri)pancreatic necrosis stemming from AP. However, the risk associated with repeated radiation exposure limits contrast-enhanced computed tomography as a monitoring tool for AP patients. Magnetic resonance imaging is preferred when minimal radioactive exposure or better evaluation of the pancreatic duct is required. Although imaging evidence of pancreatitis is only one of the three criteria for diagnosis of AP, these modalities are also helpful in identifying potential complications. Right upper quadrant ultrasound is also used to identify gallstones as a potential AP etiology. Endoscopic ultrasound can be performed to screen for microlithiasis or choledocholithiasis when clinical suspicion is high, but right upper quadrant ultrasound is negative. Disease severity is determined using either the Revised Atlanta Classification or the Determinant-Based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity. Each of these classification systems was published in the same year, with similar categories for patients based on organ failure. Both classification systems have been compared.

### Acute pancreatitis: The increasing role of medical management of a traditionally surgically managed disease [^1169EYhx]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Management of acute pancreatitis and its complications has rapidly evolved in recent years. The earlier pillars of management, which included prolonged bowel rest, empiric intravenous antibiotics, and early surgical intervention for complications such as pancreatic necrosis, have become much less common. The latest evidence-based approaches to acute pancreatitis take an almost diametrically different path compared to previous management strategies. The focus is on early feeding, judicious use of antibiotics, and delayed use of invasive interventions. Even in complex cases, when surgical interventions may be indicated, there is an expressed preference for minimally invasive techniques. We review the changes that have evolved rapidly over the past decade in this common clinical problem.

### What's new in the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^1157XZ1C]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Infected necrosis occurs in 40–70% of patients in the second or third week of the illness and is the leading cause of late mortality. The onset or worsening of organ failure in a septic context must raise suspicion of infected necrosis, and fine needle CT-guided aspiration should be considered. Antibiotics should be administered as soon as the results of the Gram stain are available. More conservative intervention than surgical necrosectomy now predominates. A step-up approach involving percutaneous drainage followed, if necessary, by a minimally invasive surgical necrosectomy significantly reduces the rate of major complications and mortality by 29% compared with open surgery.

Mouli et al. recently reported that a conservative initial approach with antimicrobial therapy, with or without percutaneous drainage, was successful for 64% of patients with infected necrosis. Moreover, postponement of surgical necrosectomy provides an opportunity for acute collections to become walled-off and liquefied. A randomized study with a very small number of patients requiring secondary pancreatic debridement found endoscopic transgastric necrosectomy to be superior to surgical necrosectomy concerning the overall rate of major complications or mortality (20% vs. 80%).

### Acute pancreatitis: Current clinical approaches, molecular pathophysiology, and potential therapeutics [^116gov5d]. Pancreas (2023). High credibility.

Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), characterized by pancreatic inflammation leading to multiorgan failure, is associated with high morbidity and mortality. There is a critical need to identify novel therapeutic strategies to improve clinical outcomes for SAP patients.

- **Materials and methods**: A comprehensive literature review was performed to identify clinical strategies, known molecular pathophysiology, and potential therapeutic targets for SAP.

- **Results**: Clinical approaches focus on determining which patients will likely develop SAP. However, therapeutic options are limited to supportive care and fluid resuscitation. The application of a novel 5-cytokine panel accurately predicting disease outcomes in SAP suggests that molecular approaches will improve the impact of future clinical trials in acute pancreatitis.

- **Conclusions**: Inflammatory outcomes in acute pancreatitis are driven by several unique molecular signals, which compound to promote both local and systemic inflammation. The identification of master cytokine regulators is critical to developing therapeutics that reduce inflammation through several mechanisms.

- **Summary of included guidelines**: The figures provide an overview of the clinical practice guidelines and their coverage across key domains in the patient pathway.

- **Summary of recommendations**: Table 2 elucidates the recommendations by key domains and subdomains within the clinical practice guidelines for acute pancreatitis. Differences in the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence reported across the indicators are depicted in Fig. 3. Specifically, (A) highlights the strength of recommendation for each indicator, while (B) shows the quality of evidence supporting recommendations.

- **Treatment domain recommendations**: Analysis within this domain, comprising 696 recommendations, reveals that a significant portion is derived from early in-hospital management (215 recommendations, 30.9%), diagnosis of disease (159 recommendations, 22.8%), and late in-hospital management (123 recommendations, 17.7%) (Appendix p 10; Table S6). Of these, 337 recommendations (48.4%) were graded strong, though merely 125 (17.9%) were supported by high-level evidence (Appendix p 11; Table S7).

- **Rehabilitation recommendations**: There are 19 recommendations across two indicators: follow-up care (17 recommendations) and diagnosis and management of new long-term conditions (2 recommendations). Of these, 11 recommendations (57.9%) are strong, but only seven (37.8%) are supported by high-level evidence.

- **Sensitivity analysis**: This analysis evaluated the impact of gastroenterology expertise in the development of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Findings revealed no significant differences in study characteristics between guidelines with and without gastroenterology expertise (Appendix p 12, Table S8).

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^1127AgFt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Almost simultaneously, in 2012, two new classification systems of acute pancreatitis (AP) were published: Determinant-Based Classification of Acute Pancreatitis Severity (DBC) and the Revised Atlanta Classification 2012 (RAC). The novel DBC was based on a global web-based survey and a dedicated international symposium with contributors from different disciplines. E-mail invitations were sent to 528 pancreatologists from 55 countries, and 240 pancreatologists from 49 countries participated in the survey. During the 2011 World Congress of the International Association of Pancreatology in Kochi, India, around 100 participants discussed the proposed classification and tried to agree on the definitions.

The RAC was generated by an iterative, web-based consultation process incorporating responses from the members of 11 national and international pancreatic societies. Revisions were made in response to comments, and the web-based consultation was repeated three times. The final consensus was reviewed, and only statements based on published evidence were retained. The RAC offers a broader overview than DBC: in addition to severity classification, it provides a clear definition for diagnosing AP, highlights the onset of pain as an important reference point, and defines individual local complications as well as interstitial and necrotizing pancreatitis. The RAC categorizes AP into three categories: mild, moderately severe, and severe, according to organ failure and local or systemic complications. The DBC added a fourth category: critical, based on two main determinants of mortality: (peri)pancreatic necrosis and organ failure.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^115DZ8Sg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Recent evidence has shown that prophylactic antibiotics in patients with acute pancreatitis are not associated with a significant decrease in mortality or morbidity. Thus, routine prophylactic antibiotics are no longer recommended for all patients with acute pancreatitis (1A).

- **Statement (prophylactic antibiotics)**: The use and efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic therapy in acute pancreatitis has long been a point of controversy. Prophylaxis refers to the administration of antibiotics in patients when no clinical infection is present, with the intent to prevent pancreatic infection. Although early trials suggested that the administration of antibiotics might prevent infectious complications in patients with sterile necrosis, subsequent, better-designed trials have consistently failed to confirm an advantage. Recent evidence has shown that prophylactic antibiotics in patients with acute pancreatitis are not associated with a significant decrease in mortality or morbidity. Thus, routine prophylactic antibiotics for all patients with acute pancreatitis are no longer recommended.

### Determinant-based classification of acute pancreatitis severity: An international multidisciplinary consultation [^111LhFVs]. Annals of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

To develop a new international classification of acute pancreatitis severity, a sound conceptual framework, comprehensive review of published evidence, and worldwide consultation were utilized. The Atlanta definitions of acute pancreatitis severity, which are ingrained in the lexicon of pancreatologists, have been deemed suboptimal as they are based on empiric descriptions of occurrences merely associated with severity.

A personal invitation to contribute to the development of a new international classification of acute pancreatitis severity was extended to all surgeons, gastroenterologists, internists, intensivists, and radiologists actively engaged in clinical research on acute pancreatitis. This invitation was not restricted to specific association members or residents of particular countries. A global web-based survey was conducted, and a dedicated international symposium was organized to unify contributors from diverse disciplines to discuss the concept and definitions.

The newly developed international classification is based on actual local and systemic determinants of severity, rather than descriptions of events correlated with severity. The local determinant involves the presence of (peri)pancreatic necrosis, and if present, whether it is sterile or infected. The systemic determinant is concerned with the presence of organ failure, and if present, whether it is transient or persistent. The interaction between determinants can modify their effects, such that the presence of both infected (peri)pancreatic necrosis and organ failure intensifies severity.

### Questions about the use of antibiotics in acute pancreatitis [^113iCFgq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), as defined by the Atlanta criteria, is present in up to 25% of patients with acute pancreatitis (AP), with a mortality rate of 10%–20%. In these patients, AP develops in two phases: the first ten days are characterized by the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), whereas, at the end of the second week, infectious complications begin to appear. These complications due to infection are responsible for up to 80% of deaths in patients with AP. About 40% to 75% of patients with pancreatic necrosis develop infection — 24% after the first week and 71% after the third week — with mortality rates up to 50%.

The mechanisms of infection in AP include bacterial translocation via lymphatic and hematogenic pathways, as well as reflux from the duodenum and biliary tree. If the major problem in AP is the infection of pancreatic necrosis, it makes sense to consider that the use of antibiotics in this situation could reduce the morbidity and mortality of these patients. However, at present, there are still controversies about this topic. Therefore, some questions remain unclear regarding the use of antibiotics in AP:

- **Should we use antibiotics in acute pancreatitis?**
	- Yes, since severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is characterized by the presence of organ failure (Ranson ≥ 3 or APACHE II ≥ 8) or local complications such as necrosis, pseudocyst, and abscess.
- **Which antibiotic?**
	- The choice of antibiotic depends on the severity and the specific pathogens involved.
- **How long should the treatment last?**
	- The duration of antibiotic therapy should be guided by clinical response and severity.
- **Should we wait for more studies?**
	- Additional research may help clarify optimal treatment strategies and improve patient outcomes.

The Balthazar score on a CT scan determines the intensity of local complications, and the presence of pancreatic or peri-pancreatic necrosis significantly impacts treatment considerations.

### Gaps and uncertainties in the management of acute pancreatitis: A scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines [^111jrxxH]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Low credibility.

For the treatment domain, seven indicators were identified: (i) diagnosis of disease; (ii) assessment of severity; (iii) early in-hospital management; (iv) late in-hospital management; (v) interventional management; (vi) intensive care unit management; and (vii) organisation or model of care. For the rehabilitation domain, key indicators were (i) follow-up care and (ii) diagnosis and management of new long-term conditions such as exocrine insufficiency. The matrix of indicators and domains and their definitions are described in the Appendix (pp. 7–8; Tables S4 & S5).

The strength of recommendations was defined as strong, moderate, weak, very weak, none, or not reported according to the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) framework. Grading the quality of evidence underpinning each was defined as high, moderate, low, or very low. In instances where no grading of the quality was performed for each recommendation within a clinical practice guideline (CPG), this was extracted as 'not reported' in the analysis.

- **Stage 5: Data synthesis**: For each CPG, each recommendation was extracted by two reviewers (SKK, VG). The recommendation was mapped to a domain, and the corresponding strength and quality of evidence were recorded. Each recommendation was grouped in preparation for narrative synthesis in a three-staged process. First, two reviewers (SKK, VG) coded and summarised each component of the recommendations against the developed conceptual framework. Both reviewers then reviewed the codes, with any disagreements resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (MJL).

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^112LdYPa]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Clinical deterioration with signs or a strong suspicion of infected necrotizing pancreatitis is an indication to perform intervention, such as percutaneous or endoscopic drainage.

- **Indications for intervention (after 4 weeks from the onset of the disease)**:
	- Ongoing organ failure without signs of infected necrosis
	- Ongoing gastric outlet, biliary, or intestinal obstruction due to a large walled-off necrotic collection
	- Disconnected duct syndrome
	- Symptomatic or growing pseudocyst

- **Indications for intervention (after 8 weeks from the onset of the disease)**:
	- Ongoing pain and/or discomfort

The evidence for these indications is based on understanding the natural course of the disease, mechanism-based reasoning, and non-randomized studies. Interventions for necrotizing pancreatitis should preferably be done when the necrosis has become walled-off, usually after 4 weeks from the onset of the disease.

Signs or strong suspicion of infected necrosis in a symptomatic patient requires intervention, although a small number of patients have been shown to recover with antibiotics only. When a patient deteriorates, a step-up approach starting with percutaneous or endoscopic drainage is indicated.

A majority of patients with sterile necrotizing pancreatitis can be managed without interventions. However, it should be noted that nearly half of the patients operated on due to ongoing organ failure without signs of infected necrosis have a positive bacterial culture in the operative specimen. Therefore, interventions should be considered when organ dysfunctions persist.

### Management of acute pancreatitis [^111JiSut]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

In managing patients with acute pancreatitis (AP), fluid resuscitation and vigilance are crucial. Although most patients experience a mild course, approximately 20% develop complications. Predicting which patients will suffer from acute organ failure or necrosis early in AP is challenging. Nonetheless, several risk factors for severe disease should be identified by clinicians, such as comorbidities (cardiac and renal diseases), obesity, and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN). This patient would have benefited from a monitored bed, closer observation, and better vigilance. Evaluating vital signs more frequently and reassessing BUN and hematocrit (HCT) 6 hours post-admission could have helped in identifying and addressing hypovolemia by adjusting intravenous (IV) hydration.

Although exact rates and volumes for initial resuscitation are debated, IV hydration is vital in managing acute pancreatitis. The patient might be experiencing a cycle of pancreatic inflammation, leading to fluid extravasation and relative pancreatic ischemia, worsening pancreatitis, and further fluid extravasation under hypovolemic conditions due to third spacing. The treatment involves restoring pancreatic perfusion through early, moderately aggressive IV hydration. While "Goal-Directed Fluid Resuscitation" has been recommended, the case study demonstrates that achieving this goal is often problematic.

Subsequently, Bansal et al. in a cohort of 248 patients found that RAC and DBC are similar in ICU admission, need for percutaneous drainage, need for surgery, and in-hospital mortality. The critical category in DBC identified the most severe disease. Nawaz et al. enrolled prospectively 256 patients and assigned a severity category for all three classifications: RAC, DBC, and Atlanta 1992. They found that RAC and DBC severity categories accurately reflected clinical outcomes and were superior to Atlanta 1992 in evaluating mortality, ICU admission, and ICU length of stay.

Two years later, a retrospective study of 395 patients in China, with an overall 8.9% in-hospital mortality, found similar results. The authors found that all three classification systems (RAC, DBC, and Atlanta 1992) accurately classify the severity of AP. However, the RAC and the DBC performed better than Atlanta 1992, and they were comparable in predicting long-term clinical prognosis, major complications, and clinical interventions.

Choi et al, studying 553 patients with AP admitted to a single center during a 7-year period, validated that the RAC correlates well with clinical outcomes, despite not considering infected necrosis. However, patients in the severe group with infected necrosis (classified as critical in DBC) should be considered separately from those without it, as the mortality rate increased fourfold: up to 32%. Another study analyzed 543 episodes of AP from 459 patients in a prospective cohort and found that the different classification systems had varied results.

### Severe acute pancreatitis: Advances and insights in assessment of severity and management [^1155hkvj]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with acute pancreatitis are at risk of developing various complications due to ongoing pancreatic inflammation. Often, there is no correlation between the degree of structural damage to the pancreas and the clinical manifestation of the disease. The effectiveness of any treatment is related to the ability to accurately predict severity, but there is no ideal predictive system or biochemical marker available. Severity assessment is indispensable for selecting the appropriate initial treatment in the management of acute pancreatitis.

- **Use of multiparametric criteria**: These allow the selection of high-risk patients through the evaluation of severity index.
- **Role of imaging**: Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scanning and contrast-enhanced MRI are crucial in assessing severity.

The adoption of multiparametric criteria, combined with morphological evaluation, allows for a reasonably reliable prognosis on the evolution of the disease a few days from onset.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^1164pctP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Currently, several trends in the management of severe acute pancreatitis have changed our clinical practices. These include early enteral feeding, the selective role of prophylactic antibiotics, avoiding surgery in patients with sterile necrosis, a more conservative approach to infected necrosis with delayed intervention (whether endoscopic or surgical), and management of biliary pancreatitis. The aim of these guidelines is to present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis. This was achieved through collaboration among a panel of experts who met during the World Congress of Emergency Surgery from June 27–30, 2018, in Bertinoro, Italy.

### 2019 WSES guidelines for the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^114yFFds]. World journal of emergency surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Although most patients with acute pancreatitis experience the mild form of the disease, about 20–30% develop a severe form, often associated with single or multiple organ dysfunctions requiring intensive care. Identifying the severe form early is one of the major challenges in managing severe acute pancreatitis. Infection of the pancreatic and peripancreatic necrosis occurs in about 20–40% of patients with severe acute pancreatitis and is associated with worsening organ dysfunctions.

While most patients with sterile necrosis can be managed nonoperatively, patients with infected necrosis usually require an intervention that can be percutaneous, endoscopic, or open surgical. These guidelines present evidence-based international consensus statements on the management of severe acute pancreatitis from a collaboration of a panel of experts meeting during the World Congress of Emergency Surgery in June 27–30, 2018, in Bertinoro, Italy.

- **Diagnosis**: The guidelines provide recommendations for early and accurate diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis.
- **Antibiotic treatment**: Evidence-based approaches to antibiotic use in managing infection risks are discussed.
- **Management in the intensive care unit**: Strategies for intensive care management of patients with severe acute pancreatitis are outlined.
- **Surgical and operative management**: The document details various surgical and operative interventions for managing complications.
- **Open abdomen**: Considerations for the management of open abdomen cases are presented.

These topics form the core of the guidelines, aiming to improve patient outcomes in severe acute pancreatitis.

### Contemporary management of acute pancreatitis: What you need to know [^111gjZ9m]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

Acute pancreatitis and the management of its complications are common consults for the acute care surgeon. With the ongoing development of both operative and endoscopic treatment modalities, management recommendations continue to evolve. We describe the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for acute pancreatitis through the lens of acute care surgery. Topics, including optimal nutrition, timing of cholecystectomy in gallstone pancreatitis, and the management of peripancreatic fluid collections, are discussed.

The management of severe acute pancreatitis can include advanced interventional modalities such as endoscopic, percutaneous, and surgical debridement. However, the initial management of acute pancreatitis includes fluid resuscitation, early enteral nutrition, and close monitoring with consideration of cross-sectional imaging and antibiotics in the setting of suspected superimposed infection. Several scoring systems, including the Revised Atlanta Criteria, the Bedside Index for Severity in Acute Pancreatitis score, and the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma grade, have been devised to classify and predict the development of severe acute pancreatitis.

In biliary pancreatitis, cholecystectomy prior to discharge is recommended in mild disease and within 8 weeks for necrotizing pancreatitis, while early peripancreatic fluid collections should be managed without intervention. Underlying infection or ongoing symptoms warrant delayed intervention, with technique selection dependent on local expertise and the anatomic location of the fluid collection.

Postponing surgical interventions for more than 4 weeks after the onset of the disease results in less mortality (2B).

- **Discussion**: Early surgery was compared to late surgery in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma. The study consisted of nine studies, of which one was a randomized controlled study. Timing of operative interventions was compared in three different cut-offs (72 h, 12 days, and 30 days). In all cut-offs, late surgery resulted in a clear survival benefit. With delayed surgery, the demarcation of necrosis from vital tissue occurs, resulting in fewer injuries to vital tissues. Therefore, in late surgery, there is less bleeding, and the necrosectomy is more effective.

It is not known how long surgery can be postponed if the patient can tolerate it, and if the longer delay will result in more complications, such as an increased rate of bowel fistulas or intestinal obstruction. If emergency surgery is needed earlier for other indications, such as abdominal compartment syndrome or bowel necrosis, drainage or necrosectomy is not routinely recommended.

- **Statements (surgical strategy)**: In infected pancreatic necrosis, percutaneous drainage as the first line of treatment (step-up approach) delays the surgical treatment to a more favorable time or even results in complete resolution of infection in 25–60% of patients, and it is recommended as the first line of treatment (1A). Minimally invasive surgical strategies, such as transgastric endoscopic necrosectomy or video-assisted retroperitoneal…

### Gaps and uncertainties in the management of acute pancreatitis: A scoping review and quality assessment of clinical practice guidelines [^115iZhSW]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). High credibility.

Universal health coverage (UHC) emphasizes equitable care for all, without financial hardships, and healthcare professionals use clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to inform service delivery. With the rising burden of acute pancreatitis worldwide, the recent James Lind Alliance highlighted that knowledge gaps exist within pathways. This scoping review and quality assessment aim to determine gaps and uncertainties in CPGs for the management of acute pancreatitis.

- **Methods**: We conducted a scoping review through an Arksey and O'Malley five-staged process. Electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO), targeted websites, and reference lists were used to identify eligible CPGs on acute pancreatitis on February 22, 2024, and updated on March 27, 2025. Drawing from the UHC effective coverage framework, we mapped twelve indicators to a matrix representing health service types (i.e. promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation). The corresponding strength and quality of each recommendation were extracted, and the quality of overall CPGs was assessed using AGREE-II.

- **Findings**: Of the 22 CPGs identified, 11 were published over the past decade, and 17 (77.3%) were from high-income countries only. Only two guidelines included experts in rehabilitation and policymakers. A total of 718 recommendations were made and reported across: (i) prevention (n = 3; 2 studies); (ii) treatment (n = 696; 22 studies); and (iii) rehabilitation (n = 19; 4 studies). No recommendations were made around promotion or palliation. Of the twelve indicators, only obesity prevention or weight management were discussed.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for acute pancreatitis, specifically with respect to risk assessment, the WSES 2019 guidelines recommend recognizing that:

- **Hematocrit > 44%**: Represents an independent risk factor of pancreatic necrosis.

- **Urea > 20 mg/dL**: Represents an independent predictor of mortality.

- **Procalcitonin**: Is the most sensitive laboratory test for detection of pancreatic infection, and low serum values are strong negative predictors of infected pancreatic necrosis.
