## Question

What did the CASPIAN trial show about overall survival and safety when durvalumab was added to first-line platinum–etoposide for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the CASPIAN trial showed about overall survival and safety when durvalumab was added to first-line platinum-etoposide for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the trial design and population. Then, I should verify the efficacy results, especially median overall survival and hazard ratio. Next, I will examine safety outcomes, including grade 3–4 adverse events, serious adverse events, and treatment-related deaths. After that, I should review durability and subgroup signals, including PD-L1 and TMB analyses. Finally, I will contextualize these findings within guidelines and regulatory status to synthesize clinical implications.

> Let me first confirm the trial design and population so I don't jump to conclusions. CASPIAN was a randomized, open-label, phase 3 study in treatment-naïve extensive-stage SCLC, with patients assigned 1:1:1 to durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide, durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide, or platinum-etoposide alone; the primary endpoint was overall survival for durvalumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, and the reported comparison here focuses on the durvalumab arm versus control, with maintenance durvalumab after induction chemotherapy [^9fecc239] [^12b55e5d].

> Now, I should verify the efficacy results precisely. Median overall survival was 13.0 months with durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide versus 10.3 months with platinum-etoposide alone, yielding a hazard ratio for death of 0.73 with a 95% CI of 0.59–0.91 and a statistically significant P value of 0.0047; importantly, this benefit persisted in updated analyses with longer follow-up, reinforcing the durability of the effect [^9fecc239] [^12b55e5d] [^cc13c3c5].

> Wait, let me verify the magnitude and clinical meaning of that benefit. The absolute improvement is about 2.7 months in median OS, and the relative risk reduction in death is approximately 27%; longer-term outcomes also favored durvalumab, with 18-month survival around 34% versus 25% and 1-year survival around 52.8% versus 39.3%, which aligns with the hazard ratio and supports a clinically meaningful, albeit modest, survival gain in this disease setting [^9fecc239] [^cc13c3c5].

> Next, I should review safety carefully and make sure I'm not overstating tolerability. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 62% of patients in both the durvalumab plus chemotherapy arm and the chemotherapy-alone arm, indicating no excess in high-grade toxicity with the addition of durvalumab; serious adverse events were reported in 32% with durvalumab versus 36% with chemotherapy alone, and treatment-related deaths were 2% with durvalumab versus 1% with chemotherapy alone, which suggests a broadly similar safety profile with a small, acceptable increase in immune-related events [^9fecc239] [^cc13c3c5] [^ea7e3c1e].

> Hold on, I should verify immune-related toxicity and discontinuations. Immune-related adverse events were more frequent with durvalumab, around 20% versus 3% with chemotherapy alone, but most were manageable; discontinuations due to adverse events were about 7% with durvalumab, and the FDA label documents specific serious events such as febrile neutropenia, pneumonia, and pneumonitis, which reinforces the need for vigilance and steroid protocols for irAEs [^3c15ac72] [^ea7e3c1e].

> I will now examine durability and response patterns to ensure consistency. Median progression-free survival was numerically similar between arms, around 5.1 months with durvalumab versus 5.4 months with chemotherapy, yet the 1-year PFS rate was higher with durvalumab, reflecting a tail in the curve consistent with durable benefit in a subset; the objective response rate was 68% with durvalumab versus 58% with chemotherapy, supporting maintained chemosensitivity with added immunotherapy [^9fecc239] [^a68b37b7].

> But wait, what if biomarkers change the interpretation? I should double-check PD-L1 and TMB. Exploratory biomarker analyses showed that the OS benefit with durvalumab plus chemotherapy occurred irrespective of PD-L1 expression or tissue TMB, indicating no utility for these markers in selecting patients for durvalumab-based therapy; however, there was a signal that adding tremelimumab might confer greater benefit in PD-L1–positive subgroups, though this was not statistically definitive and warrants cautious interpretation [^edc741a6] [^6f0fc7ca] [^fa10aac8].

> Next, I should review how these findings fit into guidelines and regulatory status so the clinical implications are clear. Based on CASPIAN, durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide received FDA approval in March 2020 for first-line ES-SCLC, and major guidelines (NCCN, ESMO, ASCO) recommend PD-L1 inhibitor plus platinum-etoposide as a preferred first-line option for patients without contraindications to immunotherapy, with durvalumab or atezolizumab as acceptable choices and maintenance immunotherapy until progression or unacceptable toxicity [^8e513283] [^cc13c3c5] [^c3018243] [^fd8be79e].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing anything critical. CASPIAN demonstrated that adding durvalumab to first-line platinum-etoposide improves overall survival by about 2.7 months with a 27% reduction in the risk of death, without increasing grade 3–4 adverse events, and with a manageable increase in immune-related events; the benefit appears consistent across subgroups and is reflected in guideline-supported adoption of chemoimmunotherapy as a new standard for ES-SCLC, while acknowledging the modest absolute gain and the need for careful irAE management [^9fecc239] [^12b55e5d] [^cc13c3c5].

The CASPIAN trial showed that adding durvalumab to first-line platinum-etoposide **significantly improved overall survival** in extensive-stage SCLC, with a median OS of 13.0 months vs 10.3 months for chemotherapy alone (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.59–0.91; p = 0.0047) [^9fecc239] [^12b55e5d]. The safety profile was **similar to chemotherapy alone**, with 62% grade 3–4 adverse events in both arms and no new safety signals; immune-related adverse events were more frequent with durvalumab but were generally manageable [^9fecc239] [^12b55e5d]. These results support durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide as a **new standard first-line regimen** for extensive-stage SCLC [^cc13c3c5] [^c3018243].

## Overall survival benefit

- **Median overall survival**: 13.0 months with durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide vs 10.3 months with platinum-etoposide alone (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.59–0.91; p = 0.0047) [^9fecc239] [^12b55e5d].
- **One-year survival**: 52.8% vs 39.3% with chemotherapy alone [^cc13c3c5].
- **Eighteen-month survival**: 34% vs 25% with chemotherapy alone [^9fecc239].
- **Thirty-six-month survival**: 17.6% vs 5.8% with chemotherapy alone [^0aff04ad].

---

## Safety profile

- **Grade 3–4 adverse events**: 62% in both arms, indicating no significant increase in severe toxicity with durvalumab [^9fecc239] [^12b55e5d].
- **Serious adverse events**: 32% with durvalumab vs 36% with chemotherapy alone [^cc13c3c5].
- **Treatment-related deaths**: 2% with durvalumab vs 1% with chemotherapy alone [^cc13c3c5].
- **Immune-related adverse events**: More frequent with durvalumab but generally manageable [^3c15ac72].

## Clinical implications

The CASPIAN trial establishes durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide as a **new standard first-line treatment** for extensive-stage SCLC, providing a modest but significant survival benefit with a safety profile similar to chemotherapy alone [^cc13c3c5] [^c3018243]. This regimen is now recommended by major guidelines, including NCCN and ESMO, for patients with good performance status and no contraindications to immunotherapy [^cc13c3c5] [^c3018243].

Background

Most patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) have extensive-stage disease at presentation, and prognosis remains poor. Recently, immunotherapy has demonstrated clinical activity in extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). The CASPIAN trial assessed durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, in combination with etoposide plus either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum-etoposide) in treatment-naive patients with ES-SCLC.

Methods

This randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial was done at 209 sites across 23 countries. Eligible patients were adults with untreated ES-SCLC, with WHO performance status 0 or 1 and measurable disease as per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 1:1:1 ratio) to durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide; durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide; or platinum-etoposide alone. All drugs were administered intravenously. Platinum-etoposide consisted of etoposide 80–100 mg/m² on days 1–3 of each cycle with investigator's choice of either carboplatin area under the curve 5–6 mg/mL per min or cisplatin 75–80 mg/m² (administered on day 1 of each cycle). Patients received up to four cycles of platinum-etoposide plus durvalumab 1500 mg with or without tremelimumab 75 mg every 3 weeks followed by maintenance durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks in the immunotherapy groups and up to six cycles of platinum-etoposide every 3 weeks plus prophylactic cranial irradiation (investigator's discretion) in the platinum-etoposide group. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. We report results for the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group versus the platinum-etoposide group from a planned interim analysis. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of their assigned study treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03043872, and is ongoing.

Findings

Patients were enrolled between March 27, 2017, and May 29, 2018. 268 patients were allocated to the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group and 269 to the platinum-etoposide group. Durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival, with a hazard ratio of 0·73 (95% CI 0·59–0·91; p = 0·0047]); median overall survival was 13·0 months (95% CI 11·5–14·8) in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group versus 10·3 months (9·3–11·2) in the platinum-etoposide group, with 34% (26·9–41·0) versus 25% (18·4–31·6) of patients alive at 18 months. Any-cause adverse events of grade 3 or 4 occurred in 163 (62%) of 265 treated patients in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group and 166 (62%) of 266 in the platinum-etoposide group; adverse events leading to death occurred in 13 (5%) and 15 (6%) patients.

Interpretation

First-line durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide significantly improved overall survival in patients with ES-SCLC versus a clinically relevant control group. Safety findings were consistent with the known safety profiles of all drugs received.

The study CASPIAN was published by Luis Paz-Ares and colleagues in 2019 in the journal Lancet. This study is related to the following diseases: Small cell lung cancer. In the CASPIAN study, the trial question was: what is the role of first-line durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer? In the CASPIAN study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the CASPIAN study, the population was: 537 patients (163 female, 374 male). The inclusion criteria were adult patients with untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. The key exclusion criteria were history of radiotherapy to the chest or planned consolidation chest radiotherapy; active or previous autoimmune or inflammatory disorders; paraneoplastic syndrome of autoimmune nature requiring systemic treatment; active primary immunodeficiency; uncontrolled, concurrent illness or active infections. In the CASPIAN study, the interventions were: n = 268 durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide (four cycles of platinum-etoposide plus durvalumab 1,500 mg) n = 269 platinum-etoposide (platinum-etoposide alone). In the CASPIAN study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median overall survival (13 months vs. 10.3 months; HR 1.37, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.7). In the CASPIAN study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in median progression-free survival (5.1 months vs. 5.4 months; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.94) Significant increase in confirmed objective response (68% vs. 58%; OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.22). In the CASPIAN study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in adverse events, death due to adverse events. In the CASPIAN study, the conclusion was: in adult patients with untreated extensive-stage small cell lung cancer, durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide was superior to platinum-etoposide with respect to median overall survival.

### Durvalumab, with or without tremelimumab, plus platinum-etoposide versus platinum-etoposide alone in first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): updated results from a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 3 trial [^12b55e5d]. The Lancet: Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Background

First-line durvalumab plus etoposide with either cisplatin or carboplatin (platinum-etoposide) showed a significant improvement in overall survival versus platinum-etoposide alone in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) in the CASPIAN study. Here we report updated results, including the primary analysis for overall survival with durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide versus platinum-etoposide alone.

Methods

CASPIAN is an ongoing, open-label, sponsor-blind, randomised, controlled phase 3 trial at 209 cancer treatment centres in 23 countries worldwide. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older (20 years in Japan) and had treatment-naive, histologically or cytologically documented ES-SCLC, with a WHO performance status of 0 or 1. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) in blocks of six, stratified by planned platinum, using an interactive voice-response or web-response system to receive intravenous durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide, durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide, or platinum-etoposide alone. In all groups, patients received etoposide 80–100 mg/m² on days 1–3 of each cycle with investigator's choice of either carboplatin area under the curve 5–6 mg/mL/min or cisplatin 75–80 mg/m² on day 1 of each cycle. Patients in the platinum-etoposide group received up to six cycles of platinum-etoposide every 3 weeks and optional prophylactic cranial irradiation (investigator's discretion). Patients in the immunotherapy groups received four cycles of platinum-etoposide plus durvalumab 1500 mg with or without tremelimumab 75 mg every 3 weeks followed by maintenance durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks. The two primary endpoints were overall survival for durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide versus platinum-etoposide and for durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide versus platinum-etoposide in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03043872.

Findings

Between March 27, 2017, and May 29, 2018, 972 patients were screened and 805 were randomly assigned (268 to durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide, 268 to durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide, and 269 to platinum-etoposide). As of Jan 27, 2020, the median follow-up was 25·1 months (IQR 22·3–27·9). Durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide was not associated with a significant improvement in overall survival versus platinum-etoposide (hazard ratio [HR] 0·82 [95% CI 0·68–1·00]; p = 0·045); median overall survival was 10·4 months (95% CI 9·6–12·0) versus 10·5 months (9·3–11·2). Durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide showed sustained improvement in overall survival versus platinum-etoposide (HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·62–0·91]; nominal p = 0·0032); median overall survival was 12·9 months (95% CI 11·3–14·7) versus 10·5 months (9·3–11·2). The most common any-cause grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (85 [32%] of 266 patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide group, 64 [24%] of 265 patients in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group, and 88 [33%] of 266 patients in the platinum-etoposide group) and anaemia (34 [13%], 24 [9%], and 48 [18%]). Any-cause serious adverse events were reported in 121 (45%) patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide group, 85 (32%) in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group, and 97 (36%) in the platinum-etoposide group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in 12 (5%) patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus platinum-etoposide group (death, febrile neutropenia, and pulmonary embolism [n = 2 each]; enterocolitis, general physical health deterioration and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, pneumonia, pneumonitis and hepatitis, respiratory failure, and sudden death [n = 1 each]), six (2%) patients in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group (cardiac arrest, dehydration, hepatotoxicity, interstitial lung disease, pancytopenia, and sepsis [n = 1 each]), and two (1%) in the platinum-etoposide group (pancytopenia and thrombocytopenia [n = 1 each]).

Interpretation

First-line durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide showed sustained overall survival improvement versus platinum-etoposide but the addition of tremelimumab to durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide did not significantly improve outcomes versus platinum-etoposide. These results support the use of durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide as a new standard of care for the first-line treatment of ES-SCLC.

### FDA approval summary: atezolizumab and durvalumab in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy in extensive stage small cell lung cancer [^13141f03]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted approval to atezolizumab and durvalumab in March of 2019 and 2020, respectively, for use in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer. These approvals were based on data from two randomized controlled trials, IMpower133 (atezolizumab) and CASPIAN (durvalumab). Both trials demonstrated an improvement in overall survival (OS) with anti-programmed death ligand 1 antibodies when added to platinum-based chemotherapy as compared with chemotherapy alone. In IMpower133, patients receiving atezolizumab with etoposide and carboplatin demonstrated improved OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54–0.91; p = .0069), with median OS of 12.3 months compared with 10.3 months in patients receiving etoposide and carboplatin. In CASPIAN, patients receiving durvalumab with etoposide and either cisplatin or carboplatin also demonstrated improved OS (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.91; p = .0047) with median OS of 13.0 months compared with 10.3 months in patients receiving etoposide and either cisplatin or carboplatin. The safety profiles of both drugs were generally consistent with known toxicities of immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapies. This review summarizes the FDA perspective and data supporting the approval of these two agents. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Effective therapeutic options for small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are limited, and there has been modest improvement in the overall survival (OS) of patients with SCLC over the past 3 decades. The approvals of atezolizumab and of durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of patients with extensive stage SCLC represent the first approved therapies with OS benefit for this patient population since the approval of etoposide in combination with other approved chemotherapeutic agents. Additionally, the efficacy results from IMpower133 and CASPIAN lay the groundwork for possible further evaluation in other treatment settings in this disease.

### Small cell lung cancer, version 2.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^cc13c3c5]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Durvalumab plus etoposide with carboplatin or cisplatin (CASPIAN) in previously untreated extensive-stage SCLC was evaluated against chemotherapy alone with maintenance durvalumab in the combination arm. A 3-year analysis showed that the median overall survival was 13.0 months (95% CI, 11.5–14.8) in the durvalumab plus chemotherapy group and 10.3 months (95% CI, 9.3–11.2) in the chemotherapy alone group (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.91; P = 0.0047). The 1-year overall survival rate was 52.8% for the durvalumab regimen versus 39.3% for chemotherapy alone, and most patients received carboplatin (78%). Safety outcomes were similar between groups, including serious adverse events (32% vs. 36%) and death from adverse events (2% vs. 1%). In this trial, adding tremelimumab to durvalumab/etoposide carboplatin (or cisplatin) did not improve overall survival (OS) compared with platinum/etoposide (10.4 vs. 10.5 months; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–1.0). Based on the data and FDA approval, the NCCN SCLC Panel recommends durvalumab plus etoposide plus (carboplatin or cisplatin) as a category 1 and preferred first-line systemic therapy option.

Small cell lung cancer — durvalumab plus etoposide/platinum first-line therapy (CASPIAN) and recommendation: CASPIAN, a phase 3 randomized trial, assessed adding durvalumab to etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin followed by maintenance durvalumab in 537 patients with previously untreated extensive-stage SCLC; most patients received carboplatin (78%). A 3-year analysis showed that the median overall survival (OS) was 13.0 months (95% CI, 11.5–14.8) in the chemotherapy/durvalumab group and 10.3 months (95% CI, 9.3–11.2) in the chemotherapy alone group (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59–0.91; P = 0.0047), and the 1-year OS rate was 52.8% for the durvalumab regimen versus 39.3% for chemotherapy alone; the rate of serious adverse events was similar in both groups (32% vs. 36%) and the death rate from adverse events was also similar (2% vs. 1%). In this trial, adding tremelimumab to carboplatin (or cisplatin)/durvalumab/etoposide did not improve OS compared with platinum/etoposide (10.4 vs. 10.5 months; HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–1.0). Based on the data and FDA approval, the Panel recommends carboplatin or cisplatin/durvalumab/etoposide as a category 1 and preferred first-line systemic therapy option followed by maintenance durvalumab for patients with extensive-stage SCLC, including those with asymptomatic untreated brain metastases.

### Durvalumab ± tremelimumab + platinum-etoposide in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): outcomes by PD-L1 expression and tissue tumor mutational burden [^71fdb3d4]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

After many years with little improvement in outcomes for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), the phase III CASPIAN and IMpower133 studies showed that the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) to first-line platinum doublet chemotherapy prolonged overall survival (OS) in patients with this aggressive and rapidly fatal tumor.

Durvalumab is a selective, high-affinity human IgG1 mAb that targets PD-L1, blocking its binding to programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and CD80. The phase III CASPIAN study investigated the efficacy and safety of first-line durvalumab, with or without the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor tremelimumab, in combination with etoposide plus either carboplatin or cisplatin (EP), compared with EP alone in patients with treatment-naïve ES-SCLC. At a planned interim analysis (data cutoff: March 11, 2019), durvalumab plus EP significantly improved OS compared with EP alone, with a HR of 0.73 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.59–0.91; P = 0.0047]: median OS was 13.0 and 10.3 months in the durvalumab plus EP and EP arms, respectively. This survival benefit was sustained at updated analyses after approximately 2 and 3 years of follow-up, establishing durvalumab plus EP as a global standard of care in this setting. However, durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP did not significantly improve OS versus EP (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.68–1.00; P = 0.0451; ref.).

### Carboplatin, etoposide, atezolizumab, and bevacizumab in the first-line treatment of patients with extensive stage small-cell lung cancer: the GOIRC-01-2019 CeLEBrATE study [^ba2f1ee5]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2025). Medium credibility.

The phase III IMpower133 trial randomized patients with ES-SCLC in the first-line setting to receive a combination of carboplatin and etoposide plus atezolizumab or placebo for four 21-day cycles (induction phase), followed by a maintenance phase during which they received either atezolizumab or placebo. Atezolizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody directed against PD-L1, which prevents the interaction with PD-1, leading to activation of tumor-specific T-cell responses. Co-primary endpoints of the IMpower133 study were OS and progression-free survival (PFS) and were both met as the mOS was 12.3 months compared with 10.3 months, whereas the median PFS (mPFS) was 5.2 months and 4.3 months in the atezolizumab arm and in the placebo arm, respectively. In addition, both 1-year and 1.5-year survival rates were higher in patients who received atezolizumab compared with the placebo group. Updated survival data confirmed these findings and showed that atezolizumab improved survival regardless of tumor mutational burden or PD-L1 expression.

In the phase III CASPIAN trial, durvalumab, a fully-human anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, was combined with platinum-etoposide in treatment-naïve patients with ES-SCLC showing an improved OS, the primary endpoint of the study, compared with platinum-etoposide alone (12.9 vs 10.5 months, respectively). The addition of PD-L1 inhibition with either atezolizumab or durvalumab to platinum-etoposide chemotherapy was safe, with a manageable toxicity profile consistent with what was previously reported, and did not negatively affect the patient's quality of life. A meta-analysis including two additional trials confirmed that the addition of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors to chemotherapy improves all activity and efficacy outcomes, with a good safety profile. The FDA approved the use of durvalumab for extensive-stage SCLC in the first-line setting shortly thereafter.

### Comparison of first-line treatments for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1edcbb44]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is the combination of a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor with etoposide-platinum chemotherapy associated with better tumor response among patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer compared with other first-line treatments?

Findings

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis of 3 phase 2 and 11 phase 3 randomized clinical trials, which included 4838 patients, the combination of a PD-L1 inhibitor (durvalumab or atezolizumab) with etoposide-platinum regimen was associated with better tumor response and safety than other regimens.

Meaning

The findings of this study suggest that the PD-L1 inhibitor plus etoposide-platinum regimen may be an optimal first-line treatment for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of lung cancer and mesothelioma [^c0bcffc1]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2022). Medium credibility.

Durvalumab was FDA-approved in March 2020, as a first-line treatment for ES-SCLC, in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin, based on the phase III, randomized, open-label CASPIAN trial (NCT03043872). The 268 patients who received durvalumab with chemotherapy exhibited a significant advantage in median OS versus chemotherapy treatment (269 patients) alone. Similar rates of AEs were reported in both arms, with 98% for the durvalumab group and 97% for the chemotherapy group. Both arms reported grade 3–5 AEs at a rate of 62%. Another arm of this trial examined the durvalumab plus chemotherapy regimen in combination with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 ICI, but this combination did not meet the primary endpoint of improved OS compared with the chemotherapy combination regimen.

Pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy has also been investigated in the first-line setting in the randomized, double-blind, phase III KEYNOTE-604 trial (NCT03066778), which compared pembrolizumab plus etoposide and platinum-based therapy with placebo plus etoposide and platinum-based therapy for patients with ES-SCLC. The addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy improved PFS compared with chemotherapy alone (median PFS 4.5 months vs 4.3 months, 12 month PFS 13.6% vs 3.1%; HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.61 to 0.91; p = 0.0023). Numerically superior OS was reported in the pembrolizumab arm, however the prespecified threshold for statistical significance was not met (median OS 10.8 months vs 9.7 months, 12 month OS 22.5% vs 11.2%; HR 0.80; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.98; p = 0.0164).

Statistical analysis

The biomarker analyses reported here were based on data from the updated analysis of CASPIAN with a median follow-up of 25.1 months (data cutoff: January 27, 2020). The PD-L1 and tTMB biomarker-evaluable population (BEP) included all randomized patients who had a tumor sample available for PD-L1 and tTMB testing, respectively, and an evaluable result. Within each subset, safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of treatment.

For both the overall PD-L1 BEP and the overall tTMB BEP, OS and PFS were analyzed as for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population using a stratified log-rank test adjusted for planned platinum therapy at cycle 1, with HRs and 95% CI estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model. OS and PFS were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. PD-L1 and tTMB subgroup analyses (based on different cut-off thresholds) used an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model with treatment as the only covariate. The ORR was analyzed using a logistic regression model stratified for planned platinum at cycle 1 for the overall PD-L1 and tTMB BEPs, and an unstratified model for subgroup analyses, to calculate the ORs and associated 95% CIs comparing the response rate between treatment arms. An unstratified Cox proportional hazards or logistic regression model (for ORR) was used to test for any evidence of an interaction between treatment effect and tTMB; the model in each case included covariates for treatment effect, tTMB score (as a continuous variable), and a treatment by tTMB score interaction. A χ² statistic from each model with and without the interaction term was used to calculate the P value. Because the analyses of PD-L1 expression and TMB were exploratory, no adjustments were made for multiple comparisons. All analyses used SAS (version 9.4).

### Extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer in patients receiving atezolizumab plus carboplatin-etoposide: stratification of outcome based on a composite score that combines gene expression profiling and immune characterization of microenvironment [^360155d2]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis, accounting for approximately 15% of all lung cancers. Most patients are diagnosed with an extensive-stage disease (ES). Platinum-based chemotherapy has been the standard first-line treatment over the past 40 years; however, after an initial response to treatment, progression typically occurs within 1 year.

Several studies have consistently shown that the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to standard chemotherapy improves survival, thus leading to a new standard first-line treatment in this setting.

In the randomized phase III IMpower-133 trial, the addition of atezolizumab to standard chemotherapy showed a significant improvement in median overall survival (mOS) from 10.3 to 12.3 months compared with chemotherapy alone, with a manageable safety profile. Similarly, the CASPIAN trial showed an mOS improvement with the addition of durvalumab to chemotherapy (12.9 months) compared with chemotherapy alone (10.5 months).

However, durable benefit occurs in about 15% of patients. Several predictive biomarkers have been investigated, but the prospective identification of patients more likely to have a better outcome appears challenging in SCLC. Indeed, tissue samples are often scarce, the aggressive nature of the disease often precludes in-depth studies requiring surgical specimens, and classical immune-predictive biomarkers such as PD-L1 or tumor mutational burden (TMB) do not correlate with outcome.

Tumor immune microenvironment (TME) of SCLC remains poorly understood and is commonly classified as "cold" lacking an infiltration of cytotoxic immune cells, notwithstanding the presence of high TMB. While high TMB correlates with increased neoantigen production and favorable response to anti-PD-L1/PD1 in NSCLC, this is not the case in SCLC. These observations underscore the need to uncover the mechanisms restricting immune cell infiltration in SCLC to develop therapeutic approaches that warm up the immune landscape and to identify predictive biomarkers for patient selection.

### Comparison of first-line treatments for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^93562d7a]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Conclusions

The findings of this network meta-analysis suggest that, in general, PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab or durvalumab) plus etoposide-platinum chemotherapy may be an optimal first-line treatment for patients with ES-SCLC; it was associated with the best OS and the fewest toxic effects. Moreover, the addition of bevacizumab to etoposide-platinum chemotherapy was associated with the most TRAEs of grade 3 or higher. These findings could provide recommendations for clinicians in selecting first-line treatments based on their clinical benefits and safety profiles.

### First-line durvalumab in addition to etoposide and platinum for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a U.S.-Based cost-effectiveness analysis [^f49d92d6]. The Oncologist (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The latest published CASPIAN trial demonstrated that adding durvalumab to etoposide and platinum (EP) improved survival dramatically for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Considering the high cost of durvalumab, this study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab plus EP (DEP) in the first-line setting for treatment-naïve patients with ES-SCLC from the U.S. payer perspective.

Materials and Methods

We developed a three-state Markov model to simulate the disease course and source consumption of ES-SCLC over a lifetime horizon. Pseudo-individual patient-level data were generated from digitized Kaplan-Meier curves. Direct medical costs, including drug and administration costs, disease management and adverse events treatment fees, best supportive care and terminal care costs were obtained from sources including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, and relevant literature. Health state utility values were derived from published literature. Main outcomes considered were total costs, life-years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). All costs were adjusted for inflation to reflect 2019 U.S. dollars. The willingness-to-pay threshold was set as $150,000/QALY. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were used to explore the uncertainty of model assumptions.

Results

Compared with EP, DEP was projected to increase life expectancy by 0.86 LYs (1.73 vs. 0.87) and 0.44 QALYs (0.93 vs. 0.49). The incremental treatment cost was $95,907, and the corresponding ICER was $216,953/QALY. The result was most sensitive to the variation of durvalumab acquisition cost. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed that the probability of DEP over EP regimen to be cost-effective was 9.4% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $150,000/QALY. In the case of reducing the price of durvalumab by 30.7%, DEP was more cost-effective than EP.

Conclusion

From the perspective of the U.S. payer, adding durvalumab to EP is estimated to be not cost-effective compared with EP alone for patients with untreated ES-SCLC.

Implications For Practice

The information provided by this analysis serves as a reference for decision makers. Lowering the price of durvalumab would be a potential measure to improve the economics of durvalumab plus etoposide and platinum (DEP), and the inclusion of durvalumab in the Medicare pharmacopeia could make DEP more economically available. These results may also guide physicians and patients to choose the most economically feasible treatment.

Materials and Methods

Study design and patients

CASPIAN (NCT03043872) is an open-label, sponsor-blind, multicenter, randomized, international phase III study, for which the primary analyses have been published previously. In brief, eligible patients were aged ≥ 18 years and had treatment-naïve, histologically or cytologically documented ES-SCLC; World Health Organization (WHO) performance status score of 0 or 1; measurable disease according to RECIST, version 1.1; and a life expectancy of at least 12 weeks. Patients with asymptomatic or treated and stable brain metastases were permitted. All patients provided signed informed consent for participation in the study. The study protocol and all amendments were approved by the relevant ethics committees and regulatory authorities, and the study was run in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization good clinical practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, and applicable local regulations.

Treatment

Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to receive durvalumab plus EP, durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP, or EP; randomization was stratified according to planned platinum agent (carboplatin or cisplatin). In all arms, chemotherapy comprised etoposide 80‒100 mg/m², administered on days 1 to 3 of each 21-day cycle, and investigator's choice of either carboplatin AUC 5‒6 mg/mL/minute or cisplatin 75‒80 mg/m², given on day 1 of each cycle. In the immunotherapy arms, patients received four cycles of EP plus durvalumab 1,500 mg with or without tremelimumab 75 mg every 3 weeks, followed by maintenance durvalumab 1,500 mg every 4 weeks; patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP arms also received one further dose of tremelimumab 75 mg after EP. In the EP arm, patients could receive an additional two cycles of EP (up to six cycles maximum) and prophylactic cranial irradiation administered at the investigator's discretion after chemotherapy. Treatment continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or other discontinuation criteria were met. Study treatment beyond disease progression was allowed if there was evidence of clinical benefit.

### Durvalumab ± tremelimumab + platinum-etoposide in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): outcomes by PD-L1 expression and tissue tumor mutational burden [^fd327f55]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The OS benefit was greater with durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP versus EP in the TC or IC ≥ 1% subgroup than in the TC and IC < 1% subgroup. Randomization was not stratified by PD-L1 expression and there were some imbalances in baseline characteristics between treatment arms within the TC or IC ≥ 1% subgroup that could have influenced prognosis. However, the OS benefit remained after adjustment for these imbalances in a post hoc analysis. Although total exposure to durvalumab was greater in the durvalumab plus EP arm than in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP arm in the TC or IC ≥ 1% population, treatment with durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP had a more pronounced effect on OS. These results suggest that CTLA-4 inhibition may better complement the effect of PD-L1 inhibition to maintain antitumor activity in patients with PD-L1 expression, but this finding would require prospective validation.

The lack of association between PD-L1 expression and efficacy outcomes with anti-PD-(L)1 in the absence of coinhibition of CTLA-4 in CASPIAN is consistent with findings from the phase III IMpower133 study of first-line atezolizumab plus chemotherapy and the phase III KEYNOTE-604 study of first-line pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, both in patients with ES-SCLC. Whether or not the relationship between PD-L1 expression and treatment effect might be influenced by the presence of chemotherapy is currently unclear. Conflicting results were reported from earlier phase studies of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as monotherapy in pretreated SCLC without an active comparator arm. However, comparison of results across earlier phase studies is complicated by the use of different assays and scoring systems to evaluate PD-L1, as well as the exploratory nature of these analyses, and the potential confounding prognostic effects in single-arm studies.

### Durvalumab ± tremelimumab + platinum-etoposide in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): outcomes by PD-L1 expression and tissue tumor mutational burden [^edc741a6]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

In the CASPIAN trial, first-line durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide (EP) significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus EP alone in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We report exploratory analyses of CASPIAN outcomes by programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and tissue tumor mutational burden (tTMB).

Experimental Design

Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to durvalumab (1,500 mg) plus EP, durvalumab plus tremelimumab (75 mg) plus EP, or EP alone. Treatment effects in PD-L1 and tTMB subgroups were estimated using an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model.

Results

The PD-L1 and tTMB biomarker-evaluable populations (BEP) comprised 54.4% (438/805) and 35.2% (283/805) of the intention-to-treat population, respectively. PD-L1 prevalence was low: 5.7%, 25.8%, and 28.3% had PD-L1 expression on ≥ 1% tumor cells (TC), ≥ 1% immune cells (IC), and ≥ 1% TCs or ICs, respectively. OS benefit with durvalumab plus EP versus EP was similar across PD-L1 subgroups, with HRs all falling within the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the PD-L1 BEP (0.47‒0.79). OS benefit with durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP versus EP was greater in PD-L1 ≥ 1% versus < 1% subgroups, although CIs overlapped. There was no evidence of an interaction between tTMB and treatment effect on OS (durvalumab plus EP vs. EP, P = 0.916; durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP vs. EP, P = 0.672).

Conclusions

OS benefit with first-line durvalumab plus EP in patients with ES-SCLC was observed regardless of PD-L1 or tTMB status. PD-L1 expression may prove to be a useful biomarker for combined treatment with PD-(L)1 and CTLA-4 inhibition, although this requires confirmation with an independent dataset. See related commentary by Rolfo and Russo, p. 652.

### Durvalumab ± tremelimumab + platinum-etoposide in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): outcomes by PD-L1 expression and tissue tumor mutational burden [^14cb0891]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Translational Relevance

Addition of durvalumab to first-line platinum-etoposide (EP) prolongs overall survival (OS) in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Some reports suggest programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and tissue tumor mutational burden (tTMB) are predictive biomarkers of outcomes with PD-(L)1 inhibitors in other tumor types, but no evidence clearly supports their validity in SCLC. Exploratory analyses from the phase III CASPIAN trial showed low prevalence of PD-L1 expression, particularly on tumor cells. OS benefit with durvalumab plus EP versus EP was not linked to PD-L1 expression or tTMB, suggesting neither is useful in selecting patients or predicting outcomes with durvalumab plus EP in ES-SCLC. With durvalumab plus tremelimumab and EP, OS benefit versus EP appeared greater in subgroups with PD-L1 expression on ≥ 1% tumor or immune cells, suggesting PD-L1 may be a useful biomarker for treatment with anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-CTLA-4; however, confirmation from a prospective dataset is required.

Abstract

Purpose:

In the CASPIAN trial, first-line durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide (EP) significantly improved overall survival (OS) versus EP alone in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). We report exploratory analyses of CASPIAN outcomes by programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression and tissue tumor mutational burden (tTMB).

Experimental Design:

Patients were randomized (1:1:1) to durvalumab (1,500 mg) plus EP, durvalumab plus tremelimumab (75 mg) plus EP, or EP alone. Treatment effects in PD-L1 and tTMB subgroups were estimated using an unstratified Cox proportional hazards model.

### Novel combinations of immunotherapies or DNA damage repair inhibitors in platinum-refractory extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: the phase II BALTIC study [^e7256135]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Platinum-based chemotherapy was the primary treatment modality for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) for many years, with improvements in overall survival (OS) only recently demonstrated by the addition of PD-L1 inhibitors to chemotherapy. Nonetheless, most patients relapse within months of completing initial therapy, and platinum-refractory or -resistant ES-SCLC has a particularly poor prognosis, highlighting the need for novel treatment options to improve outcomes. The current standard-of-care second-line treatment outside Japan is typically topotecan, associated with an objective response rate (ORR) of 9.4% and median OS of 5.7 months in patients refractory to first-line therapy.

The rationale for investigating immunotherapy in SCLC is based on its immunogenic nature. However, early successes in treating relapsed ES-SCLC with inhibitors of programmed cell death 1 (PD1) have not yet been confirmed in phase III studies. Durvalumab is a selective, high-affinity human IgG1κ mAb, which binds to PD-L1 and blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with PD1 and CD80. First-line durvalumab in combination with platinum–etoposide (EP) is approved in patients with ES-SCLC in multiple countries worldwide based on the results of the phase III CASPIAN study. In pretreated ES-SCLC, durvalumab monotherapy exhibited promising clinical activity in a phase I/II study.

Combination of PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors with cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) inhibitors is of interest because PD-L1 and CTLA4 regulate immune responses by different, nonredundant mechanisms. Tremelimumab, a selective human IgG2 monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA4, in combination with durvalumab has demonstrated a manageable safety profile and encouraging antitumor activity phase I studies in tumor types including ES-SCLC and non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; refs.). In the phase III POSEIDON study, durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus chemotherapy significantly improved OS and progression-free survival (PFS) versus chemotherapy alone in patients with metastatic NSCLC. However, outcomes of other phase III studies in metastatic NSCLC have been variable. In CASPIAN, addition of tremelimumab to first-line durvalumab plus EP was not associated with a significant improvement in OS versus EP in patients with ES-SCLC.

### Comparison of first-line treatments for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^5eb212f4]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Combinations of chemotherapy with immunotherapy or bevacizumab in first-line treatments of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) have been evaluated in various clinical trials. However, it remains unclear what the optimal combination regimen is.

Objective

To clarify which first-line combination regimen is associated with the best tumor response among patients with ES-SCLC.

Data Sources

Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science) were systematically searched to extract eligible literature from database inception to December 2019.

Study Selection

Head-to-head randomized clinical trials on first-line treatments for patients with ES-SCLC were included with outcomes and toxic effects reported, including objective response rate (ORR, involving complete response and partial response), disease control rate (DCR, involving complete response, partial response, and stable disease), progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and treatment related adverse events (TRAEs) of grades 3 to 5. Of 199 eligible articles, 14 were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were independently extracted and collected by 2 reviewers based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Main outcomes were OS, PFS, DCR, ORR, and TRAEs of grades 3 to 5.

Results

A total of 3 phase 2 and 11 phase 3 randomized clinical trials involving 4838 patients were included. Programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor (durvalumab and atezolizumab) plus etoposide-based chemotherapy, compared with etoposide-based chemotherapy alone, showed the most favorable OS (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.09–1.80) and the best DCR (odds ratio [OR], 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21–0.81). Bevacizumab plus etoposide-based chemotherapy provided the best PFS compared with etoposide-based chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09–2.27), although this was not translated into OS benefit. The addition of PD-L1 inhibitors to etoposide-platinum chemotherapy caused no more toxic effects in general (compared with etoposide-based chemotherapy alone: OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.36–2.31), while bevacizumab plus etoposide-platinum regimen induced the most TRAEs grades 3 to 5 among all first-line treatments (eg, compared with irinotecan-platinum regimen: OR, 4.24; 95% CI, 1.26–14.57). Based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve value, PD-L1 inhibitor plus etoposide-platinum had the highest probability of being ranked first for OS (0.87) and DCR (0.97).

Conclusions and Relevance

The findings of this systematic review and network meta-analysis suggest that the combination of a PD-L1 inhibitor (durvalumab and atezolizumab) and etoposide-based chemotherapy may be an optimal first-line treatment option for patients with ES-SCLC patients.

### Efficacy, safety, and exploratory biomarker analysis of envafolimab plus carboplatin and etoposide as first-line treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer: a prospective, single-arm, phase II trial [^9d5b77c1]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancer cases and is characterized by rapid growth, early metastasis, high malignancy, and poor prognosis. Approximately 70% of patients with SCLC are initially diagnosed with extensive-stage SCLC (ES‐SCLC), losing the opportunity for radical surgery. Currently, the combination of platinum and etoposide remains the standard first-line treatment regimen for ES-SCLC. Although the majority of the patients with ES-SCLC are originally highly sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents, the rapid development of resistance appears inevitably. In recent decades, there have been advances and breakthroughs in the treatment of ES-SCLC, but more drugs with high efficiency and low toxicity are still warranted to improve patient clinical outcomes.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), represented by programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, have revolutionized the treatment landscape of advanced solid tumors, yielding important milestones in cancer treatment, either alone or in combination. ES-SCLC has a relatively high degree of somatic mutation frequency and immunogenicity, which may indicate that tumors may be immunogenic and benefit from ICIs. As evidenced by the IMpower133, first-line atezolizumab plus platinum-etoposide showed superior PFS (5.2 months vs. 4.3 months, P = 0.020) and OS (12.3 months vs. 10.3 months, P = 0.007) compared with platinum-etoposide alone. Similarly, the combination of durvalumab and chemotherapy also significantly improved the OS of patients with ES-SCLC (13.0 months vs. 10.3 months, HR = 0.73, 95% CI, 0.59–0.91; P = 0.005). Additionally, adverse effects (AEs) in the combination group were generally clinically controllable and manageable. In brief, immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy resulted in favorable therapeutic efficacy with a tolerable safety profile and was established as the standard treatment regimen for first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. However, some patients may still experience intolerable AEs over the course of treatment, such as immune-related pneumonitis and enteritis. Additionally, the majority of currently approved ICIs are administered by continuous intravenous infusion, which is inconvenient for patients. Hence, novel treatment regimens are thus warranted to further improve the efficiency and safety, with favorable convenience for patients with ES-SCLC.

### Durvalumab, carboplatin, and etoposide in patients who are treatment-naive with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer and poor performance status (NEJ045A): a single-arm phase 2 trial [^e2d4eb11]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Background

Treating patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) with poor performance status poses considerable challenges. We aimed to evaluate the combination of an immune checkpoint inhibitor with platinum-based therapy in this population.

Methods

This open-label, single-arm phase 2 NEJ045A trial enrolled untreated patients with extensive-stage SCLC with performance status 2 or 3. Participants received four cycles of durvalumab, carboplatin, and etoposide, followed by durvalumab maintenance. A dose adjustment strategy was used, with initial reductions in carboplatin-etoposide dosages, subsequently adjusted based on adverse events, allowing for potential escalation. The primary endpoint was tolerability, assessed by the proportion of patients completing induction therapy. A key secondary endpoint was 1-year survival rate. This trial is registered at the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jRCTs031200319) and has been completed.

Findings

Between April 8, 2021, and Oct 3, 2023, 57 patients (performance status 2 n = 43 and performance status 3 n = 14) were enrolled with a median age of 73·5 years (IQR 69·0–77·5), 44 (79%) of 56 were male. 26 (67%; 80% CI 55·2–76·7; p < 0·0001) of 39 patients with performance status 2 and five (50%; 26·7–73·3; p = 0·0088) of ten with performance status 3 completed induction therapy, exceeding the pre-specified threshold. Grade 3 or higher adverse events occurred in 52 (93%) of 56 patients, and 12 (21%) of 56 discontinued due to adverse events. The 1-year survival rates were 43·4% (80% CI 34·1–53·1) overall (p < 0·0001), 50·0% (39·1–60·9) in performance status 2 (p < 0·0001), and 18·2% (5·0–41·5) in performance status 3.

Interpretation

Durvalumab, carboplatin, and etoposide showed tolerability and promising efficacy as a first-line treatment for patients with untreated extensive-stage SCLC with poor performance status, supporting the integration of immune checkpoint inhibitors in this therapeutically challenging population.

### Cost-effectiveness analysis of durvalumab plus chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer [^65e7af19]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In the CASPIAN trial, durvalumab + chemotherapy demonstrated significant improvements in overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of durvalumab in patients with extensive-stage SCLC from the US healthcare system perspective.

Patients and Methods

A comprehensive Markov model was adapted to evaluate cost and effectiveness of durvalumab combination versus platinum/etoposide alone in the first-line therapy of extensive-stage SCLC based on data from the CASPIAN study. The main endpoints included total costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-e-ectiveness ratios (ICERs). Model robustness was assessed with sensitivity analysis, and additional subgroup analyses were also performed.

Results

Durvalumab + chemotherapy therapy resulted in an additional 0.27 LYs and 0.20 QALYs, resulting in an ICER of $464,711.90 per QALY versus the chemotherapy treatment. The cost of durvalumab has the greatest inﬂuence on this model. Subgroup analyses showed that the ICER remained higher than $150,000/QALY (the willingness-to-pay threshold in the United States) across all patient subgroups.

Conclusions

Durvalumab in combination with platinum/etoposide is not a cost-effective option in the first-line treatment of patients with extensive-stage SCLC.

Small cell lung cancer — other immunotherapy strategies: Despite the success with atezolizumab/chemotherapy or durvalumab/chemotherapy regimens, other immunotherapy-based strategies have not been as favorable; in extensive-stage SCLC, a phase 3 randomized trial adding ipilimumab to cisplatin or carboplatin/etoposide as first-line therapy did not improve either OS or PFS compared with chemotherapy alone, and another phase 3 randomized trial showed no improvement in OS with first-line pembrolizumab plus etoposide/platinum followed by maintenance pembrolizumab compared with chemotherapy alone.

### Durvalumab ± tremelimumab + platinum-etoposide in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): outcomes by PD-L1 expression and tissue tumor mutational burden [^320d5b42]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this exploratory biomarker analysis from the CASPIAN study, tumor samples were collected from 64% of patients in the ITT population; PD-L1 and tTMB were evaluable in 54% and 35% of the ITT population, respectively. On the basis of the low prevalence of PD-L1 expression in the CASPIAN population, we explored thresholds of 1% expression on TCs, ICs, or TCs and ICs combined. We observed a similar benefit in OS with durvalumab plus EP versus EP regardless of PD-L1 expression. However, OS benefit with durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP versus EP appeared greater in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% subgroups, driven particularly by benefit in the IC ≥ 1% subgroup, suggesting potential predictive value of PD-L1 for this combination regimen. Because the predictive value of TMB has not been established in SCLC, there was no predefined tTMB cutoff in this study. However, analysis using a range of tTMB cutoffs that gave a meaningful sample size indicated that tTMB was not predictive of OS benefit with either durvalumab plus EP or with durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP, versus EP.

Consistent with previously published data in SCLC, the overall prevalence of PD-L1 expression in CASPIAN was low, particularly on TCs. The PD-L1 BEP had better efficacy outcomes than the ITT population for both treatment comparisons; this increased clinical benefit appeared to be driven by a relatively poor performance in the EP arm, as indicated by a higher proportion of deaths and progression events, and lower confirmed ORR in patients from this treatment arm in the BEP when compared with the ITT population. While there were no obvious differences in baseline characteristics of the EP arm in each BEP, the higher rate of adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation in the EP arm of the PD-L1 safety population compared with the EP arm of the overall safety population may have contributed to the comparatively poor survival outcomes in the EP arm in the PD-L1 BEP.

INTRODUCTION

Nearly two-thirds of patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) have extensive-stage (ES) disease at diagnosis, which is associated with poor prognosis and a 5-year survival rate of < 7%. Platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin [CP] or cisplatin) with etoposide (ET) has remained the standard treatment for > 2 decades. Despite initial high response rates, median survival is limited to approximately 10 months. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated improved outcomes in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). - Based on the double-blinded, randomized phase III IMpower133 study, the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor atezolizumab, in combination with CP and ET (CP/ET), was approved for the first-line (1L) treatment of ES-SCLC by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)and the European Medicines Agency. Results from the randomized, phase III CASPIAN study also recently led to the FDA approval of the combination of the PD-L1 inhibitor, durvalumab, plus platinum and ET for the 1L treatment of ES-SCLC. In addition, based on durable responses observed in nonrandomized studies, the programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors nivolumaband pembrolizumab, both received US FDA accelerated approval for the third-line treatment of ES-SCLC.

### FDA approves durvalumab for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer… [^8e513283]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

On March 27, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved durvalumab in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin as first-line treatment of patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. Efficacy of this combination in patients with previously untreated ES-SCLC was investigated in CASPIAN, a randomized, multicenter, active-controlled, open-label, trial. The evaluation was based on the comparison of patients randomized to durvalumab plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy alone. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival. Additional efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and objective response rate, per RECIST v1.

1. Median OS was
13. 0 months in the durvalumab plus chemotherapy arm compared with 10. 3 months in the chemotherapy alone arm.

Investigator-assessed PFS showed a HR of 0. 78, with median PFS of
5. 1 months in the durvalumab plus chemotherapy arm and 5. 4 months in the chemotherapy alone arm. The investigator-assessed confirmed ORR was 68% in the durvalumab plus chemotherapy arm and 58% in the chemotherapy alone arm. The most common adverse reactions in patients with ES-SCLC were nausea, fatigue/asthenia, and alopecia. For ES-SCLC, durvalumab is to be administered prior to chemotherapy on the same day. The recommended durvalumab dose when administered with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin is 1500 mg every 3 weeks prior to chemotherapy and then every 4 weeks as a single agent.

### Durvalumab ± tremelimumab + platinum-etoposide in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): outcomes by PD-L1 expression and tissue tumor mutational burden [^fa10aac8]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations of this analysis primarily relate to its exploratory nature; CASPIAN was not designed to evaluate outcomes based on PD-L1 expression or tTMB, and although provision of archival tissue (if such samples were available) was mandatory, only half of patients were evaluable for PD-L1 and one-third for tTMB. This led to relatively small sample sizes in some of the biomarker-defined subgroups as indicated by the wide CIs. Furthermore, there was an imbalance in sample availability, with a smaller proportion of patients being evaluable for PD-L1 and tTMB in the EP arm compared with the durvalumab plus EP and durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP arms. Although the CASPIAN study was open label, the pretreatment withdrawal rate was low. Thus, there appears to be no obvious reason that fewer patients should have known biomarker status in the EP arm, and we assume the data were missing at random. In addition, the PD-L1 BEP appeared to have better treatment outcomes compared with the ITT population, which could have confounded the analysis. However, both treatment comparisons displayed this difference in efficacy, suggesting that it was unlikely to explain the differential effect observed for durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP based on PD-L1 expression. It should also be noted that that no samples were collected in CASPIAN for analysis of bTMB, so no comparison with tTMB data in the same patients could be performed. It is possible that assessment of bTMB in ES-SCLC could provide a more accurate representation of the overall disease than tTMB, because it captures total tumor TMB, including both primary and metastatic sites.

In conclusion, these results support treatment benefit with first-line durvalumab plus EP in patients with ES-SCLC irrespective of biomarker status; there was no evidence that either PD-L1 expression or tTMB can be used to select patients or predict outcomes with durvalumab plus EP in this disease setting. However, our observations in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP arm suggest that PD-L1 expression may yet prove to be a useful biomarker for combined treatment with PD-(L)1 and CTLA-4 inhibition, although this requires confirmation with a prospective and independent dataset.

### Consolidative thoracic radiation therapy after first-line chemotherapy and immunotherapy in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a multi-institutional case series [^2c8604d0]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nearly two-thirds of patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) present with extensive stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Survival for these patients is poor, and despite advances in both systemic therapy and radiation therapy, overall survival (OS) has improved incrementally to approximately 12 months with the use of first-line chemoimmunotherapy.

For patients with ES-SCLC, systemic therapy with a platinum-based chemotherapy and etoposide is the cornerstone of treatment. Consolidative thoracic radiation therapy (cTRT) has been shown to improve OS in selected patients who respond to initial chemotherapy. Consolidative radiation therapy to distant sites has also been shown to delay progression but was not found to improve OS. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was initially shown to improve OS; however, a contradictory trial has emerged in the setting of routine magnetic resonance imaging staging and surveillance imaging. More recently, the phase III IMpower133 trial found that the addition of atezolizumab to first-line chemotherapy improved OS for patients with ES-SCLC. Similarly, the phase III CASPIAN trial showed that the addition of durvalumab to first-line chemotherapy improved OS for patients with ES-SCLC.

Notably, cTRT was not permitted in either the IMpower133 or CASPIAN studies. Given that cTRT is well-tolerated and has previously demonstrated a survival advantage after chemotherapy, it may be reasonable to consider whether adding this to chemoimmunotherapy may lead to an even more substantial benefit. To our knowledge, no data exist regarding the safety and effectiveness of cTRT in patients with ES-SCLC treated with platinum-based chemotherapy and atezolizumab. We performed a multi-institutional retrospective analysis to characterize the outcomes and toxicities after first-line atezolizumab with chemotherapy followed by cTRT for patients with ES-SCLC.

### Phase II study of durvalumab plus olaparib as maintenance therapy in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (TRIDENT): preliminary efficacy and safety results… [^856c1906]. ASCO (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract 8518 Background: First-line durvalumab in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer demonstrated significant improvement of OS in phase Ⅲ CASPIAN trial. PARP inhibitors have the potential to confer antitumor activity, modify tumor immunogenicity, and sensitize tumors to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Durvalumab in combination with Olaparib had clinical activity in relapsed SCLC in a phase Ⅰ/Ⅱ study. This phase Ⅱ study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of durvalumab plus olaparib as maintenance therapy in patients with ES-SCLC. Methods: TRIDENT is a single arm, multicenter, phase Ⅱ study. Treatment-naive ES-SCLC aged ≥ 18 with ECOG PS 0–2 were eligible. Durvalumab was concurrently administered with platinum–etoposide every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by durvalumab 1500 mg every 4 weeks plus olaparib 300 mg twice daily until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The primary endpoint was the rate of progression free survival at 12 months, the secondary endpoints included progression free survival, objective response rate according to RECIST 1. 1, duration of response, overall survival and safety profile. All patients should provide tumor sample for biomarker analysis. ORR was 75%, the median DoR was 5. 0 months. With a median follow-up of 10. 5 months, the median PFS was
5. 8 months as calculated from the first cycle of durvalumab plus chemotherapy. The median OS was not reached. Of all, treatment emergent adverse event occurred in 93. 3% patients, and AEs ≥ grade 3 occurred in
36. 7% patients. There were no unexpected adverse events identified in this study. There were 5 patients discontinued treatment and 1 death due to AE. Biomarker analysis is still on-going and will be presented in the meeting.

### Recent treatment patterns and real-world survival following first-line anti-PD-L1 treatment for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer [^0aff04ad]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and leading cause of cancer death worldwide, representing 11% of cancers diagnosed and 18% of cancer deaths. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a high-grade neuroendocrine tumor that accounts for 10%-15% of all lung cancers.SCLC is traditionally staged based on the size and spread of the tumor as limited-stage (LS) disease or extensive-stage (ES) disease. Prognosis is poor, with a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of < 10% including LS-SCLC and ES-SCLC.

For many years, first-line (1L) standard-of-care for patients with ES-SCLC consisted of etoposide plus platinum (EP)-based chemotherapy. Within the last 5 years, the addition of anti-programmed death ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) immunotherapy to chemotherapy in the 1L setting was approved for patients diagnosed with ES-SCLC. Based on results from the CASPIANand IMpower133 trials,1L treatment of SCLC with anti-PD-L1 atezolizumab or durvalumab combined with chemotherapy followed by maintenance therapy with checkpoint inhibitor alone, led to durable but modest survival gains for a subset of patients with ES-SCLC. In the CASPIAN trial, median OS was 12.9 months (95% CI, 11.3–14.7) for durvalumab plus EP with either cisplatin or carboplatin versus 10.5 months (95% CI, 9.3–11.2) for EP alone, with 36-month OS rates of 17.6% (95% CI, 13.3–22.4) versus 5.8% (95% CI, 3.4–9.1), respectively. In IMpower 133, median OS was 12.3 months (95% CI, 10.8–15.8) for atezolizumab plus EP versus 10.3 months (95% CI, 9.3–11.3) for placebo plus EP, with 18-month OS rates of 34.0% versus 21.0%, respectively.

### First-line atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer [^0fd282ee]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Enhancing tumor-specific T-cell immunity by inhibiting programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-programmed death 1 (PD-1) signaling has shown promise in the treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer. Combining checkpoint inhibition with cytotoxic chemotherapy may have a synergistic effect and improve efficacy.

Methods

We conducted this double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial to evaluate atezolizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer who had not previously received treatment. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive carboplatin and etoposide with either atezolizumab or placebo for four 21-day cycles (induction phase), followed by a maintenance phase during which they received either atezolizumab or placebo (according to the previous random assignment) until they had unacceptable toxic effects, disease progression according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or no additional clinical benefit. The two primary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population.

Results

A total of 201 patients were randomly assigned to the atezolizumab group, and 202 patients to the placebo group. At a median follow-up of 13.9 months, the median overall survival was 12.3 months in the atezolizumab group and 10.3 months in the placebo group (hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 0.91; P = 0.007). The median progression-free survival was 5.2 months and 4.3 months, respectively (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.96; P = 0.02). The safety profile of atezolizumab plus carboplatin and etoposide was consistent with the previously reported safety profile of the individual agents, with no new findings observed.

Conclusions

The addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer resulted in significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than chemotherapy alone.

### Efficacy, safety, and exploratory biomarker analysis of envafolimab plus carboplatin and etoposide as first-line treatment for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer: a prospective, single-arm, phase II trial [^30df4cac]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our results were consistent with recent clinical trials on first-line immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy for patients with ES-SCLC (Additional File 1: Table S1). IMpower133 evaluated the efficacy and safety of the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab plus carboplatin-etoposide as first-line treatment for patients with ES-SCLC. The results from IMpower133 revealed that the median PFS and OS of atezolizumab plus chemotherapy were 5.2 and 12.3 months, respectively, which were significantly longer than those of chemotherapy alone. In the CASPIAN trial, durvalumab combined with platinum-etoposide showed significantly longer OS (HR = 0.73, 95% CI, 0.59–0.91, P = 0.005) than those treated with platinum-etoposide alone. The CAPSTONE-1 study demonstrated that adding adebrelimab to chemotherapy showed a significantly improved survival, and the median PFS and OS were 5.8 and 15.3 months, respectively. As evidenced by the ASTRUM-005 trial, serplulimab significantly prolonged PFS (5.7 vs. 4.3 months) and OS (15.4 vs. 10.9 months) in patients with ES-SCLC. Compared with these clinical trials, the proportion of patients aged 65 years or older and non-smoker was higher in this study, whereas the proportion of brain and Liver metastases was lower. In particular, the median age at baseline in this trial was 67.0 years, and 65.6% of patients were 65 years or older, which were both higher than reported by other trials. In the current trial, the median PFS was 6.43 months (95% CI, 4.83–7.67 months), and mOS was 20 months (95% CI, 14.7–NA), which was comparable or even better than Published results from other combination therapies. Moreover, envafolimab plus carboplatin-etoposide showed favorable clinical benefit, with an ORR of 87.1% and DCR of 100%. Overall, envafolimab combined with carboplatin-etoposide as first-line treatment conferred a survival benefit for patients with ES-SCLC, which may provide a new treatment option for both patients and physicians.

### Dashing decades of defeat: long anticipated advances in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer [^8f72bd39]. Current Oncology Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an exceptionally lethal subtype of lung cancer. For patients with extensive-stage (ES) disease, which is the majority of patients, platinum-doublet chemotherapy has been the standard of care for decades. Dozens of phase III trials have failed to improve survival over standard platinum plus etoposide. Recent results, however, have met with long-overdue success. This manuscript reviews the new standards of care for ES-SCLC.

Recent Findings

Two recent phase III trials have shown an improvement in overall survival with concurrent immunotherapy and chemotherapy. In IMpower 133, the addition of the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab to carboplatin plus etoposide significantly improved both progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). This was the first trial in over 30 years to improve survival. In CASPIAN, concurrent durvalumab, another anti-PD-L1 antibody, also led to an improvement in survival. While there is clearly a need to further improve outcomes, the improvement in survival with the addition of atezolizumab or durvalumab to platinum-doublet chemotherapy is a major advance. We now have new standards of care and the potential of a more meaningful benefit for patients with advanced SCLC.

### Durvalumab ± tremelimumab + platinum-etoposide in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): outcomes by PD-L1 expression and tissue tumor mutational burden [^6f0fc7ca]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Relationship between PD-L1 expression and efficacy outcomes

For durvalumab plus EP versus EP, the OS benefit was broadly similar regardless of PD-L1 expression on either TCs or ICs, with HRs of 0.75, 0.59, and 0.61, respectively, for the PD-L1 ≥ 1% subgroups based on TC, IC, and TC or IC expression, and 0.62, 0.64, and 0.63, respectively, for the PD-L1 < 1% subgroups based on TC, IC, or TC and IC expression (Fig. 1A). For durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP versus EP, OS HRs appeared improved in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% subgroups based on TC, IC, and TC or IC expression (HRs 0.42, 0.53, and 0.50, respectively) compared with the PD-L1 < 1% subgroups (HRs 0.76, 0.88, and 0.91, respectively), suggesting that PD-L1 expression based on a 1% cutoff may predict OS benefit (Fig. 1B). In particular, the treatment effect on OS was more favorable in the subgroup of patients with TC or IC ≥ 1% (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31–0.83) than in the subgroup with TC and IC < 1% (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.68–1.23; Fig. 2A and B).

For the CASPIAN tTMB BEP, baseline characteristics as well as efficacy and safety outcomes were generally consistent with the ITT population, suggesting that these patients are likely to be a representative sample. tTMB did not seem to predict OS with either immunotherapy regimen, when assessed either based on binary cutoffs or as a continuous variable. Overall, the value of TMB as a predictive biomarker of outcomes in SCLC is currently unclear, with inconsistent results across different studies. In the phase III IMpower133 study, treatment benefit with first-line atezolizumab plus chemotherapy in ES-SCLC was not associated with TMB measured in blood (bTMB) using a cutoff of either 10 or 16 mut/Mb. Consistent with both CASPIAN and IMpower133, results from the phase III KEYNOTE-604 study showed that tTMB was not positively associated with OS or PFS in patients treated with first-line pembrolizumab plus EP. However, analyses of the phase I/II CheckMate 032 study, in patients with SCLC previously treated with chemotherapy, have suggested an association of higher tTMB levels with improved outcomes to treatment with nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab plus ipilimumab, and a small retrospective analysis has also suggested the possible value of tTMB as a biomarker in SCLC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Indications that TMB is predictive of response to immunotherapy, but not of response to the combination of immunotherapy with chemotherapy, have also been observed in NSCLC: tTMB was associated with OS, PFS, and ORR with first-line pembrolizumab monotherapy in the KEYNOTE-010 and KEYNOTE-042 studies, while tTMB was not significantly associated with efficacy of first-line pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy in the KEYNOTE-021, 189, and 407 studies. Ultimately, comparison of findings across studies is complicated by significant variability in TMB measurement techniques, and there is a need for standardization of TMB assessment methodology across different assays, platforms, and centers to improve insights from future research.

### Durvalumab ± tremelimumab + platinum-etoposide in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): outcomes by PD-L1 expression and tissue tumor mutational burden [^9da23fbe]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

To further investigate the apparent association of PD-L1 expression with OS benefit for durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP versus EP, we examined baseline disease characteristics in the PD-L1 subgroups (Table 1). This revealed some imbalances between the treatment arms in key factors. In the TC or IC ≥ 1% subgroup, 24.1% of patients in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP arm had a WHO performance status score of 0 versus 37.5% of patients in the EP arm; 29.6% versus 37.5% of patients, respectively, had baseline liver metastases; and 18.5% versus 12.5%, respectively, had baseline brain metastases. A post hoc exploratory analysis adjusted to account for the imbalances in these characteristics within this subgroup produced an HR of 0.53 (95% CI, 0.31–0.90) for OS benefit with durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP versus EP, which was similar to the OS benefit observed in the unadjusted analysis (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31–0.83). Calculation of HRs between the PD-L1 subgroups within each treatment arm indicated longer OS in the TC or IC ≥ 1% subgroup compared with the TC and IC < 1% subgroup in the durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP arm (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33–0.75); the difference between PD-L1 subgroups was less pronounced in the durvalumab plus EP arm (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.56–1.30) and the EP arm (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.50–1.18; Fig. 3A, B, and C).

### State of affairs regarding targeted pharmacological therapy of cancers metastasized to the brain [^4882e16e]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

The CASPIAN trial confirmed significantly longer overall survival following first-line treatment with the PD-L1 antagonist durvalumab in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with extensive stage SCLC. Median OS was 13.0 months in the durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide group versus 10.3 months in the platinum-etoposide group.

Owonikoko et al. reported on the effect of the Aurora A kinase inhibitor, alisertib, plus paclitaxel as second-line treatment for SCLC. The median PFS was 3.32 months with alisertib plus paclitaxel versus 2.17 months with placebo plus paclitaxel. Overall survival was 6.1 months versus 5.4 months.

Spigel et al. presented recently the results of Checkmate 331 comparing nivolumab monotherapy with chemotherapy for relapsed SCLC. No significant improvement in OS was seen with nivolumab versus chemotherapy (median OS 7.5 versus 8.4 months). Median progression-free survival was 1.4 versus 3.8 months. Objective response rate was 13.7% versus 16.5% and median duration of response was 8.3 versus 4.5 months. Rates of grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events were 13.8% versus 73.2%.

In summary, perspective for disseminated SCLC remains poor, independent of any CNS involvement.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)

The abovementioned EGFR and ALK alterations have proved fruitful targets for specific therapy and the overall perspective of these subgroups has markedly improved over the past years. Ten years ago, targeted therapy focused on anti-VEGFR. Overall survival in patients with disseminated disease remained in the range of 6 to 9 months. The introduction of ALK-directed therapy yielded a clear benefit for the ALK + subgroup. In 2016, Solomon and coauthors reported on the intracranial efficacy of first-line crizotinib versus chemotherapy (PROFILE 1014 study). Patients with stable treated brain metastases were eligible. Twenty-three percent of patients had CNS involvement at baseline. Among these patients, intracranial disease control was significantly higher with crizotinib versus chemotherapy at 12 weeks (85% versus 45%) and at 24 weeks (56% versus 25%). Progression-free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib versus chemotherapy in both subgroups, with brain metastasis at baseline 9.0 versus 4.0 months, and without brain metastasis 11.1 versus 7.2 months.

### Safety and activity of tarlatamab in combination with a PD-L1 inhibitor as first-line maintenance therapy after chemo-immunotherapy in patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (deLLphi-303): a multicentre, non-randomised, phase 1b study [^29d192f4]. The Lancet: Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Background

Tarlatamab is a delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3)-directed bispecific T-cell engager immunotherapy that has improved survival in patients with previously treated small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). We evaluated the safety and activity of tarlatamab in combination with atezolizumab or durvalumab as first-line maintenance therapy in patients with extensive-stage (ES)-SCLC.

Methods

In this multicentre, non-randomised, phase 1b study, patients aged 18 years and older, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1 and without disease progression after four to six cycles of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy plus a programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor (if available), received tarlatamab 10 mg intravenously once every 2 weeks, after an initial tarlatamab 1 mg dose, with atezolizumab intravenously (1680 mg once every 4 weeks) or durvalumab intravenously (1500 mg once every 4 weeks) as maintenance until disease progression. Patients were enrolled from 30 centres in 13 countries. The primary objective was to evaluate safety and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose or maximum tolerated dose of tarlatamab in combination with a PD-L1 inhibitor through assessment of dose-limiting toxicities, treatment-emergent adverse events, treatment-related adverse events, and changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory tests. All patients who received at least one dose of tarlatamab were included in the analyses. Because overall survival data were immature at the primary analysis, in this Article, we report a non-specified interim analysis to provide an updated examination of overall survival and longer-term safety. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT05361395; the EU Clinical Trials registry, 2021-005462-17; and EudraCT, 2024-511021-58.

Findings

Between Aug 31, 2022, and Jan 30, 2024, 88 patients received tarlatamab with atezolizumab or durvalumab after standard-of-care first-line chemo-immunotherapy. The median time from start of standard-of-care first-line chemo-immunotherapy to start of tarlatamab maintenance was 3·6 months (IQR 3·2–4·3). The median follow-up from the start of maintenance was 18·4 months (15·2–23·0) and the median exposure to tarlatamab was 35 weeks (8–75). The most common grade 3–4 adverse events were hyponatraemia (nine [10%] of 88 patients), anaemia (seven [8%] of 88 patients), and neutropenia (six [7%] of 88 patients). Serious adverse events occurred in 50 (57%) of 88 patients. The most common serious adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (21 [24%] of 88 patients), pyrexia (six [7%] of 88 patients), immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (four [5%] of 88 patients), and pneumonia (four [5%] of 88 patients). There were no deaths due to treatment-related adverse events. Median overall survival was 25·3 months (95% CI 20·3-not estimable).

Interpretation

Tarlatamab plus a PD-L1 inhibitor as maintenance after first-line chemo-immunotherapy showed a manageable safety profile with promising anticancer activity, supporting the ongoing phase 3 trial (NCT06211036).

### Updated overall survival and PD-L1 subgroup analysis of patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer treated with atezolizumab, carboplatin, and etoposide (IMpower133) [^c98c9680]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

IMpower133 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02763579), a randomized, double-blind, phase I/III study, demonstrated that adding atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) to carboplatin plus etoposide (CP/ET) for first-line (1L) treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) resulted in significant improvement in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo plus CP/ET. Updated OS, disease progression patterns, safety, and exploratory biomarkers (PD-L1, blood-based tumor mutational burden [bTMB]) are reported.

Patients and Methods

Patients with untreated ES-SCLC were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive four 21-day cycles of CP (area under the curve 5 mg per mL/min intravenously [IV], day 1) plus ET (100 mg/m² IV, days 1–3) with atezolizumab (1,200 mg IV, day 1) or placebo, and then maintenance atezolizumab or placebo until unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or loss of clinical benefit. Tumor specimens were collected; PD-L1 testing was not required for enrollment. The two primary end points, investigator-assessed PFS and OS, were statistically significant at the interim analysis. Updated OS and PFS and exploratory biomarker analyses were conducted.

Results

Patients received atezolizumab plus CP/ET (n = 201) or placebo plus CP/ET (n = 202). At the updated analysis, median follow-up for OS was 22.9 months; 302 deaths had occurred. Median OS was 12.3 and 10.3 months with atezolizumab plus CP/ET and placebo plus CP/ET, respectively (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.95; descriptive P = 0.0154). At 18 months, 34.0% and 21.0% of patients were alive in atezolizumab plus CP/ET and placebo plus CP/ET arms, respectively. Patients derived benefit from the addition of atezolizumab, regardless of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry or bTMB status.

Conclusion

Adding atezolizumab to CP/ET as 1L treatment for ES-SCLC continued to demonstrate improved OS and a tolerable safety profile at the updated analysis, confirming the regimen as a new standard of care. Exploratory analyses demonstrated treatment benefit independent of biomarker status.

Small Cell Lung Cancer

In extensive‐stage small cell lung cancer (esSCLC) with disease progression on or after platinum‐based chemotherapy and at least one other line of therapy, both pembrolizumab and nivolumab were granted accelerated approval as monotherapy based on ORR. Both indications have subsequently been withdrawn in consultation with FDA in late 2020 or early 2021. Atezolizumab was the first approval of a PD‐[L]1 inhibitor in the frontline setting. At the time of its approval, the standard of care for frontline therapy of esSCLC had not changed since the 1980s. The approval of atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin and etoposide was based on IMpower133, which showed, at the planned interim analysis, a 2‐month median OS benefit (12.3 vs. 10.3 months) with HR of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.54–0.91) and 1‐month median PFS benefit (5.2 vs. 4.3 months) with HR of 0.77 (95% CI, 0.62–0.96). Durvalumab in combination with carboplatin or cisplatin and etoposide was also approved in the frontline; the CASPIAN trial showed a survival benefit in durvalumab with chemotherapy over chemotherapy alone: with OS median 13.0 versus 10.3 months and HR of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.59–0.91).

INTRODUCTION

Current first-line treatment options for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) are atezolizumab in combination with carboplatin and etoposide (CE), on the basis of significant overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) improvements versus CE in the phase III IMpower133 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:), or durvalumab plus chemotherapy, on the basis of results of the phase III CASPIAN study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:). Significant OS improvement was also reported with serplulimab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in the phase III ASTRUM-005 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:). Although these regimens have improved outcomes in ES-SCLC, most patients experience disease progression (PD), and median survival remains at approximately 12 months. Therefore, there is a significant unmet need for new therapeutic options to improve long-term outcomes in ES-SCLC.

Endpoints and assessments

The two primary endpoints were OS for durvalumab plus EP versus EP and for durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP versus EP. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR; including unconfirmed responses) based on investigator assessment according to RECIST v1.1, as well as safety and tolerability graded per NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03. Confirmed ORR was analyzed post hoc. Assessment of efficacy based on biomarkers, including PD-L1 expression on TCs and ICs, and tTMB, was an exploratory endpoint. Provision of an archival (< 3 years old) tumor tissue block (or ≥ 15 newly cut unstained slides) was mandatory for inclusion in the study, if such samples were available. Because there were no established prognostic or predictive biomarkers in SCLC at the time of designing the study, neither measurement of PD-L1 expression nor TMB was required during patient screening.

PD-L1 testing

PD-L1 expression on TCs and ICs was assessed using the VENTANA SP263 IHC assay (Ventana Medical Systems; ref.).

The percentage of tumor-associated ICs with PD-L1 staining intensity above background determined the PD-L1 IC expression status (IC ≥ 1%), and the percentage of TCs with any membrane staining above background determined the PD-L1 TC expression status (TC ≥ 1%). Cutoffs for PD-L1 expression at ≥ 1% of ICs, ≥ 1% of TCs, and ≥ 1% of ICs or TCs were explored. Testing was done in a central laboratory by pathologists trained and qualified by Ventana to score the samples at specific cutoffs.

### Adebrelimab plus chemotherapy and sequential thoracic radiotherapy as first-line therapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC): a phase II trial [^3edb94ed]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective, phase 2 study to evaluate the combination of adebrelimab plus chemotherapy and sequential TRT in patients with ES-SCLC. The results indicated that adebrelimab plus chemotherapy and sequential TRT could improve the survival benefits of patients with ES-SCLC. The median OS was 21.4 months. 1-year and 2-year OS rate were 74.1% and 39.7%. The median PFS was 10.1 months. The safety profile was manageable and no new safety signals were observed compared to previous reports.

The current standard first-line treatment for ES-SCLC is immunotherapy in combination with platinum-etoposide. In the IMpower133 trial, the addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy resulted in significantly longer OS (12.3 vs. 10.3 months, HR 0.70, P = 0.007) and PFS (5.2 vs. 4.3 months, HR 0.77, P = 0.02) than control group. In the CASPIAN trial, the addition of durvalumab to chemotherapy resulted in significantly longer OS (13.0 vs. 10.3 months, HR 0.73, P = 0.0047) and PFS (5.1 vs. 5.4 months, HR 0.78) than chemotherapy alone. As both IMpower 133 and CASPIAN trials did not allow TRT, the combination of TRT and immunotherapy has not been well defined in ES-SCLC first-line treatment.

### Comparison of first-line treatments for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^299145d3]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Discussion

This network meta-analysis study included 14 head-to-head phase 2 and 3 randomized clinical trials, with 4838 patients, and compared the benefits and safety profiles of various first-line treatment regimens for patients with ES-SCLC. The results showed that a combination of etoposide-based chemotherapy with other treatments was associated with better antitumor benefits. Among them, the addition of ipilimumab was associated with the best ORR, the addition of PD-L1 inhibitors was associated with the best OS and DCR, and the addition of bevacizumab was associated with the best PFS. Toxicity analyses suggested that combination treatments might cause more TRAEs. Among them, bevacizumab plus etoposide-platinum chemotherapy was associated with the highest toxic effect rate.

The addition of PD-L1 inhibitors (ie, atezolizumab or durvalumab) to the standard etoposide-platinum chemotherapy was associated with the best DCR and OS. This phenomenon could be explained by the fact that patients with SCLC often experience a high variation rate and several autoimmune paraneoplastic syndromes, indicating that they might respond to ICI drugs. Previous trials, have shown that ICI monotherapy has promising antitumor activity with durable response. Furthermore, the improvement of response and prolonged survival in combination regimens may indicate the potential immunogenic ability of chemotherapy to increase the number of cytotoxic lymphocytes and block signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) pathway to enhance antigen cross-presentation. Additional immunotherapy might improve the patient response to standard chemotherapy by developing the antitumor effect of intratumoral T-cells. These findings suggest that the addition of PD-L1 inhibitors to etoposide-platinum chemotherapy might provide better clinical benefits to patients with ES-SCLC compared with other treatment options. Our study also found that the addition of ipilimumab to etoposide-based chemotherapy provided was associated with the best benefit in ORR but not in survival outcomes. A possible explanation might be that unlike PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab or durvalumab), ipilimumab could stimulate peripheral T-cells but not those in the tumor microenvironment, showing less antitumor effect in ES-SCLC. Although the addition of bevacizumab to etoposide-based chemotherapy was associated with the best PFS benefit, this treatment modality showed no benefit in other outcome indices, including ORR, DCR, and OS. Moreover, other antiangiogenic small molecules, including cediranib (AZD-2171), vandetanib (ZD-6474), and thalidomide, also showed no additional benefits to patients with ES-SCLC.

tTMB score distribution

The overall distribution of tTMB scores was broadly similar across treatment arms within the tTMB BEP (Supplementary Fig. S9). On the basis of the observed tTMB scores, cut-off points ranging from 6 to 14 mut/Mb were chosen for exploratory analysis; for each selected cut-off point, one or more of the treatment arms had at least 25% of the tTMB BEP in the smallest category of the cutoff.

Relationship between tTMB and efficacy outcomes

Exploratory analysis of OS at tTMB cutoffs ranging from 6 to 14 mut/Mb showed that HRs for durvalumab plus EP versus EP, and for durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP versus EP, all fell within the CI associated with the HR in the tTMB BEP and favored the immunotherapy regimen across the tTMB subgroups, suggesting that tTMB did not predict treatment benefit (Fig. 4A and B). When considering tTMB score on a continuous scale, there was no evidence of an interaction between treatment effect and tTMB for OS (durvalumab plus EP vs. EP, P = 0.916; durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP vs. EP, P = 0.672). Kaplan–Meier curves for OS in subgroups using a tTMB cutoff of 10 mut/Mb (selected on the basis of previously published data with other immunotherapies; see Materials and Methods) are shown in Supplementary Fig. S10. For durvalumab plus EP versus EP, the HR for OS was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.50–1.20) in the tTMB < 10 mut/Mb subgroup and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.42–1.14) in the tTMB ≥ 10 mut/Mb subgroup. For durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP versus EP, the HR for OS was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.54–1.29) in the tTMB < 10 mut/Mb subgroup and 0.77 (95% CI, 0.46–1.30) in the tTMB ≥ 10 mut/Mb subgroup.

### Comparison of first-line treatments for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^b4452846]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Overall, this multiple comparison study found that bevacizumab plus etoposide-based chemotherapy was associated with the worst safety profiles and the highest incidences of nausea, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia. The overall safety profiles in PD-L1 inhibitor plus etoposide-based chemotherapy were similar to standard chemotherapy, with similar frequencies of TRAEs of grade 3 or higher but lower frequencies of other major adverse events such as leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and nausea. The better safety profiles may be associated with more cycles of etoposide-platinum treatment for patients in the standard chemotherapy group. In addition, the rate and grade of immune-mediated adverse events were also low, similar to the known toxic effects of ICI drugs.

Unlike previous meta-analyses investigating treatments of patients with ES-SCLC, our network meta-analysis compared more extensive therapy regimens, including durvalumab, atezolizumab, ipilimumab, and bevacizumab, in first-line treatment for this population. Therefore, our study may help clinicians make better decisions from multiple promising treatment regimens for patients with ES-SCLC by taking full consideration of their clinical benefits and toxicity profiles. ICI drugs with etoposide-based chemotherapy were advantageous as the first-line treatment for patients with ES-SCLC. The PD-L1 inhibitor combination appeared to be the best among these treatment regimens. More trials comparing the clinical benefits and safety of combined treatment regimens with these ICI drugs should be conducted.

Background

The addition of a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, either atezolizumab or durvalumab, to platinum-etoposide prolonged survival in a limited subset of patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Preclinical studies demonstrated synergistic antitumor activity of combined vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and PD-L1 inhibition in SCLC. Since bevacizumab added to platinum-etoposide was safe and active in ES-SCLC, we investigated the efficacy of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, carboplatin, and etoposide as first-line treatment of ES-SCLC.

Methods

The CeLEBrATE study is an Italian multicentric single-arm phase II trial of carboplatin (area under the curve 5 ml/min), etoposide (100mg/sqm), bevacizumab (7.5mg/kg), and atezolizumab (1,200mg) every 3 weeks (q3w) for four to six courses, followed by bevacizumab and atezolizumab maintenance q3w in patients with ES-SCLC and no contraindications to immunotherapy or antiangiogenic therapy. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases were eligible. Prophylactic cranial irradiation and consolidation thoracic external radiotherapy were not permitted while on study treatment. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) rate at 1 year.

Results

53 patients were enrolled (45.3%women, median age 65 years) and received at least one dose of study treatment. At a median follow-up time of 23.4 months (95% CI: 21.1 to 26.0), the 1-year OS rate was 61.8% (90% CI: 50.7% to 72.8%; p = 0.04), with a median OS of 12.9 months (95% CI: 11.6 to 17.5). Median progression-free survival was 6.2 months (95% CI: 5.4 to 6.6) and objective response rate was 83.3% (95% CI: 69.8% to 92.5%). Grade 3–4 adverse events were reported in 34 patients (64.2%) leading to dose reductions in 24 (45.3%), and dose delays in 39 (73.9%) and 32 (69.6%) during the induction and maintenance phase, respectively. 19 (35.8%) treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

The CeLEBrATE study met its primary objective demonstrating a signal of efficacy of bevacizumab, atezolizumab, carboplatin, and etoposide in the first-line treatment of patients with ES-SCLC.

Abstract

Background

The addition of a programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor, either atezolizumab or durvalumab, to platinum-etoposide prolonged survival in a limited subset of patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). Preclinical studies demonstrated synergistic antitumor activity of combined vascular endothelial growth factor receptor and PD-L1 inhibition in SCLC. Since bevacizumab added to platinum-etoposide was safe and active in ES-SCLC, we investigated the efficacy of atezolizumab, bevacizumab, carboplatin, and etoposide as first-line treatment of ES-SCLC.

Methods

The CeLEBrATE study is an Italian multicentric single-arm phase II trial of carboplatin (area under the curve 5 ml/min), etoposide (100 mg/sqm), bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg), and atezolizumab (1,200 mg) every 3 weeks (q3w) for four to six courses, followed by bevacizumab and atezolizumab maintenance q3w in patients with ES-SCLC and no contraindications to immunotherapy or antiangiogenic therapy. Patients with asymptomatic brain metastases were eligible. Prophylactic cranial irradiation and consolidation thoracic external radiotherapy were not permitted while on study treatment. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS) rate at 1 year.

Results

53 patients were enrolled (45.3% women, median age 65 years) and received at least one dose of study treatment. At a median follow-up time of 23.4 months (95% CI: 21.1 to 26.0), the 1-year OS rate was 61.8% (90% CI: 50.7% to 72.8%; p = 0.04), with a median OS of 12.9 months (95% CI: 11.6 to 17.5). Median progression-free survival was 6.2 months (95% CI: 5.4 to 6.6) and objective response rate was 83.3% (95% CI: 69.8% to 92.5%). Grade 3–4 adverse events were reported in 34 patients (64.2%) leading to dose reductions in 24 (45.3%), and dose delays in 39 (73.9%) and 32 (69.6%) during the induction and maintenance phase, respectively. 19 (35.8%) treatment-related serious adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

The CeLEBrATE study met its primary objective demonstrating a signal of efficacy of bevacizumab, atezolizumab, carboplatin, and etoposide in the first-line treatment of patients with ES-SCLC.

The existing randomized clinical trials only provided a model to directly compare the outcomes and safety of etoposide-platinum chemotherapy with etoposide-platinum chemotherapy plus immunotherapies and monoclonal antibodies. Furthermore, previous meta-analyses have only partly compared different chemotherapy regimens for patients with ES-SCLC without including the recent randomized clinical trials that use the recommended addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the outcomes and safety profiles of chemotherapy-only regimens as well as chemotherapy plus either PD-L1 antibody, CTLA-4 antibody, or VEGF antibody as the first-line treatmentfor patients with ES-SCLC; to directly and indirectly compare the advantages of these treatments using network meta-analyses of randomized clinical trials; to identify the optimal treatment regimen in clinical practice; and to provide comprehensive evidence to help clinicians and patients select treatment.

Introduction

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma with a dismal prognosis. Two thirds of SCLC patients present with extensive-disease SCLC (ED-SCLC) at the time of diagnosis, and the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate is only 3%–5%. First-line treatment for ED-SCLC with cisplatin/carboplatin plus etoposide could achieve an objective response rate (ORR) of 40%–70% and an OS of ten months, but relapse is inevitable. The addition of anti–programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab (Impower 133) or durvalumab to chemotherapy (CASPIAN) as first-line treatment increases the 2-year OS rate from 11% to 22%, but again, the vast majority of patients relapse rapidly, and treatment options for relapsed patients are limited. Besides, due to economic and other factors, a considerable number of patients cannot receive first-line anti–PD-L1 antibody, and the addition of immunotherapy is alternative for relapsed patients.

The only approved second-line therapy for ED-SCLC until very recently was topotecan, with an ORR of 22%–24% and a progression-free survival (PFS) of 2–3 months. Amrubicin is an approved second-line chemotherapy option in some parts of the World for patients with ED-SCLC. It achieved numerically higher ORR but similar PFS and OS compared with topotecan. Lurbinectedin was approved in February, 2020 for use in SCLC patients who have progressed after previous platinum-based therapy, but the subsequent phase III trial compared lurbinectedin/doxorubicin vs topotecan or cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine failed to prolong OS for ED-SCLC in second-line setting (ATLANTIS). Nivolumab plus ipilimumab or pembrolizumab (KEYNOTE 158 and 028) were approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2018 and 2019, respectively, but were withdrawn later based on the negative results of subsequent phase III trials. Other immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including nivolumab (CheckMate 331) and atezolizumab (IFCT-1603), failed to show survival benefit as second-line monotherapy for ED-SCLC.

### Systemic therapy for small-cell lung cancer: ASCO-Ontario health (cancer care Ontario) guideline [^76472506]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

Extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES–SCLC) — additional immunotherapy trials and evidence synthesis support benefit and guide first-line therapy. In ASTRUM-005, all efficacy endpoints favored serplulimab: RR (80.2% v 70.4%), PFS (median, 5.7 v 4.3 months; HR, 0.48, 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.59), and OS (median, 15.4 v 10.9 months; 1-year, 61% v 49%; P < .001). In KEYNOTE-604, pembrolizumab improved PFS (1-year, 13.6% v 3.1%, HR, 0.75; P = 0.002) but the OS difference was not statistically significant (2-year, 22.5% v 11.2%, HR, 0.80; P = 0.16). EA5161 enrolled 160 untreated patients and found both PFS and OS were slightly better with nivolumab. Several meta-analyses confirmed benefit of chemoimmunotherapy over chemotherapy alone, including a meta-analysis totaling 1,553 patients that showed improvement in both PFS and OS with no significant difference between anti–PD-L1 and anti–PD-1 agents; based on the available evidence, the panel suggests that patients with ES–SCLC should be treated with first-line platinum and etoposide plus either durvalumab or atezolizumab for four cycles followed by maintenance immunotherapy.

### Durvalumab ± tremelimumab + platinum-etoposide in extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (CASPIAN): outcomes by PD-L1 expression and tissue tumor mutational burden [^8a766222]. Clinical Cancer Research (2024). Medium credibility.

The impact of tTMB on PFS and ORR in CASPIAN was less clear-cut: for durvalumab plus tremelimumab plus EP versus EP, the HRs for PFS and ORs for ORR appeared more favorable in the lower tTMB subgroups, with a significant interaction observed for PFS with tTMB as a continuous variable. However, it should be noted that these results were associated with wide CIs, and PFS and ORR were secondary endpoints in CASPIAN. Because the trend was weak and inconsistent with the OS findings, and is also contrary to current knowledge indicating that tTMB ≥ 10 mut/Mb predicts better outcomes with immunotherapy in NSCLC, we believe this could be a chance finding. Similar results were reported in KEYNOTE-604, with lower TMB predicting higher PFS and OS benefit with pembrolizumab plus EP versus placebo plus EP. However, this finding is likely to have been impacted by the statistically significant positive association of TMB with OS in the placebo plus EP arm and given the exploratory nature of the analyses, should be interpreted with caution.

PD-L1 and TMB have been shown to identify different, but overlapping populations in SCLC and NSCLC, and to be independent biomarkers in an analysis of nearly 10,000 clinical samples across a broad range of cancer types. In CASPIAN, there was no clear association between tTMB score and PD-L1 expression on either TC or IC, and it is conceivable that a combination of these two biomarkers may have greater predictive power for response to checkpoint inhibitors than either biomarker alone in SCLC. However, other biomarkers, such as SCLC molecular subtypes or HLA genotype, may have a more important role than PD-L1 or tTMB in this setting, given the differences in immune biology compared with NSCLC. Exploration of such emerging biomarkers using genomic and transcriptomic profiling in the CASPIAN dataset is ongoing. Liquid biopsies can provide a rapid, noninvasive alternative to tumor biopsies to assess the molecular profile of a disease and to monitor its on-treatment clonal evolution. Previous studies in various tumor types have demonstrated that reduction in ctDNA during immunotherapy treatment may be associated with patient outcomes, possibly indicating a decrease in disease burden in response to treatment, including in several studies in SCLC. In future, it is possible that ctDNA dynamics could be a useful tool to enable early clinical decision-making by identifying patients who are responding to or resistant to treatment for SCLC.

INTRODUCTION

Targeted therapies have redefined oncology management for many tumor types in recent years, but novel treatment options have remained elusive for patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC).SCLC is characterized by a rapid doubling time and early metastases, and most patients present with extensive-stage or metastatic disease at diagnosis. The aggressive nature of SCLC means that affected patients face a poorer prognosis than those with any other type of lung cancer. The five-year survival rate for SCLC is 7.2%, compared with 29.8%, 22.5%, and 18.6% for adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, respectively.

First-line therapy for patients with metastatic SCLC (with etoposide and cisplatin or carboplatin, alone or combined with atezolizumab or durvalumab)is associated with high response rates, but most patients relapse within 1–2 years, and subsequent treatment options are limited. Currently, only two drugs are approved for second-line SCLC treatment: the topoisomerase I inhibitor, topotecan, and the alkylating agent, lurbinectedin. - Topotecan is an established agent, but its modest antitumor activity is transient, and its use is limited by myelosuppression and hematological toxicities. Lurbinectedin was granted accelerated approval in 2020 for second-line use in adults with metastatic SCLCon the basis of a manageable safety profile and an overall response rate of 35.2% in a phase II trial. In the subsequent phase III ATLANTIS trial, lurbinectedin in combination with doxorubicin also showed activity in patients with relapsed SCLC, but the primary overall survival (OS) end point was not met versus physician's choice of topotecan or cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine (hazard ratio [HR], 0.97; P = 0.70). First-line immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy modestly improved OS in both the CASPIAN and IMpower133 studies, becoming a new standard of care. However, immunotherapy alone has shown limited efficacy in a small number of patients with SCLC in second-line treatment. Thus, there remains an unmet need for novel efficacious second-line treatment options for patients with SCLC.

### Integration of clinical and blood parameters in risk prognostication for patients receiving immunochemotherapy for extensive stage small cell lung cancer: real-world data from two centers [^771ab863]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in China and a common type of cancer diagnosis worldwide. Although small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for only 15% of lung cancer cases, it has a high degree of malignancy and is characterized by rapid growth, easy metastasis, and high mortality. Platinum in combination with etoposide has resulted in modest improvements in survival and has been the unshakable standard treatment over the 30 years in patients with extensive stage SCLC (ES-SCLC), with a 2-year survival rate of approximately 7%. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are rapidly progressing, and their synergy in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy has been validated in some phase III clinical trials. Based on IMpower133 and CASPIAN results, Atezolizumab or Durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy is approved for first-line treatment of ES-SCLC. However, different types of ICI drugs have vastly different outcomes in clinical trials, Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab have been briefly approved for SCLC patients who have relapsed or metastasized following chemotherapy and have withdrawn their indications following phase III trials. In fact, only minority ES-SCLC patients could benefit from immunotherapy in clinical trials.

Although immunotherapy made a huger progress than standard chemotherapy, some patients still cannot benefit from it or even develop treatment-related serious adverse reactions and even superprogress, affecting the survival outcome and quality of life. Therefore, reliable biomarkers are needed to stratify patient survival risk. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and tumor mutation burden (TMB) are universally acknowledged as predictive biomarkers for various types of tumors. SCLC has low PD-L1 expression but high TMB; nevertheless, no correlation between the two and treatment response has been found in clinical trials. Currently, a variety of biomarkers based on blood tests have been developed to assess the diagnosis, recurrence, and treatment effects of lung cancer, but studies of these markers have mostly focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and there is insufficient evidence in distinguishing the prognosis of patients treated with SCLC immunotherapy. In addition, the combined effect of multiple indicators on the prediction of disease is often better than a single indicator, and the prognostic model is a good choice. Current studies mostly focus on the collection of clinical data, while ignoring the value of blood parameters.

### Immune-checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer [^df116cac]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for approximately 15% of all lung cancers, characterized by a highly invasive and lethal disease. Huge efforts have been made to improve the survival of this population. However, they were almost annihilated and etoposide and platinum (EP) remains standard-of-care ﬁrst-line therapy for extensive-stage (ES) SCLC for the past 30 years.

SCLC has high tumor mutational burden (TMB), which is associated with more tumor neoantigens and improved efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Currently, PD-1 inhibitors, including nivolumab or pembrolizumab, have been approved by Food Drug and Administration (FDA) as a third-line or later-line therapy for patients with ES-SCLC. However, the objective response rates (ORRs) were only 10%–19.3% as monotherapy, which was lower than expected response rate and may be partially attributed to the low program death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on tumor cells in SCLC. Recent success of ICIs in combination with chemotherapy in both lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma propelled this therapeutic strategy into ES-SCLC. Theoretically, chemotherapy, including EP, could result in immunogenic tumor cell death, increase presentation of tumor-associated antigens, promote the maturation of dendritic cells and therefore activate the cytotoxic T-cell response. Encouragingly, recent two landmark trials, IMpower133 and CASPIAN, demonstrated a synergetic antitumor effect of ICIs and EP and found that the addition of PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab or durvalumab) to EP could significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared with EP alone for patients with ES-SCLC. Although the absolute improvements of progression-free survival (PFS) were moderate, a higher 12-month PFS rates were observed in patients treated with PD-L1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy (12.6% in IMpower133% and 18% in CASPIAN vs 5.4% and 5.0% in controls), reflecting that the PFS benefit was durable in a subset of patients.

### Systemic therapy for small cell lung cancer: ASCO guideline rapid recommendation update [^dc0246b6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for small cell lung cancer, more specifically with respect to elderly and frail patients, ASCO 2025 guidelines recommend to consider offering standard treatment with carboplatin and etoposide plus immunotherapy (atezolizumab or durvalumab) followed by maintenance immunotherapy in treatment-naïve older patients with extensive-stage SCLC and ECOG performance status 0–1.

### Nivolumab and ipilimumab as maintenance therapy in extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer: checkMate 451 [^d9da547f]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

The delay between patients' last dose of chemotherapy and random assignment might have also affected the results. To ensure that all patients who completed first-line chemotherapy did not progress at the end of treatment, a window of ≥ 3 weeks from the last chemotherapy dose to first dose of study drug was chosen; the median of this window was 5.6 weeks for the total study (5.4–5.7 across study arms). Given the high risk of tumor regrowth in SCLC, some patients might have experienced disease progression before initiating maintenance treatment. In line with this, OS appeared to be improved with nivolumab monotherapy versus placebo when maintenance treatment was initiated sooner after the last dose of first-line chemotherapy. Consistent with the results from this study, several other trials have shown no benefit of chemotherapy or targeted agents as maintenance therapy for ED-SCLC after first-line chemotherapy. - By contrast, studies have shown modest but significant efficacy of first-line platinum-doublet chemotherapy plus immunotherapy, followed by a median of three maintenance immunotherapy cycles, in ED-SCLC; in these studies, immunotherapy was delivered without delay following the last cycle of chemotherapy. Concurrent administration of chemotherapy and immunotherapy might have also contributed to these positive results, as previously reported. The CASPIAN study demonstrated a survival benefit for durvalumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for SCLC, but not for durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus chemotherapy. Rates of all-cause grade 3–4 AEs were 62% and 70% for durvalumab with chemotherapy and durvalumab plus tremelimumab with chemotherapy, respectively; rates of AEs leading to discontinuation were 10% and 21%, respectively. The increased rate of toxicity observed with the nivolumab plus ipilimumab combination in the current study and the durvalumab plus tremelimumab arm of the CASPIAN trial, along with lack of efficacy improvement, raises a legitimate question about the clinical relevance of this strategy of combined targeting of cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte-4/PD-1 in an unselected patient population.

### Multidisciplinary assessment of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer: a geriatric tumor board [^3311244b]. CA (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, there are no studies that specifically address the safety and efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy in older patients with ES‐SCLC. However, published trials evaluating CGA in older patients with other cancers have demonstrated that CGA‐based interventions, including modification of systemic therapy and referrals to physical therapy, nutritional counseling, and psychological evaluation, result in better treatment completion, compliance, and tolerance without compromising survival. The best evidence comes from the subset analyses of older patients enrolled in the CASPIAN (durvalumab plus platinum/etoposide) and IMpower133 (atezolizumb plus platinum/etoposide) trials (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT03043872 and NCT02763579, respectively).

In the CASPIAN trial, 113 of 537 patients with ES‐SCLC and an ECOG PS of 0–1 were defined as older; and, in the IMpower133 trial, 186 of 403 patients were aged 65 years and older. Neither study was powered to evaluate the effect of age on outcomes, but there appeared to be no difference in the benefit of chemoimmunotherapy in older versus younger patients. As real‐world evidence accumulates and new trials are developed for this population, more informative data should become available. Currently, there is sufficient evidence to support the use of combination chemoimmunotherapy in carefully selected patients aged 65 years and older with ES‐SCLC.

We assessed our patient with ES‐SCLC by using a comprehensive geriatric evaluation and deemed her fit for treatment. Based on this assessment, she received standard first‐line chemoimmunotherapy. We used the geriatric assessment to guide our decision between full‐dose treatment, dose adjustments, or supportive care — an especially important consideration because SCLC is aggressive, usually incurable, and typically requires intensive therapy.

Many patients diagnosed with SCLC are older and have comorbidities. Our goal in performing a geriatric assessment is to tailor treatment according to each patient's functional status, comorbid conditions, nutritional and cognitive evaluations, and their risk of experiencing grade 3 toxicity (Table 1). Table 1 summarizes our approach to managing older patients with SCLC based on CGA.

### Durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy in limited-stage small-cell lung cancer [^40df15e4]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2024). Excellent credibility.

The study ADRIATIC was published by Ying Cheng and colleagues in 2024 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Small cell lung cancer. In the ADRIATIC study, the trial question was: what is the role of adjuvant therapy with durvalumab in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer? In the ADRIATIC study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ADRIATIC study, the population was: 530 patients (164 female, 366 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer without disease progression after standard concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy. The key exclusion criteria were history of ≥ grade 2 pneumonitis from previous chemoradiotherapy; extensive-stage small cell lung cancer; uncontrolled intercurrent illness; active infection; active or prior documented autoimmune or inflammatory disorder; receipt of sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In the ADRIATIC study, the interventions were: n = 264 durvalumab (at a dose of 1,500 mg every 4 weeks for up to 24 months) n = 266 placebo (matching placebo every 4 weeks for up to 24 months). In the ADRIATIC study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in median overall survival (55.9 months vs. 33.4 months; HR 1.37, 97.5% CI 1.02 to 1.85). In the ADRIATIC study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in median progression-free survival (16.6 months vs. 9.2 months; HR 1.32, 97.5% CI 1.02 to 1.69). In the ADRIATIC study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse events of grade 3–4. In the ADRIATIC study, the conclusion was: in patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer without disease progression after standard concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy, durvalumab was superior to placebo with respect to median overall survival.

Rank Probability and Inconsistency Assessment

The ranking profiles of comparable treatments, shown in Figure 2, indicated the probability of each regimen with the best outcomes and safety profiles. Among all first-line treatments for patients with SCLC, bevacizumab plus etoposide-platinum chemotherapy was associated with the highest probability of ranking first for PFS (0.87) and TRAEs of grade 3 or greater (0.89), and PD-L1 inhibitors plus etoposide-platinum chemotherapy was associated with the highest probability of ranking first for DCR (0.97) and OS (0.87). Interestingly, ipilimumab plus etoposide-platinum chemotherapy seemed associated with the highest probability of ranking first for ORR (0.95). eTable 2 in the Supplement summarizes the clinical outcomes, including ORR, DCR, PFS, OS, and TRAEs of grade 3 or greater. eTable 3 in the Supplement shows the results of the evaluation of inconsistency for direct, indirect, and overall effects as well as inconsistency standard deviation.

### Phase III randomized trial of ipilimumab plus etoposide and platinum versus placebo plus etoposide and platinum in extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer [^2fc3b27c]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose Patients with extensive-stage disease small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) have poor survival outcomes despite first-line chemotherapy with etoposide and platinum. This randomized, double-blind phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ipilimumab or placebo plus etoposide and platinum in patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC. Patients and Methods Patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of one to one to receive chemotherapy with etoposide and platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin) plus ipilimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks for a total of four doses each in a phased induction schedule (chemotherapy in cycles one to four; ipilimumab or placebo beginning in cycle three up to cycle six), followed by ipilimumab or placebo maintenance every 12 weeks. Primary end point was overall survival (OS) among patients receiving at least one dose of blinded study therapy. Results Of 1,132 patients randomly assigned, 954 received at least one dose of study therapy (chemotherapy plus ipilimumab, n = 478; chemotherapy plus placebo, n = 476). Median OS was 11.0 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 10.9 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.09; P = 0.3775). Median progression-free survival was 4.6 months for chemotherapy plus ipilimumab versus 4.4 months for chemotherapy plus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.97). Rates and severity of treatment-related adverse events were similar between arms, except for diarrhea, rash, and colitis, which were more frequent with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. Rate of treatment-related discontinuation was higher with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab (18% v 2% with chemotherapy plus placebo). Five treatment-related deaths occurred with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab and two with chemotherapy plus placebo. Conclusion Addition of ipilimumab to chemotherapy did not prolong OS versus chemotherapy alone in patients with newly diagnosed extensive-stage disease SCLC. No new or unexpected adverse events were observed with chemotherapy plus ipilimumab. Several ongoing studies are evaluating ipilimumab in combination with programmed death-1 inhibitors in SCLC.

### Immunotherapy in small-cell lung cancer: from molecular promises to clinical challenges [^21602d0a]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

The first results of another anti-PD-L1 agent, durvalumab (10 mg/kg every 2 weeks), are also available. The study was performed in a PD-L1-unselected population. Primary endpoint was safety: treatment was well tolerated and all irAEs were grade 1 or 2. Secondary endpoints were also of interest with an ORR of 9.5%, a median PFS 1.5 months and a median OS 4.8 months. Durvalumab showed a tolerable safety profile and a promising activity also when combined with tremelimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 agent. Initial data from a phase I dose-finding trial on heavily pre-treated ED-SCLC patients showed a 23% grade 3–4 irAEs, with a confirmed ORR of 13.3% and a median DOR of over 18 months.

Combination strategies have also been investigated after the failure of platinum-etoposide treatment. Positive findings about chemotherapy plus anti-PD-1 drug are coming from a phase II study that investigated the efficacy of this combination in a small group of platinum refractory ED-SCLC patients. Paclitaxel (175 mg/m2) was administered every 3 weeks up to 6 cycles and flat dose pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) was added from the second cycle and continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. ORR was 23.1%, with a disease control rate (DCR) of over 80% and median OS of 9.2 months. Toxicity was acceptable and main grade 3–4 events, such as febrile neutropenia, were related to chemotherapy.

A large number of trials are ongoing for this setting of treatment. ICIs are administered as single agent in single arm trial, as a single agent compared to standard treatment, or in combination either with other ICIs, or with chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or with other drugs (Table 4).

The study population characteristics were: median age of 63 years (range: 28 to 82); 40% age 65 or older; 70% male; 84% White, 15% Asian, and 0.9% Black; 65% WHO/ECOG PS of 1; and 93% were former/current smokers. Ninety percent of patients had Stage IV disease and 10% had brain metastasis at baseline. A total of 25% of the patients received cisplatin and 74% of the patients received carboplatin. In the chemotherapy alone arm, 57% of the patients received 6 cycles of chemotherapy, and 8% of the patients received PCI.

The OS results are summarized in Table 27 and Figure 5.

Figure 5. Kaplan-Meier Curves of Overall Survival in the CASPIAN Study

Investigator-assessed PFS (96% of total planned events) showed a HR of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.65, 0.94), with median PFS of 5.1 months (95% CI: 4.7, 6.2) in the IMFINZI plus chemotherapy arm and 5.4 months (95% CI: 4.8, 6.2) in the chemotherapy alone arm. The investigator-assessed confirmed ORR was 68% (95% CI: 62%, 73%) in the IMFINZI plus chemotherapy arm and 58% (95% CI: 52%, 63%) in the chemotherapy alone arm.

In the exploratory subgroup analyses of OS based on the planned platinum chemotherapy received at cycle 1, the HR was 0.70 (95% CI 0.55, 0.89) in patients who received carboplatin, and the HR was 0.88 (95% CI 0.55, 1.41) in patients who received cisplatin.

### Updated overall survival and PD-L1 subgroup analysis of patients with extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer treated with atezolizumab, carboplatin, and etoposide (IMpower133) [^9d1dad74]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

PD-L1 expression in SCLC is highly variable, and published results indicate that expression ranges from 2% to 83%, depending on the assay and scoring algorithm used. In this study, using the SP263 assay, the prevalence of PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% on TC or IC within the BEP was 53%, whereas the prevalence of PD-L1 expression ≥ 5% on TC or IC was 21%. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression was more frequently observed on IC than on TC; this finding differs from that for NSCLC, for which PD-L1 expression is observed on both TC and IC. The pattern of PD-L1 expression primarily on IC in SCLC was also seen in the phase III CASPIAN (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03043872) study, which also demonstrated an improvement in OS similar to that observed in IMpower133 when the anti–PD-L1 antibody durvalumab was added to platinum plus etoposide (EP) versus placebo plus EP in patients with untreated ES-SCLC. The data from both IMpower133 and CASPIAN suggest that the immune biology of SCLC may be more similar to that of diseases such as triple-negative breast cancerand urothelial carcinoma, for which PD-L1 expression is primarily on IC (limited PD-L1 expression on TC).

### Durvalumab plus chemo improves survival for small cell… [^2b493968]. NCI (2019). Medium credibility.

UPDATE: On March 27, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration approved durvalumab to treat small cell lung cancer. Under the approval, durvalumab can be used as an initial treatment for people with extensive-stage SCLC. The approval was based on the results of the CASPIAN clinical trial, which showed that patients treated with durvalumab and standard chemotherapy lived longer than patients treated with chemotherapy alone. More details on the CASPIAN trial are described in the article below. The CASPIAN trial results were presented in September at the World Conference on Lung Cancer in Barcelona, Spain, and published October 4 in The Lancet. "CASPIAN underlines the therapeutic value of chemoimmunotherapy in patients with SCLC as a new standard of care, " wrote Thorsten Oliver Goetze, M. D., of the Institute of Clinical Cancer Research in Frankfurt, Germany, in an accompanying editorial.

The trial also "raises further questions" for future clinical trials to answer, Dr. Goetze added, including how best to use chemotherapy in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. CASPIAN, which is being conducted at 209 sites across 23 countries, was funded by AstraZeneca, the maker of durvalumab. Durvalumab is already being used as standard therapy for patients with advanced NSCLC. All 805 patients in the CASPIAN trial had advanced SCLC. Of these, 268 were randomly assigned to durvalumab plus standard chemotherapy and 269 were randomly assigned to standard chemotherapy alone. Another 268 patients were randomly assigned to durvalumab plus a second immune checkpoint inhibitor, tremelimumab, in addition to standard chemotherapy.

The planned interim analysis of CASPIAN reported at the WCLC and published in The Lancet, which included data from the durvalumab and control groups only, showed that patients receiving durvalumab in addition to standard chemotherapy lived longer overall after random assignment: a median of 13. 0 months versus
10. 3 months. Nevertheless, 87% and 85% of patients, respectively in the two groups completed four cycles of chemotherapy. Adverse effects leading to death occurred in 5% of patients in the durvalumab group and 6% in the control group.

### Effect of first-line serplulimab vs placebo added to chemotherapy on survival in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: the ASTRUM-005 randomized clinical trial [^628c5674]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Programmed cell death ligand 1 inhibitors combined with chemotherapy has changed the approach to first-line treatment in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC). It remained unknown whether adding a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor to chemotherapy provided similar or better benefits in patients with extensive-stage SCLC, which would add evidence on the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of extensive-stage SCLC.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy and adverse event profile of the PD-1 inhibitor serplulimab plus chemotherapy compared with placebo plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in patients with extensive-stage SCLC.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This international, double-blind, phase 3 randomized clinical trial (ASTRUM-005) enrolled patients at 114 hospital sites in 6 countries between September 12, 2019, and April 27, 2021. Of 894 patients who were screened, 585 with extensive-stage SCLC who had not previously received systemic therapy were randomized. Patients were followed up through October 22, 2021.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either 4.5 mg/kg of serplulimab (n = 389) or placebo (n = 196) intravenously every 3 weeks. All patients received intravenous carboplatin and etoposide every 3 weeks for up to 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was overall survival (prespecified significance threshold at the interim analysis, 2-sided P < .012). There were 13 secondary outcomes, including progression-free survival and adverse events.

Results

Among the 585 patients who were randomized (mean age, 61.1 [SD, 8.67] years; 104 [17.8%] women), 246 (42.1%) completed the trial and 465 (79.5%) discontinued study treatment. All patients received study treatment and were included in the primary analyses. As of the data cutoff (October 22, 2021) for this interim analysis, the median duration of follow-up was 12.3 months (range, 0.2–24.8 months). The median overall survival was significantly longer in the serplulimab group (15.4 months [95% CI, 13.3 months-not evaluable]) than in the placebo group (10.9 months [95% CI, 10.0–14.3 months]) (hazard ratio, 0.63 [95% CI, 0.49–0.82]; P < .001). The median progression-free survival (assessed by an independent radiology review committee) also was longer in the serplulimab group (5.7 months [95% CI, 5.5–6.9 months]) than in the placebo group (4.3 months [95% CI, 4.2–4.5 months]) (hazard ratio, 0.48 [95% CI, 0.38–0.59]). Treatment-related adverse events that were grade 3 or higher occurred in 129 patients (33.2%) in the serplulimab group and in 54 patients (27.6%) in the placebo group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with previously untreated extensive-stage SCLC, serplulimab plus chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone, supporting the use of serplulimab plus chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for this patient population.

### Durvalumab (Imfinzi) [^0d62879c]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Randomization was stratified by the planned platinum-based therapy in cycle 1 (carboplatin or cisplatin).

The evaluation of efficacy for ES-SCLC relied on comparison between:

IMFINZI 1,500 mg, and investigator's choice of carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6 mg/mL/min) or cisplatin (75–80 mg/m²) on Day 1 and etoposide (80–100 mg/m²) intravenously on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle for 4 cycles, followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or

Investigator's choice of carboplatin (AUC 5 or 6 mg/mL/min) or cisplatin (75–80 mg/m2) on Day 1 and etoposide (80–100 mg/m2) intravenously on Days 1, 2, and 3 of each 21-day cycle, up to 6 cycles. After completion of chemotherapy, PCI as administered per investigator discretion.

Administration of IMFINZI as a single agent was permitted beyond disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and deriving clinical benefit as determined by the investigator.

The major efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) of IMFINZI plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy alone. Additional efficacy outcome measures were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR), per RECIST v1.1.

### Comparison of first-line treatments for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^ee886d27]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which is characterized by rapid growth and early development of metastasis, is an extremely aggressive type of lung cancer. Because most cases have metastasized to widespread sites at the time of diagnosis, 70% of patients present with extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). For several decades, the standard first-line chemotherapy for ES-SCLC has been etoposide combined with platinum (cisplatin or carboplatin). Despite its high response rate, nearly all patients experienced quick disease relapse, with a median progression-free survival (PFS) of as long as 3 months, and poor survival outcomes, with a median overall survival (OS) of approximately 10 months. Although some trials in Japan demonstrated that an irinotecan-based regimen as a first-line treatment for ES-SCLC had better PFS and OS, its OS benefit remained poor. Thus, improved first-line treatments are urgently needed.

Scholars have investigated the outcomes of a biologically synergistic combination of etoposide-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) antibody, as a first-line option to prolong survival. They observed that bevacizumab plus etoposide-based chemotherapy as the first-line treatment for patients with ES-SCLC resulted in positive signals, such as increased PFS, but not in OS. Additionally, immunotherapies targeting either programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) or cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) have also been used as first-line treatments for ES-SCLC in recent years, including durvalumab and atezolizumab, 2 human monoclonal antibodies that inhibit PD-L1–PD-1 signaling to enhance the T-cell immunity, and ipilimumab, a fully humanized immunoglobin G1 monoclonal antibody that blocks CTLA-4 binding to its ligands (CD80 and CD86). Previous studies indicated that first-line immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) plus etoposide-platinum chemotherapy might improve survival among patients with ES-SCLC. Furthermore, a PD-L1 inhibitor with chemotherapy has been included in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline as a first-line treatment option for patients with ES-SCLC. However, with advancements in first-line treatments for patients with ES-SCLC, the outcomes and relative safety profiles of these treatment regimens have not been fully compared.

Baseline and follow-up assessment

The first tumor imaging examination (computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) was completed within 28 days prior to starting treatment and had to be at least one measurable lesion that meets the RECIST 1.1 criteria. Tumor imaging evaluation was conducted every 6 weeks (± 7 days) after initial administration and every 9 weeks (± 7 days) after 1 year until disease progression occurred. For patients with radiographic disease progression at the first assessment, if the clinical condition was stable, and the investigators believed that patients could continue to obtain clinical benefit, the current treatment regimen could be continued, and radiographic confirmation had to be repeated at least 4 weeks (± 7 days) apart. If disease progression was confirmed after re-evaluation, this treatment regimen should be discontinued. The follow-up time was calculated as the duration from the initiation of treatment to the moment of the related endpoint or the end of the last follow-up evaluation.

Outcomes

The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), which was defined as the time from the initiation of treatment to the time of disease progression or death from any cause. The secondary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DoR), overall survival (OS), and safety. The ORR was defined as the percentage of patients who achieved a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). The DCR was defined as the percentage of CR, PR, or stable disease (SD). The DoR was defined as the time from initial CR or PR to PD or death from any cause. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time from the date of first treatment to the date of death for any reason or the date of the last follow-up. Adverse events/AEs were classified based on Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Version 25.0, and graded according to the National Cancer Institute Standard for Common Terminology for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE Version 5.0). Treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were determined by the investigator. Serious adverse events (SAEs) were defined if they led to death, life-threatening events, in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or severe disability, congenital anomalies, or birth defects.

### Immune-checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy as first-line treatment for patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer [^5b2026ab]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

In total, six studies involving 2905 patients were identified (online supplementary figure 1). The main characteristics of the included trials are presented in table 1. Two trials compared ipilimumab plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy, two trials compared PD-1 inhibitors (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy, while two trials compared PD-L1 inhibitors (atezolizumab and durvaluamb) plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy. Additionally, the CASPIAN study was a three-arm randomized trial that investigated durvalumab with or without tremelimumab (CTLA-4 inhibitor) plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone. In brief, 469 patients received PD-L1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy, 308 received PD-1 inhibitors plus chemotherapy, 563 received CTLA-4 inhibitors plus chemotherapy, 268 received PD-L1/CTLA-4 inhibitors plus chemotherapy and 1297 received chemotherapy alone. Moreover, 10.8% (283/2615) patients had baseline brain metastases (BMs). The median follow-up time ranged from 10.5 to 25.1 months. All of the six trials provided OS, PFS, ORR and AE information. The assessment of risk of bias is presented in online supplementary figure 2.

### Recent treatment patterns and real-world survival following first-line anti-PD-L1 treatment for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer [^61714f40]. The Oncologist (2024). Medium credibility.

Implications for Practice

Etoposide-platinum (EP) chemotherapy has been the backbone therapy of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) for 3 decades despite short-lived responses. More recently, the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to standard-of-care chemotherapy demonstrated improved survival in clinical trials, leading to their approval and inclusion in clinical treatment guidelines for extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). This report provides insight on how treatment patterns have evolved following the introduction of ICIs and their impact on survival outcomes in patients with ES-SCLC. These findings support the need for new treatment strategies and innovative treatments to improve clinical outcomes for patients with ES-SCLC.

Extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES–SCLC) — phase III chemoimmunotherapy trials with atezolizumab (IMpower133) and durvalumab (CASPIAN) improved outcomes versus chemotherapy alone with generally similar overall toxicity. In IMpower133, both PFS and OS improved with atezolizumab, with PFS (1-year, 12.6% v 5.4%; HR, 0.77; P = 0.02) and OS (1-year, 52% v 38%; HR, 0.70; P = 0.007), and an update reported OS at 18-month (34% v 21%, HR, 0.76; P = 0.015); grade 3–4 AEs were similar (56.0% v 56.1%) while immune-related AEs were more common with immunotherapy (39.9% v 24.5%). In CASPIAN, durvalumab plus chemotherapy improved RR (68% v 58%), PFS (1-year, 18% v 5%, HR, 0.78), and OS (1-year, 54% v 40%, HR, 0.73; P = 0.005), with 18-month OS 32% v 25% and overall toxicity similar (62% grade 3–4 AEs; treatment-related 5%-6%), while immune-related AEs were more common with durvalumab (20% v 3%).

### Prolonging survival: the role of immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of extensive-stage small cell lung cancer [^52737600]. The Oncologist (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) represents approximately 15% of lung cancers, and approximately 70% are diagnosed as extensive-stage SCLC (ES-SCLC). Although ES-SCLC is highly responsive to chemotherapy, patients typically progress rapidly, and there is an urgent need for new therapies. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have recently been investigated in SCLC, and this review provides guidance on the use of these agents in ES-SCLC based on phase III evidence.

Methods

Published and presented literature on phase III data addressing use of ICIs in ES-SCLC was identified using the key search terms "small cell lung cancer" AND "checkpoint inhibitors" (OR respective aliases). Directed searches of eligible studies were periodically performed to ensure capture of the most recent data.

Results

Six phase III trials were identified, with four assessing the benefits of ICIs plus chemotherapy first-line, one evaluating ICIs as first-line therapy maintenance, and one assessing ICI monotherapy after progression on platinum-based chemotherapy. The addition of ipilimumab or tremelimumab to first-line treatment or as first-line maintenance did not improve survival. Two out of three studies combining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy demonstrated significant long-lasting survival benefits and improved quality of life with no unexpected safety concerns. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line maintenance or in later lines of therapy did not improve survival. Biomarker research is ongoing as well as research into the role of ICIs in combination with radiation therapy in limited-stage SCLC.

Conclusion

The addition of atezolizumab or durvalumab to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy for ES-SCLC prolongs survival and improves quality of life.

Implications For Practice

Platinum-based chemotherapy has been standard of care for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC) for more than a decade. Six recent phase III trials investigating immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have clarified the role of these agents in this setting. Although ICIs were assessed first-line, as first-line maintenance, and in later lines of therapy, the additions of atezolizumab or durvalumab to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy were the only interventions that significantly improved overall survival and increased quality of life. These combinations should therefore be considered standard therapy for first-line ES-SCLC. Biomarker research and investigations into the role of ICIs for limited-stage disease are ongoing.

### Pembrolizumab or placebo plus etoposide and platinum as first-line therapy for extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer: randomized, double-blind, phase III KEYNOTE-604 study [^7f5cb6fa]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Pembrolizumab monotherapy has shown antitumor activity in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). The randomized, double-blind, phase III KEYNOTE-604 study compared pembrolizumab plus etoposide and platinum (EP) with placebo plus EP for patients with previously untreated extensive-stage (ES) SCLC.

Methods

Eligible patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks or saline placebo for up to 35 cycles plus 4 cycles of EP. Primary end points were progression-free survival (PFS; RECIST version 1.1, blinded central review) and overall survival (OS) in the intention-to-treat population. Objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response were secondary end points. Prespecified efficacy boundaries were one-sided P = 0.0048 for PFS and .0128 for OS.

Results

Of the 453 participants, 228 were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab plus EP and 225 to placebo plus EP. Pembrolizumab plus EP significantly improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.91; P = 0.0023). Twelve-month PFS estimates were 13.6% with pembrolizumab plus EP and 3.1% with placebo plus EP. Although pembrolizumab plus EP prolonged OS, the significance threshold was not met (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.64 to 0.98; P = 0.0164). Twenty-four-month OS estimates were 22.5% and 11.2%, respectively. ORR was 70.6% in the pembrolizumab plus EP group and 61.8% in the placebo plus EP group; the estimated proportion of responders remaining in response at 12 months was 19.3% and 3.3%, respectively. In the pembrolizumab plus EP and placebo plus EP groups, respectively, any-cause adverse events were grade 3–4 in 76.7% and 74.9%, grade 5 in 6.3% and 5.4%, and led to discontinuation of any drug in 14.8% and 6.3%.

Conclusion

Pembrolizumab plus EP significantly improved PFS compared with placebo plus EP as first-line therapy for patients with ES-SCLC. No unexpected toxicities were seen with pembrolizumab plus EP. These data support the benefit of pembrolizumab in ES-SCLC.

### Immunotherapy in small-cell lung cancer: from molecular promises to clinical challenges [^4aa7a22c]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2019). Medium credibility.

Several clinical trials are currently exploring, in first line treatment, the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with chemotherapy and other ICIs, as summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Ongoing clinical trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors in first line setting for SCLC

ED-SCLC Extensive-stage Disease Small cell lung cancer, CE Cisplatin/Carboplatin plus Etoposide, PFS Progression Free Survival, DLTs Dose-limiting Toxicities, OS Overall Survival, AEs Adverse Events, ORR Overall Response Rate, LD-SCLC Limited-stage Disease Small cell lung cancer, RT Radiotherapy, MTD Maximum Tolerated Dose

Another promising approach is represented by the association of radiotherapy and immunotherapy. Similarly to chemotherapy, radiation therapy can induce an immunogenic cell death. Clinical trials are also evaluating concurrent administration of radiotherapy and chemo-immunotherapy regimens containing pembrolizumab (NCT02934503, NCT02402920).

The association of the anti-PD-L1 durvalumab with the anti-CTLA4 tremelimumab is also under investigation (NCT02658214, NCT03043872). The rationale behind this combination is to exploit the different mechanisms of action: inhibiting CTLA-4 leads to differentiation of naïve T cells, which will later be able to infiltrate tumor tissues with no restraint on their anti-tumor activity mediated by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibition.

Maintenance

While it is hard to replace first line chemotherapy, the rapid decline of performance status and the worsening of symptoms at disease progression might prevent many patients to be eligible for immunotherapy as salvage treatment. Moreover, chemotherapy may enhance the susceptibility of the tumor to immunotherapy: all these features represent the rationale of administrating ICIs as a maintenance or consolidation treatment. A phase II single arm trial assessed the efficacy of maintenance pembrolizumab in 45 ED-SCLC patients, after response or stable disease following platinum/etoposide chemotherapy. Maintenance started within 8 weeks from the last cycle of chemotherapy and continued for a total of 2 years. The primary endpoint was the improvement of median PFS to 3 months (50% increase over 2 months of the historical controls). The endpoint was not met, with a median PFS of 1.4 months (95%CI: 1.3–2.8 months); however, a subset of patients with any PD-L1 expression on cells confined in the stromal interface could gain a long lasting benefit from maintenance (6.5 months, 95%CI: 1.1–12.8 months).

### Factors affecting survival and prognosis in extensive stage small cell lung cancer [^d8cdaaea]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Although chemotherapy significantly improves the quality of life and prolongs survival in patients with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC), relapse is almost inevitable, with only 5% of patients surviving two years after the initial diagnosis. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is considered for patients who achieve a complete response, as it has been shown to improve survival rates in this population. Recent studies have also demonstrated that adding PD-L1 inhibitors, such as atezolizumab or durvalumab, to chemotherapy in first-line treatment significantly enhances survival compared to chemotherapy alone. Our study was conducted retrospectively at a single center, including 280 patients with ES-SCLC who began therapy at our institution between July 2009 and February 2023. Patients who underwent thoracic residual radiotherapy (p < 0.001) and PCI (p < 0.001) showed statistically significant improvements in OS. In the first-line treatment group, the median overall survival (OS) for patients receiving cisplatin+etoposide was 12.0 months (10.71–13.28), while those treated with carboplatin+etoposide had a median OS of 7.0 months (4.58–9.41). For patients receiving carboplatin+etoposide+atezolizumab, the median OS was 35.0 months (21.32–48.67), and a statistically significant difference was observed (p < 0.001). In our study, the median OS was 7 months in patients who received ≤ 4 cycles of treatment in the first line and 14 months in patients who received > 4 cycles of treatment. After first-line treatment, the proportion of patients with progression-free survival (PFS) between 0–3 months was 21%, and between 3–6 months was 24%. PFS was notably worse in those with bone, liver, or brain metastases at diagnosis in the first-line treatment. Multivariate analysis revealed that carboplatin+etoposide+atezolizumab in the first line and cisplatin+etoposide in the second line reduced the risk of both progression and death, while PCI reduced the risk of death. In conclusion, ES-SCLC remains one of the most challenging malignancies, characterized by poor survival rates and short progression-free intervals. Multiple factors influence OS and PFS, some of which are intrinsic to the patient and disease at diagnosis. In contrast, others, such as treatment modalities, the number of treatment cycles, and the application of radiotherapy, can be modified by clinicians.

Small cell neuroendocrine cervical cancer (NECC) — first-line regimens and outcomes are summarized as follows: In a randomized, open-label, phase 3 extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES‑SCLC) trial, durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide improved overall survival with HR 0.73 (95% CI, 0.59–0.91; P = 0.00471), with median overall survival 13.0 months versus 10.3 months; 268 patients received durvalumab plus platinum-etoposide and 269 received platinum-etoposide. Based on this trial, a combination of durvalumab with Cisplatin (or carboplatin) and etoposide is one of the recommended regimens for first-line, recurrent or metastatic small cell NECC along with atezolizumab, and other recommended first-line options for recurrent or metastatic small cell NECC include the topotecan, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab combination. In a retrospective series of recurrent small cell cervical cancer (SCCC), median progression-free survival was 7.8 months with topotecan/paclitaxel/bevacizumab (TPB) versus 4.0 months with non-TPB regimens (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09–0.54; P = 0.001), while median overall survival was 9.7 months with TPB versus 9.4 months with non-TPB (HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.23–1.22; P = 0.13).

### Systemic therapy for small cell lung cancer: ASCO guideline rapid recommendation update [^e80e467c]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) — Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has reported 2-year and 5-year overall survival (OS) rates of 51%-58% and 29%-34% with either once-daily or twice-daily radiotherapy. ADRIATIC results show a 2-year OS of 58.5% for chemoradiotherapy alone and suggest that adding consolidation durvalumab can improve the 2-year OS rate by about 10%. Despite other trials and longer-term OS pending, the addition of consolidation durvalumab after chemoradiotherapy represents a new standard of care for patients with LS-SCLC.

In a phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned patients to receive durvalumab at a dose of 1500 mg, durvalumab (1500 mg) plus tremelimumab at a dose of 75 mg (four doses only), or placebo every 4 weeks for up to 24 months. Randomization was stratified according to disease stage (I or II vs. III) and receipt of prophylactic cranial irradiation (yes vs. no). Results of the first planned interim analysis of the two primary end points of overall survival and progression-free survival (assessed on the basis of blinded independent central review according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1) with durvalumab as compared with placebo (data cutoff date, January 15, 2024) are reported; results in the durvalumab-tremelimumab group remain blinded.

Results

A total of 264 patients were assigned to the durvalumab group, 200 to the durvalumab-tremelimumab group, and 266 to the placebo group. Durvalumab therapy led to significantly longer overall survival than placebo (median, 55.9 months [95% confidence interval {CI}, 37.3 to not reached] vs. 33.4 months [95% CI, 25.5 to 39.9]; hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 98.321% CI, 0.54 to 0.98; P = 0.01), as well as to significantly longer progression-free survival (median 16.6 months [95% CI, 10.2 to 28.2] vs. 9.2 months [95% CI, 7.4 to 12.9]; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.76; 97.195% CI, 0.59 to 0.98; P = 0.02). The incidence of adverse events with a maximum grade of 3 or 4 was 24.4% among patients receiving durvalumab and 24.2% among patients receiving placebo; adverse events led to discontinuation in 16.4% and 10.6% of the patients, respectively, and led to death in 2.7% and 1.9%. Pneumonitis or radiation pneumonitis with a maximum grade of 3 or 4 occurred in 3.1% of the patients in the durvalumab group and in 2.6% of those in the placebo group.

Conclusions

Adjuvant therapy with durvalumab led to significantly longer overall survival and progression-free survival than placebo among patients with limited-stage small-cell lung cancer. (Funded by AstraZeneca; ADRIATIC ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT03703297.).

Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer – CASPIAN

The safety of IMFINZI in combination with etoposide and either carboplatin or cisplatin in previously untreated ES-SCLC was evaluated in CASPIAN, a randomized, open-label, multicenter, active-controlled study. A total of 265 patients received IMFINZI 1,500 mg in combination with chemotherapy every 3 weeks for 4 cycles followed by IMFINZI 1,500 mg every 4 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The stydy excluded patients with active or prior autoimmune disease or with medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressants [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Among 265 patients receiving IMFINZI, 49% were exposed for 6 months or longer and 19% were exposed for 12 months or longer.

Among 266 patients receiving chemotherapy alone, 57% of the patients received 6 cycles of chemotherapy and 8% of the patients received prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) after chemotherapy.

IMFINZI was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 7% of the patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. These include pneumonitis, hepatotoxicity, neurotoxicity, sepsis, diabetic ketoacidosis and pancytopenia (1 patient each). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 31% of patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. The most frequent serious adverse reactions reported in at least 1% of patients were febrile neutropenia (4.5%), pneumonia (2.3%), anemia (1.9%), pancytopenia (1.5%), pneumonitis (1.1%) and COPD (1.1%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 4.9% of patients receiving IMFINZI plus chemotherapy. These include pancytopenia, sepsis, septic shock, pulmonary artery thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and hepatitis (1 patient each) and sudden death (2 patients). The most common adverse reactions (occurring in ≥ 20% of patients) were nausea, fatigue/asthenia and alopecia.
