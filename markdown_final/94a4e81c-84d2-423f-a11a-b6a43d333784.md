## Question

Latest treatment stage 4 endometrial cancer

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the latest treatment options for stage IV endometrial cancer. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how stage IV disease is defined and why outcomes are poor. Then, I should verify the role of surgery and whether cytoreduction remains appropriate. Next, I will review systemic therapy standards, including chemotherapy backbones and the pivotal addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors. After that, I need to check biomarker-driven strategies by MMR/MSI status and HER2 amplification. I will then examine sequencing of radiotherapy with systemic therapy, consider special histologies like carcinosarcoma, and finally integrate supportive care, clinical trials, and a practical algorithm, making sure each assertion is supported by current guidelines and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the disease context and staging implications. Stage IV endometrial cancer denotes spread beyond the pelvis, with IVA indicating direct invasion of bladder or bowel mucosa and IVB indicating distant metastases; prognosis is poor, with 5-year overall survival around 20%, underscoring the need for aggressive, guideline-concordant multimodal therapy and enrollment in clinical trials when feasible [^111way5r] [^1173gtEa] [^112HDEje].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgery. I initially thought cytoreductive surgery is contraindicated in stage IV disease, but wait, I should verify whether maximal cytoreduction is still beneficial in selected patients. Evidence and guidelines support considering surgical tumor debulking, including enlarged nodes, if complete macroscopic resection is feasible with acceptable morbidity, as achieving no residual disease correlates with improved survival; this applies across histologies, including carcinosarcoma, and should be planned in specialized centers with multidisciplinary input [^116VnTb4] [^114pofDd] [^116tv8Nu].

> Next, I should review the backbone of systemic therapy. Carboplatin plus paclitaxel remains the standard first-line chemotherapy doublet, with typical dosing of carboplatin AUC 5–6 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m² every 21 days for six cycles. Response rates are about 40–62% and median overall survival around 13–29 months, establishing the historical benchmark before immunotherapy integration [^1166Jn9u] [^1127KZc2] [^115wMBeu].

> I need to ensure I capture the immunotherapy revolution. Multiple phase III trials and subsequent FDA approvals have established chemoimmunotherapy as the new first-line standard for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer: pembrolizumab plus carboplatin/paclitaxel, dostarlimab plus carboplatin/paclitaxel, and durvalumab plus carboplatin/paclitaxel all improve progression-free survival, with the strongest benefit in dMMR/MSI-H disease but clinically meaningful gains observed across biomarker subgroups. These approvals supersede chemotherapy alone as the default first-line approach in most patients [^114kLBAS] [^116D3WnP] [^116TGBqQ].

> Let me consider biomarker-driven strategies beyond adding ICIs to chemotherapy. For dMMR/MSI-H tumors, PD-1 blockade monotherapy is an established option after platinum failure, with pembrolizumab or dostarlimab reasonable. For pMMR/MSS disease after chemotherapy, pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib is the preferred second-line regimen based on robust randomized data, while TMB-H disease may respond to pembrolizumab per tissue-agnostic indications, albeit with lower response rates in TMB-low cohorts [^116U6FxV] [^116kt84Q] [^116D3WnP].

> But wait, what if the tumor is HER2-amplified uterine serous carcinoma. I should confirm whether anti-HER2 therapy is indicated. Trastuzumab added to carboplatin/paclitaxel improves outcomes in HER2-positive uterine serous carcinoma and should be incorporated when HER2 positivity is documented, aligning with contemporary guideline positions and trial data [^116kt84Q] [^1122sHJ6].

> Next, I should review how radiotherapy integrates with systemic therapy. For locoregional control and symptom palliation, external beam radiotherapy with or without brachytherapy can be used sequentially or concurrently with chemotherapy. ASTRO recommends considering EBRT with concurrent chemotherapy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy, or sequential chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy, individualized by resection status, nodal disease, and patient factors, with NCCN listing cisplatin-based chemoradiation followed by carboplatin/paclitaxel as a preferred pathway in some scenarios [^115UbPxq] [^115RFn7y] [^117Pk7Af].

> I will now examine special histologies and scenarios. Carcinosarcoma should be treated as high-risk carcinoma with aggressive systemic therapy and consideration of maximal surgical cytoreduction when feasible; for patients unfit for primary surgery, primary systemic therapy with consideration of interval debulking after response is appropriate, and enrollment in trials is especially encouraged given limited high-quality evidence in this subtype [^115hTHfh] [^112EQdrD] [^1169Df5d].

> Let me think about supportive care and prognostic modifiers. Given the high symptom burden and comorbidities in advanced endometrial cancer, early palliative care integration, venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, and management of treatment-related toxicities are essential. Performance status, histology, and molecular subtype guide intensity and agent selection, and disparities in access and timeliness of care can worsen outcomes, necessitating equitable, guideline-concordant delivery in specialized centers [^1133xaUH] [^111SHU8p] [^114wU5cy].

> I should double-check the role of clinical trials. With rapidly evolving standards and multiple ongoing studies evaluating ICI monotherapy substitutions, novel combinations, ADCs, and targeted agents, enrollment in clinical trials is a priority at every step, particularly for first-line and post-platinum settings, and non–FDA-approved ICI combinations should generally be restricted to trials [^116D3WnP] [^1169Df5d] [^111fJQaw].

> Let me synthesize a practical, evidence-based algorithm while acknowledging nuances. For medically fit patients with resectable disease, maximal cytoreduction to no gross residual followed by chemoimmunotherapy is preferred. For unresectable or medically inoperable patients, first-line chemoimmunotherapy is standard, with radiotherapy added for locoregional control or palliation. After progression, use MMR status to select pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib for pMMR/MSS disease or PD-1 monotherapy for dMMR/MSI-H disease, and consider HER2-targeted therapy in HER2-positive serous tumors. Throughout, prioritize clinical trial options and multidisciplinary care in specialized centers [^116VnTb4] [^114kLBAS] [^116TGBqQ] [^1133xaUH].

> Finally, I need to ensure the bottom line is clear and accurate. The latest treatment for stage IV endometrial cancer is chemoimmunotherapy with carboplatin/paclitaxel plus a PD-1 inhibitor as the new first-line standard, replacing chemotherapy alone for most patients. Surgery remains appropriate for selected candidates when complete cytoreduction is achievable. Subsequent lines are biomarker-driven, with pembrolizumab/lenvatinib for pMMR/MSS disease and PD-1 monotherapy for dMMR/MSI-H disease, all within a framework of multidisciplinary, guideline-concordant care and clinical trial participation whenever possible [^114kLBAS] [^114wU5cy] [^116TGBqQ] [^116nxBgT].

---

The latest treatment for stage 4 endometrial cancer is **chemoimmunotherapy** (carboplatin/paclitaxel plus pembrolizumab or dostarlimab) for all-comers, with **dMMR/MSI-H tumors** benefiting most from immunotherapy-based regimens [^114kLBAS] [^116D3WnP]. For pMMR/MSS disease after platinum failure, **pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib** is standard [^116kt84Q]. Cytoreductive surgery is considered for resectable disease with acceptable morbidity [^114pofDd], and radiotherapy is used for local control or palliation [^116tv8Nu]. Molecular profiling (MMR/MSI, HER2, TMB) is essential to guide therapy, and clinical trials should be prioritized when available [^116kt84Q] [^1169Df5d].

---

## Current standard of care

### Systemic therapy

- **First-line therapy**: Carboplatin plus paclitaxel with pembrolizumab or dostarlimab is now standard for advanced/metastatic or recurrent disease, regardless of MMR status [^114kLBAS] [^114wU5cy].

- **Second-line therapy**: Pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib for pMMR/MSS disease after platinum failure [^116kt84Q].

- **Chemotherapy alone**: Carboplatin/paclitaxel remains an option if immunotherapy is contraindicated or unavailable [^1166Jn9u].

---

### Surgical management

In selected patients with resectable disease and acceptable morbidity, **cytoreductive surgery** is recommended to improve outcomes [^114pofDd] [^116VnTb4].

---

### Radiation therapy

Radiation therapy is used for **locoregional control**, symptom palliation, and in combination with systemic therapy when indicated [^115UbPxq] [^117Pk7Af].

---

## Molecular profiling and biomarker-driven therapy

- **MMR/MSI status**: dMMR/MSI-H tumors respond well to immunotherapy; pembrolizumab or dostarlimab plus chemotherapy is standard [^114kLBAS] [^116TGBqQ].

- **HER2 status**: HER2-positive serous tumors may benefit from trastuzumab-based regimens [^116kt84Q].

- **TMB**: TMB-H tumors may respond to pembrolizumab [^116kt84Q].

---

## Emerging therapies and clinical trials

- **Antibody-drug conjugates**: Trials of HER2-targeted ADCs (e.g. trastuzumab deruxtecan) are ongoing [^112jJrsS].

- **PARP inhibitors**: Under study, particularly in homologous recombination-deficient tumors [^113CQv7r].

- **Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)**: Early-phase trials are exploring TIL therapy [^111fJQaw].

---

## Multidisciplinary care and patient-centered considerations

Care should be coordinated by a **multidisciplinary team** (gynecologic oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, pathology, radiology) to optimize outcomes [^1133xaUH]. Treatment should be individualized based on age, comorbidities, performance status, and patient preferences [^notfound]. Participation in clinical trials should be encouraged to access novel therapies and advance care [^1169Df5d].

## Summary of current treatment algorithm

| **Treatment modality** | **Indication** | **Recommended regimen** |
|-|-|-|
| First-line systemic therapy | Advanced/metastatic or recurrent disease | Carboplatin + paclitaxel + pembrolizumab or dostarlimab [^114kLBAS] [^116D3WnP] |
| Second-line systemic therapy | pMMR/MSS disease after platinum failure | Pembrolizumab + lenvatinib [^116U6FxV] |
| Chemotherapy alone | Immunotherapy contraindicated | Carboplatin + paclitaxel [^1166Jn9u] |
| Cytoreductive surgery | Resectable disease with acceptable morbidity | Maximal cytoreduction [^114pofDd] [^116VnTb4] |
| Radiation therapy | Locoregional control or palliation | EBRT ± brachytherapy [^112mSZNe] [^116tv8Nu] |

---

The latest treatment for stage 4 endometrial cancer centers on **chemoimmunotherapy** for first-line therapy, with biomarker-guided second-line options and selective surgery and radiotherapy. Molecular profiling and clinical trials are integral to delivering personalized, evidence-based care [^116TGBqQ] [^116tv8Nu] [^116nxBgT] [^1169Df5d].

Objectives

Patients with advanced stage endometrial carcinoma constitute a heterogeneous group of patients with different stages, tumor histologic types, and involved sites. Hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-ophorectomy, and surgical staging are the cornerstone of surgical management in these patients. The optimal adjuvant therapy is yet to be established. An expert panel was convened to reach consensus on the most appropriate management options in this group of patients.

Methods

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances where evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

Results

Four clinical variants were developed to address common scenarios in the management of women with advanced-stage endometrial carcinoma. Group members reached consensus on the appropriateness of specific evaluation and treatment approaches with numerical ratings.

Conclusions

In combining available medical literature and expert opinions, this manuscript may serve as an aid for other practitioners in the appropriate management of women with advanced-stage endometrial carcinoma.

Uterine Cancer Research Results and Study Updates See Advances in Endometrial Cancer Research for an overview of recent findings and progress, plus ongoing projects supported by NCI. More Immunotherapy Options Approved for Treating Endometrial CancerPosted: People with advanced endometrial cancer now have new FDA-approved treatment options: pembrolizumab and durvalumab, paired with chemotherapy, for tumors with a genetic change called mismatch repair deficiency. The agency also expanded the approved uses of dostarlimab for the disease. Immunotherapy's Role in Treating Endometrial Cancer Expected to GrowPosted: In two clinical trials, combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with standard chemotherapy substantially increased how long people with advanced endometrial cancer lived without their cancer worsening, particularly those with dMMR or MSI-high tumors. Trastuzumab May Improve Survival in Women with Rare Endometrial CancerPosted:

For some women with HER2-positive uterine serous carcinoma, a rare type of endometrial cancer, treating them with trastuzumab and chemotherapy may help them live longer, according to updated results from a small clinical trial. Women Experience More Side Effects from Pelvic Radiation than RealizedPosted: Women with cervical or uterine cancer who received radiation to the pelvic region reported side effects much more often using an online reporting system called PRO-CTCAE than they did during conversations with their clinicians, a new study shows. Can Some Women Treated for Endometrial Cancer Forgo Radiation after Surgery. Posted: Some women with endometrial cancer may be able to receive less intensive treatment, chemotherapy and no radiation, without increasing their risk of the disease recurring within 5 years, according to the results of a randomized clinical trial.

Study Shows Incidence Rates of Aggressive Subtypes of Uterine Cancer RisingPosted: An NCI-led study shows rates for aggressive subtypes of uterine cancer rose rapidly among women ages 30 to 79 from 2000–2015. The findings, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, also reveal racial disparities in incidence and survival rates. Study Provides Closer Look at Postmenopausal Bleeding and Endometrial CancerPosted: A new study has found that 90% of postmenopausal women diagnosed with endometrial cancer reported vaginal bleeding before their diagnosis. Approximately 9% of postmenopausal women who saw a doctor for bleeding, the study showed, later received an endometrial cancer diagnosis. Study Shows Experimental Screening Test Can Detect Endometrial and Ovarian CancersPosted: Scientists have struggled to come up with a simple test to detect endometrial and ovarian cancers early, when they are most likely to respond to treatment. Can a liquid biopsy test called PapSEEK change that.

Endometrial Cancer Incidence Rising in the US and WorldwidePosted: Diagnoses of endometrial cancer have increased worldwide in recent years, with rates rising in more than half of the 43 countries studied during the decade ending around 2010, a team of international researchers has shown.

TMB-H endometrial cancer

The efficacy data leading to the accelerated approval of pembrolizumab for all solid tumors that are TMB-H are described in the Immunotherapy biomarkers for gynecologic cancer section. In the patients with TMB-H endometrial cancer (n = 15) in KEYNOTE-158, the ORR with pembrolizumab was 47% (95% CI 21% to 73%) and the response duration ranged from 8.4+ months to 33.9+ months. Responses were infrequent, however, in patients with endometrial cancer that was TMB-low, with only 4 of 67 patients responding.

Expert Panel recommendations

For first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer, carboplatin plus paclitaxel with or without trastuzumab (if HER2+ serous endometrial cancer) was the standard of care at the time of guideline publication (LE:2). Anti-PD-1 ICIs in combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PFS over chemotherapy alone for the treatment of previously untreated stage III or IV or first recurrent (after prior neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy) endometrial cancer. The observed benefit was regardless of MMR status (LE:2), however, this combination was not FDA-approved at the time of guideline publication.
For second-line treatment of patients with pMMR/MSS advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer, pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib is recommended, as indicated. For second-line treatment of patients with TMB-H/pMMR/MSS endometrial cancer (LE:2), pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib is the standard of care option (LE:2) however, anti-PD-1 monotherapy may also be an option (LE:3).
For patients with dMMR/MSI-H advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer who have disease progression following prior systemic therapy in any setting and who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, pembrolizumab monotherapy is recommended (LE:3). For patients with dMMR/MSI-H advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer who have disease progression following prior platinum-containing regimen in any setting and who are not candidates for curative surgery or radiation, dostarlimab monotherapy is recommended (LE:3).

### Advances in the management of recurrent endometrial cancer [^111h8PHy]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Endometrial carcinoma is the most common malignancy of the female reproductive tract. Although most cases are diagnosed at an early stage, endometrial carcinoma carries a poor prognosis when it recurs after previous definitive treatment or when diagnosed at an advanced stage. The purpose of this review is to summarize the contemporary management of recurrent endometrial carcinoma.

Methods

A literature review was conducted on the management of advanced, recurrent, or metastatic endometrial cancer to determine the best evidence to support the roles of surgery, radiation, and medical therapy.

Results

Radiation therapy (RT) has a role in the treatment of a local or regional recurrence, especially in the patient who has not had prior RT. For selected patients who experience a loco-regional recurrence and who have been treated with RT, pelvic exenteration may be an option. Those patients with metastatic disease are not curable and should be considered for palliative chemotherapy. The data support the use of carboplatin and paclitaxel as an acceptable alternative to cisplatin-based regimens. For women who progress after first-line treatment, the options are limited. Current clinical trials are evaluating the role of angiogenesis inhibitors and molecularly targeted therapy (including the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors and multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors) with the aim of identifying other novel agents that can be exploited for treatment of advanced disease.

Conclusions

The treatment of women with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic endometrial cancer represents an unmet need in oncology. Robust clinical trials are required to explore how to improve on therapy. The incorporation of molecularly targeted agents has the potential to improve outcomes for women who require treatment in both the first-line and second-line settings.

cancer:

- Stage I
- Stage II
- Stage III
- Stage IV
- Endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:

- Low-risk endometrial cancer
- High-risk endometrial cancer
- Endometrial cancer can recur after it has been treated. The following stages are used for endometrial cancer: Stage I In stage I, cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.
- Stage IA: Cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium.
- Stage IB: Cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium. Stage IV In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB, based on how far the cancer has spread. Treatment Option Overview Key Points
- There are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer.
- Five types of standard treatment are used:

- Surgery
- Radiation therapy
- Chemotherapy
- Hormone therapy
- Targeted therapy
- New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
- Treatment for endometrial cancer may cause side effects.
- Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
- Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
- Follow-up tests may be needed. There are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer. Different types of treatment are available for patients with endometrial cancer. Some treatments are standard, and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.

When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment. Five types of standard treatment are used: Surgery Surgery is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:

- Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.
- Radical hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina. The ovaries, fallopian tubes, or nearby lymph nodes may also be removed.
- Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.

The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Monoclonal antibodies, mTOR inhibitors, and signal transduction inhibitors are three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer.
- Monoclonal antibody therapy: Monoclonal antibodies are immune system proteins made in the laboratory to treat many diseases, including cancer. As a cancer treatment, these antibodies can attach to a specific target on cancer cells or other cells that may help cancer cells grow.

### Endometrial cancer: molecular classification and future treatments [^112jb1j6]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The treatment for endometrial cancer is rapidly evolving with the development of molecular analysis and novel strategies. Surgical resection, cytotoxic chemotherapy, endocrine or hormonal treatment, and radiation have been the staples of treatment for decades. However, precision based approaches for tumours are rapidly becoming a part of these strategies. Biomarker driven treatments are now a part of primary and recurrent treatment algorithms. This review aims to describe the current state of molecular analysis and treatment for endometrial cancer as well as to elucidate potential approaches for the near future.

Introduction

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological malignancy in the US with an estimated 66 000 new cases (2022 estimates) annually. Globally, it is the sixth most common cancer, with 417 000 new cases and 97 000 deaths in 2020.

Evidence reporting

Despite recent advances and novel treatments, survival for endometrial cancer has decreased in the past 10 years and represents one of the few cancers with an impaired survival. Uterine cancer is one of the few cancers with an increase in overall mortality, with a rise of 1.7% over the past 10 years. Common risk factors for endometrial cancer include obesity, states of unopposed oestrogen (eg, obesity, polycystic ovary syndrome), early menarche or late menopause, and hereditary cancer syndromes including Lynch and Cowden's syndrome. Treatment for endometrial cancer has historically been related to the known histopathological risk factors of the tumour that might indicate better or worse recurrence risk. However, over the past decade, molecular analysis and molecular driven treatments have become an important aspect of patient directed care in endometrial cancer. This review summarises the known current molecular aberrations of endometrial cancer and associated treatment options. It highlights the current clinical trial landscape and potential therapeutic shifts based on molecular analysis. This review is aimed towards patients and healthcare providers.

Uterine histopathological status

Uterine factors, histopathological features, and cancer stage continue to be important factors of risk stratification in endometrial cancer. Several studies have examined the importance of numerous factors and have shown that grade, depth of invasion, presence or absence of lymphovascular space invasion, tumour size, and lower uterine segment involvement are all prognostic factors for survival and recurrence. These tenets help stratify patients into low, intermediate, high intermediate, and high risk criteria for adjuvant treatment. Today, patients at low risk are recommended for observation alone while those at high intermediate risk and high risk (advanced stage, serous or clear cell histology, grade 3 with deep invasion) are advised for more aggressive adjuvant treatments. The importance of chemotherapy with consideration of radiation for adjuvant treatment in the high risk population has been evaluated in several studies with recent reports from the GOG 258 and PORTEC-3 trialsestablishing current standards of care based on histopathology and stage. The current standard cytotoxic treatment in advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer is carboplatin and paclitaxel. Second line options for chemotherapy are limited in endometrial cancer, with poor response rates of about 15%.

Recommended immunotherapy treatments — immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have shown benefit in endometrial cancer across settings, though some combinations were not FDA-approved at the guideline's publication. ICIs have demonstrated benefit for biomarker-selected, previously treated endometrial cancers, as well as unselected, previously treated tumors when combined with the anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) lenvatinib. ICIs combined with chemotherapy have also demonstrated benefit in patients with systemic therapy-naive or first recurrent endometrial cancer, although these combinations were not FDA-approved at the time of guideline publication. While not FDA-approved at the time of the guideline publication, two phase III randomized placebo-controlled trials have reported positive results with the use of anti-PD-1 ICIs in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in patients with previously untreated stage III or IV or first recurrent endometrial cancer

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States, and its incidence is rising. Although there have been significant recent advances in our understanding of endometrial cancer biology, many aspects of treatment remain mired in controversy, including the role of surgical lymph node assessment and the selection of patients for adjuvant radiation or chemotherapy. For the subset of women with microsatellite-instable, metastatic disease, anti- programmed cell death protein 1 immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and numerous trials are attempting to build on this early success.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery in patients with serous endometrial cancer with transperitoneal spread (stage IV): a new preferred treatment? [^1167HGws]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Endometrial cancer is the most frequent malignancy of the female genital tract in the Western world. The most common subtype is endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) (80%). Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) accounts for 10% and is a highly aggressive variant that is more likely to spread intraperitoneally, similar to ovarian cancer. The incidence of surgical stage IV disease is ∼5–10%, with a 5-year overall survival (OS) ranging from 0–10%. Despite the poor outcome, few data exist regarding the optimal management of patients with stage IV endometrial cancer.

The amount of residual disease after surgery for advanced endometrial cancer has an impact on median survival and progression-free interval (PFI). These data correspond to findings in ovarian cancer. Primary debulking is, however, associated with a considerable rate of postoperative complications: 34–53% in ovarian cancer and 36–39% in endometrial cancer. Moreover, taking into consideration the age and co-morbidities of endometrial cancer patients, there is a need for better treatment options.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has been used in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer as an alternative approach to conventional primary debulking surgery.

A strategy of NACT enables to identify chemo-sensitive disease that is more likely to benefit from debulking surgery when compared with chemoresistant disease. Furthermore, resection of a reduced tumour burden permits less aggressive surgery and can improve the patients' quality of life by reduced morbidity and shorter operations, intensive care unit stays and overall hospitalisations. A disadvantage of this neoadjuvant approach was the potential for a worse survival when compared with primary debulking. In addition, when the neoadjuvant approach was introduced, some reluctance existed regarding post-chemotherapy complications at the time of major surgery.

Cytotoxic therapy leads to morphological and histopathological changes within tumour tissue and in involved stromal tissue. Successful treatment results in fibrosis and scarring of tumoral stroma and the surrounding tissue. Histopathological tumour regression has been established as the gold standard for the assessment of treatment response in several types of solid tumours (osteosarcomas, gastric, oesophageal and non-small-cell lung cancer). A histopathological assessment of tumour regression in ovarian cancer patients showed a correlation between the composite pathological tumour response score and prolonged progression-free survival.

### A clinically applicable molecular-based classification for endometrial cancers [^115a2n6Z]. British Journal of Cancer (2015). Low credibility.

Endometrial cancers (EC) are the most prevalent gynaecologic malignancies in the developed world and are the fourth most common cancer in women overall. Incidence rates have increased markedly over the last decades attributable at least in part to the global epidemic of obesity. Although the majority of women with EC have good outcomes, women with advanced disease or more aggressive subtypes may not be curable with adjuvant therapy. In Canada over the last decade, the annual percentage increase in age-standardised mortality rate for EC is greater than any other cancer in women and we are in desperate need of new approaches, including diagnostic tools, to manage this cancer.

There are many unanswered questions in EC pertaining to diagnosis and optimal management. Management considerations include which surgery to perform by either a generalist or subspecialist, which if any adjuvant therapies to administer, surveillance strategies and fertility-sparing options in young women. Currently, there are multiple systems of risk-group stratification based on post-surgical staging pathologic examination (principally histotype, tumour grade and stage) that may help guide treatment(s). However, pathologists are unable to reproducibly diagnose histotype and grade of EC; lack of consensus between expert pathologists has been demonstrated, even with the addition of immunohistochemistry. This lack of reproducibility is a major barrier to improving care for women with this disease, and treatments vary within and between cancer centres globally. Assessment of treatment efficacy when there is variable histotype and grade assignment hinders our ability to determine optimal management.

### Treatment for advanced and recurrent endometrial carcinoma: combined modalities [^111xNFSv]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

Women with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer constitute a heterogeneous group of patients. Depending on previous treatment, women with recurrent endometrial cancer may be appropriate candidates for surgery, radiation therapy, hormonal therapy, or chemotherapy. Women with advanced stage disease at presentation may also be appropriate candidates for systemic and local therapies. We review the treatment options available to treat recurrent and locally advanced endometrial cancer. Treatment choice depends largely on the localization of disease, the patient's performance status and previous treatment history, as well the tumor's hormonal receptor status. Radiation therapy is appropriate for isolated vaginal recurrences in patients with no previous history of radiation therapy. Patients with recurrent low-grade tumors overexpressing estrogen and progesterone receptors may be treated with progestin therapy. Systemic therapy is appropriate for patients with disseminate recurrences or advanced stage disease at presentation, or for those with receptor-negative tumors. We review all these different treatment strategies available to patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer.

### ESGO / ESTRO / ESP guidelines for the management of patients with endometrial carcinoma [^111aPpGh]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

A European consensus conference on endometrial carcinoma was held in 2014 to produce multidisciplinary evidence-based guidelines on selected questions. Given the large body of literature on the management of endometrial carcinoma published since 2014, the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO), the European SocieTy for Radiotherapy & Oncology (ESTRO) and the European Society of Pathology (ESP) jointly decided to update these evidence-based guidelines and to cover new topics in order to improve the quality of care for women with endometrial carcinoma across Europe and worldwide. ESGO/ESTRO/ESP nominated an international multidisciplinary development group consisting of practicing clinicians and researchers who have demonstrated leadership and expertise in the care and research of endometrial carcinoma (27 experts across Europe). To ensure that the guidelines are evidence-based, the literature published since 2014, identified from a systematic search was reviewed and critically appraised. In the absence of any clear scientific evidence, judgment was based on the professional experience and consensus of the development group. The guidelines are thus based on the best available evidence and expert agreement. Prior to publication, the guidelines were reviewed by 191 independent international practitioners in cancer care delivery and patient representatives. The guidelines comprehensively cover endometrial carcinoma staging, definition of prognostic risk groups integrating molecular markers, pre- and intra-operative work-up, fertility preservation, management for early, advanced, metastatic, and recurrent disease and palliative treatment. Principles of radiotherapy and pathological evaluation are also defined.

### New targeted agents in endometrial cancer: are we really making progress? [^113CQv7r]. Current Oncology Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological malignancy in Europe and North America. Metastatic and recurrent disease is generally incurable with poor prognosis. Recent advances in molecular profiling of endometrial cancer have elucidated four distinct molecular subtypes with different biology and prognosis which should facilitate the development of treatments tailored to disease-specific subgroups. To date, some molecular-targeted agents have shown interesting clinical activity in the recurrent setting, but no targeted therapies are approved for endometrial cancer. Novel pan-PI3K, AKT, and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors are being investigated with early signs of activity, but there are concerns about tolerability and toxicity in this often elderly patient population with comorbidities. The development of anti-angiogenic therapies, PARP inhibitors, and immunotherapies, alone or in combinations, appear to be promising strategies. This paper will describe the current evidence supporting the efficacy of molecular-targeted agents already tested in the treatment of metastatic and recurrent EC, and provide some insights on emerging data related to novel-targeted therapies.

### Chemotherapy for endometrial cancer in adjuvant and advanced disease settings [^112jJFbS]. The Oncologist (2016). Low credibility.

Level I evidence exists for use of adjuvant chemotherapy in stage IIIC endometrial cancer (positive lymph nodes), although results of randomized trials have varied. Chemotherapy is also often recommended for high-risk subsets of stage I disease, such as serous carcinomas, although prospective trial data to validate this practice are lacking. Carboplatin plus paclitaxel is the current standard regimen, based on extrapolation of data from the metastatic setting. Several clinical trials have compared adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy alone to a combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy with mixed results. One of the largest of these trials, Postoperative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Carcinoma 3 (PORTEC-3), has completed accrual and is awaiting data maturation. Metastatic disease is not curable. For tumors of low-grade endometrioid histology with a prolonged time to recurrence, endocrine therapy with a progestin-based regimen is appropriate. Chemotherapy will be used in most other cases, and the standard first-line regimen is carboplatin and paclitaxel. Few chemotherapy agents have been shown to produce meaningful response rates in the second-line setting. Molecularly targeted therapies such as mTOR inhibitors and antiangiogenic agents including bevacizumab have been studied but their role in the armamentarium remains uncertain.

Implications For Practice

Following surgical resection and staging for endometrial cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel can be administered to patients with a high risk for recurrence. This includes patients with stage IIIC disease with positive lymph nodes, and high-risk subsets of stage I disease such as serous carcinomas. In the metastatic setting, endocrine therapy can be considered, particularly for patients with lower-grade disease and a prolonged time to recurrence. Combined therapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel is the standard of care used for front-line chemotherapy. Antiangiogenic agents are clearly active, but how they should be integrated into treatment is not yet determined. Immunotherapy is a promising direction for patients with mismatch repair-deficient or polymerase ε-mutated tumors.

Endometrial cancer is one of the gynaecological cancers that carries good overall prognosis because it is often detected at early stages of disease. The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics replaced clinical staging with surgical staging in 1988 and updated the system in 2009. Controversies remain regarding the recommended screening protocol for women with a high risk of endometrial cancer, the role and benefit of retroperitoneal lymph-node dissection, the necessity of ovarian resection, the benefit and type of adjuvant radiation therapy, and the safety of hormone-replacement therapy after treatment. This article reviews the available evidence for optimum management of endometrial cancer and how management strategies can be applied in Asian countries with different levels of health-care resource availability and economic development.

### Imfinzi, keytruda approved for some endometrial cancers… [^114kLBAS]. NCI (2024). Medium credibility.

More Immunotherapy Options Approved for Treating Endometrial Cancer, by Sharon Reynolds The Food and Drug Administration has approved three new immunotherapy options for people with advanced endometrial cancer. The approvals are for drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors. The first approval, announced on June 14, is for durvalumab given in combination with chemotherapy to treat people with advanced endometrial cancer whose tumors have certain genetic changes that cause them to have a characteristic known as mismatch repair deficiency. Tumors that are dMMR are particularly susceptible to immunotherapy. The second approval, announced on June 17, is for pembrolizumab given along with chemotherapy, regardless of whether tumors are dMMR. And on August 1, FDA approved dostarlimab plus chemotherapy for people with advanced endometrial cancers regardless of dMMR status.

Dostarlimab had previously been approved, in 2023, for advanced endometrial cancers that are dMMR. Under the approvals, the combinations can be used as an initial therapy or as treatment for cancer that has come back after certain previous treatments. In large clinical trials, the addition of these immunotherapy drugs to chemotherapy led to improvements in progression-free survival, which is how long people live without their cancer growing. The most recent data from the clinical trial that led to the dostarlimab approval, called RUBY, showed that it improved overall survival for people with dMMR tumors and suggested it may improve it for people whose tumors are not dMMR. "The fact that three clinical trials strongly confirmed that adding an immune checkpoint inhibitor to standard chemotherapy markedly improves outcomes for patients with mismatch repair–deficient endometrial cancer is a huge step forward, " said Elise Kohn, M. D., of NCI's Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, who was involved with the trial that led to pembrolizumab's approval for this use. "For people with mismatch repair–deficient endometrial cancer, the data demonstrate unequivocally that the addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor to standard chemotherapy is beneficial, " regardless of which drug is used, Dr. Kohn said. Most people with endometrial cancer, however, do not have dMMR tumors, said Shannon Westin, M. D., of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, who led the durvalumab trial. And although both pembrolizumab and dostarlimab have been found to improve progression-free survival in people with these so-called proficient MMR tumors, Dr. Westin continued, the improvements are "not as profound" as they are in people with dMMR tumors. This means that the decision to use either drug in people with advanced pMMR endometrial cancer is less straightforward, Dr.

Westin explained, noting that researchers are trying to find ways to identify which people with pMMR tumors might be the best candidates to get one of these drugs. Long treatment, long tumor responses When endometrial cancer is found early, it can often be cured with surgery alone or surgery followed by radiation or chemotherapy. However, the prognosis is poor for people with endometrial cancer that has spread or returned after initial treatment. FDA had already approved pembrolizumab and dostarlimab to be used alone to treat people with advanced dMMR endometrial cancer that worsened after initial chemotherapy. The approvals were based on clinical trials in which both drugs improved progression-free survival. Those positive results led researchers to test these drugs as part of the initial treatment of people with advanced endometrial cancer.

### An analysis of appropriate delivery of postoperative radiation therapy for endometrial cancer using the RAND / UCLA appropriateness method: executive summary [^115CbDZL]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Endometrial cancer is a common disease with increasing incidence and yet considerable controversy regarding optimal therapy. Although randomized trials address many important questions regarding radiation, uncertainty remains because of patient and disease heterogeneity and numerous potential treatment strategies. The most favorable stage I patients are often cured with surgery alone. For higher risk early-stage patients, vaginal brachytherapy or external beam radiation therapy (RT) may be considered to improve local control, and systemic therapy can potentially address occult distant metastasis risk. For advanced-stage patients, the optimal regimen and sequencing has yet to be determined and includes chemotherapy and RT.

Reflecting the complexity of endometrial cancer treatment decisions and ambiguity of available evidence for many questions, ASTRO applied the RAND/University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method to assess clinical scenarios and provide management recommendations. Although this analysis and ASTRO's clinical practice guideline on endometrial cancerfocus on the same disease site, they differ in their clinical questions, methodologies for assessing the literature, level of evidence considered, and subsequently their recommendations. This executive summary briefly discusses areas of concordance and divergence between the Guideline and the RAND/UCLA analysis and highlights where the analysis explores issues not covered in the Guideline. The full analysis results are reported in the Supplemental Materials.

### Endometrial cancer: molecular markers and management of advanced stage disease [^117SbJ9U]. Gynecologic Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Endometrial cancer is the most prevalent gynecologic cancer in the United States. Over the last 10 years, death rates from endometrial cancer have been rising about 1.4% per year. Traditionally endometrial cancer treatment has been driven by stage and histology. Recent studies have, however, shown that cancers of the same stage and histology have very distinct molecular and genomic profiles. Translational research is progressing rapidly and endometrial cancer-specific precision medicine is evolving. The first tissue agnostic therapy based on the molecular profile of the tumor was approved by the FDA this year. The approval of immune checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1), for all solid tumors with defective DNA mismatch repair, could benefit 20–30% of patients with advanced endometrial cancer. Other genomic changes and molecular markers in endometrial cancer, such as hormone receptor status, could lead to more tailored therapy in the future. Pre-clinical and clinical investigations of targeted therapies suggest efficacy for some agents. Single agent targeted therapies, however, have modest activity. Identifying biomarkers that effectively determine response to targeted therapy remains a challenge. The next generation of clinical trials will focus on novel combinations and how to best utilize the advances that have been made in sequencing technology and bioinformatics. Although there is currently an immense body of data and many options for obtaining genomic characteristics of endometrial cancer, how to interpret and utilize this data is still being explored. This review will summarize the important trials that have led to the treatment options we have for advanced and/or recurrent endometrial cancer and discuss the important studies that have led to a better understanding of the distinctive molecular and genomic profiles within endometrial cancer. We will review the current status of biomarker-driven targeted therapy in endometrial cancer and the rationale behind ongoing clinical trials that are utilizing novel targeted agents.

### Advances in the management of endometrial cancer [^111JLHbk]. BMJ (2025). Excellent credibility.

Endometrial cancer is now the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, with incidence rates rising globally. Treatment strategies have historically been focused on a combination of surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy based primarily on histology and extent of tumor. Advances in the evaluation and treatment of endometrial cancers are occurring at a rapid pace, with a new focus on genomic profiling and targeted therapies. Surgical removal of the tumor remains the mainstay of therapy, but adjuvant treatments are a shifting paradigm. In the realm of gynecologic malignancies, endometrial cancer leads in the evolution of precision medicine. The ability to analyze patients, tumors, and therapy has increased over the past 10 years. Gaps in knowledge about racial and ethnic disparities, as well as pre-invasive disease prevention, are closing. This review describes the advances in endometrial cancer with a focus on people at risk, molecular classification, and modern therapeutic strategies.

### Immune checkpoint inhibitors in gynecologic oncology: current status and perspectives [^112iw8VL]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 Future perspectives

Molecular characterization in endometrial cancer has led to paradigm shifts, establishing immunotherapy as one of the primary treatment options. The MMRd‐GREEN trial of the RAINBO program compares adjuvant radiotherapy plus durvalumab to radiotherapy alone in patients with Stage II or III dMMR endometrial cancer. The KEYNOTE‐C93 and DOMENICA studies are ongoing to determine the possibility of substituting chemotherapy with pembrolizumab and dostarlimab monotherapy, respectively, as first‐line treatments for dMMR expressing advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. In addition to immunotherapy, ongoing studies on oral selinexor, as well as antibody drug‐conjugates targeting HER2, folate receptor α, and TROP2, are expected to bring significant advancements in the treatment of endometrial cancer.

### Endometrial cancer [^1134mXY5]. Lancet (2022). Excellent credibility.

Endometrial cancer is the most common gynaecological cancer in high income countries and its incidence is rising globally. Although an ageing population and fewer benign hysterectomies have contributed to this trend, the growing prevalence of obesity is the major underlying cause. Obesity poses challenges for diagnosis and treatment and more research is needed to offer primary prevention to high-risk women and to optimise endometrial cancer survivorship. Early presentation with postmenopausal bleeding ensures most endometrial cancers are cured by hysterectomy but those with advanced disease have a poor prognosis. Minimally invasive surgical staging and sentinel-lymph-node biopsy provides a low morbidity alternative to historical surgical management without compromising oncological outcomes. Adjuvant radiotherapy reduces loco-regional recurrence in intermediate-risk and high-risk cases. Advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of endometrial cancer have paved the way for targeted chemotherapeutic strategies, and clinical trials will establish their benefit in adjuvant, advanced, and recurrent disease settings in the coming years.

### Endometrial cancer: a Society of Gynecologic Oncology evidence-based review and recommendations [^1163r1zq]. Gynecologic Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2014, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology's Clinical Practice Committee published a clinical update reviewing the treatment of women with endometrial cancer. At that time, there had been significant advances in the diagnosis, work-up, surgical management, and available treatment options allowing for more optimal care of affected women. Despite these advances, the incidence of endometrial cancer as well as the deaths attributable to the disease have continued to rise; from 1987 to 2014 there has been a 75% increase in cases and almost 300% increase in endometrial cancer deaths. Fortunately, since then, there has been progress in the treatment of patients with endometrial cancer with increased utilization of molecular pathology, greater understanding of genetic predisposition, enhanced methods for lymph node assessment, a broader understanding of the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy, and a more efficient approach to survivorship and surveillance. The purpose of this document is to present a comprehensive review of this progress.

Manuscript Development Process

The authors reviewed the available evidence, contributed to the development of this manuscript, provided critical review of the guidelines, and finalized the manuscript recommendations. The review was also presented to and approved by the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Clinical Practice Committee, SGO Publications Committee, and the SGO board members prior to submission for publication. The recommendations for this manuscript were developed by a panel of gynecologic oncologists who were members of the SGO Clinical Practice and Education Committees. Panelists reviewed and considered evidence from current uterine cancer literature. The terminology used in these guidelines was adopted from the ASCCP management guidelines [1] using a two-part rating system to grade the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence (Table 1). The rating for each recommendation is given in parentheses.

### Translating biological insights into improved management of endometrial cancer [^116uqhuW]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynaecological cancer among women in high-income countries, with both incidence and mortality continuing to increase. The complexity of the management of patients with EC has evolved with greater comprehension of the underlying biology and heterogeneity of this disease. With a growing number of novel therapeutic agents available, emerging treatment regimens seem to have the potential to help to address the concerning trends in EC-related mortality. In this Review, we describe the epidemiology, histopathology and molecular classification of EC as well as the role of the new (2023) International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) staging model. Furthermore, we provide an overview of disease management in the first-line and recurrent disease settings. With increasing use of molecular profiling and updates in treatment paradigms, we also summarize new developments in this rapidly changing treatment landscape.

### Endometrial cancer: molecular classification and future treatments [^115xmXEN]. BMJ Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Conclusion

The future treatments for endometrial cancer are very promising. The development of molecular analysis combined with novel agents and new drug classes have revolutionised precision medicine for patients with endometrial cancer. Uterine risk factors have been used for decades to stratify risk and recommended treatments. Whether molecular analysis will replace or supplement this risk stratification model is unknown. However, our ability to treat patients with more options is clearly improving based on this knowledge.

Questions for future research

Should molecular analysis be performed on all patients wtih endometrial cancer in the upfront or recurrent setting or both?
Should all future trials on endometrial cancer incorporate biomarker driven molecular evaluation?
Is molecular classification of endometrial cancer into the four known subclassifications an adequate evaluation?

Patient involvement

Patients and the public were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or dissemination plans of this research.

Treatment and survival

Among patients with early stage (stage I) uterine corpus cancer, 69% undergo hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy without chemotherapy or radiation (Figure 16), with ovarian preservation possible for a select group of premenopausal women who have early disease (i.e. stage IA). Most patients with stage II disease (64%) undergo surgery alone or with radiation, whereas the majority of patients with stage III disease (71%) undergo surgery and receive chemotherapy with or without radiation (Figure 16). Black women are more likely to receive chemotherapy after surgery, with or without radiation, for both stage I and stage II disease (Figure 16), likely reflecting the higher proportion of nonendometrioid disease, which is generally more aggressive than endometrioid disease. When stratified by disease subtype, receipt of guideline‐concordant therapy in hospital‐based studies was lower among Black women than among White women for endometrioid subtypesbut was similar for nonendometrioid cancers. However, population‐based studies of patients aged 65 years and older have reported that Black patients are more likely than White patients to experience treatment delays and less likely to receive adjuvant therapy regardless of histology.

For patients with advanced disease who are not candidates for surgery, conventional treatment options have included external‐beam radiation therapy, brachytherapy, hormone therapy, and chemotherapy with carboplatin or paclitaxel. Immunotherapy now represents a standard component of first‐line therapy based on contemporary clinical trials demonstrating that the addition of an anti–PD‐1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to platinum‐based chemotherapy improves outcomes in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. For patients with metastatic disease who are not candidates for first‐line chemoimmunotherapy or who experience disease progression, mismatch repair status can guide further treatment selection. Immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy may be considered for tumors with deficient mismatch repair; whereas the combination of lenvatinib, a multikinase inhibitor, and pembrolizumab is recommended for tumors with proficient mismatch repair.

### Treatment considerations in advanced endometrial cancer [^112n2sor]. Current Oncology Reports (2007). Low credibility.

An estimated 39,080 new cases of endometrial cancer will occur in the United States in 2007, along with 7400 deaths associated with this disease. Fortunately, with surgical staging, the majority of women are diagnosed with disease at an early stage and are often completely treated with a hysterectomy alone. However, 13% of women who are surgically staged have stage III disease, and 3% to 13% have stage IV disease identified at that time. Over the past 10 years, the role of cytoreductive surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy in endometrial cancer have been actively investigated. This review outlines and summarizes some of these important developments and findings.

Endometrial carcinoma — suspected or gross cervical involvement is evaluated with cervical biopsy or pelvis MRI (if not previously done), after which primary treatment branches by surgical candidacy. Under suitable for primary surgery, operative choices include TH (preferred) or radical hysterectomy (RH) and BSO and surgical staging, and adjuvant pathways are listed as adjuvant treatment for surgically staged: Stage I (ENDO-4), Stage II (ENDO-5), and Stage III–IV (ENDO-6). For patients not suitable for primary surgery, options include EBRT ± brachytherapy (category 2B) or systemic therapy (category 2B). Following EBRT ± brachytherapy, subsequent options include TH/BSO and surgical staging 4–12 weeks post RT or surgical resection, if rendered operable, 4–12 weeks post RT, or definitive RT if inoperable. Note: All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by interval debulking surgery in patients with serous endometrial cancer with transperitoneal spread (stage IV): a new preferred treatment? [^1164yWMc]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

The clinical decision making for advanced stage endometrial cancer should preferably take morbidity attributed to primary debulking surgery into consideration. Endometrial cancer also frequently affects old and fragile women. Balancing between chemotherapy (without surgery) and aggressive cytoreductive surgery, when sensitivity to chemotherapy is not known, the use of NACT followed by IDS might be a valuable option. This study showed that this strategy is a valuable alternative as we were able to identify chemoresistant disease (and hence poor candidates for any surgery) and, given the high rate of complete cytoreduction, a low complication rate. These results confirm earlier case reports on this subject. It appears from Table 3 that all five previously published cases had CR or PR based on imaging studies and all had no residual disease after IDS.

The response to chemotherapy as determined by a histopathological assessment of the tumour is identified as a new prognostic marker in endometrial cancer. In patients with ovarian cancer undergoing IDS,) assessed four features of tumour necrosis (necrosis, fibrosis, macrophage infiltration and tumour-induced inflammation). They concluded that a higher composite pathological tumour response score was significantly correlated with a prolonged progression-free survival (P = 0.0016) and OS (P = 0.017). In contrast, could not confirm this correlation between histopathological features and OS. Residual tumour size was the only criterion significantly correlated with treatment response and OS. In the absence of any data on this in endometrial cancer, we used the same criteria as that used for ovarian cancer. In this study, a histopathological score indicative of chemosensitivity was significantly correlated with recurrence and OS. Especially, tumour infiltration and necrosis were related to better PFS and OS.

In current practice, patients with stage IV endometrial cancer receive either no surgery (systemic treatment only) or primary debulking surgery. An overview of studies exploring the latter is presented in Table 4. From this table, it seems that PFS and OS depend on the amount of residual disease and that patients without residual tumour have a better outcome. In addition, 28–48% of patients were unable to have optimal cytoreduction and 18–38% were considered inoperable. In contrast, this study revealed 24 patients (80%) who underwent optimal cytoreduction (R ≤ 1 cm), of whom 22 (92%) were with no residual tumour. Only 4 (14%) patients were considered inoperable. The median PFS of 13 months corresponds to that of previous reports.

### Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of gynecologic cancer [^1167o1Kh]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2023). Medium credibility.

Advanced gynecologic cancers have historically lacked effective treatment options. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cervical cancer and endometrial cancer, offering durable responses for some patients. In addition, many immunotherapy strategies are under investigation for the treatment of earlier stages of disease or in other gynecologic cancers, such as ovarian cancer and rare gynecologic tumors. While the integration of ICIs into the standard of care has improved outcomes for patients, their use requires a nuanced understanding of biomarker testing, treatment selection, patient selection, response evaluation and surveillance, and patient quality of life considerations, among other topics. To address this need for guidance, the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) convened a multidisciplinary panel of experts to develop a clinical practice guideline. The Expert Panel drew on the published literature as well as their own clinical experience to develop evidence- and consensus-based recommendations to provide guidance to cancer care professionals treating patients with gynecologic cancer.

### ESGO-ESTRO-ESP guidelines for the management of patients with endometrial carcinoma: update 2025 [^116nxBgT]. The Lancet: Oncology (2025). High credibility.

In 2023, based on advances in the understanding of the pathological and molecular features of endometrial carcinoma, an updated International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system was published, aiming to better define prognostic groups and identify relevant treatment subgroups by including factors reflecting tumour biology (histological subtypes, lymphovascular space invasion, and molecular classification) alongside refinements of anatomical factors (peritoneal carcinomatosis and lymph node metastasis). As part of its mission to improve the quality of care for people with gynaecological cancers, the European Society of Gynaecological Oncology (ESGO), European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO), and the European Society of Pathology (ESP) updated the ESGO-ESTRO-ESP evidence-based guidelines published in 2021 by incorporating this revised FIGO staging and the large body of new evidence addressing the management of endometrial carcinoma. The development process of these guidelines was based on a systematic literature review and critical appraisal process involving an international multidisciplinary development group consisting of 30 experts from relevant disciplines (gynaecological oncology, radiation oncology, medical oncology, and pathology). A patient representative was also included. Before publication, the guidelines were reviewed by 225 independent international practitioners in cancer care delivery and three patient representatives from Asia, Europe, North Africa, North America, the Middle East, and South America to ensure a global perspective. These guidelines comprehensively cover diagnosis, management, follow-up, and patient education. Management includes surgical and adjuvant therapy according to the stage of the disease, and metastatic and recurrent disease. The management algorithms and the principles of radiotherapy and pathological evaluation are also defined.

### The role of radiotherapy in endometrial cancer: current evidence and trends [^115BG4B4]. Current Oncology Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Adjuvant treatment of patients with endometrial cancer is tailored to clinical-pathological prognostic factors. Pelvic radiation therapy for stage I endometrial cancer (EC) provides a highly significant improvement of local control, but without survival advantage. Low-risk EC patients have a very favorable prognosis, and should be observed after surgery. Use of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) is limited to patients with high-intermediate or high-risk factors. For those with high-intermediate risk features, vaginal brachytherapy alone provides excellent vaginal control with less morbidity and better quality of life than pelvic external beam RT (EBRT). For patients with stage I–III EC with high-risk features, the use of adjuvant chemotherapy alone has not shown survival benefit as compared to pelvic EBRT. A first trial comparing pelvic EBRT with or without adjuvant chemotherapy has shown better progression-free survival with combined therapy. Current ongoing trials are exploring the role of combined RT and chemotherapy, compared to chemotherapy or RT alone.

Immunotherapy for the treatment of endometrial cancer

Endometrial cancer was the sixth most common cancer in women in 2020. As the most common form of uterine cancer, incidence rates have been on the rise in the US for many years, with an estimated 65,000 new cases and 12,500 deaths in 2021. In developed regions, diagnosis often occurs at an early/localized stage, which is associated with a favorable prognosis with the 5-year OS rates for The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IA and IB of 77%–90%. Advanced-stage endometrial cancer, however, has historically lacked effective treatments and the 5-year OS for stage IV disease is around 20%. Metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancer has historically been treated with cytoreductive surgery, followed by systemic therapy, often multi-agent platinum plus taxane-based chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. Second- or later-line options for advanced disease have been limited to rechallenge, which generally offers moderate responses with low durability.

A percentage of endometrial tumors have high mutational burdens and IC infiltration, characteristics of immunologically 'hot' tumors. ICIs have significantly improved outcomes for other 'hot' tumors, such as melanoma and NSCLC, providing rationale for investigation of their efficacy in endometrial cancer as well.

Histology, molecular subtypes, and immunotherapy biomarkers for endometrial cancer

Endometrial tumors are commonly classified into two major histological subtypes: endometrioid, which is the most common and often lower-grade, and non-endometrioid, which includes serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma, and others, all of which are classified as high grade. In addition to staging and histology, endometrial cancers can also be classified by molecular features, which has important implications for immunotherapy treatment.

Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecologic malignancy, with worldwide increasing incidence and disease-associated mortality. Although most patients with EC are diagnosed with early-stage disease, systemic treatment options for patients with advanced or recurrent EC have historically been limited. EC-focused clinical trials and the ensuing therapeutic landscape have expanded since The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified 4 distinct EC subgroups associated with differential survival. This endeavor revolutionized our understanding of the genomic characterization of EC as well as molecular drivers of this heterogeneous malignancy, leading to precision oncology approaches to therapeutics and advancement in treatment options. This review describes the current status of and recent advancements in therapeutic options for patients with advanced and recurrent EC. The NCCN Guidelines for Uterine Neoplasms provide detailed recommendations regarding the diagnosis, workup, and management of EC.

### Adjuvant chemotherapy for advanced endometrial cancer [^116hhPMe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 13% of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer present with advanced stage disease (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III/IV). The standard treatment of advanced endometrial cancer consists of cytoreductive surgery followed by radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, or both. There is currently little agreement about which adjuvant treatment is the safest and most effective.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of adjuvant chemotherapy compared with radiotherapy or chemoradiation, and to determine which chemotherapy agents are most effective in women presenting with advanced endometrial cancer (FIGO stage III/IV).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Gynaecological Cancer Collaborative Review Group's Trial Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Issue 10 2013), MEDLINE and EMBASE up to November 2013. Also we searched electronic clinical trial registries for ongoing trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adjuvant chemotherapy compared with radiotherapy or chemoradiation in women with FIGO stage III and IV endometrial cancer.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors selected trials, extracted data, and assessed trials for risk of bias. Where necessary, we contacted trial investigators for relevant, unpublished data. We pooled data using the random-effects model in Review Manager (RevMan) software.

Main Results

We included four multicentre RCTs involving 1269 women with primary FIGO stage III/IV endometrial cancer. We considered the trials to be at low to moderate risk of bias. All participants received primary cytoreductive surgery. Two trials, evaluating 620 women (83% stage III, 17% stage IV), compared adjuvant chemotherapy with adjuvant radiotherapy; one trial evaluating 552 women (88% stage III, 12% stage IV) compared two chemotherapy regimens (cisplatin/doxorubicin/paclitaxel (CDP) versus cisplatin/doxorubicin (CD) treatment) in women who had all undergone adjuvant radiotherapy; and one trial contributed no data. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was longer with adjuvant chemotherapy compared with adjuvant radiotherapy (OS: hazard ratio (HR) 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.99, I² = 22%; and PFS: HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.92, I² = 0%). Sensitivity analysis using adjusted and unadjusted OS data, gave similar results. In subgroup analyses, the effects on survival in favour of chemotherapy were not different for stage III and IV, or stage IIIA and IIIC (tests for subgroup differences were not significant and I² = 0%). This evidence was of moderate quality. Data from one trial showed that women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy were more likely to experience haematological and neurological adverse events and alopecia, and more likely to discontinue treatment (33/194 versus 6/202; RR 5.73, 95% CI 2.45 to 13.36), than those receiving adjuvant radiotherapy. There was no statistically significant difference in treatment-related deaths between the chemotherapy and radiotherapy treatment arms (8/309 versus 5/311; Risk Ratio (RR) 1.67, 95% CI 0.55 to 5.00). There was no clear difference in PFS between intervention groups in the one trial that compared CDP versus CD (552 women; HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.17). We considered this evidence to be of moderate quality. Mature OS data from this trial were not yet available. Severe haematological and neurological adverse events occurred more frequently with CDP than CD. We found no trials to include of adjuvant chemotherapy versus chemoradiation in advanced endometrial cancer; however we identified one ongoing trial of this comparison.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate quality evidence that chemotherapy increases survival time after primary surgery by approximately 25% relative to radiotherapy in stage III and IV endometrial cancer. There is limited evidence that it is associated with more adverse effects. There is some uncertainty as to whether triplet regimens offer similar survival benefits over doublet regimens in the long-term. Further research is needed to determine which chemotherapy regimen(s) are the most effective and least toxic, and whether the addition of radiotherapy further improves outcomes. A large trial evaluating the benefits and risks of adjuvant chemoradiation versus chemotherapy in advanced endometrial cancer is ongoing.

### Treatment of early stage high-risk endometrioid-type endometrial cancer and patterns of disease relapse: a retrospective analysis [^116CbFqa]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

In contrast to local disease relapses, where various salvage options of radiation therapy, systemic therapy or surgery are available with relatively high rates of disease control, distant disease relapses pose more management challenges and many patients are left with only limited treatment options, mostly in the palliative setting. This further supports the use of effective chemotherapy in adjuvant treatment in this particular patient population to further reduce the rate of distant recurrences. However, in the absence of level I evidence from randomized controlled trials and conflicting results on the use of chemotherapy in the early stage high-risk group, the routine use of chemotherapy cannot be recommended for all early stage high-risk patients.

Multiple studies have recently highlighted the heterogeneous nature of endometrial cancer that are both prognostic and predictive of response to treatment. The Cancer Genome Atlas in their comprehensive analysis of 373 endometrial cancer has characterized gene mutations and molecular markers that carry potential therapeutic implications. In their analysis, 4 mutation classes have been identified: POLE (ultramuted), microsatellite instability (MSI) (hypermutated), copy-number low (endometrioid), and copy-number high (serous-like). Bosse and colleagues, using this molecular classification, have investigated survival outcomes of grade 3 endometrioid-type endometrial cancers and has identified the POLE mutation to be associated with better prognosis than the p53 abnormal, loss of mismatch repair protein expression (MMRd), and no specific molecular profile groups. In addition, several other biomarkers and their molecular pathways, including HER2/neu, ARID1A, FGFR2, CTNNB1, and PIK3CA pathway, have been identified as potential therapeutic targets in endometrial cancer. Pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint programmed cell death protein 1 inhibitor commonly used to treat metastatic lung cancer with positive programmed cell death protein 1 mutation, has been shown to be safe and effective in treatment of advanced endometrial cancer, and the drug has been granted an accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval for patients with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors, including endometrial cancer, that are MSI-high or MMRd (the approval has been extended to patients who are not MSI-high or MMRd recently). More importantly, the PORTEC-4a trial currently in its recruitment phase is investigating individualized adjuvant treatment in high-intermediate-risk endometrial cancer patients with a specific molecular-integrated risk profile based on the 4 aforementioned mutations. We remain hopeful that the recent rapid advancement in the molecular genomics of endometrial cancer can provide guidance on selecting the right patients for appropriate adjuvant therapy and potentially avoiding unnecessary treatments and related toxicity in the early stage high-risk patients with endometrial cancer.

Future treatments

Treatment for primary adjuvant and recurrent endometrial cancer is in an era of rapid advancements. Additional practice changing regimens have already been conducted, with treatments such as checkpoint inhibition using single agent immunotherapy, and combination strategies. By far, immunotherapy has resulted in the greatest shift in treatment over the past decade. In addition to responding to a highly effective drug class, MMR genes also have a specific biomarker. Current clinical trials require inclusive molecular analysis as we shift to care tailored to tumours and patients.

Future treatments, based on open clinical trials, are largely reliant on molecular analysis (table 1). Immunotherapy has a large role in these investigations in trying to optimise the timing of this treatment, as well as determining the role of using the treatment over again. Furthermore, there are currently no approved maintenance treatments in endometrial cancer. As newer agents are developed, maintenance treatment is seeing early clinical successes. Finally, as newer drugs are in development, we are building on the range of available treatment options for recurrent or advanced disease.

Endometrial carcinoma is the most common gynecologic malignancy and the fourth most prevalent cancer in women in the modern world. Despite a relatively high chance of surgical cure, for patients with advanced or recurrent disease there are few therapeutic options. Angiogenesis has been extensively studied ever since vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was discovered in the 1980s. Several clinical trials of anti-angiogenic therapy in endometrial carcinoma have been conducted, with mixed results, and many researchers have tried to determine prognostic and therapeutic biomarkers. Recent trials, which shed new light on possible treatment biomarkers and efficacious combination therapies, are reviewed in this text. While we are still far from effectively tailoring anti-angiogenic treatment to each patient, these data have provided valuable insight and have put us on track for the discovery of novel opportunities for angiogenesis therapy in endometrial carcinoma.

### Radiation therapy for endometrial cancer: an American Society for Radiation Oncology clinical practice guideline [^115y3fAa]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Endometrial cancer — guideline scope focuses on the adjuvant management of endometrial cancer and emphasizes the effect that uterine risk factors and disease stage, surgical staging procedures, and molecular tumor profiling have on adjuvant therapy. This guideline discusses the indications for adjuvant VBT, EBRT, and systemic therapy and includes sequencing of these therapies, as well as the effect that surgical nodal staging procedures and molecular tumor profiling decisions may have regarding adjuvant therapy. Determining which patients benefit from adjuvant therapy in endometrioid carcinoma requires consideration of patient and uterine risk factors including age, tumor histology, grade, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), and tumor stage. The details and recommendations regarding primary surgical management of endometrial cancer are outside the focus of this guideline, and the guideline also does not address endometrial cancers that are metastatic, inoperable, or recurrent, nor management of nonepithelial histologies.

### Treatment options for advanced endometrial carcinoma [^115rfHd7]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Endometrial carcinoma is the most common malignancy of the female reproductive tract. Most cases are diagnosed at an early stage due to the appearance of symptoms such as postmenopausal bleeding. However, endometrial carcinoma carries a poor prognosis when it recurs after previous definitive treatment or when diagnosed at an advanced stage. Here, treatment options for advanced endometrial carcinoma are evaluated.

Methods

Literature review was performed to determine current therapy options, with a focus on the treatment landscape for women with recurrent, advanced, or metastatic disease.

Results

Combination chemotherapy is being used more frequently as first-line treatment of advanced disease, consisting of cisplatin/doxorubicin/paclitaxel, if tolerated, or the doublet of carboplatin/paclitaxel. Options following disease progression after first-line treatment are extremely limited, particularly with the increasing use of active agents in the adjuvant setting. Fortunately, several new cytotoxic and biologic therapies appear promising for women who have progressed on first-line treatment.

Conclusions

Clinical trials are planned to further explore how to best incorporate novel agents into the current treatment algorithm with the aim to improve the options in both first- and second-line treatments for women with endometrial adenocarcinomas.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® management of recurrent endometrial cancer [^113Wogxu]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

In women with endometrial carcinoma (EC), tumor recurrences tend to occur in the 2- to 3-year period following surgical staging. Management of disease recurrence in EC poses significant challenges. These patients represent a heterogenous group where histologic subtypes, previous adjuvant management, interval since completion of adjuvant therapy, and size and site(s) of disease recurrence all have important implications on salvage therapies and prognosis. No randomized controlled trials have been published to determine optimal management in this group of patients. An expert panel was convened to reach consensus on the most appropriate management options in this group of patients.

Methods

The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Results

Five clinical variants were developed to address common scenarios in the management of women with recurrent EC. Group members reached consensus on the appropriateness of specific evaluation and treatment approaches with numerical ratings.

Conclusions

In combining available medical literature and expert opinions, this manuscript may serve as an aid for other practitioners in the appropriate management of women with recurrent EC.

### Contemporary management of endometrial cancer [^115Ab6ic]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

The treatment of endometrial cancer has changed substantially in the past decade with the introduction of a new staging system and surgical approaches accompanied by novel adjuvant therapies. Primary surgical treatment is the mainstay of therapy but the effectiveness and extent of lymphadenectomy has been challenged, and its acceptance as a routine procedure varies by country. The role of radiation has evolved and chemotherapy has been incorporated, either alone or combined with radiation, to treat the many patients in whom cancer recurs because of a tumour outside the originally radiated pelvic and lower abdominal area. Use of traditional adjuvant chemotherapeutics has been challenged in clinical trials of new agents with improved side-effect profiles. Novel agents and targeted therapies are being investigated. Research into genetic susceptibility to endometrial cancer and the potential genetic aberrations that might translate into therapeutic interventions continues to increase. Substantial global variability in the treatment of endometrial cancer has led to examination of long-accepted norms, which has resulted in rapidly changing standards. International cooperation in clinical trials will hasten progress in treatment of this ubiquitous cancer.

### Promising novel therapies for the treatment of endometrial cancer [^113V1QLN]. Gynecologic Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

To discuss the novel agents which are being developed for the treatment of advanced and recurrent endometrial carcinoma and to review other molecular targets that may be interesting in the treatment of this disease. While the majority of women with endometrial cancer enjoy a relatively good prognosis, the options for those women who suffer from a disease recurrence are limited and there is a need to identify novel agents.

Methods

A review of clinical trials of novel therapeutic agents and their molecular targets is provided. In addition, a review of the current literature on other potential molecular targets for endometrial cancer was performed.

Results

Several phase II trials of novel agents, both alone and in combination with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy, have been completed or are nearing completion. It appears that the targeted agents may have the most efficacy in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy or in a multi-targeted agent approach.

Conclusions

Chemotherapy offers the opportunity for a meaningful response rate in women with endometrial cancer, but the responses are often short lived and cure is uncommon in the setting of recurrent disease. The recent increase in molecular targets has led to the availability of many novel therapies. Determining how these agents are to be used, alone or in combination with "standard" therapies, needs to be defined and translational studies are needed to develop rational combinations of these novel agents before we can move into clinical trials.

12 STAGE IV

Optimal management in women with Stage IV endometrial cancer with intraperitoneal disease only may include cytoreductive surgery, which is associated with superior overall survival outcome, especially when the metastatic sites are intra‐abdominal (peritoneum, omentum). In such advanced disease, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is also an option, particularly if postoperative morbidity is considered likely and/or ascites is present. A recent observational study including 102 patients showed that interval debulking surgery can be considered regardless of histologic subtype. In this population, progression‐free survival and overall survival depend on the amount of residual disease and the aim should be to leave no residual tumor. After surgery, platinum‐based chemotherapy should be considered, based on the trials cited above. Patients with evidence of extra‐abdominal metastases are usually managed with systemic platinum‐based chemotherapy, or hormonal therapy if grade 1 and/or receptor positive.

As neoadjuvant chemotherapy is the treatment of choice in advanced‐stage disease, as well as in relapsed disease, several studies have investigated the optimal combinations of chemotherapeutic agents that represent the most effective neoadjuvant therapy for Stage IV endometrial cancer patients. As the combination of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel (TAP)and carboplatin and paclitaxel have been shown to be most effective, these have been the most studied. The former, however, is much more toxic and resulted in treatment‐related deaths.

The carboplatin‐paclitaxel doublet has been tested in several Phase 2 studies in advanced‐stage or relapsed disease, demonstrating a response rate of 65%–75% and progression‐free survival of about 14 months. The results of the GOG‐0209 trial, a noninferiority trial in 1381 women comparing the combination of doxorubicin, cisplatin, and paclitaxel (TAP) with G‐CSF versus carboplatin and paclitaxel, showed that the carboplatin and paclitaxel doublet is noninferior to TAP. Better tolerability profile of carboplatin‐paclitaxel has led to the recommendation of the use of carboplatin and paclitaxel as the standard for adjuvant treatment in Stage III and IV disease.

Pelvic radiotherapy in Stage IV disease is sometimes considered to provide local tumor control. Similarly, symptomatic patients with vaginal bleeding or pain from a local tumor mass, or with leg edema due to lymph node involvement, are often palliated well with pelvic radiotherapy. Palliation of brain or bone metastases can be effectively obtained with short courses (1–5 fractions) of radiotherapy.

### When and how should adjuvant radiation be used in early endometrial cancer? [^1139Si1n]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

The role of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) in early endometrial cancer is no longer clearly defined. The increased use of surgical lymph nodes staging and the perceived "lack of survival advantage" with adjuvant pelvic RT leads to a wide array of conclusions on who should be treated and if so how. The purpose of this review is 2-fold: first, to determine the scientific validity of some of the conclusions drawn about the lack of survival impact of adjuvant pelvic RT and, second, to determine which treatment option provides the best therapeutic ratio. Overall survival may not be the ideal endpoint for early-stage endometrial cancer where death more often than not is because of causes other than endometrial cancer. Observation after hysterectomy may have the best morbidity profile, yet it may not be the option with the best therapeutic ratio. Finding a suitable alternative such as intravaginal RT or using intensity-modulated radiation therapy may ultimately prove to be the option with the best therapeutic ratio. The data learned from surgical lymph nodes staging and from the 2 recent randomized trials on the role of pelvic RT in early endometrial cancer need not be ignored nor held as the final answer. Perhaps, rectal cancer should be used as an example of how an incremental use of individual adjuvant therapies, each impacting outcome little at a time, ended up improving overall survival. If we were to use the current prevailing approach in endometrial cancer for rectal cancer, patients would still be treated with surgery alone.
