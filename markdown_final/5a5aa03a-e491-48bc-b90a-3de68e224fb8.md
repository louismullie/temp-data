## Question

lipoprotein A clinical signficance

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical significance of lipoprotein(a), starting from its molecular identity and genetic architecture and moving through epidemiology, measurement, risk thresholds, and management implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the molecular structure and biosynthesis of Lp(a). Then, I should verify the genetic determinants and isoform biology. Next, I will review the causality and epidemiology across ancestries. After that, I need to assess how Lp(a) risk behaves independent of LDL-C, including thresholds. I will then examine assay and reporting issues and who to test. Finally, I will consider current and emerging therapies, special populations, and practical clinical decision-making, while double-checking where common misconceptions occur and correcting them in real time as needed.

> Let me first confirm the molecular identity because mischaracterizing the particle leads to downstream errors. Lp(a) is an LDL-like particle with a single apoB100 covalently linked via a disulfide bond to apolipoprotein(a), a highly glycosylated plasminogen-like protein enriched in kringle IV type 2 repeats; this structure confers atherogenic, inflammatory, and prothrombotic potential, in part via a high content of oxidized phospholipids and plasminogen mimicry that can impair fibrinolysis [^116FAxEM] [^11662Atq] [^115rm4hY].

> I need to check the genetic architecture next because the isoform biology largely determines circulating levels. Lp(a) concentration is predominantly genetically determined by the LPA locus, with kringle IV-2 copy number variation driving apo(a) isoform size; smaller isoforms are associated with markedly higher Lp(a) concentrations, and most individuals co-express two isoforms in a codominant fashion, with the strength of the isoform–concentration relationship varying by ancestry [^114wg62Q].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before reviewing causality and epidemiology. Multiple lines of evidence, including Mendelian randomization, large biobanks, and long-term cohorts, support that elevated Lp(a) is a causal and independent risk factor for ASCVD and calcific aortic valve disease, with risk rising approximately linearly across the distribution and meaningful excess risk typically beginning around 50 mg/dL (≈125 nmol/L) in many populations [^116FAxEM] [^115E1bGA] [^114FnPdT].

> I should confirm whether Lp(a) risk is independent of LDL-C and whether statin-mediated LDL-C lowering offsets it. Participant-level meta-analyses of statin trials demonstrate that Lp(a) and LDL-C confer additive and independent risk, and that even at very low achieved LDL-C, elevated Lp(a) continues to confer residual risk that is not fully mitigated by LDL-C lowering alone [^114YnHeg] [^1155vYha].

> Next, I will examine thresholds and risk interpretation because assay variability complicates cut-points. Although risk appears continuous, pragmatic clinical thresholds often use ≥ 50 mg/dL (≥ 125 nmol/L) to denote high Lp(a), with a gray zone between 30–50 mg/dL (75–125 nmol/L); experts advise considering assay-specific cut-offs and context, acknowledging analytical heterogeneity and population differences in distributions [^112Y9G4e] [^113GWdHh].

> Wait, let me verify measurement and reporting details, as unit confusion is a common pitfall. Best practice is to use isoform-insensitive assays and report in molar units (nmol/L) reflecting particle number; substantial inter-individual variation in cholesterol content per Lp(a) particle undermines attempts to estimate "Lp(a)-C", and consensus statements discourage adjusting LDL-C for estimated Lp(a)-C in routine practice due to inaccuracy and potential misclassification [^116uzFMy] [^112Y9G4e].

> I should double-check who ought to be tested because targeted measurement changes management. Major societies support Lp(a) measurement at least once in a lifetime in selected settings such as premature ASCVD, a family history of premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a), possible familial hypercholesterolemia, unexplained or recurrent events despite optimal LDL-C lowering, and for risk refinement at borderline to intermediate risk, with broader testing also argued to have public health value [^117UYGxr] [^112Y9G4e] [^112Hvdjh].

> Next, I will examine incremental risk prediction, since adding a marker must improve classification. Lp(a) independently improves long-term CVD risk prediction and reclassification beyond traditional scores in community cohorts, and its association with events persists regardless of inflammatory status, supporting its role as a distinct risk pathway from hs-CRP measured inflammation [^114FnPdT] [^112JHD4x].

> Let me consider management now, but I should confirm what actually changes outcomes. Currently, no therapy is approved solely to target Lp(a); guideline-concordant care prioritizes aggressive control of all modifiable risk factors including LDL-C and apoB lowering, blood pressure, glycemia, and lifestyle, with PCSK9 inhibitors providing modest Lp(a) reductions and outcome benefits that appear greater in those with higher baseline Lp(a), while lipoprotein apheresis is reserved for extreme cases; emerging antisense and siRNA therapeutics targeting apo(a) lower Lp(a) by > 70% and are in outcomes trials to test whether lowering translates to reduced events [^116FAxEM] [^113GRb1B] [^113HhNRq].

> Hmm, wait a minute, does diet reliably lower Lp(a)? Paradoxically, reductions in dietary saturated fat that beneficially lower LDL-C often increase Lp(a) modestly, whereas some hormonal and disease states move Lp(a) in predictable directions; overall, non-genetic factors exert smaller effects than genotype, so I need to ensure patients do not misinterpret diet-induced Lp(a) changes as net harm given concurrent improvements in LDL-C and global risk [^111uScVE] [^116xby5q].

> I will now examine ancestry because risk distribution and thresholds can differ by population. Black individuals tend to have the highest Lp(a) concentrations followed by South Asian, White, Hispanic, and East Asian groups, yet the per-unit risk increment appears broadly similar; therefore, clinicians should be careful with fixed cut-points, interpret values within ancestry-specific distributions when possible, and avoid under-recognizing high Lp(a) in populations with shifted medians [^113GWdHh] [^113cfHjU].

> Hold on, I should verify a frequent analytical temptation regarding LDL-C correction. At first glance, it seems logical to subtract an estimated Lp(a)-cholesterol from LDL-C to better reflect "true LDL-C", and I almost recommended doing so; but let me reconsider, because empirical data show wide inter- and intra-individual variability in Lp(a) cholesterol content, making such corrections unreliable, and consensus statements advise against LDL-C correction for Lp(a)-C in clinical practice despite research interest [^11467D6V] [^112Y9G4e].

> But wait, what about clinical scenarios with very low achieved LDL-C yet persistent events? Even with intensively lowered LDL-C, elevated Lp(a) remains a risk enhancer, supporting consideration of PCSK9 inhibitors in secondary prevention with high Lp(a), referral for apheresis in extreme phenotypes, and enrollment in trials of specific Lp(a)-lowering agents; Mendelian randomization suggests that meaningful event reduction may require large absolute Lp(a) lowering, on the order of approximately 80–85 nmol/L for a roughly 20% coronary risk reduction over five years if effects mirror LDL-C, a hypothesis now being tested prospectively [^114YnHeg] [^11662Atq] [^113GRb1B].

> To wrap up, I should confirm a practical approach. Measure Lp(a) at least once in patients with risk-enhancing contexts, interpret using assay-appropriate units with awareness of ancestry distributions, do not correct LDL-C for estimated Lp(a)-C, intensify global risk reduction with particular attention to achieving very low LDL-C and apoB, consider PCSK9 inhibitors and, in selected refractory or extreme cases, apheresis, and reassess strategy as outcomes data for apo(a)-targeted agents emerge, since elevated Lp(a) confers independent, additive risk that persists despite optimal LDL-C lowering [^117UYGxr] [^1155vYha] [^116FAxEM].

Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a **genetically determined, independent, and causal risk factor** [^116FAxEM] for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) [^111cXdW5], with risk rising continuously across the distribution [^114YnHeg]. About 20% of the global population has Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (125 nmol/L) [^116EX3Pd], a level associated with higher ASCVD and CAVS risk [^112Y9G4e] [^112Y9G4e]. Lp(a) risk is **independent of LDL-C** [^114YnHeg] and persists despite LDL-C lowering [^1155vYha], so testing is recommended at least once in adulthood [^111xsHNy] [^117UYGxr], especially in those with premature ASCVD, family history, or familial hypercholesterolemia [^115wxbB2]. Current therapies have limited effect on Lp(a) [^113GRb1B], but RNA-based agents lowering Lp(a) by > 70% are in trials [^113HhNRq]; until then, manage overall risk aggressively and consider PCSK9 inhibitors or apheresis in very high-risk patients [^115wxbB2].

---

## Structure and genetic determinants

- **Structure**: Lp(a) is an LDL-like particle with apoB-100 covalently linked to apo(a), which is homologous to plasminogen and confers proatherogenic, proinflammatory, and antifibrinolytic properties [^111cXdW5] [^116FAxEM].

- **Genetics**: Lp(a) levels are ~70–90% genetically determined [^116FAxEM], mainly by LPA kringle IV-2 copy number and SNPs; smaller apo(a) isoforms correlate with higher Lp(a) [^114wg62Q].

- **Ethnic variation**: Median Lp(a) levels differ by ancestry, highest in Black individuals, intermediate in South Asians, and lower in East Asians and Europeans [^113cfHjU] [^113GWdHh].

---

## Epidemiological evidence and clinical associations

- **ASCVD**: Elevated Lp(a) is independently associated with coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and peripheral artery disease [^115E1bGA], with a log-linear risk relationship [^114YnHeg].

- **CAVS**: High Lp(a) is causally linked to calcific aortic valve stenosis, supported by genetic and observational data [^111cXdW5] [^116FAxEM].

- **Residual risk**: Lp(a) confers risk independent of LDL-C [^114YnHeg] and persists despite intensive LDL-C lowering, including with statins [^1155vYha].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Lp(a) **promotes atherogenesis** through lipid deposition, inflammation, and oxidized phospholipids [^116FAxEM] [^11662Atq]. Apo(a) homology to plasminogen **impairs fibrinolysis**, thereby increasing thrombosis risk [^111cXdW5]. Lp(a) also **drives vascular and valvular calcification**, contributing to CAVS [^111xsHNy].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Testing**: Measure Lp(a) at least once in adulthood, especially in premature ASCVD, family history, or familial hypercholesterolemia [^117UYGxr] [^115wxbB2] [^111xsHNy].

- **Thresholds**: Lp(a) ≥ 50 mg/dL (125 nmol/L) is high risk; ≥ 180 mg/dL (430 nmol/L) confers lifetime risk similar to heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

- **Management**: Intensify overall risk reduction (LDL-C, blood pressure, lifestyle); consider PCSK9 inhibitors or apheresis in very high-risk patients [^115wxbB2] [^113GRb1B].

---

## Therapeutic strategies

Current therapies such as statins and ezetimibe have **little effect on Lp(a)** [^113GRb1B], while **PCSK9 inhibitors** reduce Lp(a) by ~20–30% [^111bo5iR] and reduce events, particularly at higher baseline Lp(a) [^113GRb1B]. Emerging **RNA-based therapies** (antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA) lower Lp(a) by **> 70%** and are in phase 3 outcomes trials [^113HhNRq] [^113GRb1B].

---

## Clinical implications and future directions

Lp(a) testing **refines risk assessment** [^114FnPdT] and guides preventive strategies [^111xsHNy]. Research needs include **standardized assays**, harmonized guidelines, and outcomes trials of **Lp(a)-lowering therapies** [^116FAxEM].

---

Elevated Lp(a) is a **causal, independent risk factor** for ASCVD and CAVS [^116FAxEM], with risk independent of LDL-C [^114YnHeg]; testing and aggressive risk management are recommended [^117UYGxr], and RNA-based therapies may soon enable targeted Lp(a) lowering [^113HhNRq].

- **Epidemiological evidence linking Lp(a) to cardiovascular risk**: Robust epidemiological, Mendelian randomization, and genome-wide association studies have established elevated Lp(a) as an independent and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Early studies focusing on White European populations first identified the association between Lp(a) and cardiovascular risk. Subsequent large-scale, multiethnic cohorts have confirmed these findings across diverse populations, highlighting the global relevance of elevated Lp(a).

Subsequently, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) and Dallas Heart Study (DHS) demonstrated that White, Black, Hispanic, and Chinese Americans with elevated Lp(a) levels had a significantly higher incidence of CHD and CVD events, independent of traditional risk factors. The case-control INTERHEART study demonstrated that while elevated Lp(a) levels confer cardiovascular risk across multiple ethnic groups, the absolute risk varies due to differences in Lp(a) distribution and the prevalence of other risk factors.

	- In addition to atherosclerotic disease, Lp(a) has emerged as an important risk factor for CAVD. The Copenhagen General Population Study provided compelling evidence linking elevated Lp(a) levels to an increased risk of aortic valve stenosis.

### Independence of lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: A participant-level meta-analysis [^114YnHeg]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels are independently associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, the relationship between Lp(a) level, LDL-C level, and ASCVD risk at different thresholds is not well defined.

- **Methods**: A participant-level meta-analysis of 27,658 participants enrolled in 6 placebo-controlled statin trials was performed to assess the association of LDL-C and Lp(a) levels with the risk of fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease events, stroke, or any coronary or carotid revascularization (ASCVD). The multivariable-adjusted association between baseline Lp(a) level and ASCVD risk was modeled continuously using generalized additive models. The association between baseline LDL-C level and ASCVD risk by baseline Lp(a) level was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models with random effects. The joint association between Lp(a) level and statin-achieved LDL-C level with ASCVD risk was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models.

- **Results**: Compared with an Lp(a) level of 5 mg/dL, increasing levels of Lp(a) were log-linearly associated with ASCVD risk in statin- and placebo-treated patients. Among statin-treated individuals, those with Lp(a) level > 50 mg/dL (≈125 nmol/L) had increased risk across all quartiles of achieved LDL-C level and absolute change in LDL-C level. Even among those with the lowest quartile of achieved LDL-C level (3.1–77.0 mg/dL), those with Lp(a) level > 50 mg/dL had greater ASCVD risk (hazard ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.06–1.79]) than those with Lp(a) level ≤ 50 mg/dL.

The findings underscore the importance of considering both Lp(a) and LDL-C levels in assessing cardiovascular risk.

### Existing and emerging strategies to lower lipoprotein(a) [^113GRb1B]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

Abundant evidence links elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) to higher cardiovascular risk, leaving clinicians with the challenge of what measures to take to mitigate Lp(a)-associated risk. Some therapies that may reduce cardiovascular risk, such as aspirin, statins, fibrates, and ezetimibe, have little effect on Lp(a) and in some cases may even increase its concentration. Other agents that reduce levels of Lp(a), such as niacin or cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, have neutral or only slightly favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes. The only currently available therapeutic approaches that lower Lp(a) and reduce cardiovascular risk are PCSK9 inhibitors and lipoprotein apheresis. For PCSK9 inhibitors, the magnitude of clinical benefit is associated with the baseline level of Lp(a) and appears to be associated with the degree of Lp(a) reduction. Antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA agents targeting apolipoprotein(a) have the potential to reduce circulating Lp(a) concentrations by more than 70%. The results of cardiovascular outcomes trials will determine whether such substantial reductions in Lp(a) are associated with meaningful clinical benefit.

### Lipoprotein(a): a genetically determined, causal, and prevalent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^116FAxEM]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2022). High credibility.

High levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], an apoB100-containing lipoprotein, are an independent and causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases through mechanisms associated with increased atherogenesis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Lp(a) is predominantly a monogenic cardiovascular risk determinant, with approximately 70% to more than 90% of interindividual heterogeneity in levels being genetically determined. The two major protein components of Lp(a) particles are apoB100 and apolipoprotein(a). Lp(a) remains a risk factor for cardiovascular disease development even in the setting of effective reduction of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoB100.

Despite its demonstrated contribution to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease burden, we presently lack standardization and harmonization of assays, universal guidelines for diagnosing and providing risk assessment, and targeted treatments to lower Lp(a). There is a clinical need to understand the genetic and biological basis for variation in Lp(a) levels and its relationship to disease in different ancestry groups. This scientific statement capitalizes on the expertise of a diverse basic science and clinical workgroup to highlight the history, biology, pathophysiology, and emerging clinical evidence in the Lp(a) field. Herein, we address key knowledge gaps and future directions required to mitigate the atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk attributable to elevated Lp(a) levels.

### Heart UK consensus statement on lipoprotein(a): A call to action [^115wxbB2]. Atherosclerosis (2019). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a), Lp(a), is a modified atherogenic low-density lipoprotein particle that contains apolipoprotein(a). Its levels are highly heritable and variable in the population. This consensus statement by HEART UK is based on evidence that Lp(a) is an independent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor. It provides recommendations for its measurement in clinical practice and reviews emerging therapeutic strategies to reduce CVD risk.

- **Ten statements summarize the most salient points for practitioners and patients with high Lp(a)**: HEART UK recommends that Lp(a) is measured in adults in the following cases:
	1. Personal or family history of premature atherosclerotic CVD.
	2. First-degree relatives with Lp(a) levels > 200 nmol/l.
	3. Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.
	4. Patients with calcific aortic valve stenosis.
	5. Those with a borderline (but < 15%) 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event.
- **Management of patients with raised Lp(a) levels should include**:
	1. Reducing overall atherosclerotic risk.
	2. Controlling dyslipidemia with a desirable non-HDL-cholesterol level of < 100 mg/dl (2.5 mmol/l).
	3. Consideration of lipoprotein apheresis.

These measures aim to effectively manage and reduce the risk factors associated with elevated Lp(a) levels.

### Lipoprotein(a) and increased cardiovascular risk in women [^114xR4sD]. Clinical Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Approximately 20% of the population has elevated circulating levels of lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]), which is one of the most robust predictors of cardiovascular disease risk, particularly for women.

- **Hypothesis**: Many female patients with "normal" traditional risk factors or low atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk scores may harbor high risk related to elevated levels of Lp(a).

- **Methods**: A retrospective, cross-sectional study of consecutive female patients presenting to Heart Centers for Women was performed. Discordance between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and Lp(a) was determined. The ASCVD risk and Reynolds Risk Score models A (RRS-A) and B (RRS-B) were calculated, and the level of agreement in patients meeting treatment thresholds (≥ 7.5% for ASCVD, ≥ 10% for RRS-A and RRS-B) was compared.

- **Results**: Among 713 women, 290 (41%) had elevated Lp(a). However, LDL-C and Lp(a) were weakly correlated (r = 0.08). Significant discordance was observed between abnormal LDL-C and Lp(a) levels (McNemar P = 0.03). There was a moderate correlation between RRS-A and ASCVD risk (r = 0.71, P < 0.001), and Bland-Altman plot showed diminished correlation with increased risk. More patients met the treatment threshold by ASCVD risk estimation, but nearly 1 out of 20 patients met the treatment threshold by RRS-A but not the ASCVD score.

- **Conclusions**: There is a high prevalence of elevated Lp(a) among women presenting to Heart Centers for Women. Although traditional risk markers, such as elevated LDL-C or high ASCVD risk, may be absent in some women, elevated Lp(a) may identify increased cardiovascular risk.

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-the Framingham Heart Study [^112X6SCD]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is among the most common genetic dyslipidemias worldwide, affecting 1 in 5 individuals, and is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although evidence from Mendelian randomization supports a causal role of lipoprotein(a) in CVD, limited therapeutic options exist to directly lower lipoprotein(a). Recommended strategies for the management of individuals with high lipoprotein(a) emphasize the importance of managing other risk factors, including lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, without much supporting evidence for such an approach.

Among individuals with premature acute coronary syndromes, elevations of LDL-C > 135 mg/dL were more frequent among patients with high lipoprotein(a), suggesting greater absolute risk when both lipoproteins were elevated. Accordingly, we sought to evaluate the absolute and relative risks of incident CVD associated with elevated lipoprotein(a) (≥ 100 nmol/L, approximately equivalent to 50 mg/dL) in the presence of LDL-C values above and below 135 mg/dL, prospectively in the community-based Framingham Offspring Cohort. Given that the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association lipid guidelines also consider an LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL as an optional indication for early lipid-lowering therapy, we also evaluated whether the concomitant presence of high lipoprotein(a) with LDL-C levels between 135 and < 160 mg/dL conferred similar CVD risk.

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein(a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^116YKAr2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

The genetic determinants of lipoprotein(a) levels are summarized. As discussed above, there is marked variation in measured plasma lipoprotein(a) across individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds, which can be explained largely by genetic variants within the LPA gene locus.

*apo(a)* indicates apolipoprotein(a); *Lp(a)*, lipoprotein(a); and *SNP*, single‐nucleotide polymorphism.

### Lipoprotein(a) is markedly more atherogenic than LDL: An apolipoprotein B-based genetic analysis [^11662Atq]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

By employing apoB as a common denominator in assessing the relationship between Lp(a) and LDL concerning risk, we have potentially overcome several limitations:

- **Standardization and protein structure**: ApoB assays are well standardized and less susceptible to bias than those for Lp(a). Additionally, apoB is relatively uniform in protein structure between individuals. Since there is one mole of apoB per mole of Lp(a) or LDL, apoB-based odds ratios can be translated directly to per-particle risk.

- **Impact estimation**: A further consideration in estimating the impact of a given degree of Lp(a) lowering on CHD risk is how to map a lifelong risk of higher Lp(a) (and conversely, the lifelong benefit of a lower concentration) onto the timescale of a typical clinical trial. A 1 mmol/L higher lifetime LDL-C is expected to result in a CHD odds ratio of 1.54, which translates into a 22% risk reduction within the context of a 5-year clinical trial. Here, we estimated that an 85 nmol/L (around 40 mg/dL) higher lifetime Lp(a) results in a CHD odds ratio of 1.54. Thus, if drug-induced Lp(a)-lowering reduces risk in the same manner as LDL-C does, a lowering of 85 nmol/L Lp(a) is expected to decrease CHD risk by 22% within a 5-year clinical trial.

Our findings indicate that Lp(a) is indeed a highly atherogenic lipoprotein. The basis for this heightened atherogenic effect on CHD risk is not yet clear. It may be due, among other mechanisms, to the high content of oxidized phospholipids on Lp(a) that may stimulate inflammatory pathways involved in atherosclerosis, or to the structural similarity of apo(a) to plasminogen and hence its possible effects…

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor [^115rm4hY]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a class of lipoprotein particles with the lipid composition of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL), but possessing a distinct protein moiety comprised of two proteins linked together by a disulfide bridge. These two proteins are apoB100, the protein moiety of LDL, and apo(a), a heavily glycosylated protein that is specific to Lp(a). Apo(a) bears a strong structural resemblance to plasminogen and exhibits a wide-size polymorphism that has a genetic origin, contributing to the size and density heterogeneity of Lp(a).

High plasma levels of Lp(a) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease due to the atherogenic and thrombogenic potentials of this lipoprotein. This risk is exacerbated by the presence of other factors, including high plasma levels of LDL or low levels of high-density lipoprotein. The factors determining the plasma levels of Lp(a) are not completely understood, except for an association with different alleles of the apo(a) gene, located in the long arm of chromosome 6.

Currently, there are no widely accepted methods to normalize the plasma levels of Lp(a) through dietary or pharmacologic means. Until further advancements are made, patients with elevated plasma levels of Lp(a) should be advised to address modifiable risk factors to reduce the cardiovascular pathogenicity of this lipoprotein class.

### Lipoprotein(a) and diet — a challenge for a role of saturated fat in cardiovascular disease risk reduction [^1155GgaT]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Low credibility.

The role of dietary modification in reducing cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality has been a focus of studies for many years, going back to the Seven Countries Study. Although the reduction of saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake has been robustly associated with lower LDL cholesterol concentrations and a decreased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, uncertainty remains regarding the optimal replacement strategy for SFA. However, given the consistent LDL cholesterol-lowering effect by reducing SFA intake, recent observations have noted that this same intervention strategy resulted in an increase in lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations.

Lp(a) was initially identified by Berg as a factor present in an LDL fraction used to immunize rabbits around the time when diet modification was shown to affect CVD risk. The discovery of the molecular structure using protein sequencing and cDNA cloning of apo(a) — the unique structural component of Lp(a) — identified the homology of apo(a) to plasminogen. This led to improvements in Lp(a) assessment methods and the characterization of the importance of apo(a) size variability as a major genetic regulator of Lp(a) concentrations.

Elevated Lp(a) concentrations identified individuals at high risk of CVD. More recent studies identified molecular components of Lp(a) as having potential atherogenic importance, such as oxidized phospholipids, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9. Targeted interventions to lower Lp(a) concentrations and their effect on CVD risk are currently being tested in clinical studies.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^111BtH1R]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Many physicians aim to achieve an "LDL-C" of less than 70 mg/dL for high-risk patients, which is further supported by guidelines. Thus, many patients with "LDL-C" equal to or greater than 70 mg/dL and elevated lipoprotein(a) while on statin therapy already have true LDL-C significantly lower than 70 mg/dL. The recommendation to further increase LDL-C-lowering therapy in such patients may not accurately reflect whether true LDL-C or lipoprotein(a) represents additional residual risk. Statins tend to increase lipoprotein(a) levels; thus, further increasing statin dosage in a patient with an already truly low LDL-C may be counterproductive. In patients being treated with PCSK9 inhibitors that achieve exceedingly low LDL-C (e.g. less than 20 mg/dL), true LDL-C levels may be at or near zero if lipoprotein(a) is elevated, as suggested recently.

Should lipoprotein(a) mass and/or cholesterol content be part of the familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) diagnosis? Using a more accurate measurement of LDL-C would result in many subjects not meeting the criterion of "LDL-C" equal to or greater than 190 mg/dL used in many scores unless the Lp(a)-C was included in the measurement. This concept to formally include lipoprotein(a) in the diagnosis of FH is consistent with studies showing a higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events if patients with FH have concomitantly elevated lipoprotein(a) levels.

The meta-analysis included a wide range of patients receiving different statins, further reflecting their use in a wide range of cardiovascular disease prevention cohorts. Accurately quantifying true LDL-C without its content of Lp(a)-C will be important.

### Lipoprotein(a) in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic stenosis: A European Atherosclerosis Society consensus statement [^112Y9G4e]. European Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Consequences for risk thresholds

While the association between Lp(a) and cardiovascular outcomes is linear, in clinical practice threshold levels identify values expected to translate to a clinically significant increase in risk, although analytical issues may raise questions about their validity. One solution is to define assay-specific cut-offs, analogous to those used in different cardiac troponin assays. This consensus panel suggests a pragmatic approach, with Lp(a) cut-offs to 'rule out' (50 mg/dL or > 125 nmol/L) risk. The interim grey zone (i.e. 30–50 mg/dL; 75–125 nmol/L) is relevant when considering Lp(a)-attributable risk in the presence of other risk factors and in risk stratification. Laboratories should include the assay name in reports to allow for tracking of discrepant results in patient follow-up.

Should Lp(a)-cholesterol be used to correct low-density lipoprotein cholesterol?

Cholesterol contained in Lp(a) particles cannot be separated from that in LDL particles and is therefore collectively reported as LDL-C concentration. Previous analyses of isolated Lp(a) particles suggested cholesterol accounted for 30%–45% of Lp(a) mass concentration. Thus, Lp(a)-cholesterol [Lp(a)-C] was estimated by multiplying Lp(a) mass (mg/dL) by 0.3 and used to correct LDL-C (= Lp(a)-C-corrected LDL-C).

However, this approach has limitations. Direct measurement of Lp(a) cholesterol relative to Lp(a) mass showed inter- and intraindividual variation ranging from 6% to 60%, which may impact risk prediction. Therefore, this panel does not recommend using Lp(a)-C to correct LDL-C in clinical practice.

### Lp(a) - an overlooked risk factor [^111cQiB3]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is an increasingly discussed and studied risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and aortic valve stenosis. Many genetic and epidemiological studies support the important causal role that Lp(a) plays in the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Although dependent upon the threshold and unit of measurement of Lp(a), most estimates suggest that between 20% and 30% of the world's population have elevated serum levels of Lp(a). Lp(a) levels are predominantly mediated by genetics and are not significantly modified by lifestyle interventions. Efforts are ongoing to develop effective pharmacotherapies to lower Lp(a) and to determine if lowering Lp(a) with these medications ultimately decreases the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events.

In this review, the genetics and pathophysiological properties of Lp(a) are discussed, as well as the epidemiological data demonstrating its impact on the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Recommendations for screening and current approaches to patients with elevated Lp(a) are also noted. Finally, the spectrum of pharmacotherapies under development for Lp(a) lowering is detailed.

### Lipoprotein(a) and coronary calcification: Prognostic implications in rotational atherectomy patients [^112Eh2t4]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2025). Low credibility.

Elevated Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations have long been associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiac events (MACE). However, the relationship of Lp(a) and clinical outcomes in patients with severe coronary calcifications undergoing rotational atherectomy (RA) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the prognostic implications of Lp(a) in patients with calcified coronary lesions after RA.

- **Methods**:
	- Data from 494 consecutive patients undergoing RA were retrospectively collected. Lp(a) levels were stratified into two categories: < 50mg/dL, and ≥ 50mg/dL. Outcomes included MACE, and cardiovascular death (CVD).

- **Results**:
	- Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of MACE in patients with Lp(a) ≥ 50mg/dL (log-rank p = 0.006), but no significant difference was observed in the incidence of CVD (log-rank p = 0.062). We applied the minimum p-value method and identified an optimal threshold of 68.3mg/dL for CVD, then further validated by survival analysis (log-rank p = 0.02). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed Lp(a) remained an independent risk factor for MACE after adjusting for confounders. Age, hemodialysis, complications, and heart failure were common risk factors for both MACE and CVD. Subgroup analysis indicated that Lp(a) predicted higher MACE risk in smokers and patients with comorbidities.

- **Conclusion**:
	- In patients with severe calcification undergoing RA, Lp(a) ≥ 50mg/dL was independently associated with MACE but not with CVD, except when Lp(a) was markedly elevated (≥ 68.3mg/dL). Additionally, Lp(a) was found to predict.

### Lipoprotein(a): A risk factor for atherosclerosis and an emerging therapeutic target [^114f2cNs]. Heart (2022). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a complex circulating lipoprotein, and increasing evidence has demonstrated its role as a risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and as a possible therapeutic target. Lp(a)'s atherogenic effects are attributed to several potential mechanisms in addition to cholesterol accumulation in the arterial wall, including proinflammatory effects mainly mediated by oxidised phospholipids. Several studies have found a causal and independent relationship between Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, several studies also suggest a causal association between Lp(a) levels and calcific aortic valve stenosis.

Available lipid-lowering agents have, at best, a moderate impact on Lp(a) levels. Among available therapies, antibody proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors are the most effective in reducing Lp(a). Potent Lp(a)-lowering treatments that target LPA expression are under development. Lp(a) level measurement poses some challenges due to the absence of a definitive reference method and the reporting of Lp(a) values as molar (nanomoles per litre (nmol/L)) or mass concentrations (milligrams per decilitre (mg/dL)) by different assays.

Currently, Lp(a) measurement is recommended to refine cardiovascular risk in specific clinical settings, that is, in individuals with a family history of premature ASCVD, in patients with ASCVD not explained by standard risk factors, or in those with recurrent events despite optimal management of traditional risk factors. Patients with high Lp(a) levels should be managed with more intensive interventions and monitoring.

### Study of lipoprotein(a) and its impact on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: Design and rationale of the Mass General Brigham Lp(a) registry [^115j3RpZ]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

Over the last four decades, numerous studies have demonstrated that elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and calcific aortic valve stenosis. With a unique molecular structure hypothesized to be both pro‐atherogenic and pro‐thrombotic, Lp(a) is composed of a low‐density lipoprotein‐like moiety covalently bound to a genetically‐mediated apolipoprotein(a) molecule. Synthesized in the liver and mediated almost entirely by the LPA gene, elevated Lp(a) is the most common inherited dyslipidemia, affecting approximately one in five individuals. Lp(a) levels above 50 mg/dL (≈ 125 nmol/L) correspond to the 80th percentile in population‐based studies and is the threshold at which its impact on atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has been shown to become clinically meaningful. Even for individuals with otherwise well‐controlled risk factors, elevated levels of Lp(a) have a significant and independent effect on residual atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk.

Despite the robust evidence linking elevated levels of Lp(a) to cardiovascular disease, there are currently no approved pharmacologic therapies directly targeting Lp(a). Presently, those with significantly elevated levels are counseled on overall risk reduction and — in certain scenarios — recommended to initiate statin therapy. While statin therapy has no direct effect on Lp(a) levels, its use in some individuals with elevated Lp(a) centers around overall ASCVD risk.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for dyslipidemia, more specifically with respect to lipoprotein(a), the EAS/ESC 2020 guidelines recommend considering obtaining lipoprotein(a) levels in selected patients with a family history of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD), and for reclassification in patients at the borderline between moderate and high risk.

### Non-genetic influences on lipoprotein(a) concentrations [^116xby5q]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

An elevated level of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically regulated, independent, causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, the extensive variability in Lp(a) levels between individuals and population groups cannot be fully explained by genetic factors, emphasizing a potential role for non-genetic factors. In this review, evidence on non-genetic factors influencing Lp(a) levels is provided, with a particular focus on diet, physical activity, hormones, and certain pathological conditions.

Findings from randomized controlled clinical trials show that diets lower in saturated fats modestly influence Lp(a) levels and often in the opposing direction to LDL cholesterol. Results from studies on physical activity and exercise have been inconsistent, ranging from no to minimal or moderate change in Lp(a) levels, potentially modulated by age and the type, intensity, and duration of exercise modality.

- **Hormone replacement therapy**: In postmenopausal women, HRT lowers Lp(a) levels, with oral being more effective than transdermal estradiol. The type of HRT, dose of estrogen, and addition of progestogen do not modify the Lp(a)-lowering effect of HRT.

- **Kidney diseases**: These result in marked elevations in Lp(a) levels, albeit dependent on disease stages, dialysis modalities, and apolipoprotein(a) phenotypes.

- **Liver diseases**: In contrast, Lp(a) levels are reduced in liver diseases in parallel with disease progression, although population studies have yielded conflicting results on the associations between Lp(a) levels and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

### Lipoprotein(a) and diet-a challenge for a role of saturated fat in cardiovascular disease risk reduction [^111uScVE]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). High credibility.

Although it is well established that Lp(a) concentrations are primarily genetically regulated, some non-genetic factors have been identified as predictors of plasma concentrations. Thoroughly identifying such predictors has been a challenging task because multiple factors, including but not limited to sample size, choice of study design, genetic variability, and the choice of assays, have varied across studies. However, a few conditions have emerged that influence Lp(a) concentrations.

These can be broadly classified into two categories based on the direction of effect:

- **Lpa increasing**: Factors that correlate with an increase in Lp(a) concentration include reduction in dietary saturated fat intake, hypothyroidism, menopause, growth hormones, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and dialysis treatments.
- **Lpa decreasing**: Factors that correlate with a decrease in Lp(a) concentration include a diet low in carbohydrate and high in saturated fat, hyperthyroidism, hormone replacement therapy, and certain liver diseases.

The quantitative impact on Lp(a) at a population level by these metabolic and environmental factors is relatively less than the impact of genetic regulation of expression. Despite this, the impact can be substantial under some conditions.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein(a): A review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^114ShmcG]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

While universal testing may be ideal, targeted testing remains a pragmatic approach in most clinical settings. The following groups should be prioritized for Lp(a) measurement:

- **Individuals with premature ASCVD**: Premature ASCVD, defined as cardiovascular events occurring before age 55 years in men and 65 years in women, points to possible underlying genetic contributors, including elevated Lp(a). In these individuals, Lp(a) measurement may uncover a risk factor that may not be addressed by standard lipid-lowering therapies alone.

- **Family history of premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a)**: Given the strong heritability of Lp(a) levels, first-degree relatives of individuals with premature ASCVD or elevated Lp(a) should undergo testing. Cascade screening in such families can identify at-risk individuals before the onset of clinical disease, allowing for early intervention.

- **ReASCVD despite optimal LDL-lowering therapy**: Patients with less than expected response to statins or who continue to experience cardiovascular events despite achieving low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) targets may have residual risk driven by elevated Lp(a). In such cases, Lp(a) measurement can inform the need for more aggressive secondary preventive strategies.

- **Patients with suspected or confirmed familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)**: Lp(a) elevation is common among individuals with FH and may contribute to the observed variability in cardiovascular risk within this group. Identifying elevated Lp(a) in these patients can help stratify risk.

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-the Framingham Heart Study [^116khWRS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease but is not measured in routine clinical care. Screening for high lipoprotein(a) in individuals with moderate elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may help identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease.

- **Methods and results**: We examined 2,606 Framingham Offspring participants (median age, 54 years; 45% men) prospectively with a median follow-up of 15 years, during which 392 incident cardiovascular events occurred. Individuals with higher (≥ 100 nmol/L) versus lower lipoprotein(a) were divided into groups based on LDL-C < 135 mg/dL versus ≥ 135 mg/dL. In Cox models, after adjustment for known risk factors, high lipoprotein(a) (≥ 100 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL were each significant predictors of cardiovascular disease (LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL: hazard ratio [HR], 1.34; 95% CI, 1.09–1.64; P = 0.006; high lipoprotein(a): HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03–1.66; P = 0.026).

Across the groups of high/low lipoprotein(a) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL or < 135 mg/dL, the absolute cardiovascular disease risks at 15 years were 22.6% (high lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, n = 248), 17.3% (low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, n = 758), 12.7% (high lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL, n = 275), and 11.5% (low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL, n = 1,328, reference group). Among individuals with LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, those with high lipoprotein(a) had a 43% higher risk (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05–1.97; P = 0.02). The presence of high lipoprotein(a) with moderate LDL-C levels (135–159 mg/dL) yielded absolute risks equivalent to those with higher LDL-C.

### How should public health recommendations address Lp(a) measurement, a causative risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) [^112Hvdjh]. Atherosclerosis (2022). High credibility.

Elevated concentrations of Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] are an inherited, causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). This study aims to investigate the clinical utility for patients and the economic benefit to healthcare systems and society of measuring Lp(a) concentrations more widely today.

- **Methods**: We conducted a structured literature review to identify the economic and health benefits and costs of measuring the Lp(a) concentration, potential barriers hindering the uptake of the measure, and potential solutions to address them. These findings were then discussed in an advisory board attended by experts and patient organizations.

- **Results**: It was found that if Lp(a) concentration is measured more widely today, patients, healthcare systems, and society would experience clinical and economic benefits even before specific Lp(a) lowering pharmacological treatments become available. Furthermore, a wider uptake of the Lp(a) measurement would support the development of epidemiological data.

- **Conclusions**: For Lp(a) measurement to be more widely used, key barriers hindering its uptake need to be addressed. These include: i) the perception that the measure may have limited clinical value ii) lack of awareness of Lp(a) iii) lack of data on the CV benefit of reducing Lp(a) iv) technical and clinical guidelines barriers, and v) healthcare system barriers. Scientific communities and industry should collaborate to address technical challenges and deficiencies in clinical guidelines. However, policy intervention will be crucial.

### High-density lipoprotein revisited: Biological functions and clinical relevance [^117PkJ2m]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Taken together, HDL is a dynamic multifaceted lipoprotein that can serve several physiological roles, most of which have been preserved throughout evolution for reasons other than protection from atherosclerosis. Clinically, low HDL-C remains a strong and important risk marker for increased risk of ASCVD, likely due to the inverse association with increased levels of triglyceride-rich remnant lipoproteins. For patients with extremely high HDL-C, the documented increased risk of infectious disease and all-cause mortality should inform patients and doctors alike of the possible negative prognostic consequences of high HDL-C.

The observed increased risk of AMD, both observationally and genetically, for any increase in HDL levels is of concern. Future efforts to pharmacologically modulate HDL should likely focus on functional metrics of HDL function rather than HDL-C, and other clinical indications besides ASCVD.

### Lipoprotein(a) testing trends in a large academic health system in the United States [^116EX3Pd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). High credibility.

This study highlights the underrecognition and underdiagnosis of elevated lipoprotein(a), despite its high prevalence, affecting more than 20% of the general population. This corresponds to an estimated 64 million individuals in the United States and 1.4 billion individuals worldwide. Several barriers to more widespread lipoprotein(a) testing provide targets for improvement:

- **Lack of awareness**: Lipoprotein(a) as a CVD risk factor is not widely known, nor is the guideline indication for its testing.
- **Risk assessment challenges**: There is insufficient knowledge about how to assess and manage risk in patients with elevated lipoprotein(a).
- **Implementation gaps**: The absence of implementation programs for lipoprotein(a) testing hampers its adoption.
- **Insurance concerns**: Worries about coverage deter testing.
- **Assay uncertainty**: Variations in clinically available assays that report lipoprotein(a) levels add to the uncertainty.

Improved dissemination of guidelines is essential, although consistency across major societal guidelines is equally necessary to provide clinicians with clarity on when to opt for lipoprotein(a) testing. Numerous high-quality review articles discuss mechanistic, epidemiologic, and genetic studies linking lipoprotein(a) to CVD. This includes recent American Heart Association and European Atherosclerosis Society scientific statements on lipoprotein(a) that are invaluable resources.

### Estimation of the required lipoprotein(a)-lowering therapeutic effect size for reduction in coronary heart disease outcomes: A Mendelian randomization analysis [^111u1wUH]. JAMA Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Genetic and epidemiologic data suggest that lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is one of the strongest genetically determined risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). Specific therapies to lower Lp(a) are on the horizon, but the required reduction of Lp(a) to translate into clinically relevant lowering of CHD outcomes is a matter of debate.

- **Objective**: To estimate the required Lp(a)-lowering effect size that may be associated with a reduction of CHD outcomes compared with the effect size of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering therapies.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This genetic epidemiologic study used a Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the required Lp(a)-lowering effect size for a clinically meaningful effect on outcomes. The effect estimates for Lp(a) were drawn from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a meta-analysis on Lp(a) published in 2017, involving five different primarily population-based studies of European ancestry. All Lp(a) measurements were performed in one laboratory. Genetic estimates for 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms on Lp(a) concentrations were used. Odds ratios for these 27 single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with CHD risk were retrieved from a subsample of the CHD Exome+ consortium.

- **Exposures**: Considered were genetic LPA score, plasma Lp(a) concentrations, and observations of statin therapies on CHD outcomes.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The main focus was on coronary heart disease.

- **Results**: The study included 13,781 individuals from the Lp(a)-GWAS-Consortium from five primarily population-based studies and 20,793 CHD cases and 27,540 controls.

### Review of the evidence for the clinical utility of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 as a cardiovascular risk marker [^1176prXv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

A substantial body of peer-reviewed studies has been published validating the role of inflammation in atherogenesis and supporting lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) as a cardiovascular risk marker, independent of and additive to traditional risk factors. As with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, an elevated Lp-PLA2 level approximately doubles the risk for primary and secondary cardiovascular events. When both inflammatory markers are increased together, they provide even greater predictive capability to help identify very-high-risk individuals who would benefit most from aggressive lipid-lowering therapy.

High levels of Lp-PLA2 are present in inflamed, rupture-prone plaques, and it appears that Lp-PLA2 is released from these plaques into the circulation. Over 25 prospective epidemiologic studies have demonstrated the association of elevated Lp-PLA2 levels with future coronary events and stroke. Eleven of 12 prospective studies have shown a statistically significant association between elevated Lp-PLA2 and primary coronary or cardiovascular events, while 12 of 13 have shown a statistically significant association with recurrent coronary or cardiovascular events, and six studies have shown a positive association with stroke.

Lp-PLA2 should be viewed today as an important cardiovascular risk marker whose utility is as an adjunct to the major risk factors to adjust absolute risk status and thereby modify low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. The low biologic fluctuation and high vascular specificity of Lp-PLA2 make it a valuable marker in clinical settings.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: current status [^115xSH1h]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

The aims of the study were to critically evaluate lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a cardiovascular risk factor. The study also aimed to advise on screening for elevated plasma Lp(a), on desirable levels, and on therapeutic strategies.

- **Methods and results**: The robust and specific association between elevated Lp(a) levels and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) or coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, together with recent genetic findings, indicates that elevated Lp(a), like elevated LDL-cholesterol, is causally related to premature CVD or CHD. The association is continuous without a threshold or dependence on LDL- or non-HDL-cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, elevated Lp(a) levels may either induce a prothrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic effect, as apolipoprotein(a) resembles both plasminogen and plasmin but has no fibrinolytic activity, or may accelerate atherosclerosis because, like LDL, the Lp(a) particle is cholesterol-rich, or both. We advise that Lp(a) be measured once, using an isoform-insensitive assay, in subjects at intermediate or high CVD or CHD risk with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolaemia, a family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, ≥ 3% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to European guidelines, and/or ≥ 10% 10-year risk of fatal and non-fatal CHD according to US guidelines. As a secondary priority after LDL-cholesterol reduction, we recommend a desirable level for Lp(a) at less than the 80th percentile (less than approximately 50 mg/dL). Treatment should primarily be niacin 1–3 g/day, as supported by a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled interventions.

### Lipoprotein(a) - from biomarker to therapy: A review for the clinician [^113HhNRq]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality globally. Amid rising CVD rates, Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has been recognized as a critical biomarker identifying individuals at an increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (AS), independent of traditional risk factors. Lp(a) is a lipoprotein variant similar to LDL but includes apolipoprotein(a), which influences its pathogenic potential. Elevated Lp(a) levels are genetically determined and have been implicated in promoting vascular inflammation, atherogenesis, enhanced calcification, and thrombosis.

Emerging antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)- and small interfering ribonucleic acids (siRNA)-based therapies have been shown to lower Lp(a) concentrations, with ongoing trials underway to determine whether they reduce the risk of CVD. While guidelines on screening and management continue to evolve, the advent of specific Lp(a)-lowering therapies may transform CVD prevention and treatment. This review aims to consolidate the knowledge on Lp(a) from its biological functions to its implications for clinical practice, focusing on its role as a biomarker and potential therapeutic target.

### Independence of lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: A participant-level meta-analysis [^1137pjHN]. Circulation (2025). Low credibility.

In this meta-analysis of statin trials, both Lp(a) and LDL-C levels were found to be independent and additive cardiovascular risk factors, and significant reduction in LDL-C levels did not mitigate the risk mediated by Lp(a). Our findings underscore the necessity of testing and incorporating Lp(a) into cardiovascular risk assessments. Future trials are expected to elucidate the role of targeted Lp(a) therapeutics for reducing cardiovascular risk in the context of LDL-C levels.

### A test in context: Lipoprotein(a): Diagnosis, prognosis, controversies, and emerging therapies [^111cXdW5]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

Evidence that elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels contribute to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is substantial. The development of isoform-independent assays, along with genetic, epidemiological, translational, and pathophysiological insights, has established Lp(a) as an independent, genetic, and likely causal risk factor for CVD and CAVS. These observations are consistent across a broad spectrum of patients, risk factors, and concomitant therapies, including patients with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 80%. These approaches will allow the testing of the "Lp(a) hypothesis" in clinical trials. This review summarizes the landscape of Lp(a), discusses controversies, and reviews emerging therapies to reduce plasma Lp(a) levels to decrease the risk of CVD and CAVS.

### Lipoprotein(a) particle production as a determinant of plasma lipoprotein(a) concentration across varying apolipoprotein(a) isoform sizes and background cholesterol-lowering therapy [^111bo5iR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

While apoB is essential for the binding of LDL particles to the LDL receptor, necessary for cellular uptake and degradation by the liver, the role of the LDL receptor in Lp(a) particle catabolism remains unclear. Experimental studies have demonstrated that the LDL receptor is involved in Lp(a) catabolism, but the findings have not been conclusive. Early radiolabeled kinetic studies showed no difference in the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of Lp(a) between control subjects and patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, who lack hepatic LDL receptors, suggesting that the LDL receptor is not required in the catabolism of Lp(a).

Statins and proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 inhibition enhance hepatic LDL receptor activity, but their effects on plasma Lp(a) concentration appear to differ. While statins alone show a modest or no effect on plasma Lp(a) concentration, proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody monotherapy, such as evolocumab, appears to lower plasma Lp(a) concentration by decreasing the production of Lp(a) particles, particularly in subjects with elevated Lp(a). Whether variations in the apo(a) gene bear on the kinetics of Lp(a) particles, particularly against background maximal LDL-cholesterol-lowering therapy, remains unknown. Knowledge of the determinants of the kinetics of Lp(a) and the response to therapies is fundamentally important to broaden our understanding of this complex, heritable cardiovascular risk factor and to provide a rationale for best use of…

In summary, elevated Lp(a) levels are robustly and specifically associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The association is continuous in shape, without a threshold, and is independent of high levels of LDL or non-HDL cholesterol, as well as the levels or presence of other cardiovascular risk factors.

### Lipoprotein (a) and diabetes mellitus [^1164rExB]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) and diabetes are both known and established risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. However, studies attempting to link these risk factors have found an inverse association between Lp(a) and the risk of both prevalent and incident diabetes. It remains unclear whether this association is causal and whether it is due to the Lp(a) concentration itself, the length of the apo(a) isoforms, or both. The results of Mendelian randomization studies are highly heterogeneous, and this review aims to illuminate the most recent findings from epidemiological and Mendelian randomization studies to disentangle the contradictory results.

Only part of the observed association of Lp(a) with diabetes can likely be explained by causality. It may also be driven by reverse causation, co-morbidities, or medications. Furthermore, this review summarizes the role of Lp(a) within patients with diabetes. Several studies suggest that elevated Lp(a) is a causal independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in these patients. Although therapies that specifically target and lower Lp(a) have not been evaluated in diabetic patients, analysis of large PCSK9 clinical outcomes trials suggests they are beneficial for cardiovascular outcomes.

### Lipoprotein(a) in clinical practice: A guide for the clinician [^117WgEnp]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Serum lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) has been shown to be an independent and causative risk factor for atherosclerotic CVD and calcific aortic valvular disease. Lp(a) continues to be studied, with emerging insights into the epidemiology of CVD with respect to Lp(a), pathogenic mechanisms of Lp(a), and strategies to mitigate disease. There have been novel insights into genetic polymorphisms of the LPA gene, interactions between concomitant risk factors and Lp(a) based on real-world data, and metabolic pathway targets for Lp(a) reduction.

This review highlights these recent advances in our understanding of Lp(a) and discusses management strategies as recommended by cardiovascular professional societies, emerging therapies for lowering Lp(a), and future directions in targeting Lp(a) to reduce CVD.

### Lp(a) (lipoprotein[a]) concentrations and incident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: New insights from a large national biobank [^115E1bGA]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to examine the association between Lp(a) (lipoprotein[a]) concentrations and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), as well as the development of new therapies that enable potent and specific reduction. In the largest study conducted at the time of writing, we address three areas of uncertainty:

- **Magnitude and shape of ASCVD risk**: The risk conferred across the distribution of lipoprotein(a) concentrations was studied.
- **Variation of risk across racial and clinical subgroups**: Relationships were examined varied by race and clinical subgroups.
- **Clinical importance of a high lipoprotein(a) threshold**: Evaluating the threshold to guide therapy.

- **Approach and results**: The relationship of lipoprotein(a) to incident ASCVD was studied in 460,506 middle-aged UK Biobank participants. Over a median follow-up of 11.2 years, incident ASCVD occurred in 22,401 (4.9%) participants. The median lipoprotein(a) concentration was 19.6 nmol/L (25th-75th percentile 7.6–74.8). The relationship between lipoprotein(a) and ASCVD appeared linear across the distribution, with a hazard ratio of 1.11 (95% CI, 1.10–1.12) per 50 nmol/L increment.

Substantial differences in concentrations were noted according to race: median values for white, South Asian, black, and Chinese individuals were 19, 31, 75, and 16 nmol/L, respectively. However, risk per 50 nmol/L appeared similar, with hazard ratios of 1.11, 1.10, and 1.07 for white, South Asian, and black individuals, respectively. A high lipoprotein(a) concentration defined as ≥ 150 nmol/L was present in 12.2% of those without and 20.3% of those with preexisting ASCVD, and it was associated with hazard ratios of 1.50 (95% CI, 1.44–1.56) and 1.16 (95% CI, 1.05–1.27), respectively.

The kringle-2 domain and apolipoprotein(a) isoform size

Most individuals (> 80%) express two different apolipoprotein(a) isoforms inherited from each parent, which contribute to lipoprotein(a) levels in a codominant manner. The kringle IV-2–encoding domain of each apolipoprotein(a) allele can include from 2 to > 40 repeats, with each kringle IV-2–encoding repeat being 5.6 kb in size. A general inverse correlation has been observed between apolipoprotein(a) isoform size and plasma lipoprotein(a) levels, whereby smaller isoform sizes are associated with higher levels. Median lipoprotein(a) concentrations are four to five times higher in individuals with small apolipoprotein(a) isoforms (< 22 kringle IV repeats) than those with only large isoforms (≥ 22 kringle IV repeats). However, as previously discussed, the contribution of apo(a) isoform size to observed plasma lipoprotein(a) levels varies by up to 80% among individuals from different racial and ethnic backgrounds. The strength of the inverse correlation between isoform size and concentration appears stronger in European and Asian individuals compared with those of African descent. Population studies suggest that 61% to 69% versus 19% to 44% of the variance in lipoprotein(a) levels can be explained by the inverse correlation with apolipoprotein(a) isoform size in individuals of European descent versus African descent, respectively. Larger apolipoprotein(a) isoforms are less likely to be expressed in individuals of European descent compared with those of African descent, with SNPs thought to play a significant but varying role.

### Discrimination and net reclassification of cardiovascular risk with lipoprotein(a): Prospective 15-year outcomes in the Bruneck study [^114FnPdT]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2014). High credibility.

Recent studies showed that lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, whether Lp(a) modifies clinical risk assessment was not established.

- **Objectives**: This study was conducted to determine whether Lp(a) improves CVD risk prediction.

- **Methods**: In 1995, Lp(a) was measured in 826 men and women (age range, 45 to 84 years) from the general community. The incidence of CVD was recorded over 15 years of follow-up.

- **Results**: In models adjusted for Framingham Risk Score (FRS) and Reynolds Risk Score (RRS) variables, the hazard ratio (HR) for incident CVD was 1.37 per 1-SD higher Lp(a) level (SD = 32 mg/dl) and 2.37 when comparing the top fifth quintile with other quintiles. The addition of Lp(a) to the RRS increased the C-index by 0.016. Of the 502 subjects who remained free of CVD, 82 were correctly reclassified to a lower risk category and 49 were reclassified to a higher risk category (predicted 15-year categories: < 7.5%, 7.5% to < 15%, 15% to < 30%, ≥ 30%) (p < 0.001). Of the 148 subjects who developed CVD, 18 were correctly reclassified to a higher risk category and 17 were reclassified to a lower risk category. In subjects at intermediate risk (15% to < 30%), the net reclassification improvement afforded by Lp(a) was 22.5% for noncases, 17.1% for cases, and 39.6% overall. Allele-specific Lp(a) levels did not add to the predictive ability of the FRS or RRS or to Lp(a).

- **Conclusions**: Elevated Lp(a) predicts 15-year CVD outcomes and improves CVD risk prediction. These findings suggest that Lp(a) levels may be used in risk assessment.

### Genetics and pathophysiological mechanisms of lipoprotein(a)-associated cardiovascular risk [^112srr6t]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

It is well documented that lipoprotein(a) levels are largely controlled at the stage of biosynthesis rather than the catabolism of the particle. As such, a potential mechanism to explain the inverse association between apolipoprotein(a) isoform size and lipoprotein(a) concentration is based on decreased residency time of smaller apolipoprotein(a) isoforms in the endoplasmic reticulum. This results in decreased susceptibility to endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation and more efficient maturation of smaller apolipoprotein(a) proteins. This correlates with increased hepatic secretion of smaller apolipoprotein(a) isoforms and higher susceptibility of larger apolipoprotein(a) proteins to endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation, resulting in reduced secretion of larger apolipoprotein(a) isoforms.

- **Gene: Polymorphisms and splicing**: Recently, it has been shown that there are complex relationships between the genetic factors affecting lipoprotein(a) levels. This includes, for example, that modulation of the contribution of allele size to lipoprotein(a) levels is modified by many functional SNPs over the entire range of LPA allele frequencies, as well as interactions of SNPs with other SNPs and with short tandem repeats. Several loss-of-function SNPs have been identified within the LPA gene locus, such as the null alleles rs41272114 and rs143431368, which are caused by splice site mutations.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: Current status [^111xBb8p]. European Heart Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Scientific and clinical evidence favoring an interpretation of causality between elevated levels of a lipoprotein and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk constitutes a prerequisite for determining desirable levels. To interpret causality, five types of evidence should each favor causality, and all three types of human evidence (epidemiology, genetics, and intervention trials) must concur. For elevated LDL cholesterol levels, all five criteria are well documented, and there is a consensus on causality. Based on the same criteria, elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels are probably also causally related to increased CVD risk.

- **Scientific recommendations**: Recommendations proposing desirable levels should preferably be based on evidence from a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials documenting the benefit of treatment (level Ia evidence). Desirable levels for LDL cholesterol are based on such evidence from statin trials. For Lp(a), the evidence is less clear; however, a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials documenting the benefit of niacin (nicotinic acid) treatment has recently been published.

- **Desirable levels**: For the reduction of plasma Lp(a) as a secondary priority after the reduction of LDL and total cholesterol levels, we recommend a desirable level below the 80th percentile (less than approximately 50 mg/dL). As for LDL reduction, treatment of high Lp(a) levels in persons without CVD, coronary heart disease (CHD), or diabetes is recommended.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a potential causal genetic risk factor of cardiovascular disease: A rationale for increased efforts to understand its pathophysiology and develop targeted therapies [^112biF27]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Recent published studies have provided increasing evidence that lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] may be a potential causal, genetic, independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Lp(a) levels greater than 25 mg/dl are present in approximately 30% of Caucasians and 60% to 70% of Blacks. Lp(a) is composed of apolipoprotein B-100 and apolipoprotein (a) [apo(a)]. Circulating Lp(a) levels are primarily influenced by the LPA gene without significant dietary or environmental effects, mediating CVD risk throughout the patient's lifetime.

Recent clinical outcomes studies, meta-analyses, and Mendelian randomization studies, in which randomization of Lp(a) levels is achieved through the random assortment of LPA gene variants thereby removing confounders, have shown that genetically determined Lp(a) levels are continuously and linearly related to risk of CVD. Currently, Lp(a) pathophysiology is not fully understood, and specifically targeted therapies to lower Lp(a) are not available. We provide a rationale for increased basic and clinical investigational efforts to further understand Lp(a) pathophysiology and assess whether reducing Lp(a) levels minimizes CVD risk.

First, a detailed understanding of Lp(a) synthesis and clearance has not been realized. Second, several mechanisms of atherogenicity are known to varying extents, but the relative contributions of each are not known. Lp(a) may be atherothrombotic through its low-density lipoprotein moiety, but also through apo(a), including its ability to be retained in the vessel wall and mediate pro-inflammatory and proapoptotic effects.

### Why, how and in whom should we measure levels of lipoprotein(a): A review of the latest evidence and clinical implications [^11215S7e]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Low credibility.

The objectives of this narrative review are threefold. First, we discuss underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that make Lp(a) a potent contributor to cardiovascular risk. Second, we discuss the landscape of Lp(a) measurement, including available assay techniques, standardization efforts, and interpretation of results, with a particular focus on addressing the ongoing challenges in clinical application. Third, we outline recommendations regarding who should undergo Lp(a) testing, incorporating insights from recent clinical practice guidelines. By synthesizing the latest data, this review seeks to inform clinicians and provide practical guidance on integrating Lp(a) measurement into routine cardiovascular risk assessment. Lastly, we explore emerging therapeutic strategies targeting Lp(a), underscoring their potential to reshape clinical practice in the future.

- **Pathophysiological role**: Lp(a) is a structurally unique lipoprotein particle consisting of an LDL-like core (apolipoprotein-B-100) that is attached to apo(a) via a disulfide bond. Although both LDL and Lp(a) contain one apolipoprotein-B (ApoB) molecule, Lp(a) does not bind to LDL receptors with the same affinity as LDL due to the steric interference of the apo(a) moiety on Lp(a). Additionally, apo(a) alters the shape of ApoB, which may in turn decrease binding to the LDL receptor. Decreased uptake by the LDL receptor and the presence of oxidized phospholipids on the apo(a) moiety overall contribute to an approximately six-fold higher atherogenicity for Lp(a) when compared to LDL.

### Assessing the accuracy of estimated lipoprotein(a) cholesterol and lipoprotein(a)-free low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [^116uzFMy]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Low credibility.

Advancements in risk assessment, diagnosis, and treatment response to future therapies have increased the impetus for accurate measurement of the atherogenic burden of Lp(a). Currently, the reporting of Lp(a) levels varies substantially. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine recommends the Lp(a) particle number (Lp[a]‐P), an assessment of molar concentration, as the clinical standard for assessing Lp(a). However, in contemporary clinical cohorts, Lp(a) levels have often been expressed in mass concentration (mg/dL) of the entire lipoprotein particles (e.g. cholesterol, esters, phospholipids, triglycerides, and apolipoproteins) to allow familiarity in evaluating cardiovascular risk.

A proposed method for the estimation of Lp(a) cholesterol (Lp[a]‐C) has emerged by dividing Lp(a)‐P (in nmol/L) by a conversion factor of 2.4 to reflect mass in mg/dL and then multiplying by 30% to reflect the cholesterol content of Lp(a). This method is of clinical interest since the calculated LDL‐C value on a standard lipid panel contains Lp(a)‐C. As such, the ability to express Lp(a)‐C as a measure of cholesterol content within Lp(a) particles may be appealing to clinicians. Comparing Lp(a)‐C with LDL‐C would provide clinicians with a qualitative understanding of the degree to which Lp(a) is contributing to the underlying atherosclerotic disease process. Moreover, assessing Lp(a)‐C might help to explain situations wherein LDL‐C reduction is less than anticipated with LDL‐targeted therapies such as statins. There is evidence that statins, by far the most.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^11467D6V]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). High credibility.

In conclusion, our findings provide insights that the predictive value of "LDL‐C" is potentiated by its Lp(a)‐C content. This study provides a rationale to develop improved methods to accurately quantify LDL‐C. Additional clinical investigations are needed to more accurately assign CVD risk to the responsible lipoproteins and to assess the true effect of LDL‐C–modifying therapies.

### Lipoprotein(a) mass levels increase significantly according to genotype: An analysis of 431,239 patients [^116Zbi9X]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2017). Low credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels are genetically determined by hepatocyte apolipoprotein(a) synthesis, although catabolic pathways also influence circulating levels. APOE genotypes exhibit different affinities for the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and LDL-related protein-1. Notably, the ε2 genotype has the weakest binding to the LDL receptor, less than 2% relative to ε3 and ε4.

APOE genotypes (ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3, ε2/ε4, ε3/ε3, ε3/ε4, and ε4/ε4), Lp(a) mass, directly measured Lp(a)-cholesterol levels, and various apoB-related lipoproteins were measured in 431,239 patients. The prevalence of APOE traits was ε2: 7.35%, ε3: 77.56%, and ε4: 15.09%. Mean (SD) Lp(a) levels were 65% higher in ε4/ε4 compared with ε2/ε2 genotypes and increased significantly according to APOE genotype: ε2/ε2: 23.4 (29.2), ε2/ε3: 31.3 (38.0), ε2/ε4: 32.8 (38.5), ε3/ε3: 33.2 (39.1), ε3/ε4: 35.5 (41.6), and ε4/ε4: 38.5 (44.1) mg/dL (P < 0.0001). LDL-cholesterol, apoB, Lp(a)-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol corrected for Lp(a)-cholesterol content, LDL-particle number, and small, dense LDL also demonstrated similar patterns.

Patients with LDL-cholesterol ≥ 250 mg/dL, who are more likely to have LDL receptor mutations and reduced affinity for apoB, exhibited higher Lp(a) levels across all apoE isoforms, particularly in patients with ε2 alleles, compared to patients with LDL < 250 mg/dL. The lowest Lp(a) mass levels were observed in patients with ε2 isoforms and the lowest LDL-cholesterol.

APOE genotypes strongly influence Lp(a) and apoB-related lipoprotein levels, which suggests differences in the affinity of apoE proteins.

### Lipoprotein(a), c-reactive protein, and cardiovascular risk in primary and secondary prevention populations [^112JHD4x]. JAMA Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a putative causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). There are conflicting data as to whether Lp(a) may increase cardiovascular risk only in the presence of concomitant inflammation.

- **Objective**: To investigate whether Lp(a) is associated with cardiovascular risk independent of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in both primary and secondary prevention populations.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: This cohort study uses data from three distinct cohorts, including one population-based cohort and two randomized clinical trials. Participants included individuals from the UK Biobank (data from 2006–2010) without prevalent ASCVD. The study also included participants in the FOURIER (TIMI 59) trial (data from 2013–2017) with baseline Lp(a) and hs-CRP data, and participants in the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial (data from 2010–2013) who had prevalent ASCVD and baseline values for Lp(a) and hs-CRP. The data analysis took place from November 2022 to November 2023.

- **Exposure**: Baseline plasma Lp(a), considered either as a continuous variable or dichotomized at 125 nmol/L.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: Risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI), or ischemic stroke, as well as the individual MACE components and peripheral artery disease (PAD).

- **Results**: Among 357,220 individuals in the UK Biobank without prevalent ASCVD, 232,699 (65%) had low hs-CRP (< 2 mg/L), and 124,521 (35%) had high hs-CRP (≥ 2 mg/L) values. In a Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for ASCVD risk factors, higher Lp(a) was associated with.

### Independence of lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-mediated cardiovascular risk: a participant-level meta-analysis [^1155vYha]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Previous studies have sought to address the relationship between Lp(a) and LDL-C levels for cardiovascular risk. In a similar meta-analysis of seven statin trials, the association between Lp(a) level and cardiovascular risk appeared to increase linearly and independently of LDL-C level when evaluated at specific Lp(a) cut points. This study also demonstrated that the independent risk associated with Lp(a) level persisted in statin-treated individuals. Our study adds to this previous work by demonstrating that Lp(a) and LDL-C levels are independent and additive predictors of cardiovascular risk. Whereas the previous study evaluated Lp(a)-mediated risk specifically, we evaluated the implications of LDL-C lowering on global cardiovascular risk in the context of elevated Lp(a) level, demonstrating that even with the lowest achieved LDL-C levels (both absolutely and relatively), overall risk remains increased in those with elevated Lp(a) level, and potent LDL-C lowering does not appear to completely offset the risk associated with elevated Lp(a) level.

In an observational study from MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis), participants were categorized similarly by Lp(a) level above or below 50 mg/dL and LDL-C level above or below 100 mg/dL. Over a mean follow-up of 13.4 years, there was increased risk when Lp(a) level alone was elevated (HR, 1.83 [95% CI, 1.02–3.27]) compared with when Lp(a) and LDL-C levels were both lower. MESA used baseline Lp(a) and LDL-C results, excluded individuals on lipid-lowering therapy, and had only a small number of individuals with isolated elevation of Lp(a).

### Non-genetic influences on lipoprotein(a) concentrations [^113jkNr2]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

The evidence on non-genetic influences on Lp(a) concentration indicates a potential role for diet, hormones, and liver and kidney diseases. In particular, strong consistent evidence suggests an impact on Lp(a) concentration by reducing dietary saturated fat intake, sex hormones, hormone replacement therapies, and kidney diseases and treatment modalities. In contrast, more data is needed to firmly establish any potential role for physical activity/exercise and certain liver diseases in influencing Lp(a) concentration.

Use of well-standardized assay methods for Lp(a) measurement is of paramount importance for studying non-genetic influences on Lp(a), as discussed by a further review of this series. Additional factors of consideration include large, sufficiently powered sample sizes and potential confounders, including, but not limited to, race/ethnicity, metabolic status, and genetic variability. Research to elucidate mechanisms underlying the changes in Lp(a) concentration and the modulation of Lp(a) properties beyond its plasma level will help improve our understanding of non-genetic influences on Lp(a). Finally, the clinical significance of the changes in Lp(a) concentration and its risk-mediating properties due to non-genetic factors, including lifestyle interventions, remains to be seen.

### Temporal trends in lipoprotein(a) concentrations: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study [^113GWdHh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). High credibility.

Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is an atherogenic lipoprotein that has been established as an independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Mendelian randomization studies have identified elevated Lp(a) concentrations as a causal risk factor for coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, calcific aortic stenosis, heart failure, and all‐cause mortality. The American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines consider elevated Lp(a) a risk‐enhancing factor that can help refine risk estimates in patients at borderline or intermediate risk for ASCVD events. The distribution of Lp(a) concentrations is skewed, with most patients having low values and a long tail of increasing values. Traditionally, two cutoff Lp(a) values, 30 mg/dL and 50 mg/dL, have been used to identify individuals at higher ASCVD risk, with 50 mg/dL considered a high concentration, representing roughly the 80th percentile in the populations studied.

Approximately 90% of plasma Lp(a) concentrations are determined by genetic factors related to copy number variants in the kringle IV type 2 domain and single‐nucleotide polymorphisms involving the LPA gene. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated significant variability in Lp(a) concentrations, apolipoprotein(a) isoform size distribution, and single‐nucleotide polymorphisms among different races and ethnicities. Black race is associated with the highest plasma Lp(a) concentrations among large populations studied, followed by South Asian, White, Hispanic, and East Asian populations. Approximately 33% of the Black participants in the study displayed elevated levels.

### Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol corrected for lipoprotein(a) cholesterol, risk thresholds, and cardiovascular events [^116er2xS]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

It is important to clarify that Lp(a)‐C risk is not equivalent to lipoprotein(a) mass/molar concentration-mediated risk because lipoprotein(a) additionally contains the apolipoprotein B‐100 component, the potentially thrombogenic apolipoprotein(a) peptide, as well as proinflammatory oxidized phospholipids that are significantly overrepresented on lipoprotein(a) versus LDL particles. These factors may additionally contribute to risk that is not reflected in its cholesterol content. In fact, lipoprotein(a) mass has been shown to be more predictive than Lp(a)‐C when measured in the same patients.

The primary objective of this study was to estimate the clinical impact of Lp(a)‐C's contribution to what is measured as "LDL‐C" and raise awareness of this highly underappreciated caveat of the "LDL‐C" biomarker. This study, in isolation, was not intended to provide guidance on clinical practice but rather to demonstrate the clinical need for accurately defining the contribution of true LDL versus lipoprotein(a) toward the risk attributed to what is currently measured and reported as LDL‐C.

### Risks of incident cardiovascular disease associated with concomitant elevations in lipoprotein(a) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-the Framingham heart study [^112s1Lqd]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Elevated lipoprotein(a) is a well-established risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease but is not measured in routine clinical care. Screening for high lipoprotein(a) in individuals with moderate elevations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) may identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular disease.

We examined 2,606 Framingham Offspring participants (median age, 54 years; 45% men) prospectively with a median follow-up of 15 years (n = 392 incident cardiovascular events). Individuals with higher (≥ 100 nmol/L) versus lower lipoprotein(a) were divided into groups based on LDL-C < 135 mg/dL versus ≥ 135 mg/dL.

In Cox models, after adjustment for known risk factors, high lipoprotein(a) (≥ 100 nmol/L) and LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL were each significant predictors of cardiovascular disease [LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL: hazard ratio (HR), 1.34; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09–1.64; P = 0.006; high lipoprotein(a): HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.03–1.66; P = 0.026].

- **Absolute cardiovascular disease risks at 15 years across groups**:
	- **High lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL**: 22.6% (n = 248)
	- **Low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL**: 17.3% (n = 758)
	- **High lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL**: 12.7% (n = 275)
	- **Low lipoprotein(a)/LDL-C < 135 mg/dL**: 11.5% (n = 1,328, reference group)

Among individuals with LDL-C ≥ 135 mg/dL, those with high lipoprotein(a) had a 43% higher risk [HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.05–1.97; P = 0.02]. The presence of high lipoprotein(a) with moderate LDL-C levels (135–159 mg/dL) yielded absolute risks equivalent to those with higher LDL-C levels.

### Lipoprotein(a) as a cardiovascular risk factor: Current status [^113HxoWu]. European Heart Journal (2010).

The aims of the study were, first, to critically evaluate lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a cardiovascular risk factor and, second, to advise on screening for elevated plasma Lp(a), on desirable levels, and on therapeutic strategies.

- **Methods and results**: The robust and specific association between elevated Lp(a) levels and increased cardiovascular disease (CVD)/coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, together with recent genetic findings, indicates that elevated Lp(a), like elevated LDL-cholesterol, is causally related to premature CVD/CHD. The association is continuous without a threshold or dependence on LDL- or non-HDL-cholesterol levels. Mechanistically, elevated Lp(a) levels may either induce a prothrombotic/anti-fibrinolytic effect as apolipoprotein(a) resembles both plasminogen and plasmin but has no fibrinolytic activity or may accelerate atherosclerosis because, like LDL, the Lp(a) particle is cholesterol-rich, or both. We advise that Lp(a) be measured once, using an isoform-insensitive assay, in subjects at intermediate or high CVD/CHD risk with premature CVD, familial hypercholesterolemia, a family history of premature CVD and/or elevated Lp(a), recurrent CVD despite statin treatment, ≥ 3% 10-year risk of fatal CVD according to European guidelines, and/or ≥ 10% 10-year risk of fatal + non-fatal CHD according to US guidelines. As a secondary priority after LDL-cholesterol reduction, we recommend a desirable level for Lp(a) < 80th percentile (less than ∼50 mg/dL). Treatment should primarily be niacin 1–3 g/day, as a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled intervention trials indicates.

### Non-genetic influences on lipoprotein(a) concentrations [^114mQYN6]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Low credibility.

An elevated level of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a genetically regulated, independent, causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, the extensive variability in Lp(a) levels between individuals and population groups cannot be fully explained by genetic factors, emphasizing a potential role for non-genetic factors. This review provides an overview of the evidence on non-genetic factors influencing Lp(a) levels with a particular focus on diet, physical activity, hormones, and certain pathological conditions.

- **Diet**: Findings from randomized controlled clinical trials show that diets lower in saturated fats modestly influence Lp(a) levels and often in the opposing direction to LDL cholesterol.

- **Physical activity**: Results from studies on physical activity and exercise have been inconsistent, ranging from no to minimal or moderate change in Lp(a) levels. These changes may be modulated by age, and the type, intensity, and duration of the exercise modality.

- **Hormones**: Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in postmenopausal women lowers Lp(a) levels, with oral therapy being more effective than transdermal estradiol. The type of HRT, dose of estrogen, and addition of progestogen do not modify the Lp(a)-lowering effect of HRT.

- **Pathological conditions**: Kidney diseases result in marked elevations in Lp(a) levels, albeit dependent on disease stages, dialysis modalities, and apolipoprotein(a) phenotypes. In contrast, Lp(a) levels are reduced in liver diseases in parallel with disease progression; however, population studies have yielded conflicting results on the associations between Lp(a) levels and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Overall, evidence points to a complex interplay of non-genetic factors that modulate Lp(a) levels, warranting further investigation to elucidate these relationships fully.

### Lipoprotein(a) and ethnicities [^113cfHjU]. Atherosclerosis (2022). High credibility.

Initial studies focusing on lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and its role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were conducted exclusively in Whites. Subsequently, multiple large-scale, independent investigations have established clear race/ethnic differences in plasma Lp(a) concentration and population distribution over the last four decades. Blacks have the highest Lp(a) level of all race/ethnic groups studied, followed by South Asians, Whites, Hispanics, and East Asians. The mechanisms underlying these differences have been sought, with genetics playing an important role in providing insights into the observed differences.

The association of elevated Lp(a) levels with cardiovascular disease risk across different race/ethnic groups has also been studied. These studies generally show that elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with cardiovascular risk in all groups. However, given race/ethnic differences in Lp(a) levels and distribution, finding an appropriate Lp(a) threshold that predicts risk, meaningfully categorizes risk among individuals, and guides preventive therapy use has been challenging.

- **Race/ethnic differences**: In this review, we examine the available evidence regarding race/ethnic differences in Lp(a) and the underlying mechanisms.
- **Cardiovascular risk association**: Additionally, we discuss the association of Lp(a) with cardiovascular risk in various race/ethnic groups and the nuances of identifying the appropriate Lp(a) threshold.

Key points on Lp(a) and ethnicities are described in Box 1.
