## Question

What are the clinical implications of an increased hematocrit?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical implications of increased hematocrit. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming whether the elevation reflects true erythrocytosis versus relative polycythemia. Then, I should classify the likely etiologies into primary clonal, secondary hypoxia-driven, congenital, or idiopathic categories. Next, I will assess pathophysiologic consequences, especially viscosity and thrombosis, followed by immediate clinical risks. After that, I should apply evidence-based management principles, including hematocrit targets, aspirin, and cytoreduction, and then tailor by etiology. Finally, I will integrate prognostic factors and highlight controversies and knowledge gaps to ensure the plan is balanced and current.

> Let me first confirm true erythrocytosis rather than a relative increase due to plasma contraction or dehydration. I need to check repeat CBCs, volume status, diuretic use, and smoking, and I should consider a red cell mass study when results are discordant with the clinical picture, especially when Hb/Hct are very high but marrow or JAK2 are equivocal, because plasma volume expansion can mask erythrocytosis in PV and relative erythrocytosis is common with diuretics or dehydration [^113xaLY7] [^116UaRBV].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should classify the etiology next. Primary clonal erythrocytosis is most often PV, typically JAK2 V617F-positive, with trilineage marrow panmyelosis and subnormal EPO; JAK2 exon 12 variants account for many JAK2 V617F-negative PV cases, so I should test both exons up front to avoid delays, while remembering that marked splenomegaly can artifactually lower Hb/Hct and that a rising personal baseline with JAK2 positivity can indicate masked PV even if thresholds are not met [^114NpGUc] [^113U2G39]. Secondary erythrocytosis reflects increased EPO from hypoxia (COPD, sleep apnea, high altitude), tumors, renal hypoperfusion, or exogenous testosterone; COPD cohorts show about 6% prevalence and highlight the need to screen for uncorrected hypoxemia and consider LTOT when indicated, so I should verify oxygenation, sleep studies, and medication exposures such as androgens [^111SctM6] [^113pRGuc]. Congenital causes include EPOR mutations and oxygen-sensing pathway defects like VHL and EPAS1; these can carry early thrombotic risk, so I need to consider germline testing when age of onset is early or family history is suggestive [^1128FsYu]. Idiopathic erythrocytosis remains after exhaustive exclusion; a nontrivial fraction harbor occult mutations, and the risk profile is likely lower than classic PV, though I should confirm with modern data before reassuring too much [^112GbRFV].

> I will now examine pathophysiology, and I need to ensure I link hematocrit to viscosity and flow. As hematocrit rises, whole-blood viscosity increases nonlinearly, worsening shear stress and microcirculatory stasis; however, wait, let me verify whether viscosity alone explains thrombosis across all erythrocytoses — evidence suggests cellular activation, endotheliopathy, and inflammation also contribute materially, particularly in PV, so viscosity is necessary but not sufficient to explain events [^117LboG9] [^1161t3iV] [^111249Gw]. I should also consider that iron deficiency paradoxically fuels erythropoiesis via HIF-driven EPO and may exacerbate thrombocytosis and platelet activation in PV, complicating risk assessment and symptomatology [^117PSu7o].

> Next, I should review immediate clinical risks. Thrombosis is the dominant morbidity in PV, with arterial events predominating even in low-risk cohorts, and risk clusters with age, prior thrombosis, leukocytosis, and cardiovascular comorbidities. Importantly, thrombotic events can drive disease progression to myelofibrosis and AML via inflammatory circuits, so early, durable control matters beyond just preventing a single event [^116ctYEa] [^113u9eYa] [^114ZaMhc]. Bleeding can occur, especially with extreme thrombocytosis and acquired von Willebrand syndrome, so I should double-check platelet counts and vWF function before prescribing aspirin when counts are very high; in perioperative settings, both very low and very high hematocrit predict worse 30-day outcomes, reinforcing the need to optimize Hct preoperatively [^112ecCRg] [^117LboG9].

> Let me think about universal management principles that apply across etiologies. I should confirm that a hematocrit target of less than 45% reduces cardiovascular death and major thrombosis in PV; the CYTO-PV randomized trial established this, and both BSH and NCCN endorse this threshold irrespective of sex, with the caveat that sex-specific normal ranges vary and the target remains absolute in PV management [^113FtFRw] [^114GNbVz]. I need to ensure modifiable cardiovascular risks are aggressively managed and quantified with validated tools such as QRISK at baseline and annually, and I should screen for and treat hypoxemia when secondary erythrocytosis is suspected because oxygen therapy can lower EPO and reduce erythrocytosis burden [^117X7wCv] [^111SctM6].

> For PV specifically, I should confirm the cornerstone is phlebotomy to maintain Hct less than 45%, typically 300–450 mL per session in induction until the target is reached, then individualized maintenance. If frequent phlebotomy is required despite cytoreduction, that signals inadequate disease control and higher thrombotic risk, so I need to escalate therapy rather than tolerate phlebotomy dependence [^113LwTnU] [^113ssbHc]. Low-dose aspirin is recommended for most PV patients unless contraindicated, with attention to extreme thrombocytosis and bleeding history; cytoreduction is indicated for high-risk patients by age or thrombosis, and also for low-risk patients who have poor phlebotomy tolerance, uncontrolled Hct, leukocytosis, extreme thrombocytosis, or progressive symptoms, with hydroxyurea first-line and interferon favored in younger patients or during childbearing years [^114GNbVz] [^117KrWc7] [^112dohgD]. If hydroxyurea fails or is not tolerated, ruxolitinib is FDA-approved and reasonable, and I should monitor for cytopenias and infections; I also need to remember that iron deficiency is common and may worsen symptoms, so judicious iron repletion can be considered when tissue iron deficiency is symptomatic, but I must watch for rebound erythrocytosis and adjust cytoreduction accordingly [^115w8CLH] [^116SZMJi].

> But wait, what if the erythrocytosis is secondary rather than clonal? I should tailor therapy to the cause. In hypoxic lung disease, long-term oxygen therapy is first-line to suppress EPO and reduce erythrocytosis, and I should coordinate with pulmonology; in post-renal transplant erythrocytosis, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are first-line pharmacotherapy, with venesection reserved for persistent symptoms or Hct above about 50% when other measures fail; in idiopathic erythrocytosis, evidence for aspirin or venesection is limited, so I should individualize based on symptoms and thrombotic history, avoid cytoreduction, and set a pragmatic venesection target around 55% unless there is a thrombotic history, in which case a stricter target is reasonable [^113pRGuc] [^114foC2y] [^111Zw8YY] [^112GbRFV]. For congenital erythrocytoses, I should consider venesection and low-dose aspirin when symptomatic or when there is a personal or family history of thrombosis, and I should screen for complications such as pulmonary hypertension in EPAS1/VHL-related disease; importantly, I must not extrapolate PV data wholesale to these entities without caution [^111cWpya] [^112Bgn6y].

> I should double-check prognostic factors that modify vigilance. Age over 60 years and prior thrombosis consistently stratify thrombotic risk, while leukocytosis, splenomegaly, elevated LDH, abnormal karyotype, and higher JAK2 allele burden correlate with progression to myelofibrosis or AML. High molecular risk mutations such as ASXL1, SRSF2, and IDH1/2 portend worse survival and transformation risk, though they do not yet change first-line cytoreductive choices, so I need to monitor closely and consider early transplant referral if accelerated or blast phase emerges [^116ctYEa] [^113rZ2eP] [^117T2Uf6] [^113mRmAf].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also acknowledge controversies so I do not overstate certainty. Some observational and translational data question whether hematocrit alone drives thrombosis in all erythrocytoses, noting thrombosis in conditions like Chuvash erythrocytosis appears partly independent of hematocrit and that cellular and inflammatory mechanisms likely contribute; this argues for nuanced, etiology-specific management rather than reflexive phlebotomy in every secondary case, and it underscores the need for better biomarkers beyond Hct to predict events [^111249Gw] [^117PSu7o]. Additionally, while the CYTO-PV trial established the under-45% target, some guidelines allow slightly higher thresholds in select men without JAK2 mutations pending further evaluation, so I should individualize and reassess as new evidence emerges [^114NpGUc].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined sequence: confirm true erythrocytosis, classify the etiology with JAK2/EPO/marrow as indicated, quantify thrombotic and bleeding risk, apply universal principles such as Hct less than 45% in PV and aggressive cardiovascular risk modification, tailor therapy to the cause with oxygen, ACEi/ARB, or selective venesection as appropriate, and embed prognostic surveillance for progression. Throughout, I should verify assumptions, adjust for comorbidities, and communicate uncertainty where evidence is evolving so that management remains safe, evidence-based, and adaptable to new data [^114NpGUc] [^113FtFRw] [^116ctYEa].

Increased hematocrit reflects a higher red cell mass and is clinically significant because it increases blood viscosity [^117LboG9], which elevates the risk of **thrombosis** (arterial and venous) [^113FtFRw] and ischemic events [^notfound]. Persistent elevation warrants evaluation for **primary causes** such as polycythemia vera (JAK2-driven myeloproliferative neoplasm) [^114NpGUc] or **secondary causes** such as hypoxia, erythropoietin-secreting tumors, or exogenous androgens [^1177Jv8R]. Management focuses on confirming true erythrocytosis, identifying the cause, and reducing hematocrit to **< 45%** [^113FtFRw] using phlebotomy, low-dose aspirin [^114GNbVz], and cytoreductive therapy when indicated [^117KrWc7] to lower thrombotic risk and improve outcomes [^1177Jv8R].

---

## Clinical implications of increased hematocrit

Increased hematocrit has several **clinical implications**, including:

- **Increased blood viscosity**: Elevated hematocrit increases blood viscosity, which can impair blood flow and increase the risk of thrombosis [^112cEBXA] [^114e6gBM].

- **Thrombotic risk**: Patients with elevated hematocrit have an increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis [^113FtFRw].

- **Ischemic events**: Elevated hematocrit is associated with an increased risk of ischemic events, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease [^notfound].

- **Symptoms**: Patients may experience symptoms such as headache, dizziness, fatigue, pruritus, and erythromelalgia [^1177Jv8R].

---

## Causes of increased hematocrit

Increased hematocrit can be classified as **absolute erythrocytosis** (true increase in red cell mass) or **relative erythrocytosis** (hemoconcentration due to plasma volume reduction). Absolute erythrocytosis can be **primary (polycythemia vera)** or **secondary (hypoxia-driven, erythropoietin-secreting tumors, exogenous androgens)** [^1148rerc].

| **Category** | **Causes** |
|-|-|
| Absolute erythrocytosis | - Polycythemia vera (JAK2 mutation) [^114NpGUc] <br/> - Secondary erythrocytosis (hypoxia, erythropoietin-secreting tumors, exogenous androgens) [^111SctM6] <br/> - Congenital erythrocytosis (erythropoietin receptor mutations, oxygen-sensing pathway mutations) [^1128FsYu] |
| Relative erythrocytosis | - Dehydration <br/> - Diuretic use <br/> - Gaisböck syndrome (hypertension-related hemoconcentration) |

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

Diagnostic evaluation of increased hematocrit includes:

- **Confirm true erythrocytosis**: Repeat CBC, assess plasma volume, and exclude relative erythrocytosis [^116wMXhs].

- **Identify underlying cause**: JAK2 mutation testing, serum erythropoietin levels, bone marrow biopsy, and evaluation for secondary causes (hypoxia, tumors, exogenous androgens) [^1177Jv8R].

- **Risk stratification**: Assess cardiovascular risk factors, thrombotic history, and symptoms [^111mce2m].

---

## Management strategies

Management of increased hematocrit depends on the **underlying cause** and the patient's **risk profile**:

- **Phlebotomy**: Therapeutic phlebotomy is the cornerstone of management for polycythemia vera, aiming to maintain hematocrit levels below 45% [^113LwTnU] [^113FtFRw].

- **Low-dose aspirin**: Recommended for low-risk patients to reduce thrombotic risk [^114GNbVz].

- **Cytoreductive therapy**: Hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha, or ruxolitinib for high-risk patients or those intolerant to phlebotomy [^117KrWc7] [^115w8CLH].

- **Address secondary causes**: Treat underlying hypoxia, remove exogenous androgens, or surgically remove erythropoietin-secreting tumors [^113pRGuc].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Untreated or poorly controlled erythrocytosis carries significant morbidity and mortality due to **thrombotic events** (myocardial infarction, stroke, deep vein thrombosis) [^113FtFRw] and progression to myelofibrosis or acute leukemia in polycythemia vera [^117T2Uf6]. Effective management with **phlebotomy**, **low-dose aspirin**, and **cytoreductive therapy** significantly improves prognosis and reduces complications [^1177Jv8R].

---

Increased hematocrit signifies a higher red cell mass, which increases blood viscosity and thrombotic risk [^114e6gBM]. It requires a **structured evaluation** to distinguish absolute from relative erythrocytosis and to identify the cause. Management centers on reducing hematocrit to **< 45%** [^113FtFRw] and addressing the underlying etiology to lower thrombotic risk and improve outcomes [^1177Jv8R].

Introduction

The clinical course of essential thrombocythemia (ET) and polycythemia vera (PV) is characterized by an increased incidence of vascular complications and a tendency to progress to myelofibrosis (MF) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Over the past decade, new molecular and clinical knowledge in ET and PV has led to a significant improvement in the diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic processes. Despite these advancements, many uncertainties remain concerning aspects of clinical decision-making. We identified some unmet needs in clinical practice and research that urgently require new scientific initiatives. For each of these, we reviewed the most significant existing evidence and made proposals for translational and clinical investigations. We acknowledge that several other clinically relevant unmet needs in the management of patients with PV and ET remain. These could not be addressed due to space constrains, and include, above all, prediction of evolution to secondary forms of myelofibrosis, identification of genetic predictors of survival and of specific subgroups of patients to include in intervention trials with novel drugs that are claimed to modify disease course.

Implications of high molecular risk on management of polycythemia vera

Currently, the presence of HMR mutations does not alter management recommendations or target thresholds for cytoreductive therapies. While there is increasing information about predictors of response to therapies such as interferon, there is no clear recommendation to select therapies based on concomitant mutational profile. Given that concomitant mutations can be cleared with the driver mutation in some cases, it could be speculated that selection of therapies that have increased chance of inducing molecular remissions might be preferable. Allogeneic HSCT is currently not recommended for the treatment of PV that has not clinically progressed to secondary MF or AML, even in the presence of HMR mutations. Nevertheless, genomic features are highly predictive of progression from chronic phase to the accelerated phase or blast phaseand MIPSS-PV high-risk patients have a predicted median overall survival of 4.6 years. Thus, close monitoring for clinical symptoms and signs of clonal progression, especially in the setting of HMR is warranted to facilitate early referral of eligible patients for allogeneic HSCT.

### Risk of thrombosis according to need of phlebotomies in patients with polycythemia vera treated with hydroxyurea [^114xLKCd]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Hematocrit control below 45% is associated with a lower rate of thrombosis in polycythemia vera. In patients receiving hydroxyurea, this target can be achieved with hydroxyurea alone or with the combination of hydroxyurea plus phlebotomies. However, the clinical implications of phlebotomy requirement under hydroxyurea therapy are unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the need for additional phlebotomies during the first five years of hydroxyurea therapy in 533 patients with polycythemia vera. Patients requiring 3 or more phlebotomies per year (n = 85, 16%) showed a worse hematocrit control than those requiring 2 or less phlebotomies per year (n = 448, 84%). There were no significant differences between the two study groups regarding leukocyte and platelet counts. Patients requiring 3 or more phlebotomies per year received significantly higher doses of hydroxyurea than the remaining patients. A significant higher rate of thrombosis was found in patients treated with hydroxyurea plus 3 or more phlebotomies per year compared to hydroxyurea with 0–2 phlebotomies per year (20.5% vs. 5.3% at 3 years; P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for thrombosis were phlebotomy dependency (HR: 3.3, 95%CI: 1.5–6.9; P = 0.002) and thrombosis at diagnosis (HR: 4.7, 95%CI: 2.3–9.8; P < 0.0001). The proportion of patients fulfilling the European LeukemiaNet criteria of resistance/intolerance to hydroxyurea was significantly higher in the group requiring 3 or more phlebotomies per year (18.7% vs. 7.1%; P = 0.001) mainly due to extrahematologic toxicity. In conclusion, phlebotomy requirement under hydroxyurea therapy identifies a subset of patients with increased proliferation of polycythemia vera and higher risk of thrombosis.

### How I treat polycythemia vera [^116UaRBV]. Blood (2019). Medium credibility.

Since its discovery, polycythemia vera (PV) has challenged clinicians responsible for its diagnosis and management and scientists investigating its pathogenesis. As a clonal hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) disorder, PV is a neoplasm but its driver mutations result in overproduction of morphologically and functionally normal blood cells. PV arises in an HSC but it can present initially as isolated erythrocytosis, leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, or any combination of these together with splenomegaly or myelofibrosis, and it can take years for a true panmyelopathy to appear. PV shares the same JAK2 mutation as essential thrombocytosis and primary myelofibrosis, but erythrocytosis only occurs in PV. However, unlike secondary causes of erythrocytosis, in PV, the plasma volume is frequently expanded, masking the erythrocytosis and making diagnosis difficult if this essential fact is ignored. PV is not a monolithic disorder: female patients deregulate fewer genes and clinically behave differently than their male counterparts, while some PV patients are genetically predisposed to an aggressive clinical course. Nevertheless, based on what we have learned over the past century, most PV patients can lead long and productive lives. In this review, using clinical examples, I describe how I diagnose and manage PV in an evidence-based manner without relying on chemotherapy.

### Serum erythropoietin levels in essential thrombocythemia: phenotypic and prognostic correlates [^112PEhFz]. Blood Cancer Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Serum erythropoietin (EPO) level below the normal reference range is widely accepted as a minor diagnostic criterion for polycythemia vera (PV) and has retained its value in the revised 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme of myeloid neoplasms. While over 80% of PV patients exhibit subnormal EPO values, very little is known about the incidence, phenotypic connotation, or prognostic significance of serum EPO levels in essential thrombocythemia (ET). Studies on this subject remain, in fact, exceedingly rare. Previous reports limited to small patient populations have suggested that subnormal EPO levels may be more prevalent than expected in ET, up to 50% in some series. Furthermore, one study comprising 39 untreated ET patients revealed a heightened risk of vascular events and significantly shorter time to initiation of myelosuppressive therapy in those exhibiting subnormal EPO values. These observations, albeit preliminary, raise the possibility that serum EPO may be relevant, perhaps even prognostically impactful in ET. Accordingly, after securing a diagnostically pure cohort of untreated strictly WHO-defined chronic phase ET patients, we documented serum EPO measurements, laboratory and clinical features, and overall, myelofibrosis-free, and polycythemia vera-free survival stratified by EPO level.

The current study was approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board. Diagnosis of ET was in strict accordance with the 2016 WHO criteria. ET patients with available EPO measurements at diagnosis or during their chronic phase (March 1994–November 2017) were considered under the following strict provisions: (i) all patients were in chronic phase with no evidence of myelofibrotic or leukemic transformation; (ii) all patients were untreated with cytoreductive agents at the time of sample collection and those with EPO levels drawn at diagnosis were also previously untreated with cytoreductive agents; (iii) all patients had hemoglobin levels above sex-adjusted values for anemia (no more than two standard deviations below the mean or > 13.5 g/dL in men and > 12.0 g/dL in women), thus excluding anemia as a potential confounding variable; and (iv) all patients with hemoglobin values exceeding the threshold for PV criteria had clinical and morphological parameters carefully assessed and all cases of masked PV systematically excluded. Few individuals with hemoglobin values exceeding the threshold for PV but without meeting PV criteria were found to have either transient elevations in hemoglobin or clear underlying causes of secondary polycythemia such as hypoxia, smoking, or elite athletic training, among others.

Management of secondary erythrocytosis

Idiopathic erythrocytosis

Idiopathic erythrocytosis (IE) is a diagnosis of exclusion. It is an absolute erythrocytosis of no identifiable cause that is more frequent in males (Randi et al, 2016). Every effort should be made to exclude identifiable primary and secondary causes of erythrocytosis (including PV and congenital erythrocytosis) before a diagnosis of IE is made. Erythropoietin (EPO) levels are unhelpful as they are below normal in a third of patients, suggesting a primary erythrocytosis, and elevated in two‐thirds, suggesting a secondary erythrocytosis. Recent studies using sequencing analysis have identified a number of patients who were previously diagnosed with IE as having mutations in either erythrocytosis‐associated genes or novel genes (Bento et al, 2014; Camps et al, 2016), suggesting that at least some of these cases have a genetic basis.

Although previous data suggested that the risk of thrombosis and/or haemorrhage was considerably elevated in IE, these observations were based on old evidence that predated the identification of the JAK2 V617F mutation and therefore some patients with PV are likely to have been included in the study cohorts. More contemporary data suggests that the risk of thrombosis/bleeding is low in IE (Bertozzi et al, 2017). There are no clinical studies evaluating the use of aspirin or venesection in IE and therefore evidence‐based recommendations cannot be made. Cytoreductive therapy is not indicated in patients with IE. The thrombotic risk factors should be evaluated in each case and, in selected cases, the Hct can be controlled by venesection. There is no evidence on which to determine the target Hct as relevance of data from PV patients for IE is unclear. A pragmatic approach is required for these patients with rigorous control of vascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and smoking and use of aspirin in cases where this would be otherwise clinically indicated for primary or secondary prevention. It would be reasonable to venesect patients with an arbitrary target Hct of < 0·55, although a lower target Hct of < 0·45 may be appropriate for a patient with a history of thrombosis considered to be related to the erythrocytosis.

### Re-evaluation of hematocrit as a determinant of thrombotic risk in erythrocytosis [^117PSu7o]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Certain disorders with elevated hematocrit, such as PV, CE, primary familial and congenital polycythemia or erythrocytosis (EPOR mutation), and EPAS1 gain-of-function mutations, are associated with thrombotic complications. These conditions are characterized by diverse cellular and metabolic changes that could be directly associated with thrombotic risk, irrespective of hematocrit level. The challenge in these conditions is to elucidate factors for the thrombotic risk other than the elevated hematocrit, and to define what, if any, role that viscosity plays in thrombotic risk. Defining these thrombosis-predisposing factors would provide the basis for identifying and developing novel targeted therapies for these disorders. The evidence we have presented here points to favoring the use of myelosuppressive therapy for intermediate- and high-risk PV, as this approach has been proven to decrease the risk of thrombosis in PV. Furthermore, we trust that the urge to correct any abnormal laboratory data by a therapeutic intervention should be tempered by consideration of the risk-benefit ratio of any such intervention. The routine practice of phlebotomy for elevated hematocrit, with its inevitable iron deficiency (which leads to inhibition of PHD2, increased HIF, and increased erythropoietin) and potential detrimental thrombotic effects, should be re-evaluated. We hope that this review will encourage more studies to pursue the challenge of defining the specific molecular basis of thrombosis in diverse types of polycythemia and erythrocytosis. Improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of these entities should be extended to the development of targeted approaches for the prevention and therapy of thrombotic complications. A review of potential molecular mechanisms contributing to thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms was published at the time of the submission of this manuscript.

### Phenotypical differences and thrombosis rates in secondary erythrocytosis versus polycythemia vera [^112jK7Y9]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

Erythrocytosis is a common condition and an increasingly frequent reason for consultation in hematology. Since the inception of the 2016 World Health Organization (WHO) 2016 criteria, in lowering the hemoglobin (Hb) and hematocrit (Hct) diagnostic thresholds to 165 g/L and 49% in men, and 160 g/L and 48% in women, respectively, it has been estimated that 4.1% of unselected males (outpatients) have Hb levels exceeding these values. With only a minority of these having polycythemia vera (PV), hematologists are witnessing a new preponderance of referrals for secondary erythrocytosis (SE) which has yielded novel and significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. While the classic coupling of JAK2 –positive/subnormal serum erythropoietin (Epo) greatly increases the likelihood of PV diagnosis, those not strictly fulfilling these criteria represent a heterogeneous population for whom a systematic approach has been difficult to establish. Though efforts have been made to operationally discriminate between the various forms of erythrocytosis, data comparatively assessing SE and PV populations are scarce. These support different clinical profiles, while reports of outcomes, including thrombosis, have been inconsistent. Furthermore, little information exists on how these populations are managed in a real world setting, and it may be speculated that SE cohorts are subject either to under or over investigating and treatment. We conducted a direct comparison of clinical and laboratory features, outcomes, diagnostic workup, and treatment patterns in cohorts with SE vs WHO-defined PV.

### Differential diagnosis and management of polycythemia [^112cEBXA]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

One percent to 5% of all newborns in the United States are polycythemic. As the venous hematocrit rises above 65%, the thickness or viscosity of whole blood also increases, potentially compromising blood flow to a variety of organs. Fortunately, relatively few infants who have neonatal polycythemia or hyperviscosity develop complications attributable to their thick blood; however, controversy and the need for continued research envelop the issue of which infants are at risk and need to be treated. This article reviews the differential diagnosis, clinical presentation, and treatment of neonatal polycythemia.

Regarding medical management for polycythemia vera, more specifically with respect to cytoreductive therapy, ESMO 2015 guidelines recommend to obtain careful evaluation for the choice of second-line myelosuppressive drugs for PV because some drugs administered after hydroxyurea may enhance the risk of acute leukemia.
Recognize that when hydroxyurea is used with, or succeeded by, other agents, including busulfan, it will significantly increase the long-term risk of leukemia.

### Clinical insights into the origins of thrombosis in myeloproliferative neoplasms [^1161t3iV]. Blood (2021). Medium credibility.

Philadelphia chromosome-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis, are hematopoietic stem cell disorders that are defined by activating mutations in signal transduction pathways and are characterized clinically by the overproduction of platelets, red blood cells, and neutrophils, significant burden of disease-specific symptoms, and high rates of vascular events. The focus of this review is to critically reevaluate the clinical burden of thrombosis in MPNs, to review the clinical associations among clonal hematopoiesis, JAK2V617F burden, inflammation, and thrombosis, and to provide insights into novel primary and secondary thrombosis-prevention strategies.

### Thrombosis-driven disease progression in JAK2-Mutant polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: reassessing risk-based management [^114ZaMhc]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

This paper explores emerging therapies in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, focusing on thrombosis as a driver of disease progression leading to myelofibrosis, blast phase, second cancers, and mortality. While the thrombosis rate in high-risk patients has declined, it remains persistently high in low-risk individuals, with most events being arterial. Inflammation driven by JAK2 V617F mutation plays a primary role in pathogenesis, and mounting evidence suggests arterial thrombosis itself can fuel a self-sustaining cycle of inflammation, thereby accelerating hematologic and systemic complications. Early intervention with cytoreductive and anti-inflammatory drugs may not only prevent incidental thrombosis but also disrupt this inflammatory circuit.

### Polycythemia vera: rapid evidence review [^1177Jv8R]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Polycythemia vera is one of three stem-cell-derived myeloid malignancies commonly known as myeloproliferative neoplasms. It is characterized by erythrocytosis, often with associated leukocytosis and thrombocytosis. It has a significant negative impact on overall mortality and morbidity in the form of arterial and venous clots, symptoms of fatigue and pruritus, and conversion to leukemia and myelofibrosis. The World Health Organization's major diagnostic criteria include an elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit level, abnormal results on bone marrow biopsy, and presence of the Janus kinase 2 genetic mutation, which is present in approximately 98% of cases. The only minor criterion is a subnormal erythropoietin level, which helps differentiate polycythemia vera from common causes of secondary erythrocytosis such as smoking, sleep apnea, and testosterone use. First-line treatments, such as low-dose aspirin and goal-directed phlebotomy to a hematocrit level of less than 45% to reduce thrombotic events, improve quality of life and prolong survival. When indicated, cytoreductive therapy, primarily with hydroxyurea, can be added with consideration of second-line agents such as pegylated interferon-alfa, busulfan, and ruxolitinib, depending on the clinical scenario. Smoking cessation and cardiometabolic disease are modifiable risk factors that should be addressed to reduce the risk of thrombosis. Currently, no medications have been shown to cure the disease or to reduce the risk of conversion to leukemia and myelofibrosis.

### Clonal analyses reveal associations of JAK2V617F homozygosity with hematologic features, age and gender in polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia [^115tGbHK]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

Subclones homozygous for JAK2V617F are more common and larger in patients with polycythemia vera compared to essential thrombocythemia, but their role in determining phenotype remains unclear. We genotyped 4564 erythroid colonies from 59 patients with polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia to investigate whether the proportion of JAK2V617F -homozygous precursors, compared to heterozygous precursors, is associated with clinical or demographic features. In polycythemia vera, a higher proportion of homozygous-mutant precursors was associated with more extreme blood counts at diagnosis, consistent with a causal role for homozygosity in polycythemia vera pathogenesis. Larger numbers of homozygous-mutant colonies were associated with older age, and with male gender in polycythemia vera but female gender in essential thrombocythemia. These results suggest that age promotes development or expansion of homozygous-mutant clones and that gender modulates the phenotypic consequences of JAK2V617F homozygosity, thus providing a potential explanation for the long-standing observations of a preponderance of men with polycythemia vera but of women with essential thrombocythemia.

### Classification and molecular biology of polycythemias (erythrocytoses) and thrombocytosis [^115FS2K1]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

In this article, polycythemic disorders are classified based on the current understanding of biology of erythropoieses and divided into primary and secondary polycythemias. Special emphasis is given to recently uncovered molecular bases of newly described congenital polycythemic disorders. This clarification of the pathophysiology of some of the congenital polycythemic states has obvious utility for more accurate diagnosis and rational prognostic determination. The molecular basis of congenital thrombocytoses is only beginning to be uncovered. In contrast, the molecular bases of polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia remain unknown, thus their diagnostic criteria are imprecise and their treatment remains largely empirical. The central premise of this article is that deciphering the molecular basis of human diseases leads to improved understanding of hematopoiesis, precise diagnosis, and the potential for development of a specific therapy.

### Congenital polycythemias / erythrocytoses [^1128FsYu]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

Congenital polycythemias may result from inherited defects in hypoxia sensing, from inherited intrinsic defects in red blood cell precursors, or from inherited conditions that cause low tissue oxygen tension and secondary polycythemia. Conditions of defective hypoxia sensing feature inappropriately normal or elevated serum erythropoietin (Epo) concentrations in the setting of normoxia and erythrocytosis. They are often due to homozygous or compound heterozygous germline mutations in the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) but without increased incidence of tumors. Affected persons have a high risk of arterial thrombosis and early mortality. The molecular biology of rare polycythemic patients with a single mutated VHL allele remains obscure. Primary congenital and familial polycythemias are characterized by low Epo levels and increased erythroid precursor responsiveness to Epo. They are often due to heterozygous gain-of function mutations in the gene for erythropoietin receptor (EPOR). Secondary congenital polycythemias have low tissue oxygen tension due to hemoglobins with high affinity for oxygen, low erythrocyte 2,3 biphosphoglycerate levels, methemoglobinemia or cyanotic heart or lung disease. Whether phlebotomy therapy reduces complications and prolongs survival in congenital polycythemia is not known.

Background

Current treatment recommendations for patients with polycythemia vera call for maintaining a hematocrit of less than 45%, but this therapeutic strategy has not been tested in a randomized clinical trial.

Methods

We randomly assigned 365 adults with JAK2-positive polycythemia vera who were being treated with phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, or both to receive either more intensive treatment (target hematocrit, < 45%) (low-hematocrit group) or less intensive treatment (target hematocrit, 45 to 50%) (high-hematocrit group). The primary composite end point was the time until death from cardiovascular causes or major thrombotic events. The secondary end points were cardiovascular events, cardiovascular hospitalizations, incidence of cancer, progression to myelofibrosis, myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation, and hemorrhage. An intention-to-treat analysis was performed.

Results

After a median follow-up of 31 months, the primary end point was recorded in 5 of 182 patients in the low-hematocrit group (2.7%) and 18 of 183 patients in the high-hematocrit group (9.8%) (hazard ratio in the high-hematocrit group, 3.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.45 to 10.53; P = 0.007). The primary end point plus superficial-vein thrombosis occurred in 4.4% of patients in the low-hematocrit group, as compared with 10.9% in the high-hematocrit group (hazard ratio, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.19 to 6.12; P = 0.02). Progression to myelofibrosis, myelodysplasia or leukemic transformation, and bleeding were observed in 6, 2, and 2 patients, respectively, in the low-hematocrit group, as compared with 2, 1, and 5 patients, respectively, in the high-hematocrit group. There was no significant between-group difference in the rate of adverse events.

Conclusions

In patients with polycythemia vera, those with a hematocrit target of less than 45% had a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular death and major thrombosis than did those with a hematocrit target of 45 to 50%.

Our current diagnostic approach in polycythemia vera

PV is currently defined by an acquired increase in hemoglobin/hematocrit level above 16.5 gm/dL/49% in men and 16 g/dL/48% in women, in the context of a JAK2 mutation and characteristic bone marrow morphology. The 2016 WHO classification system for hematopoietic tumors recognizes the almost perfect association between PV and a JAK2 mutation, as well as the fact that JAK2 V617F is also detected in 50–70% of patients with either ET or PMF. The formal diagnostic table lists three major (Hb/Hct level above 16.5 g/dL/49% in men and 16 g/dL/48% in women or red cell mass > 25% above mean normal predicted value; consistent bone marrow morphology; and presence of a JAK2 V617F or exon 12 mutation) and one minor (subnormal serum erythropoietin (Epo) level) criteria; WHO-qualified diagnosis requires the presence of either all three major criteria or the first two major criteria plus the minor criterion. Our current approach to the diagnosis of PV is consistent with these fundamentals, with some modifications that accommodate clinical practice scenarios, which are further elaborated below (Fig. 1). In general, screening for other mutations through next-generation sequencing (NGS) or cytogenetic abnormalities is more useful in terms of prognostication (discussed below in the section of prognosis) rather than diagnosis.

Fig. 1
Current diagnostic algorithm for polycythemia vera.

Our approach to diagnosis of polycythemia vera (PV).

JAK2 mutation screening

Virtually all patients with PV harbor either JAK2 V617F (exon 14; 97% sensitivity) or JAK2 exon 12 mutation (majority of JAK2 V617F-negative cases). Accordingly, the first step in approaching the diagnosis of PV should include JAK2 mutation screening, and we favor upfront targeting of both exons 14 and 12, in order to avoid undue delay in the diagnostic process; it should also be noted that peripheral blood and bone marrow samples are equally informative in detecting and quantifying JAK2 V617F. In order to address issues with inconclusive test results and also provide an additional layer of diagnostic comfort, we recommend concomitant measurement of serum Epo level, which is expected to be subnormal in more than 85% of patients with PV. JAK2 mutation screening might also be a more sensitive diagnostic tool, compared to bone marrow morphology, in patients presenting with "MPN-unclassifiable (MPN-U)" phenotype or splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT), as discussed below.

### Quality of life in myeloproliferative neoplasms: symptoms and management implications [^111gFxM7]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms include essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and myelofibrosis. They are characterized by abnormal myeloid proliferation. Patients suffer from debilitating constitutional symptoms and splenomegaly. There have been advances in understanding the impact on quality of life in myeloproliferative neoplasms. Owing to the chronicity of these diseases, symptoms are considered in response criteria for clinical trials. This review wills cover how quality of life is measured in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasm. We review the impact of treatment options, including JAK inhibitors, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and medications in development. We discuss nonpharmacologic methods of improving symptoms and quality of life.

### Polycythemia vera [^114e6gBM]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera is a chronic myeloproliferative disorder characterized by increased red blood cell mass. The resultant hyperviscosity of the blood predisposes such patients to thrombosis. Polycythemia vera should be suspected in patients with elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit levels, splenomegaly, or portal venous thrombosis. Secondary causes of increased red blood cell mass (e.g., heavy smoking, chronic pulmonary disease, renal disease) are more common than polycythemia vera and must be excluded. Diagnosis is made using criteria developed by the Polycythemia Vera Study Group; major criteria include elevated red blood cell mass, normal oxygen saturation, and palpable splenomegaly. Untreated patients may survive for six to 18 months, whereas adequate treatment may extend life expectancy to more than 10 years. Treatment includes phlebotomy with the possible addition of myelosuppressive agents based on a risk-stratified approach. Agents under investigation include interferon alfa-2b, anagrelide, and aspirin. Consultation with a hematologist is recommended.

### Re-evaluation of hematocrit as a determinant of thrombotic risk in erythrocytosis [^111249Gw]. Haematologica (2019). Medium credibility.

Here we critically evaluate the role of elevated hematocrit as the principal determinant of thrombotic risk in polycythemia and erythrocytosis, defined by an expansion of red cell mass. Since red cell volume determination is no longer readily available, in clinical practice, polycythemia and erythrocytosis are defined by elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit. Thrombosis is common in Chuvash erythrocytosis and polycythemia vera. Although the increased thrombotic risk is assumed to be due to the elevated hematocrit and an associated increase in blood viscosity, thrombosis does not accompany most types of erythrocytosis. We review studies indicating that the occurrence of thrombosis in Chuvash erythrocytosis is independent of hematocrit, that the thrombotic risk is paradoxically increased by phlebotomy in Chuvash erythrocytosis, and that, when compared to chemotherapy, phlebotomy is associated with increased thrombotic risk in polycythemia vera. Inherited and environmental causes that lead to polycythemia and erythrocytosis are accompanied by diverse cellular changes that could directly affect thrombotic risk, irrespective of the elevated hematocrit. The pressing issue in these disorders is to define factors other than elevated hematocrit that determine thrombotic risk. Defining these predisposing factors in polycythemia and erythrocytosis should then lead to rational therapies and facilitate development of targeted interventions.

Cyanosis in adult congenital heart disease (ACHD) — definition, evaluation, and iron management: The definition of cyanosis is "bluish discoloration of the skin and/or mucous membranes resulting from inadequate oxygenation of the blood", and for cyanosis to be visible, at least 5 g/L of unsaturated hemoglobin in tissue is needed. Cyanotic heart disease encompasses a widely heterogeneous group; therefore, an individualized approach is needed for each patient according to the clinical details. Secondary erythrocytosis and polycythemia are fundamentally different conditions that require different treatments. Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in cyanotic individuals; consequences may include stroke and myocardial ischemia, and iron deficiency requires assessment of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels because mean corpuscular volume is not a reliable screening test. Limited data suggest that treatment of transferrin saturation < 20% with iron supplementation until iron stores are replete can be done safely.

### Evaluation of WHO criteria for diagnosis of polycythemia vera: a prospective analysis [^113xaLY7]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

We prospectively evaluated the accuracy of the 2007 World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for diagnosing polycythemia vera (PV), especially in "early-stage" patients. A total of 28 of 30 patients were diagnosed as PV owing to an elevated Cr-51 red cell mass (RCM), JAK2 positivity, and at least 1 minor criterion. A total of 18 PV patients did not meet the WHO criterion for an increased hemoglobin value and 8 did not meet the WHO criterion for an increased hematocrit value. Bone marrow morphology was very valuable for diagnosis. Low serum erythropoietin (EPO) values were specific for PV, but normal EPO values were found at presentation (20%). We recommend revision of the WHO criteria, especially to distinguish early-stage PV from essential thrombocythemia. Major criteria remain JAK2 positivity and increased red cell volume, but Cr-51 RCM is mandatory for patients who do not meet the defined elevated hemoglobin or hematocrit value (> 18.5 g/dL and 60% in men and > 16.5 g/dL and 56% in women, respectively). Minor criteria remain bone marrow histology or a low serum EPO value. For patients with a normal EPO value, marrow examination is mandatory for diagnostic confirmation. Because the therapies for myeloproliferative disorders differ, our data have major clinical implications.

### Secondary polycythemia in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: prevalence and risk factors [^111SctM6]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary polycythemia may have important clinical impact, including various comorbidities (e.g. pulmonary hypertension and venous thromboembolism) and mortality, on COPD patients. This study has important clinical implications related to the interpretation of and intervention on polycythemia in COPD patients. First, the present study clarifies that the prevalence of secondary polycythemia is considerable (~ 6%) in contemporary US COPD patients, especially in males and current smokers. Second, the presence of polycythemia in COPD patients may warrant an active screening of uncorrected severe hypoxemia, which is a predictor of mortality in COPD. LTOT use in COPD patients with severe resting hypoxemia improves survival and was also found to be associated with lower risk for polycythemia in our study. Polycythemia can be easily discovered through a complete blood count, one of the most routinely acquired labs in clinical practice. As a result, a careful evaluation of polycythemia may provide a valuable opportunity to uncover uncorrected hypoxemia in COPD patients. Third, DLCO may be helpful in the evaluation of COPD patients with polycythemia, in whom a low DLCO might prompt an evaluation of concomitant interstitial lung disease or pulmonary vascular disease if hypoxemia alone fails to justify the presence of polycythemia.

The strengths of this study include a large cohort of contemporary COPD patients with extensively curated phenotypes including post-bronchodilator spirometry, DLCO, quantitative chest CT measurements, and LTOT use. CBCs were drawn from participants in stable clinical conditions rather than during COPD exacerbations or hospitalizations which limited misclassification of polycythemia based on acute medical events.

Limitations of this study include the cross-sectional design, which precludes inference of directionality or causality between exposure and outcome variables. Oxygen saturation was measured by pulse oximetry instead of arterial blood gas analysis, which might result in measurement bias. Our available data did not allow us to definitely exclude polycythemia vera, though the prevalence of PV in US is quite low. Finally, LTOT use was self-reported, and information about the setting of initial prescription, follow-up adjustment, or barriers to LTOT use was not available.

### Polycythemia vera: an appraisal of the biology and management 10 years after the discovery of JAK2 V617F [^117EnLjy]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm that is associated with a substantial symptom burden, thrombohemorrhagic complications, and impaired survival. A decade after the seminal discovery of an activating mutation in the tyrosine kinase JAK2 in nearly all patients with PV, new treatment options are finally beginning to emerge, necessitating a critical reappraisal of the underlying pathogenesis and therapeutic modalities available for PV. Herein, we comprehensively review clinical aspects of PV including diagnostic considerations, natural history, and risk factors for thrombosis. We summarize recent studies delineating the genetic basis of PV, including their implications for evolution to myelofibrosis and secondary acute myeloid leukemia. We assess the quality of evidence to support the use of currently available therapies, including aspirin, phlebotomy, hydroxyurea, and interferon. We analyze recent studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of JAK inhibitors, such as ruxolitinib, and evaluate their role in the context of other available therapies for PV. This review provides a framework for practicing hematologists and oncologists to make rational treatment decisions for patients with PV.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113ssbHc]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) treated with hydroxyurea — phlebotomy frequency and prognostic factors are highlighted: In one retrospective study, the need for ≥ 3 phlebotomies per year was associated with a significantly higher rate of thrombosis in patients with PV treated with hydroxyurea (21% at 3 years compared to 5% at 3 years for those receiving ≤ 2 phlebotomies per year; P < .0001), although other investigators could not confirm these findings. The development of cytopenia at the lowest dose of hydroxyurea is an adverse prognostic factor associated with higher risk of death and transformation to AML, and patients with high-risk PV or essential thrombocythemia (ET) treated with cytoreductive therapy as initial treatment should also be monitored for intolerance or resistance to hydroxyurea.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^112UkWJS]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (MF) are the classical BCR-ABL negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). These blood cancers represent a heterogeneous group of clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorders with constitutively activated physiologic signal-transduction pathways. PV is characterized by erythrocytosis, bone marrow erythroid and megakaryocytic hyperplasia, fatigue, aquagenic pruritus, microvascular symptoms, and symptomatic splenomegaly. Complications of PV include a significantly increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis (41%) and the potential for evolution to MF (10–20%) and MPN-blast phase (3–10%), significantly reducing survival. Most patients with PV present with iron deficiency at diagnosis, even prior to the onset of therapeutic phlebotomy, the mainstay of treatment. Iron deficiency is often exacerbated by repeated phlebotomies, a desired effect thought to limit the accelerated erythropoiesis by restricting a necessary component of hemoglobin synthesis. This can lead to symptoms such as cognitive impairment and fatigue, even in the absence of anemia. Recent studies demonstrate that available therapies might improve PV-related symptoms in part by reversing iron deficiency. The genesis of iron deficiency in PV and its effect on disease manifestations and natural history have been explored to a limited extent. In this review, we focus on what is known about iron metabolism and erythropoiesis in PV. In addition, we build on recent advances in understanding the regulation of iron metabolism to enhance our understanding of PV pathophysiology and ultimately propose alternative therapeutic options.

### Don't routinely repeat the labs hemoglobin and hematocrit… [^1173W2pB]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

Preset timed interval measurements of hemoglobin and hematocrit are no longer indicated as early detectors of instability. Clinical instability is defined by physiologic criteria such as age-specific tachycardia or hypotension, tachypnea, low urine output, altered mental status, or any significant clinical deterioration that warrants increased level of care and investigation. Therefore, the routine use of repeat laboratory studies in children with isolated solid organ injury who have physiologically normal vital signs for their age is not necessary.

### How I treat essential thrombocythemia [^115t6EfJ]. Blood (2011). Low credibility.

In the past 5 years we have witnessed significant advances in both the diagnostic process and optimal therapy for patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET). Insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms have been accompanied by the development of new diagnostic tests and by an improved understanding of the relationship between ET and other related myeloproliferative neoplasms, such as polycythemia vera and primary myelofibrosis. In the first part of this review, we describe how recent molecular and histologic studies can be integrated into a streamlined diagnostic process that is applicable to everyday clinical practice. We also address areas of current diagnostic controversy, including heterogeneity within ET and the phenotypic overlap between ET, polycythemia vera, and primary myelofibrosis. In the second part, we provide an overview of our current approach to the treatment of ET, including risk stratification, choice of cytoreductive agent, and a consideration of special situations such as the pregnant or perioperative patient. Areas of controversy discussed include the identification of those at high risk of complications and therapeutic decisions in the younger patient.

### Preoperative hematocrit levels and postoperative outcomes in older patients undergoing noncardiac surgery… [^117LboG9]. JAMA Network (2007). Excellent credibility.

Thirty-day mortality and cardiac event rates increased monotonically, with either positive or negative deviations from normal hematocrit levels. We found a 1. 6% increase in 30-day postoperative mortality associated with every percentage-point increase or decrease in the hematocrit value from the normal range. Additional analyses suggest that the adjusted risk of 30-day postoperative mortality and cardiac morbidity begins to rise when hematocrit levels decrease to less than 39% or exceed 51%. Both mortality and cardiac event rates rose monotonically for patients with progressively lower or higher hematocrit values than the reference category, with higher rates at both extremes of the hematocrit spectrum. The hematocrit category of less than 18% had the highest crude 30-day postoperative mortality and cardiac event rates.

After adjusting for potential confounding, each hematocrit category in the anemic and polycythemic ranges had significantly worse outcomes for 30-day mortality and the composite of mortality and cardiac events, except for the hematocrit category of 21. 0% to
23. 9%. The hematocrit category of 51. 0% to
53. 9%, while not meeting the conventional definition for polycythemia, also showed an increased risk of 30-day postoperative mortality. Thus, a patient with a preoperative hematocrit value of 30. 0% has a
14. 4% increased risk of 30-day postoperative mortality, while a patient with a preoperative hematocrit of 24. 0% has a
24. 0% increase in the risk of 30-day postoperative mortality. Among the different clinical cohorts, the mortality risk increase per percentage point of hematocrit deviation from the normal range was 1. 9% for patients aged 75 years or older,
1. 7% for those with COPD, 1. 0% for those with renal disease,
0. 4% for those with any coronary disease, and 0.

1% for emergency surgeries. Hematocrit deviation from the normal range did not increase 30-day mortality risk in women. Physiologically, polycythemia is related to increased blood volume, and hematocrit levels of 51% or greater approximate the level at which a steep increase in blood viscosity occurs. 11, 13 High blood volumes in conjunction with high blood viscosity result in increased cardiac afterload. 27 High afterload decreases cardiac.

### Why does my patient have erythrocytosis? [^112puSuY]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Primary polycythemias are the result of intrinsic abnormalities of the hematopoietic progenitors that lead to constitutive overproduction of red cells accompanied by low erythropoietin (EPO) levels. Secondary polycythemias are caused by conditions resulting in increased EPO production. Polycythemia vera (PV) is a primary polycythemia, and is a chronic clonal progressive myeloproliferative neoplasm. A single recurrent point mutation in the pseudokinase domain of JAK2 molecule (JAK2(V617F)) is present in > 95% of patients with PV. The goal of therapy in PV is to normalize blood counts to minimize the risk of thrombotic events.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^116QJQVE]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm. Virtually all PV patients are iron deficient at presentation and/or during the course of their disease. The co-existence of iron deficiency and polycythemia presents a physiological disconnect. Hepcidin, the master regulator of iron metabolism, is regulated by circulating iron levels, erythroblast secretion of erythroferrone, and inflammation. Both decreased circulating iron and increased erythroferrone levels, which occur as a consequence of erythroid hyperplasia in PV, are anticipated to suppress hepcidin and enable recovery from iron deficiency. Inflammation which accompanies PV is likely to counteract hepcidin suppression, but the relatively low serum ferritin levels observed suggest that inflammation is not a major contributor to the dysregulated iron metabolism. Furthermore, potential defects in iron absorption, aberrant hypoxia sensing and signaling, and frequency of bleeding to account for iron deficiency in PV patients have not been fully elucidated. Insufficiently suppressed hepcidin given the degree of iron deficiency in PV patients strongly suggests that disordered iron metabolism is an important component of the pathobiology of PV. Normalization of hematocrit levels using therapeutic phlebotomy is the most common approach for reducing the incidence of thrombotic complications, a therapy which exacerbates iron deficiency, contributing to a variety of non-hematological symptoms. The use of cytoreductive therapy in high-risk PV patients frequently works more effectively to reverse PV-associated symptoms in iron-deficient relative to iron-replete patients. Lastly, differences in iron-related parameters between PV patients and mice with JAK2 V617F and JAK2 exon 12 mutations suggest that specific regions in JAK2 may influence iron metabolism by nuanced changes of erythropoietin receptor signaling. In this review, we comprehensively discuss the clinical consequences of iron deficiency in PV, provide a framework for understanding the potential dysregulation of iron metabolism, and present a rationale for additional therapeutic options for iron-deficient PV patients.

### Improving the investigative approach to polycythaemia vera: a critical assessment of current evidence and vision for the future [^113Sesr9]. The Lancet: Haematology (2021). High credibility.

Polycythaemia vera is a challenging disease to study given its low prevalence and prolonged time-to-event for important clinical endpoints such as thrombosis, progression, and mortality. Although researchers in this space often rise to meet these challenges, there is considerable room for improvement in the analysis of retrospective data, the development of risk-stratification tools, and the design of randomised controlled trials. In this Viewpoint, we review the evidence behind the contemporary approach to risk stratification and treatment of polycythaemia vera. Frameworks for using data more efficiently, constructing more nuanced prognostic models, and overcoming challenges in clinical trial design are discussed.

### Polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia: 2013 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification, and management [^112ecCRg]. American Journal of Hematology (2013). Low credibility.

Disease Overview

Polycythemia Vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) primarily characterized by erythrocytosis and thrombocytosis, respectively. Other disease features include leukocytosis, splenomegaly, thrombohemorrhagic complications, vasomotor disturbances, pruritus and a small risk of disease progression into acute myeloid leukemia or myelofibrosis.

Diagnosis

Almost all patients with PV harbor a JAK2 mutation. When PV is suspected, the presence of a JAK2 mutation highly suggests the diagnosis and its absence, combined with normal or increased serum erythropoietin level, excludes the diagnosis. Differential diagnosis of ET should include reactive thrombocytosis, chronic myeloid leukemia, prefibrotic myelofibrosis and RARS-T (refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts associated with marked thrombocytosis). A JAK2 mutation is found in 50–70% of patients with ET, myelofibrosis or RARS-T and is capable of distinguishing reactive from clonal thrombocytosis.

Risk Stratification

Current risk stratification in PV and ET is designed to estimate the likelihood of thrombotic complications: high-risk is defined by the presence of age > 60 years or presence of thrombosis history; low-risk is defined by the absence of both of these two risk factors. Recent data considers JAK2V617F and cardiovascular (CV) risk factors as additional risk factors for thrombosis. Presence of extreme thrombocytosis (platelet count > 1,000 × 10(9) /L) might be associated with acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AvWS) and, therefore, risk of bleeding. Risk factors for shortened survival in both PV and ET include advanced age, leukocytosis, and history of thrombosis.

Risk-Adapted Therapy

Survival is near-normal in ET and reasonably long in PV. The 10-year risk of leukemic/fibrotic transformation is < 1%/1% in ET and < 3%/10% in PV. In contrast, the risk of thrombosis exceeds 20%. The main goal of therapy is therefore to prevent thrombohemorrhagic complications. In low risk patients, this is effectively and safely accomplished by the use of low-dose aspirin in both PV and ET and phlebotomy (hematocrit target of < 45%) in PV. In high risk patients, treatment with hydroxyurea is additionally recommended, although not mandated in older patients without JAK2V617F or CV risk factors. Treatment with busulfan or interferon-α is usually effective in hydroxyurea failures. Screening for clinically significant AvWS is recommended before administrating aspirin in the presence of extreme thrombocytosis.

### Persistence of myelofibrosis treated with ruxolitinib: biology and clinical implications [^114tkSRg]. Haematologica (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Primary myelofibrosis is a peculiar illness that has features of both a slowly progressive cancer and a chronic inflammatory disorder. It is a clonal neoplasm driven by a handful of somatic mutations that activate cell signaling, presumably residing in the long-term stem cell compartment, but it also has a constellation of cytokine-mediated symptoms that are disproportionately severe. Myelofibrosis can also arise from antecedent polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia, leading to substantially overlapping clinical features. Progression of myelofibrosis leads to bone marrow failure with extensive marrow fibrosis or transformation to secondary acute myeloid leukemia. After the discovery of activating JAK2 mutations in 50–60% of patients with primary myelofibrosis, clinicians were hopeful that myelofibrosis would respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in a similar fashion to chronic myeloid leukemia, another myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Chronic myeloid leukemia is driven by the BCR-ABL1 fusion which responds to ABL1 TKI therapy with rapid log-fold reductions in the number of BCR-ABL1-mutated cells in the majority of patients. Ruxolitinib was the first dual JAK1/JAK2 TKI approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis and was demonstrated to reduce splenomegaly and improve many symptoms related to myelofibrosis but, unlike TKI treatment in chronic myeloid leukemia, it does not result in elimination of the mutant clonal population of cells (a phenomenon termed "disease persistence" in contrast to the conventional understanding of TKI resistance) nor does it cause widespread regression of fibrosis. Understanding the molecular basis of clinical responses to ruxolitinib is of great relevance to cancer biology and has implications for prescribing (and stopping) therapy, as well as the future design of kinase inhibitors for other cancers. Here we review what is known to date about the mechanism of ruxolitinib persistence, its relationship to various recurrent somatic mutations in myelofibrosis, and potential ways to circumvent persistence to improve outcomes.

Regarding specific circumstances for polycythemia vera, more specifically with respect to patients with congenital erythrocytosis, BSH 2019 guidelines recommend to consider performing venesection in patients with congenital erythrocytosis, particularly in the following cases:

- symptoms probably caused by raised hematocrit

- previous thrombotic episode

- thrombotic episode in a family member (carrying the same genetic lesion) of an asymptomatic person, particularly with high oxygen affinity hemoglobins.

Polycythemia vera conventional risk model — age and thrombosis history: Advanced age (ie, > 60 years) and history of thrombosis are the most consistent risk factors associated with the risk of thrombosis. In the ECLAP screening cohort of 1638 patients with PV, age > 65 years and a previous history of thrombosis were the two most important prognostic factors associated with an increasing risk of cardiovascular events, resulting in three risk groups defined as low risk (age < 65 years and no prior history of thrombosis), intermediate risk (age < 65 years with prior thrombosis or age ≥ 65 years without prior thrombosis), and high risk (age ≥ 65 years with prior thrombosis).

### Characteristics and clinical significance of cytogenetic abnormalities in polycythemia vera [^116DmcwY]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Up to 20% of patients with polycythemia vera have karyotypic abnormalities at the time of the initial diagnosis. However, the cytogenetic abnormalities in polycythemia vera have not been well characterized and their prognostic impact is largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to address these issues using a large cohort of polycythemia vera patients with cytogenetic information available. The study included 422 patients, 271 in polycythemic phase, 112 with post-polycythemic myelofibrosis, 11 in accelerated phase, and 28 in blast phase. Abnormal karyotypes were detected in 139 (33%) patients, ranging from 20% in those in the polycythemic phase to 90% among patients in accelerated/blast phase. Different phases harbored different abnormalities: isolated del(20q), +8 and +9 were the most common abnormalities in the polycythemic phase; del(20q) and +1q were the most common abnormalities in post-polycythemic myelofibrosis; and complex karyotypes were the most common karyotypes in accelerated and blast phases. Patients with an abnormal karyotype showed a higher frequency of disease progression, a shorter transformation-free survival and an inferior overall survival compared with patients with a normal karyotype in the same disease phase. Cytogenetics could be effectively stratified into three risk groups, low- (normal karyotype, sole +8, +9 and other single abnormality), intermediate- (sole del20q, +1q and other two abnormalities), and high-risk (complex karyotype) groups. We conclude that cytogenetic changes in polycythemia vera vary in different phases of disease, and carry different prognostic impacts.

### A guideline for the management of specific situations in polycythaemia vera and secondary erythrocytosis: a British Society for Haematology guideline [^113Ehg6P]. British Journal of Haematology (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The previous BSH guideline for the management of erythrocytosis was published in 2005 (McMullin et al, 2005) and amended in 2007 (McMullin et al, 2007). Here, we re‐evaluate the literature formulate guidance on the management of specific situations encountered in polycythaemia vera (PV) and the management of the other types of secondary erythrocytosis. Recommendations for the diagnostic pathway of investigation of an erythrocytosis, risk stratification and management of PV are in the accompanying guideline (McMullin et al, 2018). We review evidence and outline guidance on management of acute thrombotic events and secondary prevention of thrombosis in PV. The unusual thrombotic events, splanchnic vein and cerebral vein thromboses are discussed and haemorrhage. The specific situations of surgery and pregnancy and guidance on management of pruritus are included. The evidence for the management of other causes of erythrocytosis, including idiopathic erythrocytosis, congenital erythrocytosis, hypoxic pulmonary disease and post‐transplant erythrocytosis, is reviewed and recommendations made.

### Current management of polycythemia vera [^1124Ebs6]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2002). Low credibility.

Over a century has elapsed since the first description of polycythemia vera (PV), and current treatment recommendations are primarily based on the results of clinical trials that were performed in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Continued identification and appropriate utilization of PV-specific biologic parameters may allow substantial modification of early diagnostic criteria. New cytoreductive treatment agents are increasingly being used without any evidence of superiority over conventional therapy. The role of aspirin is being readdressed by an ongoing controlled study. Transformation of PV into either myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia or acute leukemia remains a major complication that may not be influenced by current therapy.

### Phenotypical differences and thrombosis rates in secondary erythrocytosis versus polycythemia vera [^112RGFJZ]. Blood Cancer Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Importantly, rates of thromboembolic events, prior to diagnosis, were comparable in both PV and SE populations, suggesting that from the standpoint of thrombosis, SE may not be as benign as some reports have intimated. While post-diagnosis thrombotic rates appeared lower in SE patients, limited follow-up in this cohort precludes accurate interpretation. Furthermore, regardless of erythrocytosis etiology, classic cardiovascular risk factors (age, hypertension, obesity, etc.) significantly clustered with thrombosis risk, emphasizing the importance of controlling these risk factors in PV (in addition to Hct targets) as well as SE patients.

Notably, a third of SE patients underwent bone marrow sampling with patent low-yield, raising the question of how to better discern patients that require this not entirely anodyne intervention. Similarly, from a therapeutic perspective, the fact that a significant proportion of SE patients were exposed to phlebotomy and aspirin, both of which remain controversial in secondary etiologiesand may not be completely innocuous, highlights the need for formal trials of these therapies in SE. Finally, while further studies are needed to more comprehensively address the unmet needs relevant to SE, the current observations call for a reappraisal of workup and management practices, and raise concerns for potentially increased thrombotic complications in this understudied population.

### Indications and use of therapeutic phlebotomy in polycythemia vera: which role for erythrocytapheresis? [^116KwUxR]. Leukemia (2019). Medium credibility.

ECP is about 3.5-fold more expensive than phlebotomy, either due to the higher cost of devices or because of the indirect costs due to the longer time employed by specialized personnel; the difference in the total costs is only partially mitigated by the longer interval after ECP. However, among hemochromatosis patients, ECP results in less hours of absence from work and less costs of lost production, with an overall cost per procedure lower by one-third in comparison with phlebotomy.

Up to 25% of PV patients perceive phlebotomies as having a negative impact on quality of life (QOL) and productivity, and up to 8% of patients discontinue phlebotomies because they feel worse after treatment, or for the inconvenient frequency of visits; in this regard, lowering the frequency of procedures, likewise maintaining a control of hematocrit and of symptoms, is an important clinical need.

A randomized trial in PV patients managed by RBC withdrawal could be appropriate, investigating the different effects of ECP and phlebotomy on target hematocrit, frequency of procedures, disease-associated symptoms, vascular complications, working activity, and QOL, as well as iron deprivation and its clinical consequences. The cost–efficacy analysis of ECP should consider all these outcomes.

### Where to turn for second-line cytoreduction after hydroxyurea in polycythemia vera? [^116NyoQx]. The Oncologist (2016). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The goals of therapy in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) are to improve disease-related symptoms, prevent the incidence or recurrence of thrombosis, and possibly delay or prevent the transformation into myelofibrosis or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Cytoreductive therapies have been used in older patients and those with a history of thrombosis to achieve these goals. Hydroxyurea (HU) remains the first-line cytoreductive choice; however, up to one in four patients treated with HU over time will develop resistance or intolerance to HU. More importantly, patients who fail HU have a 5.6-fold increase in mortality and a 6.8-fold increase risk of transformation to myelofibrosis or AML; therefore, alternative therapies are needed for these patients. Interferon-α has been used in PV and has shown significant activity in achieving hematologic responses and decreasing JAK2 V617F mutation allele burden. JAK inhibition has also been investigated and recently garnered regulatory approval for this indication. In this review, we will discuss the current treatment options that are available for patients after HU and the novel therapies that are currently under investigation.

Implications For Practice

The outcomes of PV patients who fail or who are intolerant of hydroxyurea are poor. Although pegylated interferon can be considered in younger patients, currently, ruxolitinib is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved agent in this setting, representing a viable option, leading to hematocrit control and a reduction in spleen size and constitutional symptoms. Although a small number of patients will achieve a molecular response with continuous treatment, the implications of such response on the clinical outcomes are still unknown. Patients whose disease is not adequately controlled with ruxolitinib, or who lose their response, can be treated with low-dose busulfan or pipobroman; however, they should be encouraged to participate in trials with novel therapies.

Patients with PMF may encounter many complications associated with disease progression or with PMF evolution. This article defines factors that determine prognosis in these 3 diseases.

### Hematocrit values in coronary artery disease… [^116E1xko]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Recent reports suggest that the hematocrit value may be a significant factor in predisposition to coronary thrombosis. 1–4 Hematocrit values of both men and women with myocardial infarction were observed to be higher on the average than those of age-matched control subjects. The data led to the proposal that the red cell volume of patients with coronary artery disease should be reduced by venesection in an effort to prevent thrombosis. An editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association5 notes that these "stirring reports. tend to pick up the threads of medieval medicine. ", and raise the question whether phlebotomy may be "an ancient procedure turning modern. " In an independent study of the hematocrit values of normal men and of men with acute myocardial infarction we were unable to corroborate the earlier reports and found no correlation between hematocrit value and occurrence of coronary thrombosis.

### JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis: current diagnostic approach and therapeutic views [^11798zui]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Erythrocytosis refers to either a true or apparent increase in hemoglobin (Hgb)/hematocrit (Hct); distinction requires familiarity with sex-, race- and altitude-adjusted normal values, together with an appreciation of extreme normal values that exceed the 95th percentile (2 SD) of reference range and attention to clinical factors associated with plasma volume depletion (relative erythrocytosis). In 2008, the World Health organization (WHO) proposed Hgb and Hct diagnostic thresholds of 18.5 g/dl/52% and 16.5 g/dl/48% in Caucasian males and females, respectively, for investigation of polycythemia vera (PV). However, in 2016, the WHO classification system revised the Hct/Hct thresholds for PV diagnosis to 16.5 g/dL/49% in males and 16 g/dL/48% in females. In a recent large population-based study, the incidence of erythrocytosis ranged from 0.3% to 3.4% based on the application of the WHO 2008 and 2016 criteria, respectively; importantly increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was reported only in the context of a higher Hgb threshold (WHO 2008).

The diagnostic workup of JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis lacks uniformity, and often includes investigations for rare hereditary conditions and several acquired entities known to be associated with secondary erythrocytosis. In a substantial proportion (up to 70%) of patients, despite extensive testing, erythrocytosis remains uncharacterized and sometimes labeled as "idiopathic", which is often a diagnosis of exclusion. The complexity and variability of the decision-making processes involved in managing erythrocytosis were underscored by an international survey of 134 myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) physicians evaluating standard practice in erythrocytosis; in this regard, while first-line assessments were relatively consistent (JAK2, EPO testing), second-line investigations were markedly heterogeneous. Equally variable were treatment practices, including the decision to initiate daily aspirin therapy and/or phlebotomy, as well as the desired Hct target, ranging from 48–56%. Some of this variability in management stems from unsubstantiated concern regarding thrombosis risk. The particular issue was further highlighted in a recent retrospective study where as many as one-third of patients with secondary erythrocytosis were subjected to bone marrow examination and 42% to periodic phlebotomy. Herein, we outline our systematic diagnostic and therapeutic approach in JAK2 unmutated erythrocytosis; our review also includes illustrative cases and a discussion on underlying pathogenetic mechanisms.

### Hemoglobin concentration, total hemoglobin mass and plasma volume in patients: implications for anemia [^117SQnQc]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Our findings are thus of real clinical importance, as a significantly low [Hb] can trigger a raft of (unwarranted) investigations (such as the assay of circulating hematinic factors) or treatments (such as the administration of packed RBCs), whilst denying the administration of agents to reduce PV, which might sometimes be required. Blood transfusion itself carries risksas well as a price in terms of healthcare costs. Meanwhile, in other circumstances, contraction in PV might offer false reassurance by maintaining [Hb] when tHb-mass is low.

Whilst tHb-mass is generally used as an index of oxygen carrying capacity and of circulating red cell mass, others have previously reported total circulating red blood cell volume (RCV) in this regard. In hematologically normal control subjects, Hct in the 20–50% range reportedly correlated well with RCV (determined by 51 Chromuim (51 Cr) labeling of RBCs: r = 0.880, P < 0.001). However, this relationship was disturbed when Hct fell outside this range, owing to wider variability in PV. Such data support those from other radiolabeling studies in suggesting that direct measurement of RCV (rather than the use of [Hb] or Hct) is required for the accurate diagnosis of polycythemia. Likewise, data derived from the same technique which we applied (oCOR) show PV to be expanded (variably, but along with increased RCV) in polycythemia rubra vera.

### Myeloproliferative neoplasms, version 3.2022, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116NDStu]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). High credibility.

Management of vascular events — thrombosis in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) states that clinically appropriate anticoagulant therapy (eg, low-molecular-weight heparin [LMWH], direct oral anticoagulant, warfarin) is recommended for patients with active thrombosis and that initial anticoagulant use should be based on American College of Chest Physicians guidelines; clinicians should consider aspirin for patients with cardiovascular risk factors with case-by-case assessment of aspirin plus anticoagulation. It notes there are no data to guide selection or duration of anticoagulation with or without antiplatelet therapy in PV or ET and that combining anticoagulants with aspirin is associated with an increased risk of bleeding, warranting caution. The duration of anticoagulant therapy is dependent on thrombotic event severity, disease control, and recurrence risk after cessation. The guidance advises to assess the need for cytoreductive therapy and to initiate cytoreductive therapy, if necessary, to maintain hematocrit < 45% in patients with PV, with consideration of intensification or switching for inadequate response, and states that the value of cytoreduction in preventing future vascular events has not been studied in prospective, randomized controlled trials in PV. Plateletpheresis may be indicated in ET with acute life-threatening thrombosis or severe bleeding.

### The complete evaluation of erythrocytosis: congenital and acquired [^1172nQUo]. Leukemia (2009). Low credibility.

The approach to a patient with erythrocytosis is greatly simplified by assessing the clonality of the process upfront. In this regard, there has been a dramatic shift toward genetic testing and away from traditional tests, such as measurement of red cell mass. Clonal erythrocytosis is the diagnostic feature of polycythemia vera (PV) and is almost always associated with a JAK2 mutation (JAK2V617F or exon 12). All other scenarios represent non-clonal erythrocytosis, often referred to as secondary erythrocytosis. Serum erythropoietin (Epo) level is usually normal or elevated in secondary erythrocytosis and subnormal in PV. Therefore, in a patient with acquired erythrocytosis, it is reasonable to begin the diagnostic work-up with peripheral blood JAK2 mutation analysis and serum Epo measurement to distinguish PV from secondary erythrocytosis. Conversely, the patient with life-long erythrocytosis is more likely to suffer from congenital polycythemia and should therefore be evaluated for germline mutations that result in enhanced Epo effect (for example, Epo receptor mutations), altered intracellular oxygen sensing (for example, mutations involving the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene) or decreased P50 (for example, high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobinopathy). The order of tests in this instance depends on the clinical scenario and serum Epo level.

Is bone marrow examination mandatory for the diagnosis of PV

The official WHO diagnostic criteria for PV allow bypassing bone marrow examination, for diagnostic purposes, in JAK2 -mutated cases with Hb/Hct level above > 18.5 g/dL/55.5% in men and 16.5 g/dL/49.5% in women, with subnormal serum Epo. However, we advise the specific procedure in all patients, save for certain clinical scenarios, not only for confirming the diagnosis but also for purposes of establishing a baseline and obtain prognostically relevant cytogenetic information. Exceptional cases include older patients and those with significant comorbidities, where the additional information from bone marrow examination might not affect treatment decisions or long-term prognostication.

The concept of masked polycythemia vera and MPN-unclassifiable

There is increasing awareness of patients presenting with SVT associated with a JAK2 mutation, but not meeting the WHO-listed criteria for PV or other MPN. The WHO classification system defines such presentation as MPN-U, which also includes cases with the so-called masked PV. From a biological standpoint, a documented increase in Hb/Hct from an individual's baseline, associated with a JAK2 mutation, should be approached as PV, even if Hb/Hct levels do not cross the WHO-defined diagnostic thresholds; such circumstances should also be considered in distinguishing PV from JAK2 -mutated ET, where JAK2 V617F allele burden might provide additional clue (i.e. expected to be higher in the former and often < 20% in the latter). Similarly, the dilutional effect of marked splenomegaly might underestimate Hb/Hct levels in some patients. In the end, such details regarding diagnostic accuracy might not influence specific treatment strategies, as long as one errs on the side of keeping the Hct level < 45%, in equivocal cases.

### Polycythemia vera: new clinicopathologic perspectives [^112H9gGX]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Context

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a clonal myeloproliferative disease characterized by an erythroid dominant trilineage proliferation of hematopoietic precursor cells. Classified as a chronic myeloproliferative disease, PV represents a histopathologic spectrum of 2 recognized stages, the polycythemic and postpolycythemic phase. The clinical manifestations of hemorrhage, thrombosis, and increased red cell mass are directly related to primary bone marrow dysfunction. Prognosis is strongly associated with thrombosis risk and disease progression; thus, treatment is directed toward minimizing coagulopathic complications and preventing leukemic transformation. Recently, a specific point mutation in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene was described in a majority of PV patients. The potential diagnostic and/or prognostic value of JAK2V617F is discussed.

Objective

To review important developments from the recent and historical literature. Modern diagnostic criteria and emerging molecular findings are emphasized.

Data Sources

A comprehensive review was performed of the relevant literature indexed in PubMed (National Library of Medicine) and referenced medical texts.

Conclusions

Modified clinical, histologic, and laboratory criteria have clarified the diagnosis of PV. Also, continuing studies on the recently discovered JAK2V617F gene mutation may significantly improve our understanding of PV pathogenesis and facilitate its medical management.

### Idiopathic erythrocytosis: a disappearing entity [^1148rerc]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2009). Low credibility.

Erythrocytosis results when there is an increased red cell mass and thus an increased hemoglobin. The causes can be divided into primary intrinsic defects of the erythroid progenitor cell and secondary defects, where factors external to the erythroid compartment are responsible. Both can then be further divided into congenital and acquired categories. Congenital causes include mutations of the erythropoietin receptor and defects of the oxygen-sensing pathway including VHL, PHD2 and HIF2A mutations. When fully investigated there remain a number of patients in whom no cause can be elucidated who are currently described as having idiopathic erythrocytosis. Investigation should start with a full history and examination. Having eliminated the common entity polycythemia vera, further direction for investigation is guided by the erythropoietin level. Clinical consequences of the various erythrocytoses are not clear, but in some groups thromboembolic events have been described in young patients. Evidence is lacking to define best management, but aspirin and venesection to a target hematocrit should be considered.

### Management of MPN beyond JAK2 [^111qoYsh]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2014). Low credibility.

Thrombocytosis has a large number of potential underlying causes, but the dominant group of hematological conditions for consideration in this setting are the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). In this chapter, we consider several key linked questions relating to the management of thrombocytosis in MPNs and discuss several issues. First, we discuss the differential diagnosis of thrombocytosis, which myeloid disorders to consider, and practical approaches to the discrimination of each individual MPN from other causes. Second, there have been several major advances in our understanding of the molecular biology of these conditions and we discuss how these findings are likely to be practically applied in the future. Third, we consider whether there is evidence that thrombocytosis contributes to the complications known to be associated with MPN: thrombosis, hemorrhage and transformation to leukemia and myelofibrosis. Last, we review current ideas for risk stratification and management of essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera as the 2 entities within the MPN family that are most frequently associated with thrombocytosis.

### Canagliflozin may increase thromboembolic events in males with erythrocytosis but not in females [^116ifR8T]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Whether to discontinue SGLT2is in patients with erythrocytosis is an important clinical issue for future consideration. Until our current report, there had been no evidence suggesting that SGLT2is increase the risk of thrombosis in patients with erythrocytosis compared with control groups. Therefore, given the robust evidence supporting the benefits of SGLT2is, no clear rationale exists for recommending discontinuation solely based on erythrocytosis. Addressing this issue would require a direct comparison between patients with erythrocytosis who continue and those who discontinue SGLT2is, which is beyond the scope of our study. Nevertheless, we recognize the clinical significance of this question and believe that our findings provide a foundation for future discussion. Further research is warranted to establish evidence-based clinical guidance. The primary strength of this study lies in the utilization of high-quality data from landmark trials, the CANVAS program, and the CREDENCE trial. However, our study has certain limitations. First, this study exclusively included patients with T2DM, limiting the generalizability of the findings to nondiabetic populations. Second, the primary outcome comprised a composite of adjudicated and investigator-reported events. Nonetheless, a high concordance between investigator-reported and adjudicated events has been documented for various ischemic endpoints in double-blind randomized clinical trials. Moreover, the primary outcome results were robustly supported by the MI results, as adjudicated by independent committees. Third, this investigation represents an integrated exploratory analysis of 2 clinical trials not originally designed to detect treatment heterogeneity. The limited number of patients and events among those with erythrocytosis raises concerns regarding the statistical power of subgroup analyses, particularly in female subjects, which may hinder the accurate estimation of effect sizes in subpopulations. Finally, the absence of JAK2 genetic testing in our study does not preclude the possibility that some participants had polycythemia vera. Nevertheless, the randomized controlled trial design minimizes the risk of an uneven distribution of such patients that could have biased the results.

In conclusion, our study demonstrated that canagliflozin significantly increased hematocrit levels even in patients with T2DM and erythrocytosis, in both males and females. Safety concerns related to canagliflozin were observed only in males with elevated baseline hematocrit levels, particularly regarding thromboembolic events, including MI. Given the lack of treatment heterogeneity based on hematocrit levels for heart failure hospitalization or kidney outcomes, the use of SGLT2i in patients with erythrocytosis may benefit from a personalized approach that considers sex and the specific outcomes targeted for improvement. These findings warrant further investigation.

### Characteristics and clinical significance of cytogenetic abnormalities in polycythemia vera [^117T2Uf6]. Haematologica (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by increased red blood cell production, a somatic gain-of-function mutation of JAK2, and panmyelosis in bone marrow (BM). The natural course of PV usually includes three phases: the pre-polycythemic phase, polycythemic phase (PP), and post-polycythemic myelofibrosis (post-PV MF). The disease in a small subset of patients may transform into an accelerated phase (AP), with 10–19% blasts in the peripheral blood and/or BM, or a blast phase (BP) with ≥ 20% blasts in peripheral blood/BM.

Patients with PV generally have relatively long survival (median, 14–19 years). Potentially fatal complications include thrombosis, progression into myelofibrosis (post-PV MF) or transformation to BP. The median survival for patients with post-PV MF is 5–6 yearsand patients with blastic transformation often have a dismal prognosis with a median survival of < 6 months. The frequency of post-PV MF is 4.9–6% at 10 years and 6–14% at 15 years;, and the risk of BP is 2.3–14.4% at 10 years and 5.5–18.7% at 15 years. Advanced age, leukocytosis, BM reticulin fibrosis, and splenomegaly have been reported to be risk factors for post-PV MF and BP;,– while leukocytosis, advanced age, and history of thrombosis have been found to be independent risk factors for overall survival (OS).

Cytogenetic abnormalities can be detected in 14–20% of patients at the time of the initial diagnosis of PV, – with del(20q), +8, +9 and +1q being the most commonly reported. The low frequency of abnormal karyotypes has made prognostication of PV patients using cytogenetic data challenging and some studies have not shown a prognostic difference between patients with a normal or abnormal karyotype. Recently other studies, including one by the International Working Group for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT), have found that patients with an abnormal karyotype have a higher risk of disease progression and an inferior outcome. However, the prognostic impact of individual cytogenetic abnormalities was not further classified, and the three most common abnormalities, +8, +9, and del(20q) have not been shown conclusively to have prognostic value.

Treatment for high-risk polycythemia vera — monitoring and management of inadequate response: Monitor for new thrombosis or bleeding and monitor response and signs/symptoms of disease progression as clinically indicated. Potential indications for change of cytoreductive therapy include intolerance or resistance to prior cytoreductive treatment, new thrombosis or disease-related major bleeding, frequent phlebotomy or intolerance of phlebotomy, splenomegaly, progressive thrombocytosis and/or leukocytosis, and disease-related symptoms (eg, pruritus, night sweats, fatigue). For inadequate response or loss of response, preferred regimens are clinical trial or ruxolitinib (category 1 for high-risk PV for hydroxyurea resistance or intolerance), with other recommended regimens being ropeginterferon alfa-2b-njft, hydroxyurea, or peginterferon alfa-2a if not previously used. Ruxolitinib is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with PV who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant of hydroxyurea. Response criteria were developed mainly for use in clinical trials, and response assessment should be done based on the improvement of disease-related symptoms at the discretion of the clinician. With disease progression, see MPN-2 (post-PV MF) or MPN-AP/BP-1 (accelerated/blast phase MPN).

WHO and ICC diagnostic criteria — polycythemia vera (PV): The diagnosis of PV requires either all 3 major criteria or the first 2 major criteria plus the minor criterion. Major criteria are elevated hemoglobin concentration (> 16.5 g/dL in men, > 16.0 g/dL in women) or elevated hematocrit (> 49% in men, > 48% in women); bone marrow biopsy showing age-adjusted hypercellularity with trilineage proliferation (panmyelosis), including prominent erythroid, granulocytic, and megakaryocytic proliferation with pleomorphic, mature megakaryocytes (differences in size); and presence of JAK2 p.V617F or JAK2 exon 12 mutation. The minor criterion is subnormal serum erythropoietin level. Major criterion 2 (bone marrow biopsy) may not be required in patients with sustained absolute erythrocytosis (hemoglobin concentrations of > 18.5 g/dL in men or > 16.5 g/dL in women, or hematocrit values of > 55.5% in men or > 49.5% in women) if major criterion 3 and the minor criterion are present. In the absence of a JAK2 mutation, a higher hematocrit target (eg, 52%) could be considered in men before further investigation is required.

### Dysregulated iron metabolism in polycythemia vera: etiology and consequences [^112DKkhk]. Leukemia (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Patients with PV present with iron deficiency despite expanded erythropoiesis and recurrent therapeutic phlebotomy induces further degrees of iron deficiency. Significant progress has been made in defining the molecular basis of PV as well as physiological and pathological regulation of iron metabolism. Furthermore, together with newly delineated molecular mechanisms involved in the iron restriction response, this knowledge enables a more nuanced evaluation of aberrant erythroid regulation of iron metabolism and iron sensing which regulate erythropoiesis in PV. Understanding the dysregulation of iron metabolism in PV may enable the development of novel therapeutics. In the interim, exploring chemical means of inducing erythropoiesis-targeted iron restriction may benefit PV patients requiring repeat therapeutic phlebotomy.

Treatment response criteria in polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) — use and limitations: The Panel acknowledges that the IWG-MRT and ELN treatment response criteria were developed mainly for use in clinical trials and that clinical benefit may not reach the threshold of the IWG-MRT and ELN response criteria, and response criteria are not defined for patients treated with low-dose aspirin. Retrospective studies suggest that achievement of CR did not correlate with a lower incidence of thrombosis or improvement in thrombosis-free survival. While normalization of blood counts after initiation of treatment is usually a goal in clinical practice, it is not associated with long-term clinical benefit and there are no evidence-based data to recommend a target WBC or platelet count; in selected patients with a severe thrombotic event, normalization of blood counts might be a goal of treatment. Response assessment should be done based on improvement of disease-related symptoms at the clinician's discretion, and target WBC or platelet counts should be individualized to prevent new thrombosis or bleeding based on risk factors.

### Personalized management of essential thrombocythemia-application of recent evidence to clinical practice [^114SfPTB]. Leukemia (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are operationally classified as BCR-ABL1 -negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). All three are believed to originate from a genetically transformed stem cell, which leads to clonal myeloproliferation. Neither the disease-initiating nor leukemia-promoting events in BCR-ABL1 -negative MPN are known, although the majority of the patients harbor JAK2 V617F or other secondary somatic mutations. In terms of diagnosis, the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system for hematopoietic tumors considers clonal erythrocytosis as being specific to PV, and uses bone marrow morphology to distinguish between ET and PMF.
