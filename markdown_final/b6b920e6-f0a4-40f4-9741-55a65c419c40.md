## Question

is using alcohol swabs recommended for ears

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether alcohol swabs are recommended for ears and, if so, in what contexts they are safe and effective to use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "alcohol swabs" typically contain and how they are intended to be used. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about ear hygiene and whether alcohol swabs are endorsed or discouraged. Next, I will examine any evidence for alcohol-based ear care, including irrigation or drops, and distinguish that from swab use. After that, I need to check safety concerns, especially regarding the tympanic membrane and ototoxicity. Finally, I will consider special scenarios like tympanostomy tubes or otitis externa and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with clear caveats and alternatives.

> Let me first confirm what we mean by "alcohol swabs". Most consumer and medical alcohol swabs contain isopropyl alcohol at about 70% on a cotton applicator, and their labeling consistently warns "for external use only", explicitly advising to keep them out of the eyes, ears, and mouth, which already signals potential harm if introduced into the ear canal [^116Hn87A] [^114B5CEc]. Wait, let me verify the exact wording on representative products; yes, both isopropyl and ethyl alcohol swab labels carry the same "do not use in the ear canal" warning, reinforcing that routine ear canal insertion of alcohol swabs is not recommended [^116Hn87A].

> Next, I should review authoritative guidelines on ear hygiene. The AAO-HNSF cerumen impaction guideline emphasizes that ears are self-cleaning and advises against inserting anything into the ear canal, including cotton-tipped swabs, due to trauma and impaction risk. It does not endorse alcohol swabs for ear cleaning or prevention, and instead supports clinician-directed methods or safe home irrigation when indicated [^112awaX3] [^116HfVB4]. Hold on, I should verify whether any guideline table lists alcohol swabs as an option; I initially thought I saw alcohol swabs listed among secondary prevention choices, but wait, that was alcohol or hydrogen peroxide drops/irrigation, not swabs, so I should correct that assumption and avoid conflating drops with swab insertion [^112awaX3] [^115xHwJE]. The AAFP similarly recommends against cotton-tipped swabs and does not include alcohol swabs in recommended ear care, reinforcing the general principle to avoid putting objects or irritants into the canal [^113tX9Gu].

> I will now examine whether there is any evidence for alcohol-based ear care that could be confused with swab use. A small prospective crossover study suggested that weekly irrigation with 70% isopropyl alcohol reduced cerumen accumulation without reported complications, but this was irrigation, not swab insertion, and the evidence quality is low with a need for larger trials. Importantly, guidelines frame such alcohol irrigation as a potential option only in select patients after counseling and with attention to tympanic membrane status, not as a blanket endorsement of alcohol swabs in the canal [^115Wih3N] [^111LuwJC] [^112uYa7S]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm that the guideline tables indeed list alcohol irrigation as a secondary prevention option. Yes, they do, but again, that is distinct from swab use and requires training and precautions [^112awaX3] [^115xHwJE].

> Safety considerations are critical here. I need to ensure we account for tympanic membrane integrity and ototoxicity risk. Guidelines caution that if the tympanic membrane is perforated or tubes are present, irrigation and certain agents can cause caloric effects or ototoxicity, and mechanical removal is preferred; alcohol can be ototoxic if it reaches the middle ear, and antiseptic labels explicitly warn to keep solutions out of the ears because of risks including deafness with middle ear exposure [^1123jHZ8] [^112z3DZy] [^114yZb5T] [^112da29B]. Hold on, I should verify whether any label specifically mentions deafness risk; yes, chlorhexidine and surgical scrubs carry this warning, underscoring the general principle that alcohol and other antiseptics should not be instilled into the ear canal, especially with an uncertain membrane status [^114yZb5T] [^112da29B].

> But wait, what about special scenarios like tympanostomy tubes or active drainage. Guidelines for tympanostomy tubes advise caregivers to remove crusting with a cotton-tipped swab dipped in hydrogen peroxide or warm water at the canal entrance, and they explicitly advise against over-the-counter ear drops and emphasize keeping the ear dry; they do not recommend alcohol swabs for this task, and given the risk of alcohol exposure to the middle ear through a tube, alcohol swabs should be avoided in this setting [^115rZfmA] [^115X2knX]. I should double-check that no tube guideline endorses alcohol swabs; I find no such endorsement, and the emphasis remains on gentle surface cleaning and approved drops when needed [^115rZfmA] [^115X2knX].

> Let me consider otitis externa prevention and treatment, since some patients inquire about drying the ear after swimming. Prevention strategies include acidifying drops, drying measures, and moisture control; alcohol-containing drying solutions exist, but these are formulated ear drops, not alcohol swabs, and they are used in small volumes for specific indications, not as routine swab insertion into the canal [^114fKjLH] [^112SduxJ]. I should confirm that guidelines do not recommend swabs for this purpose; they do not, and they caution against trauma from inserting objects into the canal, which aligns with avoiding alcohol swabs internally [^114fKjLH] [^112SduxJ].

> I need to ensure I address the practical distinction between external and internal use. It is reasonable to use an alcohol swab to clean the external pinna and around the ear opening for skin antisepsis, but the moment the applicator is advanced into the ear canal, the risk of trauma, infection, and unintended middle ear exposure rises, especially if the tympanic membrane status is unknown. Thus, even seemingly "gentle" swab insertion is not advised [^116Hn87A] [^116HfVB4] [^1123jHZ8]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; could a dry swab without alcohol be safer? The guideline still advises against inserting any foreign object into the canal because of impaction and trauma risk, so the material on the swab does not mitigate the mechanical hazard [^116HfVB4] [^112awaX3].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Alcohol swabs are not recommended for ear canal use. They are labeled for external use only and carry explicit warnings to keep out of ears, major guidelines discourage inserting anything into the canal, and the only alcohol-related practice with any supportive evidence is clinician-supervised irrigation in select cases, which is fundamentally different from swab insertion and still requires caution regarding membrane integrity [^116Hn87A] [^112awaX3] [^115Wih3N]. If earwax is problematic, safe options include observation, cerumenolytic drops, or professionally performed irrigation or manual removal. If there are symptoms, a history of ear surgery, tubes, or suspected perforation, evaluation by a clinician is appropriate before any intervention [^112awaX3] [^116umpVG] [^113tX9Gu].

In general, **alcohol swabs are not recommended for routine ear cleaning** because they can cause dryness, irritation, and ototoxicity if the eardrum is perforated [^116Hn87A]. They may be used only for **external ear disinfection** before procedures or for **drying the ear canal after water exposure** in otherwise healthy ears, and should never be inserted into the ear canal. For earwax or infection, use **clinician-approved drops or irrigation** [^112awaX3] [^112uYa7S]; avoid alcohol swabs in children, those with sensitive skin, or anyone with ear pathology.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) **do not recommend routine use of alcohol swabs** for ear cleaning or earwax removal [^112awaX3] [^113tX9Gu]. Instead, they emphasize:

- **Observation and patient education**: Most cerumen can be left alone if asymptomatic [^113W81jZ]; patients should be educated on safe ear hygiene practices [^117FDMLu].

- **Clinician-administered methods**: Manual removal with curettes, suction, or irrigation by trained professionals is preferred for symptomatic cerumen impaction [^116HfVB4] [^115Ftbjq].

- **Avoidance of trauma**: Inserting objects, including swabs, into the ear canal is discouraged due to risk of trauma, infection, and impaction [^116HfVB4].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects

Using alcohol swabs in the ears carries several **potential risks and adverse effects**:

- **Skin irritation and dryness**: Alcohol can cause significant irritation, dryness, and discomfort to the delicate skin of the external auditory canal [^112z3DZy].

- **Ototoxicity**: If the tympanic membrane is perforated, alcohol can enter the middle ear, potentially causing ototoxicity, hearing loss, or vestibular symptoms [^112z3DZy] [^1123jHZ8].

- **Trauma**: Inserting swabs into the ear canal can cause mechanical trauma, including abrasions, lacerations, and even tympanic membrane perforation [^115QSXtV] [^113hD75h].

- **Infection risk**: Trauma from swabs can introduce bacteria, increasing the risk of otitis externa or other infections [^114U9KpW].

---

## Clinical scenarios where alcohol swabs may be appropriate

While routine use is discouraged, alcohol swabs may be appropriate in **specific clinical scenarios**:

- **Pre-procedural disinfection**: Alcohol swabs may be used to disinfect the external ear (pinna) before procedures such as ear piercing or minor surgical interventions.

- **Post-water exposure drying**: In patients prone to swimmer's ear (otitis externa), alcohol swabs may be used externally to help dry the ear canal after swimming or bathing, but should not be inserted deeply into the canal [^116Hn87A].

- **Medical device cleaning**: Alcohol swabs may be used to clean external surfaces of hearing aids or other ear devices, but not inserted into the ear canal [^notfound].

---

## Alternative ear cleaning methods

Several **safer and more effective alternatives** exist for ear cleaning and earwax management:

| **Method** | **Description** | **Indication** |
|-|-|-|
| Cerumenolytic drops | Softening agents such as carbamide peroxide, mineral oil, or saline | - Earwax impaction <br/> - Routine maintenance |
| Irrigation | Gentle irrigation with warm water or saline | Symptomatic cerumen impaction [^112uYa7S] |
| Manual removal | Clinician-performed removal with curettes or suction | - Symptomatic impaction <br/> - Failed conservative measures [^114v1iUs] |
| Observation | No intervention if asymptomatic | Asymptomatic cerumen [^113W81jZ] |

---

## Special considerations and precautions

Certain populations require **additional precautions**:

- **Children**: Alcohol swabs should not be used in children's ears due to the risk of trauma and irritation [^116Hn87A].

- **Individuals with sensitive skin**: Those with eczema, dermatitis, or other skin conditions should avoid alcohol swabs due to potential irritation.

- **Patients with ear pathology**: Individuals with a history of tympanic membrane perforation, chronic otitis media, or other ear conditions should avoid alcohol swabs due to risk of ototoxicity and infection [^112z3DZy].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Alcohol swabs are **not recommended for routine ear cleaning** or earwax removal due to potential risks, including irritation, ototoxicity, and trauma. They may be used for external disinfection before procedures or for drying the external ear after water exposure, but should never be inserted into the ear canal. Clinicians should educate patients on safe ear hygiene practices and recommend evidence-based methods for earwax management, such as cerumenolytic drops, irrigation, or manual removal by trained professionals [^112awaX3] [^114v1iUs].

### Improving aseptic injection standards in aesthetic clinical practice [^117DmJ7s]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

The distance from a patient that respiratory viruses are infective, and the optimum person‐to‐person physical distance is uncertain. For the current foreseeable future, prevention and mitigation of respiratory infection will be a priority in conjunction with aseptic technique for complication prevention. Decreased transmission of viruses at physical distances of 1 m of greater, compared with closer distances, has implication for any profession working near patients' faces. 36 Face mask and eye protection could result in a large reduction in risk of infection.

Prior to any procedure, patients should be advised to attend clinics with a clean face and without cosmetics. Hair should be kept away from treatment areas to reduce contamination risks, with hairbands used for both patient and injecting practitioner, if necessary. Common antiseptics for cutaneous preparation include isopropyl alcohol, povidone‐iodine, and chlorhexidine. 37 The practitioner should note that isopropyl alcohol may cause irritation, is flammable, 37 and can produce severe ocular burns 38; it should not be used near the eye or peri‐ocular area. Povidone‐iodine is rapidly effective but neutralized by contact with blood or sputum, with the added complication of dying hair and clothing. 37 Chlorhexidine provides a sustained antiseptic effect, but poses a risk to the middle ear and has the potential to irreversibly damage the cornea following minimal splash exposure 37, 39; increasingly, chlorhexidine has been associated with reports of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. 40 Hypochlorous acid has advantages for skin asepsis, including a well‐tolerated non‐alcohol base, efficacious in reducing microbial loads, and with benefits of specific preparations for peri‐oral and peri‐ocular asepsis. 37, 41 Products such as Clinsept+ (CHT Ltd), a high purity hypochlorous solution, are compatible with skin pH. A pH neutral preparation for mucus membranes and another for eye treatment are also available and can be used as a mouth wash prior to peri‐oral treatment and antimicrobial for peri‐ocular treatment, respectively. If a nasal procedure is required, hypochlorous solution or 0.23% povidone‐iodine solution may be used in a dosage of two sprays per nostril before entering the office. 27 Purifeyes by FaceRestoration can be instilled directly onto the conjunctival surface or sprayed over the periocular area for antimicrobial cleansing prior to facial treatments where the eyes cannot be covered. Challenges from PPE include discomfort, fogging of eye protection, high resource use linked with potentially decreased equity, equipment shortages, and less clear communication.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^111LuwJC]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — preventive and self-care interventions show mixed results, with one study in 50 patients > 50 years of age testing daily olive oil spray and finding that ear canal contents weighed at 8, 16, and 24 weeks were heavier in treated than control ears. A randomized prospective study of a prophylactic topical emollient enrolled Thirty-nine adults and children and followed them for 12 months, with cerumen impaction recurring in only 23% of intervention patients versus 61% of controls. A randomized trial with 237 symptomatic patients found bulb syringe ear irrigation significantly reduced self-reported symptoms and that fewer than half (49%) of treated patients needed reirrigation by the nurse. In a retrospective chart review of the same 237 patients 2 years later, 73% of control patients required office treatment for earwax occlusion compared with 60% of the intervention group, a statistically significant difference (P = 0.038). In a prospective crossover pilot of 20 adults, once-weekly ear irrigations with 70% isopropyl alcohol (with alternating 2-month irrigation and no-cleaning periods by group) found that those who irrigated had significantly less accumulation of cerumen than those who did not, and findings suggest that once-weekly ear irrigations with isopropyl alcohol may help prevent recurrence of cerumen occlusions, with a larger RCT needed to confirm results. Currently, there is no standard protocol for self-irrigation of ears, and patients interested in these approaches should be properly trained to do them safely.

### Topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^112z3DZy]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antiseptics, one of the possible treatments for CSOM, inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antiseptics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antiseptics or their application can cause irritation of the skin of the outer ear, manifesting as discomfort, pain or itching. Some antiseptics (such as alcohol) may have the potential to be toxic to the inner ear (ototoxicity), with a possible increased risk of causing sensorineural hearing loss, dizziness or tinnitus.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antiseptics for people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2019, Issue 4, via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving patients (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antiseptic agent of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. Two main comparisons were topical antiseptics compared to: a) placebo or no intervention; and b) another topical antiseptic (e.g. topical antiseptic A versus topical antiseptic B). Within each comparison we separated studies where both groups of patients had received topical antiseptics a) alone or with aural toileting and b) on top of antibiotic treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

Five studies were included. It was not possible to calculate the total number of participants as two studies only provided the number of ears included in the study. A. Topical antiseptic (boric acid) versus placebo or no treatment (all patients had aural toileting) Three studies compared topical antiseptics with no treatment, with one study reporting results we could use (254 children; cluster-RCT). This compared the instillation of boric acid in alcohol drops versus no ear drops for one month (both arms used daily dry mopping). We made adjustments to the data to account for the intra-cluster correlation. The very low certainty of the evidence means it is uncertain whether or not treatment with an antiseptic leads to an increase in resolution of ear discharge at both four weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20 to 3.16; 174 participants) and at three to four months (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.47; 180 participants). This study narratively described no differences in suspected ototoxicity or hearing outcomes between the arms (very low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported results for health-related quality of life, adverse effects or serious complications. B. Topical antiseptic A versus topical antiseptic B Two studies compared different antiseptics but only one (93 participants), comparing a single instillation of boric acid powder with daily acetic acid ear drops, provided any information for this comparison. The very low certainty of the evidence means that it is uncertain whether more patients had resolution of ear discharge with boric acid powder compared to acetic acid at four weeks (RR 2.61, 95% CI 1.51 to 4.53; 93 participants), or whether there was a difference between the arms with respect to ear discomfort due to the low number of reported events (RR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.81; 93 participants). Narratively, the study reported no difference in hearing outcomes between the groups. None of the included studies reported any of the other primary or secondary outcomes.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to paucity of the evidence and the very low certainty of that which is available the effectiveness and safety profile of antiseptics in the treatment of CSOM is uncertain.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114fKjLH]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) prevention — measures include removing obstructing cerumen; using acidifying ear drops shortly before swimming, after swimming, at bedtime, or all three; drying the ear canal with a hair dryer; using ear plugs while swimming; and avoiding trauma to the external auditory canal.

### Ear wax [^1176qpWW]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2008). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ear wax only becomes a problem if it causes a hearing impairment or other ear-related symptoms. Ear wax is more likely to accumulate and cause a hearing impairment when normal extrusion is prevented — for example, by the use of hearing aids, or by the use of cotton buds to clean the ears. Ear wax can visually obscure the ear drum, and may need to be removed for diagnostic purposes.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of methods to remove ear wax? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to June 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ear syringing, manual removal (other than ear syringing), and wax softeners (alone or prior to syringing).

### Somatrogon-ghla (Ngenla) [^113cBnsv]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Caution: Never use a bent or damaged needle. Always handle pen needles with care to make sure you do not prick yourself (or anyone else) with the needle. Do not attach a new needle to your pen until you are ready to take your injection.

Preparing for your injection

Step 1 - Getting ready

Wash and dry your hands.
You can use your pen straight from the refrigerator. For a more comfortable injection, leave your pen at room temperature for up to 30 minutes.
Check the name, strength, and label of your pen to make sure it is the medicine your healthcare provider has prescribed for you.
Check the expiration date on the pen label. Do not use if the expiration date has passed.
Do not use your pen if:
it has been frozen or exposed to heat
it has been dropped
it looks broken or damaged
it has been more than 28 days after first use of the pen.
Do not remove the pen cap from your pen - until you are ready to inject.

Step 2 - Choose and clean your injection site

NGENLA can be given in the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, or upper arms.
Choose the best place to inject, as recommended by your healthcare provider.
If more than 1 injection is needed to complete your full dose, each injection should be given in a different injection site.
Do not inject into bony areas, areas that are bruised, red, sore or hard, and areas that have scars or skin conditions.
Clean the injection site with an alcohol swab.
Allow the injection site to dry.
Do not touch injection site after cleaning.

### Guselkumab (Tremfya) [^112xvrEb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Choose injection site

Select from the following areas for your injection:

Front of thighs (recommended)
Lower stomach area (lower abdomen), except for a 2-inch area right around your navel (belly-button)
Back of upper arms (only if someone else is giving you the injection)

Do not inject into skin that is tender, bruised, red, hard, thick, scaly or affected by psoriasis.

Clean injection site

Wash your hands well with soap and warm water.

Wipe your chosen injection site with an alcohol swab and allow it to dry.

Do not touch, fan, or blow on the injection site after you have cleaned it.

Inspect liquid

Take your TREMFYA prefilled syringe out of the carton.

Check the TREMFYA prefilled syringe liquid in the viewing window. It should be clear to slightly yellow and may contain tiny white or clear particles. You may also see one or more air bubbles. This is normal.

Do not inject if the liquid is cloudy or discolored, or has large particles. Call your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a refill.

2. Inject TREMFYA using prefilled syringe

Remove needle cover

Hold your prefilled syringe by the body and pull needle cover straight off. It is normal to see a drop of liquid.

### Necrotizing (malignant) external otitis [^114vbcw2]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Necrotizing (malignant) external otitis, an infection involving the temporal and adjacent bones, is a relatively rare complication of external otitis. It occurs primarily in immunocompromised persons, especially older persons with diabetes mellitus, and is often initiated by self-inflicted or iatrogenic trauma to the external auditory canal. The most frequent pathogen is Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Patients with necrotizing external otitis complain of severe otalgia that worsens at night, and otorrhea. Clinical findings include granulation tissue in the external auditory canal, especially at the bone-cartilage junction. Facial and other cranial nerve palsies indicate a poor prognosis; intracranial complications are the most frequent cause of death. Diagnosis requires culture of ear secretions and pathologic examination of granulation tissue from the infection site. Imaging studies may include computed tomographic scanning, technetium Tc 99m medronate bone scanning, and gallium citrate Ga 67 scintigraphy. Treatment includes correction of immunosuppression (when possible), local treatment of the auditory canal, long-term systemic antibiotic therapy and, in selected patients, surgery. Family physicians and others who provide medical care for immunocompromised patients should be alert to the possibility of necrotizing external otitis in patients who complain of otalgia, particularly if they have diabetes mellitus and external otitis that has been refractory to standard therapy. Susceptible patients should be educated to avoid manipulation of the ear canal (i.e., they should not use cotton swabs to clean their ears) and to minimize exposure of the ear canal to water with a high chloride concentration. Appropriate patients should be referred to an otolaryngologist.

### Topical antibiotics with steroids for chronic suppurative otitis media [^116YrGRc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as steroids, antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). Antibiotics are commonly prescribed in combined preparations with steroids.

Objectives

To assess the effects of adding a topical steroid to topical antibiotics in the treatment of people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any combination of a topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class and a topical corticosteroid (steroid) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic and steroid compared to a) placebo or no intervention and b) another topical antibiotic.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks and after four weeks; health-related quality of life; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity.

Main Results

We included 17 studies addressing 11 treatment comparisons. A total of 1901 participants were included, with one study (40 ears) not reporting the number of participants recruited, which we therefore could not account for. No studies reported health-related quality of life. The main comparisons were: 1. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus placebo or no treatment Three studies (210 participants) compared a topical antibiotic-steroid to saline or no treatment. Resolution of discharge was not reported at between one to two weeks. One study (50 'high-risk' children) reported results at more than four weeks by ear and we could not adjust the results to by person. The study reported that 58% (of 41 ears) resolved with topical antibiotics compared with 50% (of 26 ears) with no treatment, but the evidence is very uncertain. One study (123 participants) noted minor side effects in 16% of participants in both the intervention and placebo groups (very low-certainty evidence). One study (123 participants) reported no change in bone-conduction hearing thresholds and reported no difference in tinnitus or balance problems between groups (very low-certainty evidence). One study (50 participants) reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these patients were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment. One study (123 participants) reported that no side effects occurred in any participants (very low-certainty evidence). 2. Topical antibiotics with steroids versus topical antibiotics (same antibiotics) only Four studies (475 participants) were included in this comparison. Three studies (340 participants) compared topical antibiotic-steroid combinations to topical antibiotics alone. The evidence suggests little or no difference in resolution of discharge at one to two weeks: 82.7% versus 76.6% (risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.96 to 1.21; 335 participants; 3 studies (4 study arms); low-certainty evidence). No results for resolution of discharge after four weeks were reported. One study (110 participants) reported local itchiness but as there was only one episode in each group it is uncertain whether there is a difference (very low-certainty evidence). Three studies (395 participants) investigated suspected ototoxicity but it was not possible to determine whether there were differences between the groups for this outcome (very low-certainty evidence). No study reported serious complications. 3. Topical antibiotics with steroids compared to topical antibiotics alone (different antibiotics) Nine studies (981 participants plus 40 ears) evaluated a range of comparisons of topical non-quinolone antibiotic-steroid combinations versus topical quinolone antibiotics alone. Resolution of discharge may be greater with quinolone topical antibiotics alone at between one to two weeks compared with non-quinolone topical antibiotics with steroids: 82.1% versus 63.2% (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.84; 7 studies; 903 participants, low-certainty evidence). Results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were not reported. One study (52 participants) reported usable data on ear pain, two studies (419 participants) reported hearing outcomes and one study (52 participants) reported balance problems. It was not possible to determine whether there were significant differences between the groups for these outcomes (very low-certainty evidence). Two studies (149 participants) reported no serious complications (very low-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics with steroids in improving the resolution of ear discharge in patients with CSOM because of the limited amount of low-certainty evidence available. Amongst this uncertainty, we found no evidence that the addition of steroids to topical antibiotics affects the resolution of ear discharge. There is also low-certainty evidence that some types of topical antibiotics (without steroids) may be better than topical antibiotic/steroid combinations in improving resolution of discharge. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

### AAOS clinical practice guideline summary: prevention of surgical site infection after major extremity trauma [^113r5C2u]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). High credibility.

AAOS clinical practice guideline — pre-operative skin preparations — describes benefits, harms, and specific cautions: the potential benefit of pre-operative skin preparations is prevention of surgical site and deep infection, whereas potential harms include skin reactions or allergies (including anaphylaxis), mupirocin resistance, and microbiome disturbances. Alcohol-based solutions should not be used on neonates or come into contact with mucosa or eyes, and caution should be exercised because of their flammable nature. CHG solutions can cause skin irritation and must not be allowed to come into contact with the brain, meninges, eye, or middle ear. Alcohol based antiseptics are not recommended for open wounds or those with related allergy.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^111nNQGu]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

Childhood hearing screening — infection control outlines risk sources and required hygiene practices. "The purpose of infection control is to minimize the exposure of people and the environment to microorganisms that may make the testers or the students being tested, sick", and "The amount of risk from exposure to microorganisms can depend on the type of screening tests performed and the opportunities for transfer of microorganisms from person to person either directly or indirectly". Procedures involving ear canals carry added exposure because "Tympanometry or otoacoustic emissions screening provide opportunities for contact with and exposure to cerumen". Although "Cerumen itself is not considered to be an infectious material, it can contain substances that can be infectious", and "cerumen should always be treated as if it contains an infectious material". Device hygiene is specified: "Probe tips used for tympanometry or otoacoustic emissions testing and insert earphones for pure tone testing should either be disposable or cleaned and sterilized after each use", and "Surfaces such as supra-aural headphones and toys or objects used during screening should be cleaned and disinfected before each re-use by using a product such as a wipe or spray". Operational precautions include checking for lice outbreaks; "If so, a modification of the screening schedule is recommended". Program design guidance states, "Each hearing screening program should include a section on strategies and techniques to be used to minimize the potential for spread of infection in the screening protocol, and persons responsible for this task should be identified".

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^114LmLKU]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting describes processes for manually cleaning the ear, including dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope), or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics. This is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM. This is the first update of a Cochrane review published in 2020.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of aural toilet procedures for people with chronic suppurative otitis media.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). The searches were run on 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with at least a one-week follow-up involving adults or children who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency, and for any duration. The main comparisons were aural toileting versus placebo or no intervention, and one aural toileting method versus another aural toileting method. Within each comparison, we separated studies into those in which both groups received other concomitant treatments (e.g. antiseptics or antibiotics) and those without concomitant treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at one week to up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and adverse events (dizziness/vertigo/balance problems, ear bleeding). We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update did not find any new studies. We included three studies with 431 participants (465 ears) reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. One study recruited participants from the Solomon Islands, who were considered a 'high-risk' Indigenous group. None of the included studies reported health-related quality of life, ear pain, or ear bleeding. 1. Daily aural toileting versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, only one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study, 217 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo, or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these participants were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment, and therefore the certainty of evidence was very low. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group, so it was not possible to determine whether there was a difference between the two groups. 2. Daily aural toileting versus single aural toileting episode (both in addition to topical ciprofloxacin) One study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are very uncertain if there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low-certainty evidence). One participant in the group with single aural toileting and self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study, 80 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There were no results reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM when compared to no treatment, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. The evidence was considered very low-certainty as there were concerns over risk of bias, indirectness, imprecision, and suspected publication bias. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^113W81jZ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Supporting text — observation without routine treatment is reasonable when cerumen is not causing symptoms or impeding assessment. The guideline states that such cerumen "can safely be left alone" and that "observation over time can be offered as reasonable management". In a randomized controlled study managed with observation alone, "After 5 days, 5% of patients in the control group demonstrated complete cleaning of the ear canal and 26%, moderate cleansing, when managed with observation alone without any intervention". In another cohort managed without intervention "after a year", developmentally delayed individuals with "50% to 80% of their external canal occluded by cerumen" had follow-up where "44% had no cerumen; 53% still had the same amount but no conductive hearing loss; and only 3% progressed to impaction associated with hearing loss". For diagnostic testing, "cerumen does not appear to interfere significantly with temperature measurement based on infrared ear devices", and in a prospective emergency room study "cerumen impaction was found in 73 of 666 ears examined (11% of ears)" among "333 patients", with "Ear temperature measurement increased only 0.2°C after the cerumen removal" and "This difference had no clinically significant effect on decision making". It also notes that "Most cerumen is asymptomatic and does not impair necessary physical examination" and "It is important that patients understand that cerumen does not always need to be removed".

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^114GdvdV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — aural toilet and adherence to enhance topical delivery — the purpose is "to maximize the efficacy of topical therapy by ensuring that it penetrates the ear canal and reaches the site of infection", and clinicians are told it is important to inform patients how to administer ear drops and that they may need to have the canal cleaned if obstructed by debris; adherence is suboptimal because "Only 40% of patients who self‑medicate do so appropriately during the first 3 days", and adherence increases when someone other than the patient applies the drops; the ear canal should be cleared of inflammatory debris, obstructing cerumen, or any foreign object, and there are no randomized studies of the use of aural toilet in AOE; clinician‑performed aural toilet may use gentle lavage with body‑temperature water, saline solution, or hydrogen peroxide, with alternatives including suction or dry mop; there are no randomized trials addressing safety of aural lavage in diabetic or immunocompromised patients, lavage for cerumen impaction in elderly or diabetic patients has been implicated as a contributing factor in malignant otitis externa, and irrigation with tap water is a potential iatrogenic factor, so high‑risk patients or those with established malignant otitis externa may require atraumatic cleaning with aural suctioning under microscopic guidance; the statement includes "Benefits‑harms assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harm", notes the value judgment that cleaning was appropriate when necessary to improve penetration of the drops, and indicates "Policy level: Recommendation".

### Neomycin sulfate, polymyxin b sulfate, hydrocortisone — antibiotic ear — neo / polym / HC [^111k5bBh]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION:

Therapy with this product should be limited to 10 consecutive days. The external auditory canal should be thoroughly cleansed and dried with a sterile cotton applicator.

For adults, four drops of the solution should be instilled into the affected ear 3 or 4 times daily. For infants and children, three drops are suggested because of the smaller capacity of the ear canal.

The patient should lie with the affected ear upward and then the drops should be instilled. This position should be maintained for 5 minutes to facilitate penetration of the drops into the ear canal. Repeat, if necessary, for the opposite ear.

If preferred, a cotton wick may be inserted into the canal and then the cotton may be saturated with the solution. This wick should be kept moist by adding further solution every 4 hours. The wick should be replaced at least once every 24 hours.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^1123jHZ8]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Cerumen impaction — precautions for removal and irrigation highlight safety considerations and technique selection. The suspicion of a nonintact tympanic membrane should be assessed by history and/or physical examination prior to selection of a disimpaction technique, and prior tympanic membrane perforation, prior ear surgery, intratympanic injections, tympanostomy tubes, or barotrauma should prompt use of techniques other than irrigation. Current otitis externa should also be identified; if the ear canal is currently infected, irrigation should be avoided. Pain should alert clinicians to possible infection or other pathology, and if present the ear should be assessed before selecting a method of cleaning. In the presence of a perforated tympanic membrane, irrigation could produce caloric effects resulting in vertigo, some agents can be toxic to the middle or inner ear, and mechanical removal is the preferred technique when eardrum perforation is suspected. Safe and effective irrigation is not always possible in patients with narrow or stenotic ear canals, and specialized equipment and procedures may be required to safely remove cerumen in these patients. A perforated tympanic membrane or patent tympanostomy tube likewise limits options available for cerumen removal.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^115rZfmA]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Tympanostomy tubes — care during ear drainage and use of ear drops is addressed as follows: If you see drainage from the ear, we recommend the following: Antibiotic ear drops, without oral antibiotics, are all that is needed in most cases (usually ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin-dexamethasone). Do NOT use over the counter ear drops. Ear drainage may build up or dry at the opening of the ear canal, so remove the crusting with a cotton-tipped swab dipped in hydrogen peroxide or warm water, and if thick you can roll up a piece of tissue or toilet paper to help soak it up before using ear drops. Do not swim during infections when there is drainage or discharge coming from the ear; during bathing, use silicone ear plugs, or coat a small cotton ball with petroleum jelly and use it to cover the opening of the ear canal. Use the ear drops only for the amount of time recommended by your doctor, because using them too long could result in a yeast infection. Antibiotics taken by mouth are not needed for most ear drainage with tubes in place, although they may be needed if there is another reason to be on an antibiotic or if the infection does not go away after using only ear drops. When using ear drops, do the following to help pump the drops in the ear canal and get down to the ear tube: Have your child lay down on their side, put ear drops into opening of ear canal, then push down on tragus 4–5 times to help pump the drops into the canal. Most children do not typically have fever or pain when they have ear drainage with tubes in place.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis in clean and clean-contaminated ear surgery [^116sLfhw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Ear surgery may be performed in the treatment of chronic otitis media, ossicular chain disorders, tympanic membrane perforations and otitis media with effusion. Postoperative infection in ear surgery may result in: Wound infections Infection of the middle ear or mastoid resulting in discharge from the ear canal Failure of the tympanic membrane to close Labyrinthitis due to infection in, or adjacent to, the inner ear These complications may be associated with discomfort and inconvenience for the patient, an increase in morbidity and an increase in the costs of medical care.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to assess the effects of local and/or systemic antibiotics for preventing complications such as postoperative discharge, graft failure and labyrinthitis in patients undergoing clean or clean-contaminated ear surgery.

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE (searched January 1966 to December 2002), EMBASE (searched January 1980 to December 2002), the Science Citation Index, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Cochrane Library, Issue 4 2002); the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group and Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Group Specialised Registers and proceedings of scientific meetings. The date of the last search was December 2002. We also contacted investigators in the field (Govaerts, Antwerp). Bibliographies of identified articles were screened for further relevant trials. No language restriction was applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials involving:

Participants

patients undergoing clean or clean-contaminated types of ear surgery. Skull base surgery was excluded.

Intervention

any regimen of local and/or systemic antibiotic prophylaxis administered at or around the time of surgery compared to placebo, no antibiotic, or an alternative intervention group.

Outcome Measures

infection, discharge, graft failure, labyrinthitis, adverse effects of prophylaxis.

Data Collection and Analysis

When possible, investigators were contacted for additional information on data and methodological issues. At least two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality.

Main Results

Eleven studies were included in the review. The methodological quality of the trials was fair to good. However, most studies presented insufficient detail on methodological data. Although definitions of outcome measures were heterogeneous, pooling of results was possible. There were no significant differences between antibiotic prophylaxis groups and control groups in terms of reduction of postoperative infections, graft failures, draining outer ear canals and adverse drug effects.

Reviewers' Conclusions

There is no strong evidence that the large scale use of prophylactic of antibiotics in clean and clean-contaminated ear surgery is helpful in reducing postoperative complications such as wound infection, discharge from the outer ear canal, labyrinthitis and graft failure.

### The bacteriology of children prior to 1st stage autologous ear reconstruction [^115uVM2t]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

In virtually all surgical specialities the use of peri-operative antibiotic prophylaxis to minimise wound site infection is routine practice. Antibiotic selection is targeted towards the pathogens most commonly encountered at the surgical site. The surgical management of microtia is by autologous rib cartilage reconstruction, a process that involves at least two surgical stages. The pits and recesses of the microtia ear are difficult to clean and may shelter unusual pathogens not routinely found as skin commensals, requiring modified prophylaxis. This retrospective review of 37 patients undergoing 1st stage ear reconstruction, examines the pre-operative ear site, nose and throat swabs to determine the common pre-operative bacteria encountered in children prior to ear reconstruction, to aid in appropriate antibiotic selection.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) executive summary [^112Mh4Ts]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

The American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation (AAO-HNSF) has published a supplement to this issue of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery featuring the updated Clinical Practice Guideline: Earwax (Cerumen Impaction). To assist in implementing the guideline recommendations, this article summarizes the rationale, purpose, and key action statements. The 11 recommendations emphasize proper ear hygiene, diagnosis of cerumen impaction, factors that modify management, evaluating the need for intervention, and proper treatment. An updated guideline is needed due to new evidence (3 guidelines, 5 systematic reviews, and 6 randomized controlled trials) and the need to add statements on managing cerumen impaction that focus on primary prevention, contraindicated intervention, and referral and coordination of care.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112SduxJ]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa — risk factors and prevention highlight moisture, barrier disruption, and environmental sources, while noting a lack of randomized prevention trials. Regular cleaning of the ear canal removes cerumen, which is an important barrier to moisture and infection, and other factors such as sweating, allergy, and stress have also been implicated. Most, but not all, studies have found an association with water quality (in terms of bacterial load) and the risk of AOE. The causative organisms are present in most swimming pools and hot tubs; however, even those that comply with water quality standards may still contain AOE pathogens, and these organisms are present in the healthy external auditory canal, which may be a source of AOE. Strategies to prevent AOE are aimed at limiting water accumulation and moisture retention in the external auditory canal and maintaining a healthy skin barrier, but no randomized trials have compared the efficacy of different strategies to prevent AOE.

### Ofloxaxin (ofloxacin) [^1123oxHV]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

How should Ofloxacin Otic Solution be given?

1. Wash hands

The person giving Ofloxacin Otic Solution should wash his/her hands with soap and water.

2. Clean ear & warm bottle

Gently clean any discharge that can be removed easily from the outer ear. DO NOT INSERT ANY OBJECT OR SWAB INTO THE EAR CANAL.

Hold the bottle of Ofloxacin Otic Solution in the hand for one or two minutes to warm the solution.

3. Add drops

For a Middle Ear Infection: The person receiving Ofloxacin Otic Solution should lie on his/her side with the infected ear up. Patients (12 and older) should have 10 drops of Ofloxacin Otic Solution put into the infected ear. Pediatric patients under 12 should have 5 drops put into the infected ear. The tip of the bottle should not touch the fingers or the ear or any other surfaces.

For an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"): The person receiving Ofloxacin Otic Solution should lie on his/her side with the infected ear up. Patients (13 and older) should have 10 drops of Ofloxacin Otic Solution put into the infected ear. Pediatric patients under 13 should have 5 drops put into the infected ear. The tip of the bottle should not touch the fingers or the ear or any other surfaces.

BE SURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW FOR THE PATIENT'S SPECIFIC EAR INFECTION.

4. Press ear or pull ear

For a Middle Ear Infection: While the person receiving Ofloxacin Otic Solution lies on his/her side, the person giving the drops should gently press the TRAGUS (see diagram) 4 times in a pumping motion. This will allow the drops to pass through the hole or tube in the eardrum and into the middle ear.

For an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"): While the person receiving the drops lies on his/her side, the person giving the drops should gently pull the outer ear upward and backward. This will allow the ear drops to flow down into the ear canal.

5. Stay on side

The person who received the ear drops should remain on his/her side for at least 5 minutes.

Repeat steps 2–5 for the other ear if both ears are infected.

### Ear wax [^111566Kz]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ear wax only becomes a problem if it causes a hearing impairment or other ear-related symptoms. Ear wax is more likely to accumulate and cause a hearing impairment when normal extrusion is prevented; for example, by the use of hearing aids, or by the use of cotton buds to clean the ears. Ear wax can visually obscure the ear drum, and may need to be removed for diagnostic purposes.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of methods to remove ear wax? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to July 2014 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found nine studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: ear irrigation (syringing); manual removal (other than ear irrigation); wax softeners prior to irrigation; and wax softeners alone.

### Interventions for children with ear discharge occurring at least two weeks following grommet (ventilation tube) insertion [^115g7mra]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ear discharge (otorrhoea) is common in children with grommets (ventilation/tympanostomy tubes); the proportion of children developing discharge ranges from 25% to 75%. The most common treatment strategies include oral broad-spectrum antibiotics, antibiotic eardrops or those containing a combination of antibiotic(s) and a corticosteroid, and initial observation. Important drivers for one strategy over the other are concerns over the side effects of oral antibiotics and the potential ototoxicity of antibiotic eardrops.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of current treatment strategies for children with ear discharge occurring at least two weeks following grommet (ventilation tube) insertion.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the ENT Trials Register, CENTRAL (2016, Issue 5), multiple databases and additional sources for published and unpublished trials (search date 23 June 2016).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials comparing at least two of the following: oral antibiotics, oral corticosteroids, antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid), corticosteroid eardrops, microsuction cleaning of the ear canal, saline rinsing of the ear canal, placebo or no treatment. The main comparison of interest was antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid) versus oral antibiotics.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Primary outcomes were: proportion of children with resolution of ear discharge at short-term follow-up (less than two weeks), adverse events and serious complications. Secondary outcomes were: proportion of children with resolution of ear discharge at intermediate- (two to four weeks) and long-term (four to 12 weeks) follow-up, proportion of children with resolution of ear pain and fever at short-term follow-up, duration of ear discharge, proportion of children with chronic ear discharge, ear discharge recurrences, tube blockage, tube extrusion, health-related quality of life and hearing. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included nine studies, evaluating a range of treatments, with 2132 children who developed acute ear discharge beyond the immediate postoperative period. We judged the risk of bias to be low to moderate in most studies. Antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid) versus oral antibioticsAntibiotic eardrops with or without corticosteroid were more effective than oral antibiotics in terms of:- resolution of discharge at one week (one study, 42 children, ciprofloxacin eardrops versus amoxicillin: 77% versus 30%; risk ratio (RR) 2.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 5.22; moderate-quality evidence);- resolution of discharge at two weeks (one study, 153 children, bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone eardrops versus amoxicillin-clavulanate: 95% versus 56%; RR 1.70, 95% CI 1.38 to 2.08; moderate-quality evidence);- duration of discharge (two studies, 233 children, ciprofloxacin eardrops versus amoxicillin: median 4 days versus 7 days and bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone eardrops versus amoxicillin-clavulanate: 4 days versus 5 days; moderate-quality evidence);- ear discharge recurrences (one study, 148 children, bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone eardrops versus amoxicillin-clavulanate: 0 versus 1 episode at six months; low-quality evidence); and- disease-specific quality of life (one study, 153 children, bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone eardrops versus amoxicillin-clavulanate: difference in change in median Otitis Media-6 total score (range 6 to 42) at two weeks: -2; low-quality evidence). We found no evidence that antibiotic eardrops were more effective in terms of the proportion of children developing chronic ear discharge or tube blockage, generic quality of life or hearing. Adverse events occurred at similar rates in children treated with antibiotic eardrops and those treated with oral antibiotics, while no serious complications occurred in either of the groups. Other comparisons(a) Antibiotic eardrops with or without corticosteroid were more effective thancorticosteroid eardrops in terms of:- duration of ear discharge (one study, 331 children, ciprofloxacin versus ciprofloxacin-fluocinolone acetonide versus fluocinolone acetonide eardrops: median 5 days versus 7 days versus 22 days; moderate-quality evidence).(b) Antibiotic eardrops were more effective than saline rinsing of the ear canal in terms of:- resolution of ear discharge at one week (one study, 48 children, ciprofloxacin eardrops versus saline rinsing: 77% versus 46%; RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.69; moderate-quality evidence); but not in terms of tube blockage. Since the lower limit of the 95% CI for the effect size for resolution of ear discharge at one week approaches unity, a trivial or clinically irrelevant difference cannot be excluded.(c) Eardrops containing two antibiotics and a corticosteroid (bacitracin-colistin-hydrocortisone) were more effective than no treatment in terms of:- resolution of discharge at two weeks (one study; 151 children: 95% versus 45%; RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.62 to 2.69; moderate-quality evidence);- duration of discharge (one study; 147 children, median 4 days versus 12 days; moderate-quality evidence);- chronic discharge (one study; 147 children; RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.62; low-quality evidence); and- disease-specific quality of life (one study, 153 children, difference in change in median Otitis Media-6 total score (range 6 to 42) between groups at two weeks: -1.5; low-quality evidence). We found no evidence that antibiotic eardrops were more effective in terms of ear discharge recurrences or generic quality of life.(d) Eardrops containing a combination of an antibiotic and a corticosteroid were more effective than eardrops containing antibiotics (low-quality evidence) in terms of:- resolution of ear discharge at short-term follow-up (two studies, 590 children: 35% versus 20%; RR 1.76, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.31); and- duration of discharge (three studies, 813 children); but not in terms of resolution of discharge at intermediate-term follow-up or proportion of children with tube blockage. However, there is a substantial risk of publication bias, therefore these findings should be interpreted with caution.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate to low-quality evidence that antibiotic eardrops (with or without corticosteroid) are more effective than oral antibiotics, corticosteroid eardrops and no treatment in children with ear discharge occurring at least two weeks following grommet insertion. There is some limited, inconclusive evidence that antibiotic eardrops are more effective than saline rinsing. There is uncertainty whether antibiotic-corticosteroid eardrops are more effective than eardrops containing antibiotics only.

Head circumference

The measuring tape will be placed around the head so that the tape lies across the frontal bones of the skull, slightly above the eyebrows, perpendicular to the long axis of the face, above the ears, and over the occipital prominence at the back of the head to obtain the head circumference.

Lower leg length

The measurement of the right leg from the medial malleolus to the medial condyle of the tibia will be recorded.

Foot length

The distance from the heel to the longest toe of the right foot parallel to the long axis of the foot will be recorded.

Body inspection

We will inspect the external genitals to record the sex. It will be determined whether the body is fresh or macerated (skin and soft tissue changes such as skin discoloration or darkening, redness, peeling, and breakdown), and in case of maceration, the grade will be evaluated. A detailed external inspection of the whole body will be done looking for visible congenital physical anomalies or malformations, evidence of trauma, external tumors, skin rashes, and lesions, or changes in the color of the skin (e.g. depigmentation, areas of darkness).

Body cleaning and sterilization

The bodies will be initially washed with clean tap water. The areas of the body to be punctured for MITS will be disinfected with 96% alcohol and iodine solution, allowing five minutes for each to act on the surface of the body for adequate disinfection for the microbiological analyses and the skin will be allowed to air dry.

Postmortem collection of specimens using MITS

The nasopharyngeal sample will be collected by sterile swab in BHI broth. Another nasopharyngeal swab will be collected in Viral Transfer Media (VTM). We will collect 3 to 5 mL cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using a 20G spinal puncture needle by occipital approach, 5 to 10 mL of blood by 18G intramuscular needle, and a 20 mL syringe using the supraclavicular approach or direct puncture to the heart, brain tissue samples for histology, lung tissue samples for microbiology and histology and liver tissue sample for histology using MITS with the sterile Bard Monopty needles. Separate samples will be taken from the right and left lungs and collected in VTM.

### Topical antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1172yQDg]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics, the most common treatment for CSOM, act to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting).

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antibiotics (without steroids) for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 April 2019.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antibiotic agent(s) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic compared to a) placebo or no intervention and b) another topical antibiotic (e.g. topical antibiotic A versus topical antibiotic B). Within each comparison we separated studies where both groups of participants had received topical antibiotic a) alone or with aural toileting and b) on top of background treatment (such as systemic antibiotics).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes included hearing, serious complications and ototoxicity measured in several ways.

Main Results

We included 17 studies with a total of 2198 participants. Twelve studies reported the sample size in terms of participants (not ears); these had a total of 1797 participants. The remaining five studies reported both the number of participants and ears, representing 401 participants, or 510 ears. A: Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with aural toilet in both arms and no other background treatment) One small study compared a topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) with placebo (saline). All participants received aural toilet. Although ciprofloxacin was better than saline in terms of resolution of discharge at one to two weeks: 84% versus 12% (risk ratio (RR) 6.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82 to 24.99; 35 participants, very low-certainty evidence), the very low certainty of the evidence means that it is very uncertain whether or not one intervention is better or worse than the other. The study authors reported that "no medical side-effects and worsening of audiological measurements related to this topical medication were detected" (very low-certainty evidence). B: Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with use of oral antibiotics in both arms) Four studies compared topical ciprofloxacin to no treatment (three studies; 190 participants) or topical ceftizoxime to no treatment (one study; 248 participants). In each study all participants received the same antibiotic systemically (oral ciprofloxacin, injected ceftizoxime). In at least one study all participants received aural toilet. Useable data were only available from the first three studies; ciprofloxacin was better than no treatment, resolution of discharge occurring in 88.2% versus 60% at one to two weeks (RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.80; 2 studies, 150 participants; low-certainty evidence). None of the studies reported ear pain or discomfort/local irritation. C: Comparisons of different topical antibiotics The certainty of evidence for all outcomes in these comparisons is very low. Quinolones versus aminoglycosides Seven studies compared an aminoglycoside (gentamicin, neomycin or tobramycin) with ciprofloxacin (734 participants) or ofloxacin (214 participants). Whilst resolution of discharge at one to two weeks was higher in the quinolones group the very low certainty of the evidence means that it is very uncertain whether or not one intervention is better or worse than the other (RR 1.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 4.29; 6 studies, 694 participants). One study measured ear pain and reported no difference between the groups. Quinolones versus aminoglycosides/polymyxin B combination ± gramicidin We identified three studies but data on our primary outcome were only available in one study. Comparing ciprofloxacin to a neomycin/polymyxin B/gramicidin combination, for an unknown treatment duration (likely four weeks), ciprofloxacin was better (RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.22, 186 participants). A "few" patients experienced local irritation upon the first instillation of topical treatment (numbers/groups not stated). Others Other studies examined topical gentamicin versus a trimethoprim/sulphacetamide/polymixin B combination (91 participants) and rifampicin versus chloramphenicol (160 participants). Limited data were available and the findings were very uncertain.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics in improving resolution of ear discharge in patients with CSOM because of the limited amount of low-quality evidence available. However, amongst this uncertainty there is some evidence to suggest that the use of topical antibiotics may be effective when compared to placebo, or when used in addition to a systemic antibiotic. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine with any certainty whether or not quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, adverse effects were poorly reported.

### Topical antiseptics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^117H1e88]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antiseptics, a possible treatment for CSOM, inhibit the micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antiseptics can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). However, the effects of topical antiseptics for CSOM remain unclear. This is an update of a review last published in 2020, with one new study added. It is one of a suite of seven Cochrane reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To assess the effects of topical antiseptics for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We also searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The date of the latest search was 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving participants (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antiseptic agent of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders, or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antiseptics (a) compared to placebo or no intervention, and (b) compared to another topical antiseptic (e.g. topical antiseptic A versus topical antiseptic B). Within each comparison, we separated studies into (a) those in which both groups of participants had received aural toileting in addition to the topical antiseptics, and those where neither group had received aural toileting, and (b) those in which both groups had received some other concomitant treatment (such as antibiotics) and those with no such concomitant treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Our primary outcomes were resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We found one new study (32 participants) in this update, for a total of six included studies with 435 participants (over four studies), plus 222 ears that could not be accounted for in participant numbers (in two studies). Four studies compared topical antiseptics with no treatment or placebo, and two studies compared two different topical antiseptics (boric acid versus acetic acid, and boric acid versus hydrogen peroxide). The two core comparisons of interest are reported below; other comparisons are described in the Results section of the review. No study measured health-related quality of life or ear pain. 1. Topical antiseptic versus placebo or no treatment Three studies (297 participants plus 174 ears) compared topical antiseptics with no treatment. Evidence from one study (unclear number of participants, 174 ears) is very uncertain about the effect of a single application of povidone iodine in hydroxypropyl methyl-cellulose (HPMC) on resolution of ear discharge at one week compared to HPMC alone; however, these results were only provided by ear (rather than by participant) and therefore could not be used quantitatively (very low-certainty evidence). One study (254 children; cluster-RCT) found that boric acid in alcohol ear drops with dry mopping may help resolution of ear discharge after four weeks compared with dry mopping alone, but the evidence is very uncertain (risk ratio (RR) 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21 to 2.47; 180 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We made adjustments to the data to account for the intracluster correlation. This study narratively described no clear differences in suspected ototoxicity or hearing outcomes between study arms, but the evidence is very uncertain (very low-certainty evidence). Evidence from one study (43 children; 58 ears) is very uncertain about the effect of antiseptics on serious complications. The study reported one case of mastoiditis and one of meningitis with focal encephalitis; however, it was unclear whether these were detected pre-randomisation or during/after treatment. 2. Topical antiseptics versus no treatment/placebo, where both study arms received systemic antibiotics One study (32 participants) compared topical povidone iodine with placebo (saline) in conjunction with oral amoxicillin and dry mopping. Topical povidone iodine with oral amoxicillin and dry mopping may increase resolution of ear discharge at one to two weeks (RR 3.25, 95% CI 1.35 to 7.84; 32 participants; low-certainty evidence). The study narratively reported no ototoxicity in the topical antiseptic arm; however, this was unclear for the placebo group, so we do not know if povidone iodine increases suspected ototoxicity (low-certainty evidence). The study did not assess resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, hearing, or serious complications.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain about the effect of topical antiseptics on improving resolution of ear discharge in people with CSOM given the low and very low certainty of the evidence, which was mostly due to risk of bias and imprecision. However, there is some evidence suggesting that boric acid in alcohol ear drops with dry mopping may help resolution of ear discharge compared with dry mopping alone, and that topical povidone iodine may be more effective than placebo (where both arms used systemic beta-lactam antibiotics and dry mopping). There is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about harmful effects. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Otitis externa: a practical guide to treatment and prevention [^114U9KpW]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Otitis externa is most commonly caused by infection (usually bacterial, although occasionally fungal), but it may also be associated with a variety of noninfectious systemic or local dermatologic processes. The most characteristic symptom is discomfort that is limited to the external auditory canal, while the most characteristic signs are erythema and swelling of the canal with variable discharge. Excessive moisture and trauma, both of which impair the canal's natural defenses, are the two most common precipitants of otitis externa, and avoidance of these precipitants is the cornerstone of prevention. Thorough cleansing of the canal is essential for diagnosis and treatment, but flushing should be avoided. Acidification with a topical solution of 2 percent acetic acid combined with hydrocortisone for inflammation is effective treatment in most cases and, when used after exposure to moisture, is an excellent prophylactic. Other prophylactic measures such as drying the ears with a hair dryer and avoiding manipulation of the external auditory canal may help prevent recurrence.

### Ofloxaxin (ofloxacin) [^11279yip]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

How often should Ofloxacin Otic Solution be given?

In patients with an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given once daily at about the same time each day (for example, 8 AM or 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

In patients with a Middle Ear Infection, Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops should be given 2 times each day (about 12 hours apart, for example 8 AM and 8 PM) in each infected ear unless the doctor has instructed otherwise. The best times to use the ear drops are in the morning and at night.

It is very important to use the ear drops for as long as the doctor has instructed, even if the symptoms improve. If Ofloxacin Otic Solution ear drops are not used for as long as the doctor has instructed, the infection may be more likely to return.

What if a dose is missed?

In patients with an Ear Canal Infection ("Swimmer's Ear"), it is important that you take the drops every day. If you miss a dose which may have been scheduled for earlier in the day, (for example, 8 AM), you should take that day's dose as soon as possible and then go back to your regular daily dosing schedule.

In patients with Middle Ear Infection, if a dose of Ofloxacin Otic Solution is missed, it should be given as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule.

Do not use a double dose unless the doctor has instructed you to do so. If the infection is not improved after one week, you should consult your doctor. If you have two or more episodes of drainage within six months, it is recommended that you see your doctor for further evaluation.

What activities should be avoided while using Ofloxacin Otic Solution?

It is important that the infected ear(s) remain clean and dry. When bathing, avoid getting the infected ear(s) wet. Avoid swimming unless the doctor has instructed otherwise.

Cerumen impaction — interventions not recommended include home use of oral jet irrigators and cotton‑tipped swabs; research demonstrating effectiveness of these home options is lacking and expert opinion favors clinician‑administered methods as the most safe and effective. Expert opinion recommends against cotton‑tipped swabs, product labeling warns not to place them into the ear canal, a case report describes fatal otogenic meningitis and brain abscess due to retained cotton swabs, and in a prospective study Thirty‑six percent of the patients cleaned their ears by introducing a foreign object into the ear.

### Niche-and gender-dependent immune reactions in relation to the microbiota profile in pediatric patients with otitis media with effusion [^113TdDFz]. Infection and Immunity (2020). Medium credibility.

Sample collection and preparation.

Prior to myringotomy, the ears were rinsed from cerumen and flushed with 1 mL sterile saline. This external ear canal (EEC) lavage fluid was collected for microbiome analyses. The ear canals were subsequently washed once with 70% denatured alcohol. After incision of the tympanic membrane, the middle ear effusion (MEE) was aspirated into a sterile trap, and 1 mL sterile saline was used to clear the suction catheter. Nasopharyngeal (NPH) swabs were collected and swirled in 1 mL sterile saline. See Fig. S1B for a summary of sample collection procedure. Besides use for the analyses in this study, all MEE and NPH samples were also routinely sent to the Department of Clinical Microbiology, Skåne University Hospital, for identification of bacteria.

Aliquots of all samples were immediately frozen at −80°C for subsequent microbiome analyses. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 350 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were collected and stored at −80°C until used for analyses of inflammatory mediators. Red blood cells in the cell pellets were lysed using ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysing buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The cells were washed, and the total number of cells in the samples, as well as the percentage of viable cells, was calculated by the trypan blue exclusion assay.

### Hear this: cotton-tipped swabs are not made for ears… [^113hD75h]. publications.aap.org (2017). Low credibility.

If your bathroom cabinet includes cotton-tipped swabs to clean your child's ears, you might want to move them to the craft drawer, makeup case or cleaning cabinet instead. Cotton-tipped swabs are not meant to be placed in ears. In fact, pediatricians say the best thing to do with earwax is to leave it alone. Trying to remove earwax can cause problems, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. There's a reason people wrongly think swabs are OK to use in their ears. Their inventor created cotton-tipped swabs after seeing his wife try to clean inside their baby's ears with a piece of cotton on the end of a toothpick in the 1920s. Doctors recently found that using cotton-tipped swabs in this manner could cause more harm than good. They recommend: "Don't put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear. " Putting cotton-tipped swabs into the ear canal pushes wax further into the ear. It can cause damage, dizziness and balance problems.

A child whose earwax is blocking the ear may have ringing or fullness, ear pain, itching, discharge, odor and cough. Swabs also may tear or rupture the eardrum causing pain, bleeding and permanent hearing loss. A recent study found that about 34 children go to the emergency room each day for cotton-tipped swab ear injuries. Most injuries happened when cleaning the ears, especially when the child tried to clean them. Damage to the ear drums was most common for kids younger than 8 years old. Earwax also can build up if children wear ear plugs or stick their fingers in their ears. Over-the-counter products can help treat earwax buildup, but some products can lead to more problems. For example, ear candles can cause burns, bleeding or can hurt the ear drum, said the Food and Drug Administration. If the earwax is not causing symptoms or blocking the ear canal, it should be left alone, doctors say.

### Role of antiseptics in the prevention of surgical site infections [^117DFq7W]. Dermatologic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Antiseptics are chemical agents used to reduce the microbial population on the surface of the skin and are used in nearly every surgical procedure today. Despite this, there are currently no definitive guidelines on surgical preoperative antisepsis that indicate a specific regimen based on demonstration of superior efficacy.

Objective

This review serves to examine preoperative antisepsis, including cutaneous bacteriology, preoperative hair removal, preoperative decolonization, surgical attire, and the antiseptic agents themselves.

Materials and Methods

A review of the literature on surgical antiseptics was performed.

Results

Although numerous studies have demonstrated differences in bacterial colonization rates, few well-controlled investigations have demonstrated superiority of a given regimen. The alcohol-based iodophor and chlorhexidine products seem to exhibit greater efficacy than their aqueous counterparts.

Conclusion

More randomized controlled trials will be needed to determine if any specific regimen is most effective. At this point in time, product usage should be based on specific attributes relating to the products, such as iodophors around the eyes and/or ears to avoid irritation and aqueous-based solutions in hair bearing areas because of concern for flammability. Ultimately, it is up to the individual surgeon to tailor the optimal antiseptic regimen for their specific scope of practice.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^113MJuho]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Earwax removal — comparative device versus manual probe evidence notes that "A nonrandomized comparison of earwax removal with a 'do it yourself' ear vacuum kit versus the conventional manual method of removal by a clinician with a Jobson-Horne probe concluded that the probe is significantly more effective than an ear vacuum for the removal of earwax", although "A majority of the patients in that study were not willing to change their habits for a safer method of cleaning".

What Are the Potential Harms of NL to Personal Contacts/HCWs Caring For COVID-19 Patients?

Risk of droplet spread and surface contamination

Irrigation is likely to generate droplets potentially carrying viruses. Sinus irrigation devices, mostly composed by plastic, can harbor viruses for hours: van Doremalen et al showed that SARS-CoV-2 is very stable on plastic and remains viable up to 72 hours. As the COVID-19 status of most of patients using NL is unknown, specific measures should be undertaken to protect personal contacts or HCWs.

Protective measures

– Clean the inside and outside of the NL device thoroughly with soap and water. For a deeper clean of components of the device that come into contact with the nose, clean with 70% isopropyl alcohol or concentrated white vinegar, rinse, and then leave to it dry before next use. Some commercial products may be suitable for sterilization in the microwave but must be replaced if there is any sign of degradation of plastic components.
– Self-irrigation is important, avoiding viral exposure to others.
– Ventilate the room: being able to remain suspended in the air, small droplets were shown to permit SARS-CoV-2 detection in ambient air for 3 hours. Guidelines on air exchanges per hour required for airborne contaminant removal have been edited by CDC.
– Perform household cleaning, disinfection of high-touch surfaces, and hand hygiene. The United States Environmental Protection Agency and the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) published a list of recommended household disinfectants.

Consistent with current guidance, these measures will help to limit viral spreading.

### Microbiome of the healthy external auditory canal [^116FBx5H]. Otology & Neurotology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To investigate the microbiota of the healthy external auditory canal (EAC) culture-independently and to evaluate the usefulness of the swabbing method in collecting EAC microbiota samples.

Study Design

Cohort study.

Patients

Fifty healthy asymptomatic working-age volunteers.

Intervention

Samples were harvested with DNA-free swabs from the volunteers' EACs.

Main Outcome Measures

Amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to characterize the microbial communities in the samples.

Results

The swabbing method is feasible for EAC microbiota sample collection. The analyzed 41 samples came from 27 female and 14 male subjects; 4 samples were excluded due to recent antimicrobial treatment and 5 because of low sequence count or suspected contaminant microbes. The four most frequent amplicon sequence variants in the microbiota data were Staphylococcus auricularis, Propionibacterium acnes, Alloiococcus otitis, and Turicella otitidis. Typically, the dominant amplicon sequence variant in a sample was one of the most frequent bacteria, but there were also subjects where the dominant species was not among the most frequent ones. The genus Alloiococcus was least common in females who reported cleaning their ears. Subjects with a high relative abundance of Alloiococcus typically had a low abundance of Staphylococcus, which may be a sign of the two being competing members of the microbial community.

Conclusions

The most common bacteria in the microbiome of the healthy EAC were Staphylococcus auricularis, Propionibacterium acnes, Alloiococcus otitis, and Turicella otitidis. The EAC microbiota seems more diverse and individualized than previously thought. Also, ear cleaning habits seem to alter the EAC microbiome.

### Aural toilet (ear cleaning) for chronic suppurative otitis media [^1155AYug]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media (COM), is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms of CSOM are ear discharge and hearing loss. Aural toileting is a term describing a number of processes for manually cleaning the ear. Techniques used may include dry mopping (with cotton wool or tissue paper), suction clearance (typically under a microscope) or irrigation (using manual or automated syringing). Dry mopping may be effective in removing mucopurulent discharge. Compared to irrigation or microsuction it is less effective in removing epithelial debris or thick pus. Aural toileting can be used alone or in addition to other treatments for CSOM, such as antibiotics or topical antiseptics.

Objectives

To assess the effects of aural toilet procedures for people with CSOM.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL via the Cochrane Register of Studies); Ovid MEDLINE; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 16 March 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with at least a one-week follow-up involving people (adults and children) who had chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. We included any aural toileting method as the intervention, at any frequency and for any duration. The comparisons were aural toileting compared with a) placebo or no intervention, and b) any other aural toileting method. We analysed trials in which background treatments were used in both arms (e.g. topical antiseptics or topical antibiotics) separately.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard Cochrane methodological procedures. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks to up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and the adverse events of ear bleeding and dizziness/vertigo/balance problems.

Main Results

We included three studies with a total of 431 participants (465 ears), reporting on two comparisons. Two studies included only children with CSOM in the community (351 participants) and the other study (80 participants) included children and adults with chronic ear discharge for at least six weeks. None of the included studies reported the outcomes of health-related quality of life, ear pain or the adverse event of ear bleeding. Daily aural toileting (dry mopping) versus no treatment Two studies (351 children; 370 ears) compared daily dry mopping with no treatment. Neither study presented results for resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks or between two to four weeks. For resolution of ear discharge after four weeks, one study reported the results per person. We are very uncertain whether there is a difference at 16 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.60 to 1.72; 1 study; 217 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. No results were reported for the adverse events of dizziness, vertigo or balance problems. Only one study reported serious complications, but it was not clear which group these patients were from, or whether the complications occurred pre- or post-treatment. One study reported hearing, but the results were presented by treatment outcome rather than by treatment group so it is not possible to determine whether there is a difference between the two groups. Daily aural toileting versus single aural toileting on top of topical ciprofloxacin One study (80 participants; 95 ears) compared daily aural toileting (suction) with administration of topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) ear drops in a clinic, to a single aural toileting (suction) episode followed by daily self-administered topical antibiotic drops, in participants of all ages. We are unsure whether there is a difference in resolution of ear discharge at between one and up to two weeks (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.30; 1 study; 80 participants) because the certainty of the evidence is very low. There were no results reported for resolution of ear discharge at between two to four weeks. The results for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks were presented by ear, not person, and could not be adjusted to by person. One patient in the group with single aural toileting and self administration of topical antibiotic ear drops reported the adverse event of dizziness, which the authors attributed to the use of cold topical ciprofloxacin. It is very uncertain whether there is a difference between the groups (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.95; 1 study; 80 participants, very low-certainty). No results were reported for the other adverse events of vertigo or balance problems, or for serious complications. The authors only reported qualitatively that there was no difference between the two groups in hearing results (very low-certainty).

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain whether or not treatment with aural toileting is effective in resolving ear discharge in people with CSOM, due to a lack of data and the poor quality of the available evidence. We also remain uncertain about other outcomes, including adverse events, as these were not well reported. Similarly, we are very uncertain whether daily suction clearance, followed by antibiotic ear drops administered at a clinic, is better than a single episode of suction clearance followed by self-administration of topical antibiotic ear drops.

### A prospective study to evaluate the efficacy of isopropyl alcohol irrigations to prevent cerumen impaction [^115Wih3N]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2012). Low credibility.

We conducted a prospective crossover study to assess the safety and efficacy of 70% isopropyl alcohol delivered from a squeezable bottle with a specially designed tip as a weekly irrigant to reduce cerumen accumulation. Twenty patients were divided into 2 groups of 10 (20 ears in each group). The patients in group 1 instilled 70% isopropyl alcohol once a week for 2 months; this was followed by 2 months of no ear cleaning. The patients in group 2 performed the opposite routine. At each visit (0, 2, and 4 mo), cerumen accumulation was graded on a scale of 0 to 4, indicating 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100% occlusion, respectively. After the accumulation was graded, a cerumenectomy was performed. At the initial evaluation, the mean occlusion scores were 3.1 for group 1 and 3.3 for group 2-not a statistically significant difference. After the first 2 months of the study, there was a significant difference in occlusion scores between groups 1 and 2 (0.75 and 1.55, respectively; p < 0.0002). At 4 months, after the crossover, the occlusion scores were 1.15 and 0.95, respectively, not a significant difference (p = 0.38). At study's end, there were also significant differences within each group between occlusion scores obtained during the treatment and nontreatment periods (group 1: p < 0.02; group 2: p < 0.01). All patients tolerated the alcohol rinse well, and there were no cases of external otitis or other complications. We conclude that weekly irrigation with 70% isopropyl alcohol is safe and reduces the accumulation of cerumen in the external auditory canal. Routine use should decrease the number of office visits for cerumen removal and hearing aid cleaning.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^113C2uGK]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Table 7 — patient education for cerumen (earwax) outlines Do items such as recognizing that earwax is normal and that earwax not causing symptoms or blocking the ear canal should be left alone; understanding symptoms of cerumen impaction (decreased hearing, fullness, tinnitus, and changes to hearing aid function); seeking medical evaluation for hearing loss, ear fullness, or ear pain when the cause is uncertain because other conditions can masquerade as cerumen impaction; asking a provider about safe home treatments; and seeking medical attention for ear pain, drainage, or bleeding. The Don't items include: overclean your ears; put anything smaller than your elbow in your ear; use ear candles because there is no evidence they remove impacted cerumen and they can cause serious damage; ignore symptoms if home remedies are unsuccessful; irrigate or try cerumen-removing/softening drops after ear surgery or with a perforated eardrum unless cleared by an otolaryngologist; and forget to clean hearing aids as recommended by the manufacturer or hearing health professional.

### Alcohol wipes are the most justifiably sustainable disinfection method for goldmann tonometry [^1152aRz1]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

The mechanism of common disinfectants

Alcohols

Alcohols provide disinfectant action against a wide spectrum of microorganisms by denaturing proteins, however, do not inactivate spores and do not effectively penetrate protein-rich materials. Ethyl alcohol (ethanol) is a useful disinfectant but is more tightly regulated due to the potential for misuse. 70% isopropyl alcohol has been shown to be ineffective against poliovirus and adenovirus as a soaking solution, as these non-enveloped viruses have a dense protein capsid. Using alcohol wipes can result in keratopathy if the tip is not dry or if swabs with additional disinfectants such as chlorhexidine are used without rinsing. It is hard to quantify the morbidity caused by this but it has led some institutions to stop using alcohol disinfection (personal communication).

Chlorine compounds

Dilute bleach is commonly used as a disinfectant in the healthcare setting. Chlorine compounds denature proteins and oxidise cell membranes, leading to effectivity against bacteria, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, mycoplasma, mycobacterium and fungi. Chlorine-based solutions should achieve a concentration of > 5000 ppm (in accordance with the CDC and AAO recommendations for HIV inactivation).

Hydrogen peroxide

Free radicals produced by hydrogen peroxide-containing cleaning products oxidise cell membranes and critical intracellular components such as DNA. 10% hydrogen peroxide has been shown to be effective against a wide range of organisms including bacteria, enveloped and non-enveloped viruses, fungi, yeasts, bacteria and acanthamoeba cysts. Hydrogen peroxide carries the risk of significant corneal toxicity if not removed from the tonometer tip after disinfection.

Related to the choice of disinfectant is the issue of degradation of the tip, because after multiple cycles of disinfection the surface of a reusable tip can become porous or scratched, increasing the theoretical risk of harbouring infectious particles between cases. Immersion in isopropyl alcohol, or repeated simulated wiping was noted to reduce the lifespan of the tip to 1–2 years. Structural damage has been found on Schiotz tonometers with a 1:10 concentration of sodium hypochlorite (5000 ppm chlorine) and 3% hydrogen peroxide.

Nasopharyngeal swabs

For HCP performing in-room collection of nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens from suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, 44 facilities (64%) recommended N95 respirators or the equivalent, identified in the survey as N95s, powered air purifying respirators (PAPRs), or half-mask respirators, which purify air with cartridges built into a rubber mask covering the nose and chin, based on "actual circumstances/supplies in the facility" (Table 3). Overall, 57 facilities (82%) recommended eyewear such as shields or goggles and 34 (49%) recommended a N95 respirator or equivalent with the eyewear. In addition, 24 facilities (35%) recommended a surgical mask with the eyewear, and 1 (1%) recommended eyewear (presumably a face shield) alone. The survey did not ask whether in-room nasopharyngeal swabs occurred in negative-pressure rooms. Also, 4 facilities (6%) used respirators for outdoor nasopharyngeal swab collection.

Front of thighs (recommended)
Lower stomach area (lower abdomen), except for a 2-inch area right around your navel (belly-button)
Back of upper arms (only for adults and only if someone else is giving you the injection). This injection site is not for use in children.

Do not inject into skin that is tender, bruised, red, hard, thick, scaly, or affected by psoriasis.

Wash hands

Wash your hands well with soap and warm water.

Clean injection site

Wipe your chosen injection site with an alcohol swab and allow it to dry.

Do not touch, fan, or blow on the injection site after you have cleaned it.

Inspect liquid in window

Take your One-Press injector out of the carton.

Check the liquid in the window. It should be clear to slightly yellow and may contain tiny white or clear particles. You may also see one or more air bubbles. This is normal.

Do not inject if the liquid is:

cloudy,
discolored, or
has large particles.

Call your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a new One-Press injector.

### Recommendations for HIV prevention with adults and adolescents with HIV in the United States, 2014 [^111Hkdt2]. HIV.gov (2014). Medium credibility.

Box 7-C — important topics when informing persons with HIV about how to prevent transmission of HIV to others include counseling on substance use and sharing drug-injection equipment, covering the health benefits of abstaining from or reducing substance use; the relation between use of some recreational drugs and higher risk sexual practices (e.g., methamphetamines); risk of transmitting HIV when sharing drug-injection equipment; and benefits of completing substance use treatment (that may include relapse prevention and opioid substitution programs). Methods to reduce the risk of transmitting HIV if drug injection continues include reducing the number of drug-injection partners, using new, sterile equipment from reliable sources (pharmacies, SSPs), using sterile needles, syringes, fluids, cookers, and cotton each time to prepare and inject drugs, using sterile water (preferable) or fresh tap water when preparing drugs, never sharing or reusing drug-injection or preparation equipment, cleaning injection sites with alcohol swabs before injection, and disposing needles and syringes in safe places after each use.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^1168zcsd]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Influenza — prevention recommendations to prevent exposure emphasize hygiene and cough etiquette. Basic personal hygiene, including hand hygiene and proper cough etiquette, are mainstays of influenza prevention. Individuals should avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth and avoid contact with sick individuals. Hands should be washed often with soap and water or, if soap and water are unavailable, with an alcohol-based hand rub containing at least 60% alcohol. Proper hand washing technique involves wetting hands with clean running water, applying soap, and rubbing and scrubbing all hand surfaces and under the fingernails for at least 20 seconds; hands should be dried with a clean towel or air dried. When using alcohol-based hand rub, the hand rub should be applied to one hand, and the hands (including all hand surfaces and fingers) should be rubbed together until dry. Cough etiquette directs that individuals cough or sneeze into a tissue rather than into their hands, and a soiled tissue should be disposed of in a waste basket.

### Self-care and clinical management of persons with laryngectomy during COVID-19 pandemic: a narrative review [^113co4Az]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2021). Medium credibility.

Self-protection of home caregiver

Stringent hand hygiene measures also apply to home caregivers of persons with laryngectomy. Direct contact with the tracheostoma (stoma care, voice prosthesis change, inspection of leakage etc.) is regarded as a high-risk procedure because of the increased chances of instigating cough and the aerosolization. Meticulous hand washing prior to and after direct contact is a way to protect themselves and the person with laryngectomy. In addition, it is advisable that the caregiver wears a mask, disposable gloves, and googles while in contact with the stoma.

Care of devices

It is of utmost importance to follow strict hygiene practices with voice rehabilitation devices considering their close contact with the stoma, mouth, and nose.
Voice prosthesis

In tracheoesophageal speakers, stomal occlusion by finger for phonation increases the likelihood of virus transmission directly to the trachea in case of contaminated hands.

Hand hygiene should be emphasized before and after speaking. Hands-free HME prevents the need for hand occlusion and is therefore beneficial, especially during these pandemic situations. Valves with silver oxide coating and Teflon are recommended to limit biofilm formation. An indwelling device should be cleaned by a dedicated brush. Furthermore, the cleaning brush should be immersed in 70% ethanol or 70% isopropyl alcohol for 10 min or 3% hydrogen peroxide for 60 min as a sanitary measure. Non-indwelling devices should be cleaned by immersing in disinfectants.
Electro larynx The electrolarynx should be thoroughly cleaned using an alcohol swab prior to using it for speaking.
Pneumatic device

The pneumatic artificial larynx is more common in Asian countries. This device comprises of a reed which is driven by respiration. One end of the device is cupped over the stoma, whereas the other end comprises of a tube that is placed in the mouth. The vibrations are transferred to the mouth and voicing is produced by movement of the articulators.

The article by Yeung and colleagues recommends cleaned of the tubing by inserting tissue strips as the top and bottom end of the device can be soiled by saliva and sputum respectively. In addition, the device must be immersed in 3% hydrogen peroxide solution for 5–10 min and rinsed with saline or boiled drinking water before use.

### In vitro efficacy of a consumer-marketed ear cleaning tool [^111CujQ5]. Otology & Neurotology (2014). Low credibility.

Hypothesis

The WaxVac ear cleaning device may be a useful adjunct for patients requiring aural toilet.

Background

Cerumen removal and routine aural toilet is a common complaint that presents to the otolaryngology clinic. We tested this device to make an appropriate recommendation to our patients.

Methods

We conducted in vitro testing of the WaxVac device on an artificial ear canal model and cadaveric temporal bones testing the strength of the suction, noise created by the device, and the ability of the device to remove foreign bodies from the external auditory canal. These foreign bodies included a PE tube, baby powder, a q-tip head, saline, and artificial cerumen.

Results

The WaxVac created very little suction as compared with Frazier tip suctions used in clinic. The device produced very little noise in the canal, which was equivalent to a #3 Frazier tip suction. The WaxVac was unable to remove q-tip heads or artificial cerumen from the ear canal model or the cadaveric temporal bones. Very little of the saline could be removed by the WaxVac, and only 20% to 50% of trials demonstrated removal of a PE tube. However, a large amount of the powder was able to be removed by the device.

Conclusion

Although the concept of this device is good, the actual product does not produce adequate suction to remove cerumen or most common foreign bodies from the external auditory canal. It is unlikely to be useful for aural toilet.

Box 1
General guidelines for illness prevention in athletes

Behavioural, lifestyle and medical strategies A variety of behavioural, lifestyle and medical intervention strategies have been advocated to reduce the risk of illness in the athlete. These include advice to athletes, measures taken by medical staff and the athlete support team. Athletes are advised to: Minimise contact with infected people, young children, animals and contagious objects; Avoid crowded areas and shaking hands and minimise contact with people outside the team and support staff; Keep at distance to people who are coughing, sneezing or have a 'runny nose', and when appropriate wear (or ask them to wear) a disposable mask; Cough or sneeze on to the elbow and not on the hands — always clean the hands and nose after sneezing or coughing; Wash hands regularly and effectively with soap and water, especially before meals, and after direct contact with potentially contagious people, animals, blood, secretions, public places and bathrooms; Use disposable paper towels and limit hand to mouth/nose contact when suffering from upper respiratory symptoms or gastrointestinal illness (putting hands to eyes and nose is a major route of viral self-inoculation); Carry insect repellent, antimicrobial foam/cream or alcohol-based hand washing gel with them; Not to share drinking bottles, cups, cutlery, towels, etc, with other people; Choose beverages from sealed bottles, avoid raw vegetables and undercooked meat, wash and peel fruit before eating, while competing or training abroad; Wear enough covered clothing (covering the arms and legs) during training sessions when travelling in tropical areas, particularly at dusk and dawn; Wear open footwear when using public showers, swimming pools and locker rooms in order to avoid dermatological diseases; Adopt strategies that facilitate good quality sleep such as strategic napping during the day and correct sleep hygiene practices at night; Avoid excessive drinking and binge drinking of alcohol as this impairs immune function for several hours, particularly after strenuous training or competition; Practice the principles of safe sex and use condoms. Medical staff taking care of athletes is advised to consider the following: Develop, implement and monitor illness prevention guidelines for athletes and medical and administrative support staff; Screening for airway inflammation disturbances (asthma, allergy and other inflammatory airway conditions); Identify the high-risk athletes and take full preventative precautions during high-risk training or competition periods; Arrange for single room accommodation during tournaments for athletes with heavy competition load or known susceptibility to respiratory tract infections, or high performance priority athletes; Consider protecting the airways of athletes from being directly exposed to very cold (< 0°C) and dry air during strenuous exercise by using a facial mask; Adopt measures to reduce the risk of illness associated with international travel; Update athletes vaccines needed at home and for foreign travel and take into consideration that influenza vaccines take 5–7 weeks to take effect, intramuscular vaccines may have a few small side effects, vaccinations are performed preferably out of season and avoid vaccinating just before competitions or if symptoms of illness are present; Update administrative and support staff vaccines needed at home and for foreign travel; Consider zinc lozenges (> 75 mg zinc/day; high ionic zinc content) at the onset of upper respiratory symptoms, as there is some evidence that the number of days with illness symptoms can be reduced. The athlete support team can consider adopting nutritional measures to maintain robust immunity in athletes, including the following: Introduce personalised nutrition programmes to avoid deficiencies of essential micronutrients; Encourage athletes to ingest carbohydrate during and after exercise and to ingest both carbohydrate and protein after exercise; Measure and monitor the vitamin D status of athletes and supplement if required; Consider advising athletes to ingest probiotic such as Lactobacillus probiotics on a daily basis; Consider advising athletes on the regular consumption of fruits and plants, polyphenol supplements (eg, quercetin), or foodstuffs (eg, non-alcoholic beer and green tea) that may reduce risk of illness.
Training and competition load management There is evidence that poor load management with ensuing maladaptation can be a significant risk factor for acute illness and overtraining. However, data are limited to a few select sports and athlete populations, and this, combined with the unique nature of different sports, make it difficult to provide sport-specific guidelines for load management. However, the following general recommendations can be made: Very high loads can have either positive or negative influences on risk of illness in athletes, with the athlete's level of competition (elite), load history (chronic load) and intrinsic risk factor profile being important; Athletes should have a detailed individualised training and competition plan, including postevent recovery measures (encompassing nutrition and hydration, sleep, and psychological recovery); The training load is monitored using measurements of external and internal load; Training load is managed by adopting the following principles: Changes in training load should be individualised as there are large intraindividual and interindividual variances in the timeframe of response and adaptation to load; Changes in training load should be in small increments, with data (from the injury literature) indicating that weekly increments should be < 10%; The competition load is monitored and managed; Variation in an athlete's psychological stressors should guide the prescription of training and/or competition loads; It is recommended that coaches and support staff schedule adequate recovery, particularly after intensive training periods, competitions and travel, including nutrition and hydration, sleep and rest, active rest, relaxation strategies and emotional support; Sports governing bodies have the responsibility to consider the competition load, and hence the health of the athletes when planning their event calendars. This requires increased coordination between single-sport and multisport event organisers, and the development of a comprehensive calendar of all international sports events.
Psychological load management Psychological load (stressors) such as negative life event stress and daily hassles can significantly increase the risk of illness in athletes. Clinical practical recommendations centre on reducing state-level stressors and educating athletes, coaches and support staff in proactive stress management, and comprise the following: Developing resilience strategies that help athletes understand the relationship between personal traits, negative life events, thoughts, emotions and physiological states, which, in turn, may help them minimise the impact of negative life events and the subsequent risk of illness; Educating athletes in stress management techniques, confidence building and goal setting, optimally under supervision of a sport psychologist, to help minimise the effects of stress and reduce the likelihood of illness; Reducing training and/or competition loads and intensities to mitigate risk of illness for athletes who appear unfocused as a consequence of negative life events or ongoing daily hassles; Implementing periodical stress assessments (eg, hassle and uplift scale, LESCA) to inform adjustment of athletes' training and/or competition loads. An athlete who reports high levels of daily hassle or stress could likely benefit from reducing the training load during a specified time period to prevent potential fatigue, illness or burnout.
Measuring and monitoring for early signs and symptoms of illness, over-reaching and overtraining The use of sensitive measures to monitor an athlete's health can lead to early detection of symptoms and signs of illness, early diagnosis and appropriate intervention. Athletes' innate tendency to continue to train and compete despite the existence of physical complaints or functional limitations, particularly at the elite level, highlight the pressing need to use appropriate illness monitoring tools. It is recommended that: Ongoing illness (and injury) surveillance systems should be implemented in all sports; Athletes be monitored, using sensitive tools, for subclinical signs of illness such as non-specific symptoms and signs, or selected special investigations; Athletes be monitored for overt symptoms and signs of illness; Athletes be monitored for early symptoms and signs of over-reaching or overtraining; Illness monitoring should be ongoing, and long enough to detect early indicators of illness particularly during alterations in training load, travel and competitions.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of aspergillosis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116z4f8K]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Aspergillus ear infections — treatment differs by disease type: noninvasive Aspergillus otitis externa, also called otomycosis, is treated by thorough mechanical cleansing of the external auditory canal followed by topical antifungals or boric acid (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence), whereas we recommend that clinicians treat IA of the ear with a prolonged course of systemic voriconazole, usually combined with surgery (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Tissue-invasive Aspergillus otitis should be treated with prolonged systemic voriconazole, often necessitating surgical debridement, and in the absence of evidence of tissue invasion, we do not recommend that colonization should be treated.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^112uYa7S]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Aural irrigation for cerumen impaction — practice and adjuncts are described: Aural irrigation is a widely practiced form of cerumen removal and can be performed with a syringe or electronic irrigator, and manual irrigation with a large syringe is the most commonly employed method in general practice with the water close to body temperature to avoid caloric effects; while there are no randomized controlled clinical trials of aural irrigation versus no treatment, there is general consensus that aural irrigation is effective in removing cerumen; systematic reviews indicate pretreatment (15 minutes before irrigation) with an otic drop improves efficacy and that saline and tap water may be as good as specially formulated products; self‑irrigation may be a cost‑effective alternative with comparable outcomes and satisfaction to provider care and, at 2‑year follow‑up, fewer return visits, although the ability of patients to perform weekly irrigation at home has not been demonstrated and jet irrigators should be avoided for home use due to risk of damage to ear structures; one small study reported that following clearance of impaction, weekly aural irrigation with 70% isopropyl alcohol over a 2‑month period resulted in fewer recurrent impactions.

### Topical antibiotics for chronic suppurative otitis media [^112zH3x1]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), sometimes referred to as chronic otitis media, is a chronic inflammation and often polymicrobial infection (involving more than one micro-organism) of the middle ear and mastoid cavity, characterised by ear discharge (otorrhoea) through a perforated tympanic membrane. The predominant symptoms are ear discharge and hearing loss. Topical antibiotics, the most common treatment for CSOM, aim to kill or inhibit the growth of micro-organisms that may be responsible for the infection. Antibiotics can be used alone or with other treatments for CSOM, such as antiseptics or ear cleaning (aural toileting). This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2020 and one of a suite of seven reviews evaluating the effects of non-surgical interventions for CSOM.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of topical antibiotics (without steroids) for people with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane ENT Register, CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and five other databases. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The latest search date was 15 June 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials with at least a one week of follow-up involving adults and children with chronic ear discharge of unknown cause or CSOM, where the ear discharge had continued for more than two weeks. The interventions were any single, or combination of, topical antibiotic(s) of any class, applied directly into the ear canal as ear drops, powders, or irrigations, or as part of an aural toileting procedure. The two main comparisons were topical antibiotic compared to placebo or no intervention, and compared to another topical antibiotic (e.g. topical antibiotic A versus topical antibiotic B).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology. Our primary outcomes were: resolution of ear discharge or 'dry ear' (whether otoscopically confirmed or not), measured at between one week and up to two weeks, two weeks and up to four weeks, and after four weeks; health-related quality of life using a validated instrument; and ear pain (otalgia) or discomfort or local irritation. Secondary outcomes were hearing, serious complications, and ototoxicity. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

This update found one new study (100 participants). Overall, we included 18 studies with 1783 participants (in 16 studies), plus 108 ears that could not be accounted for in participant numbers (in two studies). 1. Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with aural toilet in both arms and no other background treatment) One study (50 participants, data unavailable for 15 participants) compared a topical antibiotic (ciprofloxacin) with placebo (saline). All participants received aural toilet. Topical ciprofloxacin may increase resolution of discharge at one to up to two weeks compared with placebo (84% with antibiotic versus 12% with placebo; risk ratio (RR) 6.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.82 to 24.99; 35 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study authors reported "no medical side-effects and worsening of audiological measurements related to this topical medication were detected". 2. Topical antibiotics versus placebo or no treatment (with use of oral antibiotics in both arms) Four studies (438 participants) compared topical antibiotics versus no treatment, with oral antibiotics in both arms. These compared topical ciprofloxacin to no treatment (3 studies, 190 participants) or topical ceftizoxime to no treatment (1 study, 248 participants). In each study, all participants received the same antibiotic systemically (oral ciprofloxacin or injected ceftizoxime). In at least one study, all participants received aural toilet. There were no useable data comparing topical ceftizoxime to no treatment. Topical antibiotics in addition to systemic antibiotics may increase resolution of ear discharge at one to up to two weeks compared with systemic antibiotics alone (resolution of discharge occurring in 88% with topical antibiotics versus 60% without topical antibiotics; RR 1.47, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.88; 1 study, 100 participants; low-certainty evidence). One study (40 participants) stated "no side effect was recorded in any patient" (low-certainty evidence). 3. Comparisons of different topical antibiotics Eight studies (794 participants, plus 40 ears) compared aminoglycosides (gentamicin, neomycin, or tobramycin) with quinolones (ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin). Resolution of discharge at one to up to two weeks may be higher in the quinolones group, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 1.92, 95% CI 1.00 to 3.67; 7 studies, 794 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was considerable heterogeneity (I² = 97%). One study (308 participants) stated there were no differences between the different groups for resolution of ear discharge after four weeks (low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical antibiotics on ear pain (1 study reported no differences between groups). The evidence is very uncertain about the effects of topical antibiotics on hearing loss (2 studies reported no differences between groups). 4. Other comparisons We assessed five studies (501 participants, plus 68 ears) over the following three additional comparisons: quinolones versus aminoglycosides/polymyxin B with/without gramicidin, aminoglycosides versus trimethoprim-sulphacetamide-polymixin B, and rifampicin versus chloramphenicol. However, these results have not been included in the abstract.

Authors' Conclusions

We are very uncertain about the effectiveness of topical antibiotics in improving resolution of ear discharge in people with CSOM because of the limited amount of low- or very low-certainty evidence available. This was mostly due to risk of bias and imprecision. However, amongst this uncertainty, there is some evidence to suggest that the use of topical antibiotics may be effective when compared to placebo, or when used in addition to a systemic antibiotic. There is also uncertainty about the relative effectiveness of different types of antibiotics; it is not possible to determine whether quinolones are better or worse than aminoglycosides. These two groups of compounds have different adverse effect profiles, but there is insufficient evidence from the included studies to make any comment about these. In general, harmful effects were poorly reported. Limitations of the review include lack of recency in data, and limited information on certain population groups or interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline: acute otitis externa [^112ckTkN]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2014). Medium credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) research priorities emphasize determining if water precautions are necessary or beneficial during active treatment and when to discontinue them, improving recognition of treatment failure versus topical sensitivity, and conducting high-quality randomized trials comparing clinical efficacy with explicit double-blind protocols and assessing systemic antimicrobial therapy versus topical therapy. Trials are also prioritized to report early clinical outcomes (eg, after 2–4 days of therapy) and compare time to symptom resolution alongside categorical responses, and to compare "home therapies" (vinegar, alcohol) versus antimicrobials with attention to the role for patient preferences. Further needs include defining indications for aural toilet and wick placement, determining the independent efficacy of aural toilet, comparing wick versus no wick and suction or active debridement versus dry mopping, and defining best methods to teach clinicians to safely and effectively perform aural toilet and wick insertion. Additional priorities are to determine optimal assessment of tympanic membrane integrity in AOE (including the utility of tympanometry), develop medicated wicks that gradually release drug into the ear canal, and continue monitoring bacteriology and antibiotic resistance patterns in AOE.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^116MzcS9]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 3B: Nonintervention if asymptomatic — clinicians "should not routinely treat cerumen in patients who are asymptomatic and whose ears can be adequately examined", a "Recommendation against" based on "control groups in randomized trials and observational studies" with a "preponderance of benefit over harms". The action profile specifies "Quality improvement opportunity: Avoidance of harm, efficient use of health care resources", "Aggregate evidence quality: Grade C", and "Level of confidence in the evidence: Medium", with benefits to "Avoid unnecessary treatment with potential adverse events and costs", risks of "Potential progression to impaction", and "Benefit-harm assessment: Preponderance of benefit over harms". Value judgments are that "The presence of cerumen is not in itself harmful, and it may not progress to impaction; in fact, it may resolve spontaneously. If it progresses, it can be managed at that time", with "The word routinely was added to this statement to acknowledge that there may be circumstances where cerumen removal may be offered anyway, as in a patient with hearing aids", and "Role of patient preferences: Substantial role for shared decision making. The patient may still opt for removal of the cerumen". Exceptions include "history of recurrent cerumen impaction", with "Policy level: Recommendation against" and "Differences of opinion: None".

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^114K1Ln3]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Proper care of hearing aids to keep the ear canal unobstructed — key tips include that hearing aid users should have regular ear canal checks every 3 or 6 months; clean the wax trap in receiver-in-canal, completely-in-the-canal, in-the-canal, and in-the-ear hearing aids; replace the wax trap once per 3 months or whenever hearing aid is not working; once the earmold is detached, soak it in mild soapy solution and do not use isopropyl alcohol, solvents, or oils to clean earmolds; clean the earmold and rinse with water, then dry the earmold and remove any excess moisture or debris with a soft cloth or cotton ball; if earmolds cannot be detached, wipe with a damp cloth to remove any visible earwax or use a soft toothbrush or the brush provided with the hearing aids; and check the earmold tube to be sure that it is clear before reattaching to hearing aid, replacing it via a hearing care professional if the tube is clogged.

### Clinical practice guidelines: childhood hearing screening [^111bAcwF]. AAA (2011). Medium credibility.

OAE screening considerations — environment and time emphasize that OAEs are low amplitude signals that travel from the inner ear back to the ear canal; an important variable in the validity of OAE screening results is the level of noise in the recording, and valid and reliable results depend on the screening environment being as free from noise and vibration as possible; proper selection and placement of the probe tip resulting in a good acoustic seal can mitigate the effects of background noise significantly; disposable tips are preferred for optimal hygiene and infection control, and if reusable tips are used, systematic procedures are needed to ensure disinfection of tips between uses.

### Clinical practice guideline: tympanostomy tubes in children (update) [^115ztNrV]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2022). High credibility.

Ear tubes — indications and water guidance emphasize benefits and simple precautions. Ear tubes are recommended for "frequent ear infections or prolonged fluid in the ears" to "Help decrease the number of ear infections", allow treatment with "antibiotic ear drops instead of antibiotics that are taken by mouth", "Help prevent fluid from backing up" into the middle ear, and "Improve hearing" reduced by fluid. For water activities, "Your child will not usually need ear plugs", and "Head bands or other special efforts… are also unnecessary, but may be helpful" when there is "Pain or discomfort when water enters the ear canal", "Current fluid or drainage", "Swimming in lakes or non-chlorinated pools that are not clean", or "Dunking head in the bathtub". The guide cautions, "NEVER use Play-Doh or Silly Putty as an ear plug — these materials can become trapped in the ear canal and even require surgical removal".

### Conformal in-ear bioelectronics for visual and auditory brain-computer interfaces [^116tdehe]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Prior to the experiment, a comprehensive explanation of the experimental protocol was provided to all participants, and they signed the informed consent statement. As part of our study protocol, we afforded participants with the autonomy to withdraw from the experiment at any point in accordance with their own preferences, without incurring any untoward consequences.

After that, the auditory meatus of each subject was cleaned with medical alcohol to remove grease and earwax. Then SpiralE was inserted into ear in the small spiral configuration. A DC voltage of ~10 V was applied to electrothermally actuate the expansion and deformation processes. In this process, participants were equipped with the ability to modulate the temperature elevation through manipulation of the voltage knob, thereby enabling them to terminate the experiment at their discretion. During this process, an ear endoscope (Bebrid Note3) was used to inspect the deformation and assisted SpiralE to fit snugly into the ear canal. In case the impedance value still cannot be lowered into the acceptable range (≤ 50 kilohms), the SpiralE was taken out and reshaped into a small spiral. A small amount of gel was applied to SpiralE, and it is then reinserted into the ear canal and actuated again. Out of the 18 SpiralEs (9 subjects × 2 SpiralEs) involved in the visual experiments, a total of 10 had gel applied. These particular SpiralEs can be identified by their blue highlighting in Supplementary Table 2. When the power was removed, SpiralE was self-supported in ear canal after cooling to room temperature. Similarly, a voltage was applied to SpiralE after the end of the experiment. After the modulus decreased, SpiralE was carefully removed and cleaned using cotton swabs and water for reuse by next subject. The subjects were also instructed to clean their external auditory meatus using cotton swabs and alcohol to ensure proper hygiene. Notably, all participants did not report any discomfort throughout the ~2 h experiment, irrespective of the presence or absence of gel.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^1125iyWi]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Ear hygiene education for cerumen impaction and those at risk — evidence profile and policy: Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C based on preponderance of survey studies and 1 prospective pilot study, with level of confidence in evidence Medium, and the benefit–harm assessment is preponderance of benefit. Benefits include promoting safe and effective self-care behaviors in ear hygiene, preventing self-inflicted harms such as abrasions, cuts, and impaction, and reducing health care utilization, while risks/harms/costs include induced patient anxiety about an asymptomatic condition, time spent in counseling, and potential for increased use of health care resources if self-cleaning with cotton-tipped applicators is abandoned. Policy level is Recommendation, the role of patient preferences is small with the option to decline education, and exceptions are none.

### Historical perspective on the use of otic antimicrobial agents [^1162qLRv]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Treatment of otorrhea has been described in the literature since 1500 BC. A multitude of therapeutic options have been described, including the use of astringents, antiseptics, alcohol, benzoin and various powders. Since the middle of the 20th century, antibiotic usage has been promoted as the most effective means of therapy. Until recently none of the agents that were used was found to be safe for middle ear use. Since 1990 there have been publications describing the safety and efficacy of fluoroquinolone drops for acute and chronic otorrhea. This article details the transition from treatment of otorrhea with nonspecific means to an era of antimicrobial therapy based on sound scientific evidence.

### Clinical practice guideline (update): earwax (cerumen impaction) [^115xHwJE]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Medium credibility.

Statement 11 — secondary prevention of cerumen impaction provides that clinicians may educate/counsel patients with cerumen impaction or excessive cerumen regarding control measures, classified as an Option based on survey and comparative studies with unclear balance of benefit vs harm. Aggregate evidence quality is Grade C with observational studies, experimental pilot studies, and expert opinion; benefits are prevention of cerumen impaction or recurrent cerumen impaction; risks include time for counseling and potential risk of preventive measures if used; the benefit–harm assessment is balance benefit over harm; and policy level is Option with no differences of opinion. The statement's purpose is to inform clinicians of control measures to prevent recurrence after office removal and to prevent accumulation; measures that may be beneficial include instilling prophylactic topical preparations, irrigating the ear canal, cleaning hearing aids, or routine cleaning of the ear canal by a clinician, and patients can purchase wax-softening drops or home irrigation kits as part of an ear hygiene regimen to help prevent recurrence of cerumen occlusions. Cerumen accumulation and impaction may be exacerbated by the use of hearing aids, so instructions on proper care and routine cleaning of aids are important, and choices regarding topical preparations and devices for irrigating the ears should be shared with the patient.

Step 4: Choose the injection site and clean the skin

Wash and dry your hands.
Choose an injection site on your body. The recommended injection site is the front of the thigh or lower abdomen (belly), but not the area 2 inches (5 cm) around your belly button (naval) (see Figure E).
Choose a different site each time you give yourself an injection.
Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, scaly or hard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. If you have psoriasis, you should not inject directly into areas with psoriasis plaques.
Wipe your skin at the injection site with an alcohol swab in a circular motion. Let the skin dry before injecting.
Do not touch this area again before giving the injection.

Step 5: Pull off the clear needle cap

Carefully pull off the clear needle cap with a metal center straight off to remove it from the autoinjector (see Figure F).
Throw away the needle cap.

Step 6: Place the green base of the autoinjector on your skin, press down, and hold

Place the green base straight on your skin and push the entire device down firmly to start the injection.
When you push down, the injection will start (see Figure G).
You may hear the first click which means the injection has started.

### Is the healthy middle ear a normally sterile site? [^114wEXxH]. Otology & Neurotology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To systematically evaluate the presumption that the healthy middle ear becomes colonized with organisms via the patent eustachian tube using modern microbiologic techniques.

Study Design

Sterile saline washings were obtained from the middle ear of patients in a prospective fashion.

Setting

Tertiary/quaternary referral centers.

Patients

Pediatric and adult patients undergoing cochlear implantation surgery.

Intervention(S)

Standard bacterial and viral cultures, and nucleic acid amplification techniques.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Identification of organisms.

Results

Specimens were obtained from 13 children and 9 adults. No organisms were identified in any of the specimens, either through standard culture or PCR testing.

Conclusion

The presumption that the healthy middle ear is colonized by bacteria from the nasopharynx is unsubstantiated.

### Interventions for acute otitis externa [^111qDrVB]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Acute otitis externa is an inflammatory condition of the ear canal, with or without infection. Symptoms include ear discomfort, itchiness, discharge and impaired hearing. It is also known as 'swimmer's ear' and can usually be treated successfully with a course of ear drops.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for acute otitis externa.

Search Strategy

Our search for published and unpublished trials included the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; CENTRAL; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; Cambridge Scientific Abstracts; mRCT and additional sources. The date of the most recent search was 6 January 2009.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials evaluating ear cleaning, topical medication or systemic therapy in the treatment of acute otitis externa were eligible. We excluded complicated acute otitis externa; otitis externa secondary to otitis media or chronic suppurative otitis media; chronic otitis externa; fungal otitis externa (otomycosis); eczematous otitis externa; viral otitis externa and furunculosis.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors assessed eligibility and quality.

Main Results

Nineteen randomised controlled trials with a total of 3382 participants were included. Three meta-analyses were possible. The overall quality of studies was low. Topical antimicrobials containing steroids were significantly more effective than placebo drops: OR 11 (95% CI 2.00 to 60.57; one trial). In general, no clinically meaningful differences were noted in clinical cure rates between the various topical interventions reviewed. One notable exception involved a trial of high quality which showed that acetic acid was significantly less effective when compared with antibiotic/steroid drops in terms of cure rate at two and three weeks (OR 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.62) and OR 0.25 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.58) respectively). One trial of low quality comparing quinolone with non-quinolone antibiotics did not find any difference in clinical cure rate. No trials evaluated the effectiveness of ear cleaning. Only two trials evaluated steroid-only drops. One trial of low quality suggested no significant difference between steroid and antibiotic/steroid but did not report the magnitude or precision of the result. Another trial of moderate quality comparing an oral antihistamine with topical steroid against topical steroid alone found that cure rates in both groups were high and comparable (100% (15/15) and 94% (14/15) respectively at three weeks).

Authors' Conclusions

There is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. The results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. The findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). Despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available:Topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. In most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. Any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. Acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. However, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. In addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. The evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. Further investigation is needed. Given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. Factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. Patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. Although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. It may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. If they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. Patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

### Estimated burden of acute otitis externa – United States, 2003–2007 [^112LuyLE]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2011). Low credibility.

Acute otitis externa (AOE) (swimmer's ear) is inflammation of the external auditory canal most often caused by bacterial infection. AOE is characterized by pain, tenderness, redness, and swelling of the external ear canal, and occasionally, purulent exudate. AOE is associated with water exposure (e.g., recreational water activities, bathing, and excessive sweating) and warm, humid environments. Because the overall burden and epidemiology of AOE in the United States have not been well described, data from national ambulatory-care and emergency department (ED) databases were analyzed to characterize the incidence, demographics, and seasonality of AOE and associated health-care costs. The analysis showed that in 2007, an estimated 2.4 million U.S. health-care visits (8.1 visits per 1,000 population) resulted in a diagnosis of AOE. Estimated annual rates of ambulatory-care visits for AOE during 2003–2007 were highest among children aged 5–9 years (18.6) and 10–14 years (15.8); however, 53% of visits occurred among adults aged ≥ 20 years (5.3). Incidence peaked during summer months, and the regional rate was highest in the South (9.1). Direct health-care costs for nonhospitalized AOE visits total as much as $0.5 billion annually, and ambulatory-care clinicians spend nearly 600,000 hours annually treating AOE. Suggested AOE prevention measures include reducing exposure of the ears to water (e.g., using ear plugs or swim caps and using alcohol-based ear-drying solutions) (3–5). To reduce the national incidence of AOE, additional preventive measures should be investigated, and effective prevention messages should be developed and disseminated.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for vascular access: 2019 update [^114UfnWB]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2020). High credibility.

KDOQI 2019 vascular access — central venous catheter (CVC) and exit site cleansing recommendations state that the guideline suggests the preferred use of chlorhexidine for CVC and exit site cleansing, unless contraindicated, and differs from 2006 by suggesting only the necessary minimal manipulation of CVC until the exit site and tunnel are healed; the Work Group strongly suggests using a CVC care protocol that involves chlorhexidine and, if circumstances permit, using chlorhexidine gluconate 2% in 70% alcohol solution. If chlorhexidine is contraindicated (eg, skin sensitivity or allergy), povidone- iodine 10% in 70% ethanol should be used, the antiseptic solution should not include detergents such as hexachlorophene, triclosan, or benzalkonium chloride, multidose cleansing solution bottles are discouraged due to the risk of cross-contamination, and all cleansing solutions should be single use, for example, a disposable swab stick or pad.

### Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 in the cerumen of COVID-19-positive patients [^115GKr1S]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

A prospective study was conducted in a tertiary care pandemic hospital. Permission was obtained from the local ethics committee. Because this was the first study in the literature of this nature, and in order to conserve testing resources during the pandemic, a sample size of 60 patients was planned.

Participants were recruited from a population of newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients in whom the SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test was positive within a 24-hour period. Consecutive 825 patients were evaluated by bilateral ear examination until 60 patients were found for inclusion. Criteria for inclusion were the presence of cerumen bilaterally and no prior treatment for cerumen, as this was thought to potentially affect results. Patients with tympanic membrane perforation, who had a history of cerumen cleaning, and those with known chronic otitis history were excluded from the study.

Sample Collection

Swabs were taken from the bilateral external auditory canal of the patients by an experienced otolaryngologist with the test swab. Sterile nylon, Dacron, or rayon swabs with flexible plastic shafts were used to collect the samples from patients. Sampling was made by rotating the sample swab 360° 10 times in each external auditory canal for a total of 20 times. No bleeding and discomfort occurred in any patient during sampling. After the sampling, an ear examination was performed, and it was confirmed that the sample swab touched the cerumen and there was no bleeding as it may affect the results. After collection, swabs were placed into 2 mL of the sterile viral transport medium (VTM; various manufacturers) which provides cerumen evaluation. Samples were transported and tested as soon as possible after collection.

### Guide to utilization of the microbiology laboratory for diagnosis of infectious diseases: 2024 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) and the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) [^113SvNNA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Otitis media — diagnostic work-up and laboratory specimens indicate that 'Microbiologic diagnostic work-up of otitis media are best reserved for patients likely to have a bacterial etiology (recent onset, bulging tympanic membrane, pain, or exudate), who have not responded to prior courses of antimicrobial therapy, patients with immunological deficiencies, and acutely ill patients'. The 'only representative specimen is middle ear fluid obtained either by tympanocentesis, or in patients with otorrhea or myringotomy tubes, by collecting drainage on mini-tipped swabs directly after cleaning the ear canal', and 'Cultures of the pharynx, nasopharynx, anterior nares, or of nasal drainage material are of no value in attempting to establish an etiologic diagnosis of bacterial OM'. Table 22 lists etiologic agents such as 'Moraxella catarrhalis Haemophilus influenzae (non-typeable) Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Pseudomonas aeruginosa Alloiococcus otitidis Staphylococcus aureus Escherichia coli Klebsiella pneumoniae' and specifies diagnostic procedures 'Gram stain, Aerobic bacterial culture' on 'Tympanocentesis fluid' with transport 'Sterile container, RT, ≤ 2 h'. For drainage in patients with tubes or otorrhea, the specimen is a 'Mini-tipped swab of fluid draining from the middle ear cavity in patients with myringotomy tubes or otorrhea' with transport 'Swab transport device, RT, ≤ 2 h'. Additional notes state 'Viruses are often etiologic agents but microbiologic studies do not assist treatment decisions' and 'Abbreviation: RT, room temperature.'
