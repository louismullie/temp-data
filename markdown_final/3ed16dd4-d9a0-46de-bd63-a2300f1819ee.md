## Question

For Candida yeast can diflucan 200 mg be given one time

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking if a single, one-time 200 mg dose of fluconazole (Diflucan) can be given for Candida yeast. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the FDA-labeled single-dose indications for fluconazole actually are. Then, I should review guideline-supported dosing for mucosal candidiasis, including oropharyngeal and esophageal disease. Next, I will consider invasive candidiasis regimens, urinary tract infection due to Candida, and osteoarticular disease. After that, I need to check the pharmacokinetic rationale for loading and maintenance dosing to see if a one-time 200 mg dose could ever maintain therapeutic exposure. Finally, I should confirm safety and resistance considerations and synthesize a clear recommendation aligned with labeling and IDSA guidelines [^1148SBmz] [^114Pxc4S] [^112vpt1L].

> Let me first confirm the only FDA-approved single-dose indication. For uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, fluconazole is given as a single 150 mg oral dose; there is no labeled 200 mg single-dose regimen for any Candida indication, and using 200 mg once would be off-label and suboptimal for VVC compared with the approved 150 mg dose, which has robust efficacy data including recent network meta-analysis support [^1148SBmz] [^117FYksC] [^1119UpiJ] [^114ovmXp] [^113VLJpq].

> Wait, let me verify oropharyngeal candidiasis next. I initially wondered if 200 mg once might be enough here, but hold on, I should verify the standard regimen. The labeled and guideline-supported approach is 200 mg on day 1 as a loading dose, followed by 100 to 200 mg daily for 7 to 14 days; that is not a single-dose treatment, and using only 200 mg once would be inadequate exposure and duration for OPC [^114Pxc4S] [^1148SBmz] [^116vN6E8] [^113pWg1a] [^1114JCXu]. Let me also acknowledge a nuance: a randomized trial showed that a single 750 mg dose could be comparable to 14-day therapy in HIV-associated OPC, but this 750 mg strategy has not been adopted as guideline standard and certainly does not validate a single 200 mg dose for OPC [^112fXjB6].

> Next, I should review esophageal candidiasis. I need to ensure I'm not missing any single-dose pathway here. The FDA label and IDSA recommend 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily, with treatment extending 14 to 21 days and sometimes up to 400 mg daily based on response; again, this is multi-day therapy and a one-time 200 mg dose would be clearly insufficient for esophagitis [^114Pxc4S] [^117HWhy4] [^1153sgJT] [^112yLRyp] [^114iCKaj].

> I will now examine invasive candidiasis and candidemia, because if anywhere a front-loaded approach might tempt simplification, it would be here. The recommended fluconazole approach is an 800 mg loading dose followed by 400 mg daily, with duration tailored but usually at least 14 days after bloodstream clearance; step-down fluconazole is used for susceptible isolates and clinically stable patients, and ocular involvement often requires weeks of therapy at 400–800 mg daily after an 800 mg load; osteoarticular disease typically requires months of 400 mg daily; none of these invasive or deep-seated infections are amenable to a single 200 mg dose [^113nmqLE] [^116Zw9Fd] [^1117mgY2] [^112upmcJ] [^112vpt1L]. Let me double-check the urinary tract infection nuance: for symptomatic Candida cystitis due to susceptible organisms, fluconazole 200 mg daily for 14 days is recommended, not a one-time 200 mg dose [^115unPRC].

> Now, I need to check the pharmacokinetic logic to ensure my stance aligns with drug disposition. Fluconazole has a long half-life of roughly 30 hours, and labeling recommends a loading dose equal to 2× the daily dose to achieve near steady-state by day 2; however, sustained therapeutic exposure requires continued daily dosing, which is why regimens almost always include multi-day maintenance after a load for non-VVC Candida infections; a solitary 200 mg dose will not provide adequate duration above MIC for typical pathogens and sites of infection, which supports guideline insistence on multi-day regimens [^1148SBmz] [^114Pxc4S] [^117PyDx6] [^116R3eRU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions without safety considerations. FDA labeling explicitly cautions that inadequate treatment duration risks recurrence and, in immunocompromised hosts, relapse is common without maintenance therapy; undertreating with a single 200 mg dose where multi-day therapy is standard may promote persistence or recurrence and foster resistance pressure, reinforcing why guidelines specify durations tailored to clinical response and microbiology rather than a one-and-done approach [^1148SBmz] [^114Pxc4S] [^112AQJjo] [^115BV1PN].

> But wait, what if there are edge cases or renal adjustments that somehow justify a one-time 200 mg dose? I should confirm this. Even in prophylaxis settings for high-risk hosts such as stem cell transplant, dosing is 400 mg daily, not a single 200 mg dose; and although renal impairment warrants dose adjustments for multi-dose regimens, the only single-dose label exception is the 150 mg VVC dose, which does not require renal adjustment, again underscoring that a single 200 mg dose has no standard role across Candida syndromes [^116Ryg1w] [^114V8eed] [^116F5ZZ6].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my final recommendation is precise. No, fluconazole 200 mg should not be used as a single, one-time dose for Candida infections. The only approved single-dose Candida regimen is 150 mg once for uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis. For oropharyngeal candidiasis, 200 mg is a day-1 loading dose followed by daily therapy for 7–14 days; for esophageal candidiasis and invasive disease, multi-day therapy with appropriate loading and duration is required. Using a single 200 mg dose risks undertreatment, relapse, and resistance and is not guideline-concordant [^1148SBmz] [^114Pxc4S] [^116vN6E8] [^112yLRyp] [^113nmqLE] [^115unPRC] [^112vpt1L].

---

No, a single 200 mg dose of fluconazole (Diflucan) is **not recommended** for any Candida infection [^112vpt1L]. For oropharyngeal or esophageal candidiasis, 200 mg is used as **a loading dose on day 1** [^114Pxc4S], followed by **daily maintenance therapy** for 7–21 days [^116vN6E8] [^112yLRyp]. For vulvovaginal candidiasis, the standard single dose is **150 mg** [^1119UpiJ], not **200 mg** [^114ovmXp] [^1148SBmz]. Using 200 mg as a single dose risks suboptimal efficacy and relapse; always follow indication-specific dosing and duration [^114Pxc4S].

## Recommended dosing regimens for fluconazole (Diflucan)

Fluconazole dosing varies by infection type, severity, and patient factors; thus, **indication-specific dosing** is essential [^112vpt1L].

| **Indication** | **Recommended dosing regimen** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Vulvovaginal candidiasis (uncomplicated) | 150 mg orally, single dose [^1119UpiJ] | Single dose |
| Oropharyngeal candidiasis | 200 mg loading dose on day 1, then 100 mg daily [^116vN6E8] | 7–14 days |
| Esophageal candidiasis | 200 mg loading dose on day 1, then 100–400 mg daily [^112yLRyp] | 14–21 days |
| Candidemia (non-neutropenic) | 800 mg loading dose, then 400 mg daily [^113nmqLE] | ≥ 14 days after first negative culture |
| Candida urinary tract infection (symptomatic) | 200 mg daily [^115unPRC] | 2 weeks |
| Cryptococcal meningitis (initial therapy) | 400 mg loading dose, then 200–400 mg daily [^115qxFDG] | 10–12 weeks after CSF culture negative |
| Prophylaxis in bone marrow transplantation | 400 mg daily [^114V8eed] | During neutropenia |

## Clinical evidence and guidelines regarding single-dose 200 mg fluconazole

There is **no guideline support** for a single 200 mg dose for any Candida infection [^112vpt1L]; it is used only as a loading dose before maintenance therapy [^114Pxc4S] [^1148SBmz].

- **Oropharyngeal candidiasis**: 200 mg loading dose on day 1 [^114Pxc4S], then 100 mg daily for 7–14 days [^116vN6E8].
- **Esophageal candidiasis**: 200 mg loading dose on day 1 [^114Pxc4S], then 100–400 mg daily for 14–21 days [^112yLRyp].
- **Vulvovaginal candidiasis**: 150 mg single dose [^1119UpiJ]; 200 mg single dose is not recommended [^114ovmXp] [^113VLJpq].

---

## Efficacy and safety considerations

Using 200 mg as a single dose may lead to **suboptimal efficacy** and a higher risk of relapse because it falls below standard regimens for most Candida infections [^113nmqLE]. For **efficacy**, a single 200 mg dose is not supported for oropharyngeal, esophageal, or invasive candidiasis and is insufficient for reliable cure [^116vN6E8] [^112yLRyp]. For **safety**, fluconazole is generally well tolerated, but inappropriate dosing can cause treatment failure [^114Pxc4S] and resistance [^116Zw9Fd].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing dosing decisions

Dosing should be **individualized** based on factors such as immune status, renal function, and infection severity [^112vpt1L]. Immunocompromised patients often need longer or higher-dose therapy [^113nmqLE]. Adjust maintenance dosing for renal impairment [^117PyDx6]; the 150 mg single dose for VVC requires no adjustment [^116F5ZZ6]. Severe or invasive disease requires higher doses and longer duration [^113nmqLE].

---

## Alternative antifungal treatments

When fluconazole is ineffective or contraindicated, consider **alternatives**:

- **Itraconazole**: 200 mg daily for oropharyngeal candidiasis [^115JtxJJ] [^1114JCXu].
- **Voriconazole**: 200 mg twice daily for fluconazole-refractory oropharyngeal candidiasis [^115aC5EU] [^112M5Qxd].
- **Echinocandins**: Anidulafungin, caspofungin, micafungin for invasive candidiasis [^1171N4gP] [^113nmqLE].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Single-dose 200 mg**: Not recommended for any Candida infection [^112vpt1L].
- **Loading dose**: 200 mg is a loading dose for oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis, followed by maintenance therapy [^114Pxc4S].
- **Vulvovaginal candidiasis**: 150 mg single dose is standard; 200 mg single dose is not recommended [^114ovmXp].
- **Individualization**: Base dosing on infection type, severity, immune status, and renal function [^113nmqLE].

---

A single 200 mg dose of fluconazole is **not appropriate** for any Candida infection; use it only as a loading dose with subsequent maintenance therapy [^114Pxc4S] [^112vpt1L]. Always follow guideline-based regimens to ensure efficacy and prevent relapse [^113pWg1a].

### A multicenter randomized trial evaluating posaconazole versus fluconazole for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in subjects with HIV/AIDS [^115uGTdt]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis is the most common opportunistic infection among persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The use of some agents is hampered by lack of efficacy, emergence of resistance, adverse events, and the need for intravenous administration. Posaconazole is an extended-spectrum triazole with potent in vitro activity against Candida species, including Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Candida krusei, even those resistant to fluconazole.

- **Methods**: This multicenter, randomized, evaluator-blinded study of subjects with HIV infection and oropharyngeal candidiasis compared the efficacy of posaconazole with that of fluconazole. Subjects received either 200 mg of posaconazole or fluconazole oral suspension on day 1, followed by 100 mg/day for 13 days. The primary study endpoint — clinical success (cure or improvement) on day 14 — was evaluated for 329 subjects. The durability of clinical success was evaluated on day 42.

- **Results**: Three hundred fifty subjects received posaconazole (n = 178) or fluconazole (n = 172). Clinical success occurred in 155 (91.7%) of 169 posaconazole recipients and in 148 (92.5%) of 160 fluconazole recipients (95% confidence interval, -6.61% to 5.04%), indicating that posaconazole was not inferior to fluconazole. On day 14, mycological success was 68% in both arms. However, by day 42, significantly more posaconazole recipients than fluconazole recipients continued to have mycological success (40.6% vs. 26.4%; p = 0.038). Fewer posaconazole recipients than fluconazole recipients experienced clinical relapse (31.5% vs. 38.2%).

### Fluconazole dosing for the prevention or treatment of invasive candidiasis in young infants [^114vSs3Y]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Young infants are susceptible to developmental factors influencing the pharmacokinetics of drugs. Fluconazole is increasingly used to prevent and treat invasive candidiasis in infants; however, dosing guidance remains empirical and variable due to limited pharmacokinetic data.

- **Methods**: Our population pharmacokinetic model, derived from 357 fluconazole plasma concentrations from 55 infants (23–40 weeks gestation), illustrates expected changes in fluconazole clearance based upon gestational age, postnatal age, weight, and creatinine. We used a Monte Carlo simulation approach, based on a parametric description of a patient population's pharmacokinetic response to fluconazole, to predict fluconazole exposure (median: 10th and 90th percentile population variability range) after 3, 6, and 12 mg/kg dosing.

- **Results**: For the treatment of invasive candidiasis, a dose of at least 12 mg/kg/day in the first 90 days after birth is needed to achieve an area under the concentration curve (AUC) of > 400 mg*h/L and an AUC/minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) > 50 for Candida species with MIC ≥ 90% or ≥ 2 or 4 microg/mL, respectively, for half of the dosin.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116vN6E8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of oral candidiasis, particularly in relation to antifungal therapy, the IDSA 2016 guidelines recommend offering oral fluconazole at a dose of 100–200 mg daily for a duration of 7–14 days in patients with moderate-to-severe oral candidiasis.

### Diflucan [^1148SBmz]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

For vaginal candidiasis, the recommended dosage of Diflucan is 150 mg as a single oral dose.

- **Multiple dose usage**: Since oral absorption is rapid and almost complete, the daily dose of Diflucan (fluconazole) is the same for oral (tablets and suspension) and intravenous administration. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to achieve plasma concentrations close to steady state by the second day of therapy.

- **Treatment for infections other than vaginal candidiasis**: The daily dose should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should continue until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that the active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate treatment period may lead to a recurrence of the active infection. Patients with AIDS, cryptococcal meningitis, or oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

- **Oropharyngeal candidiasis**: The recommended dosage of Diflucan for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to reduce the likelihood of relapse.

- **Esophageal candidiasis**: The recommended dosage for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on the medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy.

### A randomized and blinded multicenter trial of high-dose fluconazole plus placebo versus fluconazole plus amphotericin B as therapy for candidemia and its consequences in nonneutropenic subjects [^114MWQWT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2003). Low credibility.

A randomized, blinded, multicenter trial was conducted to compare fluconazole (800 mg per day) plus placebo with fluconazole plus amphotericin B (AmB) deoxycholate (0.7 mg/kg per day, with the placebo/AmB component given only for the first 5–6 days) as therapy for candidemia due to species other than Candida krusei in adults without neutropenia. A total of 219 patients met criteria for a modified intent-to-treat analysis. The groups were similar except that those who were treated with fluconazole plus placebo had a higher mean (± standard error) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (16.8 ± 0.6 vs. 15.0 ± 0.7; p = 0.039).

Success rates on study day 30 by Kaplan-Meier time-to-failure analysis were 57% for fluconazole plus placebo and 69% for fluconazole plus AmB (P = 0.08). Overall success rates were 56% (60 of 107 patients) and 69% (77 of 112 patients; p = 0.043), respectively; the bloodstream infection failed to clear in 17% and 6% of subjects, respectively (P = 0.02). In nonneutropenic subjects, the combination of fluconazole plus AmB was not antagonistic compared with fluconazole alone, and the combination trended toward improved success and more rapid clearance from the bloodstream.

### Current treatment strategies for disseminated candidiasis [^112T6NwJ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

The incidence of disseminated candidiasis has increased dramatically over the past several decades. Fortunately, in recent years, a variety of new antifungal agents have become available to treat these infections. On the basis of efficacy, safety, and cost considerations, fluconazole is the agent of choice for the empirical treatment of disseminated candidiasis in nonneutropenic, hemodynamically stable patients, unless a patient is suspected to be infected with an azole-resistant species (i.e. Candida glabrata or Candida krusei). For hemodynamically unstable or neutropenic patients, agents with broader species coverage, such as polyenes, echinocandins, or, possibly, voriconazole, are preferred for empirical treatment of candidemia.

Modification of the initial empirical regimen depends on the response to therapy and the subsequent identification of the species of the offending pathogen. Echinocandins or high-dose polyenes are preferred for the treatment of infections with C. glabrata or C. krusei. Central venous catheters should be removed from all patients who have disseminated candidiasis, if feasible, and antifungal therapy should be administered to all patients who have candidemia or proven candidiasis.

### A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, dose-response study of micafungin compared with fluconazole for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis in HIV-positive patients [^117DKPQp]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Severely immunocompromised individuals are highly susceptible to Candida infection of the esophagus. This randomized, double-blind study assessed the dose-response relationship of the new echinocandin antifungal, micafungin, compared with that of standard fluconazole treatment.

- **Methods**: A total of 245 patients (age ≥ 18 years) with a prior diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and esophageal candidiasis, confirmed by endoscopy and culture, were randomized to receive micafungin (50, 100, or 150 mg per day) or fluconazole (200 mg per day). Both agents were administered once per day by a 1-hour intravenous infusion for 14–21 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the endoscopic cure rate, defined as an endoscopy grade of 0 at the end of therapy.

- **Results**: The endoscopic cure rate (grade 0) was dose-dependent with 50, 100, and 150 mg of micafungin per day at 68.8%, 77.4%, and 89.8%, respectively. Symptoms improved or resolved rapidly (within 3–7 days of treatment in the majority of patients). The endoscopic cure rate for 100 and 150 mg of micafungin per day (83.5%) was comparable to that for 200 mg of fluconazole per day (86.7%); the 95% confidence interval for the difference in endoscopic cure rate ranged from -14.0% to 7.7%. The overall safety and tolerability were acceptable, with no significant differences between micafungin (all doses) and fluconazole.

- **Conclusions**: The dose-response findings demonstrate greater efficacy with micafungin at 100 and 150 mg per day than at 50 mg per day. This study also indicates that the efficacy of micafungin is comparable to fluconazole in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis in HIV-positive patients.

### Current concept of abdominal sepsis: WSES position paper [^1171N4gP]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Fluconazole has been widely used for the treatment of candidiasis since its approval by the FDA in 1990. The azoles act primarily by inhibiting the cytochrome P450-dependent enzyme lanosterol 14-alpha-demethylase, necessary for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the cellular membrane of fungi.

Most C. albicans isolated from invasive candidiasis infections remain fully susceptible to fluconazole, which has been the treatment of choice for these infections in most settings, including intra-abdominal infections. However, epidemiological data demonstrate that the frequency of Candida infections is rising, with an increase in the proportion of infections caused by non-albicans Candida species that are intrinsically resistant or variably susceptible to fluconazole.

Several randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of the echinocandins in the treatment of candidaemia and invasive candidiasis. The echinocandins, namely anidulafungin, caspofungin, and micafungin, have a broad and similar spectrum of in vitro and in vivo activity against most Candida spp. Echinocandins have several potential advantages over fluconazole for the treatment of invasive candidiasis. They have a broader spectrum of activity, encompassing fluconazole-resistant C. glabrata and C. krusei, and potent fungicidal activity against most Candida species.

In the specific setting of intra-abdominal infections, echinocandins are generally recommended as a first-line empiric therapy for critically ill patients, while fluconazole is typically recommended for less severe cases.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of candidiasis: 2009 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1125tVJZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Guidelines for the management of patients with invasive candidiasis and mucosal candidiasis were prepared by an expert panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America. These updated guidelines replace the previous guidelines published in the 15 January 2004 issue of Clinical Infectious Diseases and are intended for use by healthcare providers who care for patients who either have or are at risk of these infections.

Since 2004, several new antifungal agents have become available, and several new studies have been published relating to the treatment of candidemia, other forms of invasive candidiasis, and mucosal disease, including oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. There are also recent prospective data on the prevention of invasive candidiasis in high-risk neonates and adults and on the empiric treatment of suspected invasive candidiasis in adults. This new information is incorporated into this revised document.

### How applicable is the single-dose AMBITION regimen for human immunodeficiency virus-associated cryptococcal meningitis to high-income settings [^111kJwkv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

Eighty participants were enrolled before the study was stopped on the recommendation of the independent data and safety monitoring committee. The antifungal activity was similar across the three short-course, high-dose AmBisome arms, all of which were noninferior to the control 14-day regimen (EFA of single dose: −0.52 log 10 CFU/mL/d and standard deviation [SD] 0.35 vs control: −0.41 log 10 CFU/mL/d and SD 0.11) with no suggestion of a dose response with additional doses and no safety concerns. The single-dose regimen was therefore taken forward to phase 3.

At that time, the ACTA trial results became available, showing the superiority of flucytosine as a partner drug with amphotericin. There were, however, concerns that if we simply switched to a single-dose AmBisome plus flucytosine combination, low levels of AmBisome could effectively result in flucytosine monotherapy toward the end of the induction period, risking the development of flucytosine resistance given its low barrier to resistance. Adding single-dose AmBisome to the optimized oral backbone of high-dose fluconazole plus flucytosine, which even on its own performed well in the ACTA trial, would protect flucytosine while providing a needed amphotericin-related fungicidal boost to the oral regimen. In addition, prior phase 2 studies supported earlier animal model work that showed that when higher, more effective doses of fluconazole are used, the triple combination of amphotericin, flucytosine, and fluconazole is associated with the most rapid fungicidal activity (in contrast to earlier results using lower fluconazole doses).

### Single-dose fluconazole versus standard 2-week therapy for oropharyngeal candidiasis in HIV-infected patients: a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial [^112fXjB6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Oropharyngeal candidiasis is the most common opportunistic infection affecting patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Due to convenience, cost, and reluctance to complicate antiretroviral treatment regimens, single-dose fluconazole may be a favorable regimen for the treatment of moderate to severe oropharyngeal candidiasis. We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare the clinical and mycological responses, relapse rates, and safety of a single 750-mg dose and a 14-day course of treatment with fluconazole.

- **Methods**: A total of 220 HIV-infected patients with clinical and mycological evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either a 750-mg single dose of orally administered fluconazole (110 patients) or 150 mg of orally administered fluconazole once per day for 2 weeks (110 patients). The primary efficacy analysis was based on clinical and mycological responses at the end of treatment. Secondary parameters were safety and relapse rate.

- **Results**: Single-dose fluconazole was equivalent to a 14-day course of fluconazole in achieving clinical and mycological cure, with clinical cure rates of 94.5% and 95.5%, respectively (odds ratio, 0.825; 95% confidence interval, 0.244–2.789; p = 0.99), and mycological cure rates of 84.5% and 75.5%, respectively (odds ratio, 1.780; 95% confidence interval, 0.906–3.496; p = 0.129). Drug-related adverse events were uncommon and were not different between the treatment groups.

### Anidulafungin versus fluconazole for invasive candidiasis [^112xSXDu]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2007). High credibility.

Anidulafungin, a new echinocandin, has potent activity against Candida species. We compared anidulafungin with fluconazole in a randomized, double-blind, noninferiority trial for treating invasive candidiasis.

- **Methods**: Adults with invasive candidiasis were randomly assigned to receive either intravenous anidulafungin or intravenous fluconazole. All patients could receive oral fluconazole after 10 days of intravenous therapy. The primary efficacy analysis assessed the global response (clinical and microbiologic) at the end of intravenous therapy in patients who had a positive baseline culture. Efficacy was also assessed at other time points.

- **Results**: Eighty-nine percent of the 245 patients in the primary analysis had candidemia only. Candida albicans was isolated in 62% of the 245 patients. In vitro fluconazole resistance was infrequent. Most of the patients (97%) did not have neutropenia. At the end of intravenous therapy, treatment was successful in 75.6% of patients treated with anidulafungin, as compared with 60.2% of those treated with fluconazole (difference, 15.4 percentage points; 95% confidence interval, 3.9 to 27.0). The results were similar for other efficacy endpoints. The statistical analyses failed to show a "center effect"; when data from the site enrolling the largest number of patients were removed, success rates at the end of intravenous therapy were 73.2% in the anidulafungin group and 61.1% in the fluconazole group (difference, 12.1 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.1 to 25.3). The frequency and types of adverse events were similar.

### Eraxis [^115c67s9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Recommended dosage in adults**: For candidemia and other Candida infections, such as intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis, the recommended dose is a single 200 mg loading dose of Eraxis on Day 1, followed by a 100 mg once daily maintenance dose thereafter. The duration of treatment should be based on the patient's clinical response. In general, antifungal therapy should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture.

	- For esophageal candidiasis, the recommended dose is a single 100 mg loading dose of Eraxis on Day 1, followed by a 50 mg once daily maintenance dose thereafter. Patients should be treated for a minimum of 14 days and for at least 7 days following the resolution of symptoms. The duration of treatment should be based on the patient's clinical response. Because of the risk of relapse of esophageal candidiasis in patients with HIV infection, suppressive antifungal therapy may be considered following a course of treatment.

- **Recommended dosage in pediatric patients (1 month of age and older)**: For candidemia and other Candida infections, like intra-abdominal abscess and peritonitis, the recommended dose is a single loading dose of 3 mg/kg (not to exceed 200 mg) of Eraxis on Day 1, followed by a once daily maintenance dose of 1.5 mg/kg (not to exceed 100 mg) thereafter. Overall antifungal treatment should continue for at least 14 days after the last positive culture.

### Diflucan [^116R3eRU]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 14 patients penetrated into vaginal fluid, resulting in fluid: plasma ratios ranging from 0.36 to 0.71 over the first 72 hours following dosing.

Mean body clearance in adults is reported to be 0.23 (17%) mL/min/kg. In normal volunteers, fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion, with approximately 80% of the administered dose appearing in the urine as unchanged drug. About 11% of the dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites.

The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are markedly affected by reduction in renal function. There is an inverse relationship between the elimination half-life and creatinine clearance. The dose of DIFLUCAN may need to be reduced in patients with impaired renal function (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). A 3-hour hemodialysis session decreases plasma concentrations by approximately 50%.

In normal volunteers, DIFLUCAN administration (doses ranging from 200 mg to 400 mg once daily for up to 14 days) was associated with small and inconsistent effects on testosterone concentrations, endogenous corticosteroid concentrations, and the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol response.

### Single-dose liposomal amphotericin B treatment for cryptococcal meningitis [^113hZr6T]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Participants were individually randomized to either:

- **Three-drug regimen**: Single dose L-AmB 10 mg/kg (AmBisome, Gilead Sciences Inc.) plus 14 days of flucytosine 100 mg/kg/day and fluconazole 1200 mg/day (the "AmBisome" group), or

- **Two-drug regimen**: Amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg/day) plus flucytosine (100 mg/kg/day) for seven days, followed by fluconazole 1200 mg/day on days 8–14 (the "control" group).

The randomization used a computer-generated list with block sizes of four and six, stratified by site in a 1:1 ratio. Randomization was performed electronically using a bespoke electronic data capture tool, with the allocation sequence concealed from all study investigators involved in participant recruitment. Treatment group allocation was provided to recruiting teams after consent and enrollment. The allocation was open label. AmBisome was donated by Gilead Sciences Inc.; amphotericin B deoxycholate was purchased from Bristol Myers Squibb; flucytosine was purchased from Mylan; and fluconazole was purchased from Cipla/Medopharm. Where the Pfizer Diflucan Partnership Program was operational, donated Pfizer fluconazole was used if available. All participants were treated in the hospital for a minimum of seven days. L-AmB 10 mg/kg was administered in 1 liter of 5% dextrose over 2 hours, and amphotericin B deoxycholate 1 mg/kg in 1 liter of 5% dextrose over 4 hours. Participants received 1 liter of intravenous normal saline prior to any amphotericin dose, plus further IV fluids of at least one additional liter each day of amphotericin therapy.

### Insufficient fluconazole exposure in pediatric cancer patients and the need for therapeutic drug monitoring in critically ill children [^112hFnMA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Fluconazole is recommended as the first-line treatment for invasive candidiasis in children and infants. Although achieving adequate exposure to fluconazole in a timely manner improves outcomes, therapeutic drug monitoring is currently not recommended.

We conducted a retrospective study of critically ill children treated with fluconazole from January 2007 to October 2013, for whom fluconazole concentrations were available. We collected demographic, clinical, and treatment data through a review of medical records and determined the correlation of clinical variables with the fluconazole concentration. Additionally, we assessed the relation between the fluconazole concentration and the time to culture conversion in patients with proven invasive candidiasis.

In total, 99 pediatric patients met the inclusion criteria. The fluconazole concentration was considered subtherapeutic in 40% of the patients. Multiple linear regression analysis showed a significant, independent, and positive association of the fluconazole trough concentration with the fluconazole dose (P < .001), weight (P = 0.009), and the serum urea concentration (P = 0.003). There was a significant, independent, negative association with age (P = 0.004) and cancer as an underlying condition (P = 0.003). A higher fluconazole concentration was associated with a shorter time to culture conversion (hazard ratio = 1.076 [95% confidence interval, 1.017–1.138]; p = 0.011).

The fluconazole concentration is not sufficient in pediatric cancer patients with the currently recommended dose regimen.

### Fluconazole to prevent yeast infections in bone marrow transplantation patients: a randomized trial of high versus reduced dose, and determination of the value of maintenance therapy [^114MchGH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

To determine the optimal dose and duration of fluconazole antifungal prophylaxis therapy in bone marrow transplantation patients, a study was conducted with 253 pediatric and adult patients. They were randomly assigned to receive either fluconazole 400 mg daily (high dose) or 200 mg daily (low dose) while neutropenic. After neutrophil recovery, patients continued with either fluconazole (100 mg daily) or clotrimazole troches (10 mg, 4 times daily) for up to 100 days post-transplantation. Monitoring continued until two weeks after early prophylaxis and up to 100 days post-transplantation.

During early prophylaxis, rates of yeast colonization and infections were similar across groups. By day 50, the incidence of Candida infections was 4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1% to 7%; n = 5) in the high-dose group and 1% (95% CI: 0% to 3%; n = 1; P = 0.08) in the low-dose group. During the same period, Aspergillus infections were recorded at 4% (95% CI: 1% to 7%; n = 5) in the high-dose group and 2% (95% CI: 0% to 4%; n = 2; P = 0.33) in the low-dose group. During the maintenance phase, yeast colonization and superficial infections rates were similar in both fluconazole and clotrimazole groups, with systemic fungal infections occurring in four patients (1 with clotrimazole and 3 with fluconazole).

### Fluconazole [^111DZpDW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Fluconazole Injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis. In open non-comparative studies with relatively small numbers of patients, fluconazole was also effective for the treatment of Candida urinary tract infections, peritonitis, and systemic Candida infections, including candidemia, disseminated candidiasis, and pneumonia.

Cryptococcal meningitis can also be treated with fluconazole. Before prescribing fluconazole for AIDS patients with cryptococcal meningitis, please see the clinical studies section. Studies comparing fluconazole to amphotericin B in non-HIV infected patients have not been conducted.

- **Prophylaxis**: Fluconazole Injection, USP is indicated to decrease the incidence of candidiasis in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation who receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Specimens for fungal culture and other relevant laboratory studies (serology, histopathology) should be obtained prior to therapy to isolate and identify causative organisms. Therapy may be instituted before the results of the cultures and other laboratory studies are known; however, once these results become available, anti-infective therapy should be adjusted accordingly.

### Treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis: Topical or oral drugs? Single-day or multiple-day therapy? A network meta-analysis of randomized trials [^113VLJpq]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess early (7–10 days) and late (24–35 days) clinical and mycological cure rates associated with single or multiple-day topical or oral treatment of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Data sources**: The data sources included the Cochrane Central Register of Studies Online (inception to 31 March 2024), MEDLINE via the Ovid platform (1946–31 March 2024), Embase (inception to 31 March 2024), Google Scholar (inception to 31 March 2024), US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and European Clinical Trials Register.

- **Study eligibility criteria**: Fifty randomized studies, encompassing a total of 7208 subjects, comparing different topical or oral drugs with or without placebo were included in the analysis. Confidence in the results of the network meta-analysis was evaluated using an online tool that combines confidence assessments from direct comparisons with network meta-analysis estimates. The risk of bias in individual studies was assessed using the Revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials.

- **Study appraisal and synthesis methods**: A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed using an interactive web-based tool with the R packages gemtc and BUGSNET. Ranking success probabilities were computed based on the surface under the cumulative ranking curve.

- **Results**: Compared with placebo, all the treatments studied were highly efficacious (> 75%) for the clinical and mycological cure of vulvovaginal candidiasis. Single-day use of 150 mg of fluconazole was slightly more effective than multiple-day therapy.

### Rezafungin versus caspofungin in a phase 2, randomized, double-blind study for the treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis: The STRIVE trial [^111yRskd]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Low credibility.

Invasive candidiasis (IC) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite significant advances in antifungal therapy over the past two decades, mortality rates remain between 30% and 60%. Echinocandins are recommended as first-line agents in the treatment of most types of IC. Patients treated with an echinocandin show significantly better survival rates than patients treated with other classes of antifungals; however, treatment failure with echinocandin therapy occurs in approximately 40% of cases, presenting an opportunity for improvement. The efficacy of echinocandins is reliant on concentration-dependent effects and drug levels within target tissue sites. Currently available echinocandins and dosing strategies may be insufficient to eradicate Candida spp. or to prevent the development of resistance.

Rezafungin (RZF) is a next-generation echinocandin with significant pharmacokinetic advantages, including a prolonged half-life (approximately 133 hours) and high plasma drug concentrations early in therapy, allowing for front-loaded, extended-interval dosing. Dose-proportional pharmacokinetics have demonstrated minimal interpatient variability and a favorable safety profile. Preclinical studies have established the efficacy of RZF in animal models of candidemia, IC, and Candida biofilms. Additionally, phase 1 studies have demonstrated the safety and tolerability of RZF in healthy volunteers. Here, we present the results of STRIVE, a phase 2 trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravenous (IV) RZF, compared with caspofungin (CAS) and optional oral therapy options.

### A randomized study of the use of fluconazole in continuous versus episodic therapy in patients with advanced HIV infection and a history of oropharyngeal candidiasis: AIDS Clinical Trials Group Study 323/Mycoses Study Group Study 40 [^112EA5wV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients, fluconazole prophylaxis is associated with reductions in the rate of fungal infection. However, concerns exist with regard to the use of fluconazole prophylaxis and the risk of development of fluconazole treatment-refractory infections.

- **Methods**: We performed a randomized, open-label trial that compared oral fluconazole given continuously (200 mg 3 times weekly; the "continuous fluconazole arm") with fluconazole that was provided only for episodes of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) or esophageal candidiasis (EC) (the "episodic fluconazole arm") in HIV-infected persons with CD4+ T cell counts of < 150 cells/mm³ and a history of OPC. The primary study endpoint was the time to development of fluconazole-refractory OPC or EC, which was defined as lack of response to 200 mg fluconazole given daily for 14 or 21 days, respectively.

- **Results**: A total of 413 subjects were randomized to receive continuous fluconazole, and 416 were randomized to receive episodic fluconazole. After 42 months, 17 subjects (4.1%) in the continuous fluconazole arm developed fluconazole-refractory OPC or EC infections, compared with 18 subjects (4.3%) in the episodic fluconazole arm, with no difference between treatment arms regarding the time to development of a fluconazole-refractory infection within 24 months (P = 0.88, by log-rank test) or before the end of the study (P = 0.97, by log-rank test). Continuous fluconazole therapy was associated with fewer cases of OPC or EC (0.29 vs. 1.08 episodes per patient-year; p < 0.0001).

The primary efficacy endpoint was the percentage of patients with a clinical cure (complete resolution of signs and symptoms; VSS = 0) at the time of cure (TOC). Clinical failure was defined as no response to therapy, incomplete resolution of VSS, or the need for additional vulvovaginal or systemic antifungal therapy before the TOC visit.

Secondary objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of oral ibrexafungerp in patients with VVC based on mycological and clinical outcomes and to assess the safety and tolerability of ibrexafungerp. Secondary efficacy endpoints included the percentage of patients with mycological eradication (negative fungal culture) at TOC and day 25, the percentage of patients with both clinical cure and mycological eradication at TOC, the percentage of patients with both absence of VSS and mycological eradication at day 25, and the percentage of patients with continued clinical response (ongoing absence of symptoms in patients achieving clinical cure at TOC) at day 25.

Exploratory endpoints included the percentage of patients at day 25 who were symptom-free (absence of symptoms regardless of clinical outcome at TOC), with patients who received additional antifungal therapy being considered not free of VSS at day 25. Post hoc analyses included VSS score ≤ 1 (clinical improvement) at TOC and day 25 and the use of antifungal rescue medications.

As a dose-finding study with no formal sample size calculation performed, this study was not statistically powered to detect a difference in clinical endpoints.

### Fluconazole [^112kutkn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Use in pediatric patients for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis, candida esophagitis, systemic candida infections, or cryptococcal meningitis

An open-label, randomized, controlled trial has shown fluconazole to be effective in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in children aged 6 months to 13 years. See clinical studies.

Use of fluconazole in children with cryptococcal meningitis, Candida esophagitis, or systemic Candida infections is supported by the efficacy shown for these indications in adults and by the results from several small non-comparative pediatric clinical studies. In addition, pharmacokinetic studies in children have established a dose proportionality between children and adults. See clinical pharmacology and dosage and administration.

In a non-comparative study of children with serious systemic fungal infections, most of which were candidemia, the effectiveness of fluconazole was similar to that reported for the treatment of candidemia in adults. Of 17 subjects with culture-confirmed candidemia, 11 of 14 (79%) with baseline symptoms (3 were asymptomatic) had a clinical cure; 13 of 15 (87%) of evaluable patients had a mycologic cure at the end of treatment, but two of these patients relapsed at 10 and 18 days, respectively, following cessation of therapy.

### Fluconazole [^114Pxc4S]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dosage and administration in adults:

- **Multiple dose**: Since oral absorption is rapid and almost complete, the daily dose of fluconazole is the same for oral and intravenous administration. In general, a loading dose of twice the daily dose is recommended on the first day of therapy to achieve plasma concentrations close to steady-state by the second day of therapy.

- **Treatment based on infection type**: The daily dose of fluconazole for infections other than vaginal candidiasis should be based on the infecting organism and the patient's response to therapy. Treatment should be continued until clinical parameters or laboratory tests indicate that the active fungal infection has subsided. An inadequate period of treatment may lead to recurrence of the active infection. Patients with AIDS and cryptococcal meningitis or oropharyngeal candidiasis usually require maintenance therapy to prevent relapse.

	- **Oropharyngeal candidiasis**: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Clinical evidence of oropharyngeal candidiasis generally resolves within several days, but treatment should be continued for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

	- **Esophageal candidiasis**: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for esophageal candidiasis is 200 mg on the first day, followed by 100 mg once daily. Doses up to 400 mg/day may be used, based on medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of three weeks and for at least two weeks following resolution.

### Phase 2 randomized study of oral ibrexafungerp versus fluconazole in vulvovaginal candidiasis [^112yR1jK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Based on patient convenience, efficacy, and safety data in this study, ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day was the dosage selected for further evaluation in phase 3 studies. Our study suggested comparable clinical cure rates between ibrexafungerp 300 mg BID for 1 day and fluconazole at TOC. In this phase 2 study, we found it encouraging that certain parameters, such as improved and sustained VSS scores, mycological eradication at day 25, and the need for rescue medication, appeared to be improved with ibrexafungerp compared with fluconazole. Because our study was not statistically powered, these initial findings will need further study to see if the observed differences are meaningful.

In 2019, the FDA provided pharmaceutical industry guidance for drug development in the treatment of VVC and recommended clinical cure, defined as the complete absence of all VSS, as the primary efficacy endpoint. In our study, a clinical cure was defined as the complete resolution of VSS (VSS score = 0) by the TOC visit without the need for further antifungal treatment. Mycological eradication was not a primary endpoint, as Candida is normally found in the vagina. Given variations in efficacy outcome definitions in previous studies of VVC, historical comparisons are difficult. However, some previous studies have reported a decreased sustained response with azole treatment from day 14 to day 35. In comparison, the percentage of patients receiving ibrexafungerp with no VSS increased from 51.9% at TOC to 70.4% at day 25 in our study, suggesting continued improvement and sustained efficacy.

### Sporanox [^115rRH6T]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Two randomized, controlled studies for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis have been conducted, with a total number of participants (n = 344). In one trial, the clinical response to either 7 or 14 days of itraconazole oral solution, at a dosage of 200 mg/day, was similar to fluconazole tablets, averaging 84% across all study arms. Clinical response in this study was defined as cured or improved, which meant only minimal signs and symptoms with no visible lesions. Approximately 5% of subjects were lost to follow-up before any evaluations could be performed. Response to 14 days of itraconazole therapy was associated with a lower relapse rate than the 7-day therapy.

In another trial, the clinical response rate, defined as cured or improved, for itraconazole oral solution was similar to clotrimazole troches and averaged approximately 71% across both study arms. Approximately 3% of subjects were lost to follow-up before any evaluations could be performed. Ninety-two percent of the patients in these studies were HIV seropositive.

An uncontrolled, open-label study was conducted on selected patients who were clinically unresponsive to fluconazole tablets (n = 74, all patients HIV seropositive). Patients were treated with itraconazole oral solution 100 mg b.i.d. Clinical unresponsiveness to fluconazole in this study was defined as having received a dose of fluconazole tablets of at least 200 mg/day for a minimum of 14 days. Treatment duration was 14–28 days, based on the patient's response. Approximately 55% of patients had complete resolution of oral lesions. Of patients who responded and then entered a follow-up phase (n = 22).

### Fluconazole [^116qznf9]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Clinical studies**: In a multicenter study comparing fluconazole (200 mg/day) to amphotericin B (0.3 mg/kg/day) for the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in patients with AIDS, a multivariate analysis revealed three pretreatment factors that predicted death during the course of therapy: abnormal mental status, cerebrospinal fluid cryptococcal antigen titer greater than 1:1024, and cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count of less than 20 cells/mm³. Mortality among high-risk patients was 33% and 40% for amphotericin B and fluconazole patients, respectively (p = 0.58), with overall deaths at 14% (9 of 63 subjects) and 18% (24 of 131 subjects) for the two arms of the study (p = 0.48). Optimal doses and regimens for patients with acute cryptococcal meningitis and at high risk for treatment failure remain to be determined.

- **Pediatric studies**: An open-label, comparative study assessed the efficacy and safety of fluconazole (2 to 3 mg/kg/day) and oral nystatin (400,000 I.U. 4 times daily) in immunocompromised pediatric patients aged 6 months to 13 years with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Clinical and mycological response rates were higher in children treated with fluconazole. Clinical cure at the end of treatment was reported for 86% of fluconazole-treated patients compared to 46% of nystatin-treated patients. Mycologically, 76% of fluconazole-treated patients had the infecting organism eradicated compared to 11% for nystatin-treated patients.

### Maintenance fluconazole therapy for recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis [^117Tr3xq]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

No safe and convenient regimen has proved to be effective for the management of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis.

- **Methods**: After inducing clinical remission with open-label fluconazole given in three 150-mg doses at 72-hour intervals, we randomly assigned 387 women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis to receive treatment with fluconazole (150 mg) or placebo weekly for six months, followed by six months of observation without therapy. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of women in clinical remission at the end of the first six-month period. Secondary efficacy measures were the clinical outcome at 12 months, vaginal mycologic status, and time to recurrence based on Kaplan-Meier analysis.

- **Results**: Weekly treatment with fluconazole was effective in preventing symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis. The proportions of women who remained disease-free at 6, 9, and 12 months in the fluconazole group were 90.8 percent, 73.2 percent, and 42.9 percent, compared with 35.9 percent, 27.8 percent, and 21.9 percent, respectively, in the placebo group (P < 0.001). The median time to clinical recurrence in the fluconazole group was 10.2 months, compared with 4.0 months in the placebo group (P < 0.001). There was no evidence of fluconazole resistance in isolates of Candida albicans or of superinfection with C. glabrata. Fluconazole was discontinued in one patient because of headache.

- **Conclusions**: Long-term weekly treatment with fluconazole can reduce the rate of recurrence of symptomatic vulvovaginal candidiasis. However, a long-term cure remains difficult.

### Fluconazole [^117PyDx6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

A single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 27 patients penetrated into vaginal tissue, resulting in tissue-to-plasma ratios ranging from 0.94 to 1.14 over the first 48 hours following dosing. Additionally, a single oral 150 mg dose of fluconazole administered to 14 patients penetrated into vaginal fluid, with fluid-to-plasma ratios ranging from 0.36 to 0.71 over the first 72 hours following dosing.

Mean body clearance in adults is reported to be 0.23 (17%) mL/min/kg. In normal volunteers, fluconazole is cleared primarily by renal excretion, with approximately 80% of the administered dose appearing in the urine as unchanged drug. About 11% of the dose is excreted in the urine as metabolites.

The pharmacokinetics of fluconazole are markedly affected by reduction in renal function. There is an inverse relationship between the elimination half-life and creatinine clearance, indicating that the dose of fluconazole may need to be reduced in patients with impaired renal function. A 3-hour hemodialysis session decreases plasma concentrations by approximately 50%.

In normal volunteers, fluconazole administration (doses ranging from 200 mg to 400 mg once daily for up to 14 days) was associated with small and inconsistent effects on testosterone concentrations, endogenous corticosteroid concentrations, and the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated cortisol response.

### Single-dose fluconazole for vulvovaginal candidiasis: Impact on prothrombin time in women taking warfarin [^116khgnt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

To estimate the effect of a single oral 150-mg dose of fluconazole on the prothrombin time of women on long-term warfarin therapy, women on warfarin therapy for six months or more, with no change in dose within four weeks of the study and a prothrombin time (PT) with an International Normalized Ratio (INR) between 2 and 3, were invited to participate. Two consecutive baseline PTs were obtained (days -1 and 0), and women were given 150 mg of fluconazole. Prothrombin times were measured on days 2, 5, and 8 of the study. The change in PT was calculated from the difference between the baseline PT on day 0 and the PT during the study period. To detect a 10% difference in a PT (approximately 2.1 seconds) of a patient with an INR of 2.0, at P < .05 and a power of 90%, five subjects are required.

Six women participated in the study. The mean (± standard deviation) PT for day 0 was 27.7 ± 4.1 seconds or INR 2.6 ± 0.4. The PT increased by 11% at day 2, 34% at day 5, and 2% at day 8; these differences were not statistically significant. However, half of the women experienced either a clinically relevant increase of the INR greater than 4, or bleeding that required their dosage of warfarin to be decreased.

A single 150-mg oral dose of fluconazole may increase the PT to a clinically relevant level in a woman on chronic warfarin therapy. Clinicians should monitor the PT carefully following a single dose of fluconazole.

Level of evidence: II-2.

A double-blind randomized study involving 119 participants, of whom 111 were HIV seropositive, compared itraconazole oral solution (100 mg/day) to fluconazole tablets (100 mg/day) in the treatment of esophageal candidiasis. The dosage for each medication was increased to 200 mg/day for patients who did not respond initially. Treatment continued for 2 weeks following the resolution of symptoms, with a total treatment duration of 3 to 8 weeks. The clinical response, which was a global assessment of being cured or improved, was not significantly different between the two study arms and averaged approximately 86%, with 8% lost to follow-up. In this trial, 11% (6 of 53) of itraconazole-treated patients and 21% (12 of 57) of fluconazole-treated patients were escalated to the 200 mg dose. In the follow-up phase with 88 responding patients, approximately 23% relapsed across both arms within 4 weeks.

### Fluconazole [^112LsQfi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Dosage and administration in pediatric patients: The recommended dosage of fluconazole for oropharyngeal candidiasis in pediatric patients 6 months and older is 6 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 3 mg/kg once daily. Treatment should be administered for at least 2 weeks to decrease the likelihood of relapse.

- **Esophageal candidiasis**: For the treatment of esophageal candidiasis, the recommended dosage of fluconazole in pediatric patients 6 months and older is 6 mg/kg on the first day, followed by 3 mg/kg once daily. Doses up to 12 mg/kg/day may be used, based on the medical judgment of the patient's response to therapy. Patients with esophageal candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of 3 weeks and for at least 2 weeks following the resolution of symptoms.

- **Systemic Candida infections**: The recommended dosing regimens for pediatric patients are designed to achieve systemic exposures similar to adults for the treatment of systemic Candida infections, i.e. to maintain an AUC0–24 between 400–800 mg*h/L. Patients with systemic candidiasis should be treated for a minimum of 3 weeks and for at least 2 weeks following the resolution of symptoms.

Dosing in pediatric patients on ECMO: The recommended dosage of fluconazole in pediatric patients 3 months and older on ECMO is 35 mg/kg on the first day (not to exceed 800 mg), followed by 12 mg/kg once daily (not to exceed 400 mg). For patients from birth to 3 months postnatal age, and with a gestational age of less than 30 weeks, a loading dose of 35 mg/kg on the first day followed by 9 mg/kg once daily is recommended.

### Diflucan [^116F5ZZ6]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Fluconazole is primarily expelled from the body through renal excretion as an unchanged drug. No dosage adjustment is necessary for single-dose therapy treating vaginal candidiasis in patients with impaired renal function. However, for those receiving multiple doses of Diflucan, the initial loading dose should range between 50 mg and 400 mg. Following the loading dose, the daily dose, determined by the specific indication, should adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Patients on dialysis**: Those undergoing hemodialysis should receive 100% of the recommended dose post-dialysis. On non-dialysis days, patients should take a reduced dose based on their creatinine clearance.

These adjustment suggestions are derived from pharmacokinetic data obtained after the administration of multiple doses. Additional modifications might be required based on the individual's clinical condition.

- **Estimating renal function**: When serum creatinine is the only available measurement for assessing renal function, employ the following formula to estimate creatinine clearance in adults. For females, the clearance should be calculated as 0.85 times the above value. Although fluconazole's pharmacokinetics has not been studied in pediatric patients with renal deficiency, dosage reductions for such patients should mirror those recommended for adults. The formula for estimating creatinine clearance in pediatric patients is based on a factor of K, where K equals 0.55 for children older than one year and 0.45 for infants.

- **Administration**: Diflucan is administered orally and can be taken with or without food.
