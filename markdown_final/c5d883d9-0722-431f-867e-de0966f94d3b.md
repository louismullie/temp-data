## Question

What is the appropriate treatment for pain following a Lexiscan test?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate treatment for pain following a Lexiscan (regadenoson) test after pharmacologic stress myocardial perfusion imaging, including when to use reversal and how to monitor safely and rule out serious events. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing expected, self-limited discomfort from red-flag pain that could signal ischemia or another adverse event. Then, I should verify the immediate assessment and monitoring steps, including vitals and ECG, before deciding on therapy. Next, I will consider non-pharmacologic supportive care for mild symptoms versus pharmacologic reversal with aminophylline for moderate to severe or persistent pain, confirming dose and onset of effect. Finally, I need to ensure we remain vigilant for ACS and other complications even if symptoms improve after reversal, and I should review medication interactions that might worsen reactions or prolong effects.

> Let me first confirm what "typical" post-Lexiscan pain looks like, so I don't over-treat benign symptoms: dyspnea and chest discomfort are common after regadenoson, with chest discomfort around 12% and most symptoms graded as mild and transient in large observational series, and early trials also described side effects as generally mild and self-limiting [^111HQhfM] [^1171qSzp] [^1173HfM4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — any chest or abdominal pain after Lexiscan warrants a quick safety screen because regadenoson has been associated, albeit rarely, with MI, ACS, serious arrhythmias, heart block, symptomatic hypotension, seizures, and syncope, so I should check vitals, obtain a 12‑lead ECG, and continue monitoring until symptoms resolve or a cause is identified [^111svdkS] [^11336juV].

> If symptoms are mild and the patient is hemodynamically stable with a reassuring ECG, supportive care and reassurance are usually sufficient, as most regadenoson-related symptoms resolve spontaneously within minutes without pharmacologic intervention in real-world series, so I will observe and avoid unnecessary medications while watching for progression [^111HQhfM] [^1171qSzp].

> Wait, let me verify the threshold for pharmacologic reversal — when pain is moderate to severe, persistent, or accompanied by hemodynamic instability or significant ECG changes, I should consider aminophylline to antagonize A2A-mediated effects of regadenoson; the FDA labeling notes events sometimes require fluids and/or aminophylline, and clinical data support aminophylline reversal for regadenoson-induced effects [^111svdkS] [^115kAKYz].

> I need to check the dose and expected onset: aminophylline 150 mg IV has been shown to safely reverse regadenoson's hemodynamic effects with return to baseline in approximately 111 ± 71 seconds, so I should administer 150 mg IV with cardiac and blood pressure monitoring, followed by reassessment of pain and ECG changes to confirm response [^115kAKYz].

> Hold on, I should verify supportive measures in more severe presentations — if there is symptomatic hypotension, hypoxemia, or profuse autonomic symptoms, I should give IV fluids, provide supplemental oxygen as needed, and treat associated symptoms like nausea while continuing continuous ECG and BP monitoring, as some adverse events after regadenoson have required these interventions [^111svdkS].

> But wait, what if the pain is truly ischemic rather than just a vasodilator side effect; transient ST changes and even ST elevation have been described during regadenoson stress in the presence of significant CAD, so if clinical suspicion remains high despite symptom improvement after aminophylline, I should continue an ACS workup per contemporary chest pain pathways and escalate to anatomic or invasive evaluation as indicated by risk and prior testing [^115xY1Ma] [^114W7Aew].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should also double-check for pre-test factors that could amplify or prolong adverse effects — caffeine and methylxanthines antagonize regadenoson and are normally withheld 12 hours pre-test, while dipyridamole increases adenosine effect and should be held to avoid enhanced reactions; confirming adherence to these holds can help interpret atypical or severe post-test symptoms and guide reversal needs [^115gF96e] [^115hHgda] [^111svdkS] [^111xoh8w].

> Let me reconsider the overall sequence to ensure safety is prioritized: immediate vital signs and ECG, risk stratify the pain, observe and reassure if mild and stable, administer aminophylline 150 mg IV for moderate to severe or persistent symptoms with continuous monitoring and IV fluids as needed, and maintain vigilance for ACS with appropriate diagnostic escalation even if symptoms abate after reversal, documenting onset, severity, interventions, and response throughout [^111HQhfM] [^115kAKYz] [^111svdkS] [^11336juV].

Lexiscan (regadenoson) is a selective A2A adenosine receptor agonist used for pharmacologic stress testing in myocardial perfusion imaging. Post-test chest pain or discomfort is common, **typically mild and self-limited** [^1173HfM4], but can occasionally signal ischemia or rare serious events [^111svdkS]. The key is to **monitor for ischemia** and **use aminophylline for reversal** when needed [^115kAKYz] [^113sDpEo].

---

## Incidence and characteristics of chest pain after Lexiscan

Chest pain or discomfort occurs in **12–13% of patients** after Lexiscan stress testing [^111HQhfM] [^117DYWPT]. Symptoms are usually mild, transient, and self-limited, resolving within minutes without intervention [^111HQhfM] [^117DYWPT] [^1171qSzp]. Rare serious events have been reported, including myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, and stress cardiomyopathy [^111svdkS] [^114iUDVN].

---

## Initial evaluation and monitoring

Continuously monitor heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation during and after the test [^11336juV]. Continuous **ECG monitoring** is essential to detect ischemia or arrhythmias [^11336juV]. Assess chest pain characteristics (location, intensity, duration, associated symptoms) to distinguish benign from ischemic pain [^11336juV].

---

## Pharmacological management of post-test chest pain

### Aminophylline

- **Indication**: First-line reversal agent for persistent or severe chest pain after Lexiscan [^111svdkS].
- **Mechanism**: Adenosine receptor antagonist that reverses vasodilation and hyperemia [^113sDpEo].
- **Dosage**: 50–250 mg IV over 30–60 seconds; repeat once if needed.
- **Efficacy**: Rapid symptom relief and hemodynamic normalization [^115kAKYz]

---

### Nitroglycerin

- **Indication**: Use for ischemic chest pain or angina-like symptoms.
- **Mechanism**: Vasodilator that reduces myocardial oxygen demand and relieves ischemia.
- **Dosage**: 0.4 mg sublingual every 5 minutes up to three doses; consider IV infusion if persistent.
- **Precautions**: Monitor for hypotension and headache.

---

### Beta-blockers

- **Indication**: Consider for persistent ischemic symptoms or tachyarrhythmias.
- **Mechanism**: Reduce heart rate, myocardial oxygen demand, and ischemia.
- **Dosage**: Metoprolol 2.5–5 mg IV every 5 minutes up to 15 mg.
- **Precautions**: Avoid in severe bradycardia, heart block, or bronchospasm.

---

### Calcium channel blockers

- **Indication**: Use if beta-blockers are contraindicated or ineffective.
- **Mechanism**: Reduce myocardial oxygen demand and relieve ischemia.
- **Dosage**: Diltiazem 0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes; repeat if needed.
- **Precautions**: Monitor for hypotension and bradycardia.

---

## Non-pharmacological management strategies

Provide reassurance and education about the transient nature of symptoms; position the patient comfortably (typically semi-recumbent); and continue observation until symptoms resolve and the patient is stable. Use supplemental oxygen if **saturation < 90%** or if the patient is dyspneic.

---

## Indications for further diagnostic evaluation

- **Persistent symptoms**: Ongoing chest pain despite initial treatment [^11336juV].
- **ECG changes**: New ischemic changes or arrhythmias [^11336juV].
- **Hemodynamic instability**: Hypotension, bradycardia, or tachycardia.
- **High-risk patients**: Known CAD, prior MI, or multiple risk factors [^114W7Aew].

---

## Recommended diagnostic tests

- **ECG**: Serial ECGs to detect ischemia or arrhythmias [^11336juV].
- **Cardiac biomarkers**: Troponin levels to assess myocardial injury [^11336juV].
- **Echocardiography**: Evaluate wall motion abnormalities or structural heart disease [^1141H6C8].
- **Coronary angiography**: Consider if persistent ischemia or high-risk features [^116P5fb6].

---

## Patient education and follow-up care

Educate patients on recognizing recurrent symptoms and when to seek care; emphasize **adherence to prescribed medications**. Encourage lifestyle modifications, including smoking cessation, diet, exercise, and weight management. Schedule follow-up appointments with cardiology or primary care [^114b2Tmm].

---

## Potential complications and adverse effects

Common **adverse effects** include headache, dizziness, nausea, flushing, dyspnea, and palpitations, whereas serious **complications** include myocardial infarction, ventricular arrhythmias, stress cardiomyopathy, seizures, and bronchospasm [^111svdkS] [^114iUDVN] [^116XqdD5].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

AHA/ACC **guidelines** emphasize monitoring, symptom assessment, and appropriate pharmacological reversal. ESC **guidelines** recommend individualized management based on patient risk and symptom severity [^11336juV] [^111asoNg].

### Regadenoson in Europe: First-year experience of regadenoson stress combined with submaximal exercise in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy [^111HQhfM]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Symptoms and side effects were common with all forms of pharmacological stress. In the regadenoson group, 63% of patients reported at least one symptom, compared to 75% in the adenosine group, 46% in the dobutamine group, and 36% in the exercise group (P = 0.001). Dyspnoea (36%) and chest discomfort (12%) were the most common side effects following regadenoson injection. Chest discomfort and flushing were more frequent with adenosine (29% and 25%, respectively) than with regadenoson (12% and 7%, respectively), but light-headedness was more common with regadenoson (7% vs. 1% for adenosine). Diarrhoea was reported by 12 patients (1%) in the regadenoson group compared to none in the other groups, but this difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.9). Chest discomfort and dyspnoea were the most common side effects in the dobutamine group, while dyspnoea was the most frequent side effect in the exercise group.

The severity of symptoms did not differ significantly between stress agents (P = 0.3), with most symptoms graded as mild: 84%, 88%, 82%, and 60% in the regadenoson, adenosine, dobutamine, and exercise groups, respectively.

### Safety and tolerability of regadenoson in 514 SPECT MPI patients with and without coronary artery disease and submaximal exercise heart rate response [^117DYWPT]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The safety of regadenoson (Reg) during low-level exercise testing has been established. However, its administration at peak exercise for patients who do not reach target heart rate (THR) on standard exercise treadmill stress testing (ETT) needs further evaluation, particularly among patients with known coronary artery disease (CAD).

Methods: From our stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) database, we identified all patients between 2009 and 2012 who underwent standard ETT and received Reg at peak exercise for failure to reach THR. Hemodynamics, side effects, and adverse events were documented prospectively in the database at the time of testing and subsequently retrieved for analysis.

Results: There were 514 patients, with a mean age of 60 ± 12 years, 34% female, and 51% with prior CAD. Among them, 218 (42%) and 297 (57%) patients underwent standard or modified Bruce and Cornell protocols, respectively, with a mean exercise time of 5.8 ± 2.1 minutes. The mean percentage of peak heart rate achieved was 71 ± 8%, and the mean maximal metabolic equivalent (MET) was 6.7 ± 1.8. Sixty-three patients (12%) experienced a ≥ 30 mmHg drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) after 2 minutes of Reg administration, and 10 patients (2%) had an SBP < 100 mmHg at 2 minutes. These patients were younger and achieved higher METs; 8 and 2 patients were symptomatic, respectively. The most common side effects reported were shortness of breath (12%), chest pain/discomfort (13%), and dizziness (7%). There was one syncopal event, but no high-degree heart block, cardiac or major adverse events were observed.

### Regadenoson in Europe: First-year experience of regadenoson stress combined with submaximal exercise in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy [^112Y9B7V]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Although lung disease is not a contraindication to the use of regadenoson, we were initially cautious and used dobutamine in patients with persistent asthma or moderate to severe COPD. None of the patients with airways disease who underwent regadenoson stress developed wheeze, and hence clinically significant bronchoconstriction following regadenoson seems unlikely. Therefore, regadenoson is a safe option in patients with lung disease, and this has been confirmed in a recent study.

The proportions of abnormal (62%) and ischaemic (54%) scans among our patients were significantly higher than those reported in a recent study by Rozanski et al, which examined temporal trends in the frequency of abnormal and ischaemic MPS over the last two decades in patients referred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The study noted a progressive decline in the prevalence of abnormal MPS studies from approximately 41% in 1991 to only 9% in 2009. Similarly, there has been a reduction in the prevalence of ischaemic scans from 30% in 1999 to only 5% in 2009. It is important to bear in mind that for the purposes of the study, 24% of patients were excluded because of previous MI, mechanical revascularization, history of cardiomyopathy, or valve disease. In contrast, our study included all patients referred for MPS, regardless of medical history. Patients with known CAD, including those with previous MI or revascularization, comprised over half of our population. Our patients were on average 10 years older, with more cardiovascular risk factors and a higher frequency.

### Provider-directed imaging stress testing reduces health care expenditures in lower-risk chest pain patients presenting to the emergency department [^115v7VgH]. Circulation. Cardiovascular Imaging (2012). Low credibility.

Among intermediate- to high-risk patients with chest pain, we have shown that a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) stress test strategy implemented in an observation unit (OU) reduces 1-year health care costs compared with inpatient care. In this study, we compare two OU strategies to determine if, among lower-risk patients, a mandatory CMR stress test strategy was more effective than a physician's ability to select a stress test modality.

- **Methods and results**: Upon emergency department arrival and referral to the OU for management of low- to intermediate-risk chest pain, 120 individuals were randomly assigned to receive either (1) a CMR stress imaging test (n = 60) or (2) a provider-selected stress test (n = 60: stress echo [62%], CMR [32%], cardiac catheterization [3%], nuclear [2%], and coronary CT [2%]). No differences were detected in length of stay (median CMR = 24.2 hours versus 23.8 hours, P = 0.75), catheterization without revascularization (CMR = 0% versus 3%), the appropriateness of admission decisions (CMR 87% versus 93%, P = 0.36), or 30-day acute coronary syndrome (both 3%). Median cost was higher among those randomly assigned to the CMR-mandated group ($2005 versus $1686, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: In patients with lower-risk chest pain receiving emergency department-directed OU care, the ability of a physician to select a cardiac stress imaging modality (including echocardiography, CMR, or radionuclide testing) was more cost-effective than a pathway that mandates a CMR stress test. Contrary to prior observations in individuals with intermediate- to high-risk chest pain, in those cases, the costs were significantly impacted.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, particularly in the evaluation of stable chest pain with known obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess bypass graft or stent patency. This recommendation applies to patients with stents that are 3 mm or larger, especially in those experiencing stable chest pain following previous coronary revascularization.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically in the evaluation of stable chest pain in intermediate-to-high-risk patients, the ACC/AHA/ASE/CHEST/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering stress imaging. Options such as stress echocardiography, PET/SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging, or cardiac MRI are advised for diagnosing myocardial ischemia. These tests also help estimate the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in intermediate-to-high-risk patients with stable chest pain who have no known coronary artery disease.

### Lexiscan [^111svdkS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018).

The following adverse reactions have been reported from worldwide marketing experience with regadenoson. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

- **Cardiovascular**: Myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, ventricular arrhythmias, supraventricular tachyarrhythmias including atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response (new-onset or recurrent), atrial flutter, heart block (including third-degree block), asystole, marked hypertension, and symptomatic hypotension in association with transient ischemic attack. Additional reports include acute coronary syndrome (ACS), seizures, and syncope [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), (5.2), (5.3), (5.5), (5.6), and (5.8)]. Some events required intervention with fluids and/or aminophylline [see Overdosage (10)]. QTc prolongation shortly after Lexiscan administration has also been reported.

- **Central nervous system**: Tremor, seizure, transient ischemic attack, and cerebrovascular accident including intracranial hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and (5.9)].

- **Gastrointestinal**: Abdominal pain, occasionally severe, has been reported a few minutes after Lexiscan administration, in association with nausea, vomiting, or myalgias. The administration of aminophylline, an adenosine antagonist, appeared to lessen the pain. Diarrhea and fecal incontinence have also been reported following Lexiscan administration.

- **Hypersensitivity**: Anaphylaxis and angioedema.

### Initial clinical experience with regadenoson, a novel selective A2A agonist for pharmacologic stress single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging [^1173HfM4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Regadenoson, a selective A2A adenosine receptor agonist, was evaluated for tolerability and effectiveness as a pharmacological stress agent for detecting reversible myocardial hypoperfusion when combined with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

Adenosine and dipyridamole are nonselective adenosine agonists currently used as pharmacologic stressors. Despite proven safety, these agents often cause undesirable side effects and require a continuous infusion.

This Phase II, multicenter, open-label trial was conducted in 36 patients who had demonstrated ischemia on a 6-minute adenosine SPECT imaging study within the previous 2 to 46 days. Patients received regadenoson as a rapid intravenous bolus dose of 400 microg (n = 18) or 500 microg (n = 18). The radiopharmaceutical was then delivered within one minute. The SPECT images were acquired in a standard manner and uniformly processed at a central laboratory. Regadenoson and adenosine studies were presented in random order and interpreted blindly with a 17-segment model by three observers. Additionally, quantitative analysis was performed with 4D-MSPECT software (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan).

Overall agreement for the presence of reversible hypoperfusion was 86%. The 400-mug dose was better tolerated. Overall, regadenoson was well-tolerated; side effects (e.g. chest discomfort, flushing, dyspnea) were generally mild in severity and self-limiting. High-grade atrioventricular block and bronchospasm were not observed.

Regadenoson is well-tolerated.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically in evaluating acute coronary syndrome (ACS) at intermediate risk, the 2021 guidelines from ACC, ACCP, AHA, ASE, SAEM, SCCT, and SCMR recommend obtaining invasive coronary angiography for intermediate-risk patients with acute chest pain. This is advisable when there is moderate to severe ischemia on prior (≤ 1 year) stress testing and no known coronary artery disease established by prior anatomic testing.

### Advances in pharmacologic stress agents: focus on regadenoson [^11555rop]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine Technology (2010). Low credibility.

Myocardial perfusion imaging using radionuclides is a well-established protocol for determining the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of coronary artery disease. Pharmacologic stress agents are used to induce cardiac hyperemia in patients unable to achieve the target workload by physical exercise alone. The vasodilators adenosine and dipyridamole are most commonly used, with dobutamine used only when these agents are contraindicated. However, because of frequent and intense side effects, as well as complex procedures both for patients and the nuclear medicine staff, there is room for improvement in these traditional stress agents.

An ideal stress agent would be effective, safe, and well tolerated; have a simple protocol; be suitable for use in patients with reactive airway disease; and have few restrictions for the patient to adhere to before the procedure. Neither adenosine nor dipyridamole are receptor-specific, and they act on A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3) adenosine receptors. As it is the A(2A) receptor that mediates the desired coronary vasodilation, the A(1), A(2B), and A(3) adenosine receptors are deemed responsible for most side effects associated with adenosine and dipyridamole.

A(2A)-selective pharmacologic stress agents should mediate the required hyperemic response while reducing the frequency of adverse events. The only selective A(2A) adenosine receptor agonist currently approved for clinical use as a pharmacologic stress agent for myocardial perfusion imaging is regadenoson. Regadenoson has demonstrated non-inferiority to adenosine for detecting reversible myocardial ischemia.

### Downstream procedures and outcomes after stress testing for chest pain without known coronary artery disease in the United States [^114VPER9]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Millions of Americans with suspected coronary artery disease undergo noninvasive cardiac stress testing annually. However, downstream procedures and subsequent outcomes among symptomatic patients without known coronary disease who are referred for stress testing are not well characterized in contemporary community practice.

- **Methods**: We examined administrative insurance billing data from a national insurance provider from November 2004 through June 2007. After excluding patients with prior cardiac disease or chest pain evaluation, we identified 80,676 individuals aged 40 to 64 years who underwent outpatient cardiac stress testing within 30 days after an office visit for chest pain. We evaluated rates of invasive coronary angiography, coronary revascularization, and cardiovascular events after stress testing.

- **Results**: Within 60 days, only 8.8% of stress test patients underwent cardiac catheterization, and only 2.7% underwent revascularization; within 1 year, only 0.5% died or had a myocardial infarction or stroke. There were marked geographic variations in 1-year rates of catheterization (3.8%-14.8%) and revascularization (1.2%-3.0%) across 20 hospital referral regions.

- **Conclusions**: In this large national cohort of middle-aged patients without previously coded cardiac diagnosis referred for stress testing after outpatient chest pain evaluation, few proceeded to invasive angiography or revascularization, and subsequent cardiovascular events were infrequent.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of cardiomyopathies [^113z3qdc]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, specifically in the context of managing chest pain, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of β-blockers and calcium channel blockers (CCBs) such as verapamil or diltiazem. This approach aims to improve symptoms in patients experiencing angina-like chest pain, even in the absence of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (LVOTO) or obstructive coronary artery disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically the evaluation of stable chest pain at low risk, the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering exercise testing without imaging as first-line testing. This is to exclude myocardial ischemia and determine functional capacity in patients with an interpretable ECG, stable chest pain, and no known coronary artery disease, who are categorized as low risk.

### Intravenous regadenoson with aminophylline reversal is safe and equivalent to intravenous adenosine infusion for fractional flow reserve measurements [^115kAKYz]. Clinical Cardiology (2018). High credibility.

Small studies have demonstrated that adenosine is equivalent to regadenoson when obtaining coronary fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurements. However, a study evaluating the time and safety of aminophylline reversal of regadenoson effects has not been presented.

- **Hypothesis**: Reversal of regadenoson with aminophylline is safe and equivalent to adenosine for FFR measurements.

- **Methods**: Forty-six consecutive patients who underwent clinically indicated FFRs at the time of coronary angiography were enrolled between April 2012 and May 2014. Each patient had FFR measured using adenosine 140 mcg/kg/min IV. Following the return to baseline, FFR was measured using regadenoson 400 mcg IV, which was then reversed with aminophylline 150 mg IV. Time to baseline hemodynamics was measured, and agreement between the two assessments was compared using linear regression.

- **Results**: FFR results were similar with both agents (R² = 0.935, P < 0.0001). Using the 0.80 cutoff for significantly depressed FFR, there was no divergence regarding the studies' significance. After aminophylline reversal of regadenoson, hemodynamics returned to baseline in 111 ± 71 seconds. There were no unexpected side effects or complications.

- **Conclusions**: For FFR measurement, regadenoson and adenosine are equivalent hyperemic agents. Regadenoson with aminophylline reversal may be considered as an alternative to adenosine for FFR measurements.

### A clinical score to obviate the need for cardiac stress testing in patients with acute chest pain and negative troponins [^114wXEvw]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Although cardiac stress testing may help establish the safety of early discharge in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes and negative troponins, more cost-effective strategies are necessary. We aimed to develop a clinical prediction rule to safely obviate the need for cardiac stress testing in this setting.

- **Methods**: A decision rule was derived in a prospective cohort of 3001 patients with acute chest pain and negative troponins and validated in a set of 1473 subjects. The primary endpoint was a composite of positive cardiac stress testing (in the absence of a subsequent negative coronary angiogram), positive coronary angiography, or any major coronary events within 3 months.

- **Results**: A score chart was built based on 7 variables: male sex (+2), age (+1 per decade from the fifth decade), diabetes mellitus (+2), hypercholesterolemia (+1), prior coronary revascularization (+2), type of chest pain (typical angina, +5; non-specific chest pain, -3), and non-diagnostic repolarization abnormalities (+2). In the validation set, the model showed good discrimination (c statistic = 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 0.82–0.87) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, P = 0.34). If stress tests were avoided in patients in the validation sample with a sum score of 0 or lower, the number of referrals would be reduced by 23.4%, yielding a negative predictive value of 98.8% (95% confidence interval, 97.0%-99.7%).

This novel prediction rule based on a combination of readily available clinical characteristics may be a valuable tool to decide when cardiac stress testing can be safely omitted.

### Noninvasive cardiac testing [^114b2Tmm]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically concerning the evaluation of stable chest pain in patients with intermediate to high risk, the AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend stress testing with echocardiography, myocardial perfusion imaging, or cardiac MRI. Alternatively, exercise stress testing with ECG is recommended for patients with an intermediate risk of coronary artery disease and stable chest discomfort.

### Use of regadenoson for measurement of fractional flow reserve [^116RByt6]. Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions (2014). Low credibility.

To compare the use of regadenoson with adenosine for the measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR), this study focused on assessing the functional significance of intermediate coronary artery stenoses using these agents. FFR is a recognized method that employs adenosine to induce maximal hyperemia. However, the use of the selective A2a receptor agonist regadenoson for this purpose is not yet established.

The study included fifty-seven patients undergoing clinically indicated FFR assessment of intermediate coronary stenoses. Initially, FFR was measured by achieving hyperemia through a standard intravenous adenosine infusion at the dose of 140 mcg/kg/min. After a washout period of 10 minutes, FFR was reassessed using a single 0.4 mg intravenous bolus of regadenoson. Measurements of FFR were taken both at baseline and after achieving maximal hyperemia with each agent.

The results indicated that the mean age of participants was 57 ± 8 years, with 47 males involved. A total of sixty coronary lesions were evaluated, comprising 34 in the left anterior descending artery, 9 in the left circumflex, 15 in the right coronary, and 2 in the left main coronary artery. The mean (± SD) FFR values post-adenosine and regadenoson were both 0.79 (± 0.09), with P = NS. The time to FFR nadir was significantly shorter with regadenoson (36.6 ± 24 sec) compared to adenosine (66 ± 0.19 sec), with P < 0.0001, respectively. Importantly, no patients reported significant side effects related to regadenoson.

In conclusion, regadenoson presents a viable alternative to intravenous adenosine for achieving maximal hyperemia during FFR assessment. Compared to adenosine, regadenoson has a similar hemodynamic response, achieves more rapid hyperemia, and is easier to use.

### Dipyridamole [^115hHgda]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **General**: Dipyridamole should be used with caution in patients with severe coronary artery disease, such as those with unstable angina or recently sustained myocardial infarction, due to its vasodilatory effect. Those with underlying coronary artery disease may experience aggravated chest pain when receiving dipyridamole. Caution is also advised for patients with hypotension, as dipyridamole can cause peripheral vasodilation. Elevations of hepatic enzymes and hepatic failure have been associated with dipyridamole administration.

- **Stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole and other adenosinergic agents**: Clinical experience suggests that patients treated with dipyridamole tablets who require pharmacological stress testing with intravenous dipyridamole or other adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson) should interrupt dipyridamole tablets for 48 hours before stress testing. Intake of dipyridamole tablets within this period may increase the risk of cardiovascular side effects and impair the sensitivity of the test.

- **Laboratory tests**: Dipyridamole has been associated with elevated hepatic enzymes.

- **Drug interactions**: No pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies were conducted with dipyridamole tablets. However, the literature reports that dipyridamole has been observed to increase the plasma levels of adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson).

Regarding specific circumstances for chest pain, more specifically with respect to post-CABG patients (stable chest pain), the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining invasive coronary angiography to guide therapeutic decision-making in patients with a history of CABG surgery presenting with stable chest pain. This procedure is advised if noninvasive stress test results show moderate-to-severe ischemia or if myocardial ischemia is suspected with indeterminate/nondiagnostic stress test results.

### ST segment elevation ECG changes during pharmacologic stress with regadenoson [^115xY1Ma]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Regadenoson is a pharmacologic stress agent that has been widely adopted as an alternative to other pharmacologic vasodilator agents due to its ease of use, patient tolerance, and safety profile. We report the case of dynamic ST-segment elevation electrocardiogram changes after regadenoson injection during an inpatient single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion stress test, with subsequent coronary angiography revealing the presence of hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease. Our findings confirm that transient regadenoson-induced ST-segment elevations are a marker for hemodynamically significant disease even in the setting of low-risk SPECT perfusion images.

### Aspirin and dipyridamole [^111xoh8w]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Drug interaction study information obtained from literature**:

- **Adenosinergic agents (e.g. adenosine, regadenoson)**: Dipyridamole has been reported to increase the plasma levels and cardiovascular effects of adenosine; adjustment of adenosine dosage may be necessary. Dipyridamole also enhances the cardiovascular effects of regadenoson, an adenosine A2A-receptor agonist. The potential risk of cardiovascular side effects with intravenous adenosinergic agents may be increased during the testing period when dipyridamole is not held 48 hours prior to stress testing.

- **Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors**: Due to the indirect effect of aspirin on the renin-angiotensin conversion pathway, the hyponatremic and hypotensive effects of ACE inhibitors may be diminished by concomitant administration of aspirin.

- **Acetazolamide**: Use of aspirin and acetazolamide can lead to high serum concentrations of acetazolamide, and potential toxicity, due to competition at the renal tubule for secretion.

- **Anticoagulants and antiplatelets**: Patients taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole capsules in combination with anticoagulants, antiplatelets, or any substance impacting coagulation are at increased risk for bleeding. Aspirin can displace warfarin from protein binding sites, leading to prolongation of both the prothrombin time and the bleeding time. Aspirin can increase the anticoagulant activity of heparin, thereby increasing bleeding risk.

### A critical pathway for patients with acute chest pain and low risk for short-term adverse cardiac events: Role of outpatient stress testing [^114dUtxh]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). High credibility.

We evaluate the safety and feasibility of a critical care pathway protocol in which patients with acute chest pain who are at low risk for coronary artery disease and short-term adverse cardiac outcomes receive outpatient stress testing within 72 hours of an emergency department (ED) visit.

- **Methods**: We performed an observational study of an ED-based chest pain critical pathway in an urban, community hospital involving 979 consecutive patients. Patients enrolled in the protocol were observed in the ED before receiving 72-hour outpatient stress testing. The pathway was primarily analyzed for rates of death or myocardial infarction in the 6 months after ED discharge and outpatient stress testing. Secondary outcome measures included the need for coronary intervention at initial stress testing and within 6 months after discharge, subsequent ED visits for chest pain, and subsequent hospitalization.

- **Results**: Of 871 stress-tested patients aged 40 years or older, who had low risk for coronary artery disease and short-term adverse cardiac events and had 6-month follow-up, 18 (2%) required coronary intervention, 1 (0.1%) had a myocardial infarction within 1 month, 2 (0.2%) had a myocardial infarction within 6 months, 6 (0.7%) had normal stress test results after discharge but required cardiac catheterization within 6 months, and 5 (0.6%) returned to the ED within 6 months for ongoing chest pain. Hospital admission rates decreased significantly from 31.2% to 26.1% after initiation of the protocol (P < .001).

For patients with chest pain and at low risk for short-term cardiac events, this protocol demonstrates a feasible approach to manage care efficiently and safely.

### Regadenoson in Europe: First-year experience of regadenoson stress combined with submaximal exercise in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy [^112XAZN2]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

- **Haemodynamic response to stress**: There was a statistically significant but clinically unimportant difference in resting blood pressure between groups (Fig. 2). Heart rate increased by 28 ± 17 bpm with regadenoson stress, 19 ± 18 bpm with adenosine, 31 ± 24 bpm with dobutamine, and 51 ± 24 bpm with dynamic exercise (Fig. 3). There was no significant change in blood pressure from rest to peak stress in the regadenoson and adenosine groups, while there was a significant reduction in the dobutamine group. The haemodynamic response to vasodilators was modified by concurrent dynamic exercise: median workload was 25 W (0 W, 100 W) for regadenoson vs. 15 W (0 W, 75 W) for adenosine.

### Regadenoson in Europe: first-year experience of regadenoson stress combined with submaximal exercise in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy [^115iboz6]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Regadenoson stress was implemented at our institution on 22 July 2011. As part of an audit of clinical practice, all patients who underwent clinically indicated myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) over the following 12 months were studied. Clinical and imaging data were collected prospectively and retrieved for retrospective analysis from a dedicated database. The selection of stress agent was a clinical decision based on using regadenoson by default, with patients receiving another form of stress if this was preferred over regadenoson or if there was a contraindication to the use of this agent. Hence, in patients with suspected myocardial bridging, coronary anomaly, or microvascular dysfunction as the primary cause of symptoms, dynamic exercise was the preferred form of stress. Patients suitable for vasodilator stress but who self-reported caffeine consumption within 12 hours of the test were given high-dose adenosine (210 μg/kg/min) to overcome the antagonism mediated by caffeine on the adenosine receptors. Patients with a contraindication to vasodilator stress received dobutamine. After three months, regadenoson was given to patients with obstructive airways disease irrespective of disease severity.

- **Symptoms and adverse events**: Symptoms during stress were recorded and defined as mild, moderate, or severe by the health professional (a clinical nurse specialist or a nuclear cardiologist) conducting the stress test. A mild symptom did not distress the patient, while a moderate symptom… (text ends here).

### Regadenoson in Europe: First-year experience of regadenoson stress combined with submaximal exercise in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy [^1171qSzp]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Regadenoson was approved for clinical use in Europe in 2011, and since then, it has become the default form of stress at our institution. This study assessed the side-effect profile and tolerability of regadenoson in patients undergoing clinically indicated myocardial perfusion scintigraphy between July 2011 and July 2012.

Clinical, stress, and imaging data were recorded prospectively. Symptoms during stress were categorized as mild, moderate, or severe. An adverse event was defined as any symptom that persisted for more than 30 minutes or required investigation or treatment.

- **Results**:
	- Of 1,764 consecutive patients, 1,581 (90%) received regadenoson combined with submaximal exercise unless contraindicated. Symptoms were common (63%) but transient and well-tolerated. The severity of symptoms was recorded in most patients as mild (84%). Dyspnoea (36%) and chest discomfort (12%) were the most common side effects. Adverse events were reported in eight patients (0.5%), with seven thought to be vasovagal. All patients recovered fully without sequelae. There were no deaths, myocardial infarctions, or hospital admissions. Regadenoson stress was performed in 206 patients (12%) with asthma or COPD without bronchospasm or any other major side effect.

- **Conclusion**:
	- We studied the symptom profile of regadenoson in the largest European cohort at the time of writing. Regadenoson combined with submaximal exercise was well tolerated, notably also in patients with asthma or COPD. Most regadenoson-related adverse events were vasovagal.

### Regadenoson in Europe: First-year experience of regadenoson stress combined with submaximal exercise in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy [^111jXVJ7]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Although dynamic exercise is the preferred form of stress for myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS), many patients are unable to exercise maximally, and pharmacological stress is common. At our institution, pharmacological stress is the default form because most patients have already been considered for, or have undergone an exercise ECG. An efficient and effective way of stressing coronary function in this setting is the use of vasodilators. Adenosine and dipyridamole are both potent primary coronary vasodilators with a nonselective action, which explains the side effects commonly associated with these agents.

To avoid side effects and potential adverse events, a number of selective adenosine A2A receptor agonists have been developed. Of these, regadenoson is the only one approved for clinical use by the Food and Drug Administration. Approval was granted by the European Medicines Agency in 2010 and by the Royal Brompton & Harefield NHS Foundation Trust New Drugs and Clinical Guidelines Committee in May 2011. Since July 2011, we have used regadenoson as the default form of stress, and we now have the largest experience outside North America.

The main objective of this study was to assess the side effect profile, safety, and tolerability of regadenoson in patients undergoing clinically indicated MPS. A secondary objective of the study was to compare this experience with other forms of cardiac stress.

### Rapid detection of coronary artery stenoses with real-time perfusion echocardiography during regadenoson stress [^11259Q4H]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography permits the detection of myocardial perfusion abnormalities during stress echocardiography, which may improve the accuracy of the test in detecting coronary artery stenoses. We hypothesized that this technique could be used following a bolus injection of the selective A2A receptor agonist regadenoson to rapidly and safely detect coronary artery stenoses.

- **Methods and results**: In 100 patients referred for quantitative coronary angiography, real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography was performed during a continuous intravenous infusion of 3% Definity at baseline and at 2-minute intervals for up to 6 minutes following a regadenoson bolus injection (400 μg). Myocardial perfusion was assessed by examination of myocardial contrast replenishment after brief high mechanical index impulses. A perfusion defect was defined as a delay (> 2 seconds) in myocardial contrast replenishment in 2 contiguous segments. Wall motion was also analyzed. The overall sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for myocardial perfusion analysis in detecting a > 50% diameter stenosis were 80%, 74%, and 78% respectively; whereas for wall motion analysis, these were 60%, 72%, and 66% (P < 0.001 for differences in sensitivity). Sensitivity for myocardial perfusion analysis was highest on images obtained during the first 2 minutes after regadenoson bolus (P < 0.001 compared with wall motion), whereas wall motion sensitivity was highest at the 4-to-6-minute period after the bolus. No significant side effects occurred after regadenoson bolus injection.

- **Conclusions**: Regadenoson real-time myocardial contrast echocardiography is effective for detecting coronary artery stenoses.

### Randomized, controlled dose-ranging study of the selective adenosine A2A receptor agonist binodenoson for pharmacological stress as an adjunct to myocardial perfusion imaging [^114WM3yb]. Circulation (2004). High credibility.

Dipyridamole and adenosine frequently cause side effects due to nonspecific adenosine receptor stimulation. Selective agonism of the adenosine A2A receptor is anticipated to achieve a similar degree of coronary vasodilation, and thereby similar perfusion images, but with fewer side effects.

- **Methods and results**: In a multicenter, randomized, single-blind, two-arm crossover trial, 240 patients underwent two single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) imaging studies in random order. The first study was conducted after pharmacological stress with adenosine, and the second with the selective adenosine A2A receptor agonist binodenoson using one of four dosing regimens. Safety, tolerability, and SPECT image concordance between the two agents were examined. Exact categorical agreement in the extent and severity of reversible perfusion defects ranged from 79% to 87%, with kappa values from 0.69 to 0.85, indicating very good to excellent agreement between binodenoson and adenosine. The risk of any safety event or side effect was significantly lower with any dose of binodenoson compared to adenosine (P ≤ 0.01) due to a dose-related reduction in subjective side effects, as objective events were infrequent. There was a reduction in the severity of chest pain, dyspnea, and flushing in all binodenoson doses compared with adenosine (P < 0.01), and the magnitude of severity reduction was dose-related.

- **Conclusions**: The selective adenosine A2A receptor agonist binodenoson produces an extent and severity of reversible perfusion defects on SPECT imaging similar to nonselective adenosine receptor stimulation.

### ESR essentials: imaging in stable chest pain - practice recommendations by ESCR [^113aLVY5]. European Radiology (2024). Low credibility.

Stable chest pain is a common symptom with multiple potential causes. Non-invasive imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing and guiding management by assessing coronary stenoses, atherosclerotic plaque, myocardial ischaemia or infarction, and cardiac function. Computed tomography (CT) provides anatomical evaluation of coronary artery disease (CAD) through the assessment of stenosis, plaque type, and plaque burden, with additional functional information available from CT fractional flow reserve (FFR) or CT myocardial perfusion imaging. Stress magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear stress myocardial perfusion imaging, and stress echocardiography can assess myocardial ischaemia and other cardiac functional parameters.

Coronary CT angiography is recommended as a first-line test for many patients with stable chest pain, particularly those with low to intermediate pre-test probability. Functional testing may be considered for patients with known CAD when the clinical significance is uncertain based on anatomical testing or for patients with high pre-test probability. This practice recommendations document provides guidance on selecting non-invasive imaging for patients with stable chest pain and offers brief recommendations on performing and reporting these diagnostic tests.

- **Key points**: The selection of non-invasive imaging tests for patients with stable chest pain should be based on symptoms, pre-test probability, and previous history. Coronary CT angiography is recommended as a first-line test for many patients with stable chest pain, particularly those with low to intermediate pre-test probability.

### Noncardiac chest pain [^1156soUD]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2002). Low credibility.

Review of research directions in the etiology, evaluation, and treatment of patients with noncardiac chest pain. The author proposes a combined practical approach to noncardiac chest pain that incorporates these findings, which is useful in a clinical practice setting.

- **Background**: Several major schools of thought have emerged in the etiology of noncardiac chest pain: acid reflux, motor disorder, altered pain threshold/hypersensitivity, and association with psychiatric dysfunction. There is significant overlap among these. Occult gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is more common than motor disorders and is found in 30% to 40% of these patients; a subset has hypersensitivity, with a normal pH profile. Esophageal motility testing and endoscopy have a more limited role than 24-hour pH testing. Impedance planimetry and balloon sensory provocative testing remain research tools. Provocative testing with hydrochloric acid or edrophonium is less helpful than pH monitoring. Gastroesophageal reflux disease-induced chest pain requires high-dose long-term proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) of at least 4 to 8 weeks. Psychotropics are superior to placebo, both in patients with and without psychiatric dysfunction.

- **Results**: The author found combined PPIs and psychotropics helpful in patients with esophageal hypersensitivity and GERD, although supporting data is scant.

- **Conclusions**: A brief 1-week high-dose PPI challenge, i.e. omeprazole test, may be cost-effective in a primary care setting. However, this approach may not be useful in a referral setting, where pH data and diary assessments are utilized.

### Regadenoson in Europe: first-year experience of regadenoson stress combined with submaximal exercise in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy [^114WmWTk]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

This report summarizes our first-year experience performing regadenoson stress in patients with suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD). To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest series of patients undergoing clinically indicated regadenoson myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) in Europe. These results confirm previous observations and show that regadenoson in this setting is well tolerated and safe, with no deaths, hard cardiac events, or hospital admissions following its administration. The rate of other untoward events was 0.5% and these were mainly vasovagal episodes that resolved without sequelae, although two patients received CPR as part of medical management.

Our results are very similar to those of previous studies, including the phase III ADVANCE clinical trials. In these studies, side effects were reported in slightly over 70% of patients undergoing regadenoson stress. In the study, just over 60% of patients experienced at least one side effect following regadenoson injection. The lower frequency of side effects in the study might be explained by the addition of submaximal exercise, which is known to reduce the frequency and severity of vasodilator-related side effects. As in previous studies, most side effects were mild and well tolerated. We have also previously shown that side effects are less common with increasing BMI, although this aspect was not assessed in the study.

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also described as apical ballooning syndrome or stress-induced cardiomyopathy, imitates acute coronary syndrome and is usually related to a massive physiological or emotional stressor. We describe perhaps the first reported case, to the best of our knowledge, of a 55-year-old Caucasian woman who presented with congestive heart failure after having a regadenoson cardiac stress test a few hours prior to presentation to the hospital. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed reduced heart function. She had normal coronaries on cardiac catheterization, and left ventriculography confirmed apical ballooning syndrome. She underwent guideline-directed therapy, and heart function improved in the repeat echocardiogram along with clinical resolution of symptoms.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, particularly in the context of evaluating stable chest pain with known obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), the 2021 guidelines from ACC, ACCP, AHA, ASE, SAEM, SCCT, and SCMR recommend considering exercise treadmill testing. This is to determine if the symptoms are consistent with angina pectoris, assess the severity of symptoms, evaluate functional capacity, and guide the selection of management strategies, including cardiac rehabilitation. This is particularly relevant for patients with obstructive coronary artery disease who experience stable chest pain despite receiving guideline-directed medical therapy.

### Lexiscan [^115gF96e]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). High credibility.

The recommended dose of Lexiscan is 5 mL (0.4 mg regadenoson) administered as an intravenous injection within 10 seconds. Patients should be instructed to avoid consumption of any products containing methylxanthines, including caffeinated coffee, tea, or other caffeinated beverages, caffeine-containing drug products, aminophylline, and theophylline for at least 12 hours before a scheduled radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer Lexiscan if it contains particulate matter or is discolored. Administer Lexiscan as an intravenous injection within 10 seconds into a peripheral vein using a 22 gauge or larger catheter or needle. Administer a 5 mL saline flush immediately after the injection of Lexiscan. Administer the radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging agent 10–20 seconds after the saline flush. The radionuclide may be injected directly into the same catheter as Lexiscan.

The recommended dose of Lexiscan is 5 mL (0.4 mg regadenoson) administered as an intravenous injection within 10 seconds; followed immediately by saline flush and radiopharmaceutical.

### Stable atypical chest pain with negative anatomical or functional diagnostic test: Diagnosis no matter what or prevention at any cost [^1169vxHB]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

In cases of atypical chest pain, the same stress test was booked through the CUP. The median waiting time for testing was 20 days. If the exercise ECG was negative or not feasible due to the lack of an evaluable ECG or the patient's inability to perform the test, an imaging test (scintigraphy, eco stress, and coronary CTA) was also proposed. CTA was performed with the use of a 64-slice or greater multidetector CT scanner. The stress test was considered to be positive according to the American Heart Association guidelines.

Patients with a pre-test likelihood of 15% to 85% were stratified for the presence of lifestyle-related risk factors (smoking; low fruit, vegetable, and legume intake; physical inactivity) at the time of enrolment according to their answers on a specific questionnaire (defined as 0–5–30; 0 = zero cigarettes, 5 = 5 portions of fruit, vegetables, and legumes, 30 = at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity per day). All patients underwent healthy lifestyle counseling. After 12 months (with a tolerance of ± 2 weeks), a final visit was performed. The presence of major risk factors necessitating pharmacological treatment (hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes) and family history of ischemic heart disease was also noted.

### Differences in heart rate response to adenosine and regadenoson in patients with and without diabetes mellitus [^116mpqou]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Adenosine and regadenoson increase heart rate (HR) when used as stress agents to produce coronary hyperemia due to direct sympathetic stimulation. We hypothesized that the HR response would be lower in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) than in those without.

- **Methods**: We studied the HR response (percentage maximal increase) in 2,000 patients in The ADenoscan Versus regAdenosoN Comparative Evaluation for Myocardial Perfusion Imaging (ADVANCE MPI 1 and 2) Trials with known DM status.

- **Results**: There were 643 patients with a history of DM (65.4 ± 0.4 years, 32% women) and 1,357 patients with no DM (65.5 ± 0.3 years, 29% women). Compared with non-DM patients, the DM group had a higher HR at baseline (68.4 ± 0.48 vs 65.2 ± 0.31 beats/min, P < .001) and a smaller HR response after adenosine or regadenoson administration (29.4% ± 0.64% vs 36.1% ± 0.54%, P < .001). Insulin therapy was associated with further blunting in the HR response (25.9% ± 1.0% vs 31.2% ± 0.8%, P < .001). After adjusting for beta-blocker intake, baseline HR, age, gender, renal function, systolic blood pressure, and left ventricular systolic function, DM independently accounted for a decrease in the HR response.

- **Conclusions**: The HR response to adenosine and regadenoson in patients with DM is blunted. If additional studies show agreement between traditional tests for autonomic neuropathy determination and this measure, then examination of HR response to these agents during myocardial perfusion imaging might add prognostic power.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chest pain, specifically the evaluation of stable chest pain with known nonobstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), the ACC/ACCP/AHA/ASE/SAEM/SCCT/SCMR 2021 guidelines recommend considering stress imaging with PET/SPECT, cardiac MRI, or echocardiography. These modalities are suggested for diagnosing myocardial ischemia in patients with known extensive nonobstructive coronary artery disease who exhibit stable chest pain symptoms.

### Provocative testing for chest pain [^116dTEQK]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2000). Low credibility.

Since the first Chest Pain Center (CPC) was established in 1981 to expedite the evaluation and treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction, the original concept has expanded to include rapid evaluation of chest pain patients with appropriate care streamlining and the incorporation of the latest technology. It has also been established that among patients presenting with acute chest pain, a very low-risk group with less than a 5% probability of a coronary event can be identified. Recognition of this group could prevent unnecessary admissions, offering more appropriate patient care and improved cost-effectiveness.

Efficient management of these chest pain patients requires reductions in: (1) delays in therapy, (2) "soft" admissions, (3) inappropriate dispositions, and (4) cost. Over time, provocative testing (PT) for chest pain patients has moved to the forefront. PT methods are being studied in hundreds of emergency department (ED) patients, followed up over several months to ascertain the predictive value of both positive and negative test results. More CPCs are now using PT as part of their management protocol in terms of decision-making concerning prognostication, treatment, and disposition. This could take the form of the ECG graded exercise test (GXT), stress echocardiography (SE), and stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) radionuclide perfusion imaging. The GXT is currently fairly widely used, SE is gaining popularity, and stress radionuclide perfusion imaging will perhaps gain more recognition in the future.

### Prognostic value of noninvasive cardiovascular testing in patients with stable chest pain: Insights from the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain) [^114boEM5]. Circulation (2017). High credibility.

The optimal management of patients with stable chest pain relies on the prognostic information provided by noninvasive cardiovascular testing, but there are limited data from randomized trials comparing anatomic with functional testing.

- **Methods**: In the PROMISE trial (Prospective Multicenter Imaging Study for Evaluation of Chest Pain), patients with stable chest pain and intermediate pretest probability for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomly assigned to functional testing (exercise electrocardiography, nuclear stress, or stress echocardiography) or coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). Site-based diagnostic test reports were classified as normal or mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal. The primary endpoint was death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina hospitalizations over a median follow-up of 26.1 months.

- **Results**: Both the prevalence of normal test results and the incidence rate of events in these patients were significantly lower among 4,500 patients randomly assigned to CTA in comparison with 4,602 patients randomly assigned to functional testing (33.4% versus 78.0%, and 0.9% versus 2.1%, respectively; both P < 0.001). In CTA, 54.0% of events (n = 74/137) occurred in patients with nonobstructive CAD (1%-69% stenosis). The prevalence of obstructive CAD and myocardial ischemia was low (11.9% versus 12.7%, respectively), with both findings having similar prognostic value (hazard ratio, 3.74; 95% confidence interval, 2.60–5.39; and 3.47; 95% CI, 2.42–4.99). When test findings were stratified as mildly, moderately, or severely abnormal, the prognostic value also varied.

### Non-invasive assessment of low- and intermediate-risk patients with chest pain [^111z5wNn]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a significant global public health burden despite advancements in prevention and therapeutic strategies. Common non-invasive imaging modalities, both anatomic and functional, are available for the assessment of patients with stable chest pain. Exercise electrocardiography is a long-standing method for evaluating CAD and remains the initial test for the majority of patients who can exercise adequately with a baseline interpretable electrocardiogram. The addition of cardiac imaging to exercise testing provides incremental benefits for accurate diagnosis of CAD and is particularly useful in patients who are unable to exercise adequately and/or have uninterpretable electrocardiograms.

Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging and echocardiography with exercise or pharmacological stress provide high sensitivity and specificity in the detection and further risk stratification of patients with CAD. Recently, coronary computed tomography angiography has demonstrated its growing role in ruling out significant CAD given its high negative predictive value. Although less available, stress cardiac magnetic resonance provides a comprehensive assessment of cardiac structure and function and offers high diagnostic accuracy in the detection of CAD.

The utilization of non-invasive testing is complex due to various advantages and limitations, particularly in the assessment of low- and intermediate-risk patients with chest pain, where no single study is suitable for all patients. This review describes the currently available non-invasive modalities.

### Regadenoson in Europe: First-year experience of regadenoson stress combined with submaximal exercise in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy [^112fSEUP]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Lung disease, including airways obstruction, was documented by clinical history in 297 patients (17%), of whom 145 (49%) had asthma, 111 (37%) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 34 (11%) interstitial lung disease, and 7 (2%) bronchiectasis. Of these 297 patients, 242 (81%) received regadenoson. Of all patients with a history of asthma in the regadenoson group, 71% had intermittent symptoms, 26% mild persistent symptoms, and 3% moderate symptoms, with none experiencing severe persistent asthma. No patient developed bronchospasm with regadenoson, but one patient (male, 79 years old) with a history of previous myocardial infarction (MI) but not known to have airways disease developed mild bronchospasm. The bronchospasm developed soon after the injection of regadenoson and resolved shortly after inhalation of salbutamol. Most patients in the dobutamine group (77%) had some form of lung disease, mainly asthma or COPD. Among these, 13% had intermittent asthma, 19% mild persistent asthma, 44% moderate persistent asthma, and 15% severe persistent asthma. None of the patients who underwent dobutamine stress experienced any respiratory complications.

### Regadenoson in Europe: First-year experience of regadenoson stress combined with submaximal exercise in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy [^114U8ZL6]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

As shown by previous comparisons between regadenoson and adenosine stress, the frequency and intensity of side effects after regadenoson injection is similar to that of adenosine. However, the nature and quality of side effects differ between the two agents; for example, chest discomfort and flushing are more common with adenosine than regadenoson, while headache and gastrointestinal symptoms are more frequent with regadenoson. Differences in the degree of vasodilation and sympathetic stimulation, as well as differences in affinity for the adenosine receptors, may account for this finding.

Gastrointestinal symptoms, especially diarrhea, have the potential for causing procedural delays that may compromise image quality and accuracy, particularly when 201 Tl is used. Nearly 1% of our patients had diarrhea following regadenoson injection; however, all episodes were self-limiting, and images were obtained in all patients. The frequency of diarrhea in our series was significantly lower than the 11% found in a recent study. It is possible that lack of awareness of causality between regadenoson and gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as cultural differences, might have prevented our patients from reporting this unpleasant side effect. However, it is also likely that the addition of dynamic exercise might have contributed to the lower frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms. Indeed, Thomas et al. have already shown that regadenoson combined with exercise is associated with a low frequency of gastrointestinal symptoms (5%).

### EANM procedural guidelines for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT and SPECT/CT: 2015 revision [^113sDpEo]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The selective coronary vasodilator regadenoson induces myocardial hyperaemia mediated by adenosine receptors, independent of myocardial oxygen demand. Only A2A receptors induce coronary vasodilation, resulting in a fourfold to fivefold increase in myocardial blood flow in healthy coronary vessels. In addition to the A2A receptor, adenosine also stimulates A1, A2B, and A3 adenosine receptors, which provoke adverse effects. Regadenoson is a selective stimulator of the A2A receptor with minimal or no stimulation of the other adenosine receptor subtypes.

Dipyridamole increases tissue levels of adenosine by preventing the intracellular reuptake and deamination of adenosine, resulting in vasodilation. This vasodilation leads to a modest increase in heart rate and most often a modest decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures.

For regadenoson, as with other vasodilators, caffeine-containing beverages (coffee, tea, cola, etc), foods (chocolate, etc), some medications (e.g. pain relievers, stimulants, and weight control drugs), and methylxanthine-containing medications that antagonize vasodilator action must be discontinued at least 12 hours before vasodilator stress and at least five half-lives before for long-acting methylxanthines. Dipyridamole or medications containing dipyridamole should be interrupted for at least 24 hours. Pentoxifylline and clopidogrel need not be discontinued. Ticagrelor, a direct-acting P2Y12-adenosine diphosphate receptor blocker, has been shown to significantly raise adenosine plasma levels, resulting in more frequent and severe adverse effects.

### Regadenoson in Europe: First-year experience of regadenoson stress combined with submaximal exercise in patients undergoing myocardial perfusion scintigraphy [^117MoXrk]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

A total of 1,764 consecutive patients underwent stress myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) between 22 July 2011 and 28 July 2012. Of these patients, 69% were male with a mean age of 67 ± 11 years and a mean body mass index of 28 ± 5 kg/m². The majority of patients (90%) underwent regadenoson stress, while the remainder were subjected to adenosine (7%), dobutamine (2%), or dynamic exercise (1%).

The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors and other characteristics of the population are documented in Table 1. There were no significant differences between groups, except for lung disease, which was more common (83%) in the dobutamine group. Of the 1,764 patients, 73% had a history of chest pain, with 24% of these patients experiencing angina, 60% had dyspnoea, and 9% had a history of heart failure, while less than 1% had severe heart failure. Dyspnoea was more frequent in the dobutamine group, and there was a small excess of patients with a history of heart failure in the adenosine and dobutamine groups.

- **Patient characteristics**: Symptoms on presentation are detailed in Table 2. Statistical significance was assessed with a P-value threshold of < 0.05 between stress groups.
