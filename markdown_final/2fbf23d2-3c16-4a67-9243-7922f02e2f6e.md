## Question

What causes interstitial cystitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what causes interstitial cystitis, also called bladder pain syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition and diagnostic framework to anchor causation claims. Then, I should verify the prevailing consensus on whether a single cause exists or if this is multifactorial. Next, I will examine the major pathophysiological mechanisms proposed in the literature. After that, I should review phenotypic heterogeneity and how it shapes causal thinking. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, mechanism-based model and note key uncertainties and research directions, making sure I continuously check each claim against guidelines and high-quality reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical construct so I don't jump to conclusions about causation without context. IC/BPS is defined as an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the bladder, with lower urinary tract symptoms persisting beyond six weeks, after excluding infection and other identifiable causes; importantly, the diagnosis is clinical and exclusionary, and the NIDDK research criteria are not appropriate for routine clinical diagnosis, which I should explicitly state to avoid misapplication [^112mptCM] [^117PYpDe] [^115AtvJ8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single cause; I need to check the consensus. Multiple authoritative sources converge on the same point: there is no single established cause of IC/BPS, and the condition is best viewed as heterogeneous with several plausible mechanisms rather than a unitary disease entity, which means any causal narrative must remain multifactorial and phenotype-aware [^112icKp6] [^1163agpw].

> I will now examine the urothelial barrier dysfunction hypothesis, but I should double-check that I'm not overstating causality. Evidence supports impaired urothelial barrier function with glycosaminoglycan layer defects, increased permeability, and denudation, allowing urinary solutes like potassium to irritate suburothelial afferents; preclinical models of barrier compromise reproduce features seen in human IC/BPS, though whether barrier failure is primary or secondary remains unsettled, so I should frame this as a leading, not proven singular, mechanism [^111hmkhw] [^115dGgs4] [^113wJUCj].

> Next, I should review inflammatory and immune mechanisms, and I need to ensure I distinguish correlation from causation. Chronic bladder inflammation with elevated cytokines, mast cell activation, and occasional autoimmune features has been repeatedly observed, and mast cells appear central in subsets, but inflammation may be downstream of barrier injury or neurogenic drivers; nonetheless, inflammatory signaling contributes to symptom chronicity and is a rational therapeutic target in selected patients [^111HyGdM] [^112icKp6] [^1163agpw].

> Let me consider neurogenic inflammation and central sensitization carefully, because I should verify both peripheral and central components. Peripheral sensitization from urothelial injury and inflammatory mediators can amplify afferent signaling, while central sensitization links IC/BPS to other chronic pain syndromes; ATP release from urothelium activating P2X3 receptors and upregulation of nociceptive pathways provide credible mechanistic bridges, supporting a neuroimmune contribution to symptom maintenance [^117SQ9jm] [^1163agpw] [^112icKp6].

> But wait, what if an occult infection or autoimmune process initiates disease in some patients; I should review that possibility. Post-infectious autoimmune responses have been proposed, and while no specific pathogen is consistently implicated, immune dysregulation with autoantibodies and cytokine signatures appears in subsets, suggesting that autoimmunity may be contributory rather than universal, reinforcing the need for phenotype-specific immunomodulatory strategies where appropriate [^112icKp6] [^113jW3f1].

> I should also check oxidative stress as a mechanistic thread, especially given recent data. Reactive oxygen species can damage urothelium, promote inflammation, and modulate nociceptive pathways; oxidative stress biomarkers and pathway studies indicate plausible links to symptom expression, though causality remains to be proven and likely reflects one of several converging insults rather than a solitary cause [^1117TFLN].

> Let me synthesize a working model, but I need to ensure it remains hypothesis-generating rather than definitive. A plausible cascade is that an initial insult — such as infection, chemical exposure, pelvic trauma, or neurogenic injury — damages the urothelial barrier, permitting urinary solutes to penetrate and activate suburothelial nociceptors; this triggers inflammatory cascades and mast cell degranulation, which further injure nerves and epithelium, while peripheral sensitization feeds central sensitization, establishing a self-perpetuating loop of pain, urgency, and frequency; genetic or epigenetic susceptibility may modulate this trajectory, explaining heterogeneity and chronicity [^112icKp6] [^111hmkhw] [^115Sd96V].

> I should confirm how phenotypic heterogeneity modifies causal inference and treatment implications. Distinct phenotypes such as Hunner lesion disease, low anesthetic bladder capacity, and widespread pain syndromes likely reflect different dominant mechanisms: Hunner lesions align with focal inflammatory disease responsive to lesion-directed therapy, low capacity phenotypes suggest severe urothelial/neurogenic injury, and widespread pain phenotypes reflect central sensitization with systemic pain comorbidity; this stratification supports phenotype-guided therapy rather than a one-size-fits-all causal model [^114YLWux] [^1163agpw] [^1117SAC8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought "urothelial dysfunction is the primary cause", but I should correct that to "a primary driver in many patients, not all". While barrier compromise is compelling and therapeutically actionable in subsets, parallel lines of evidence for neurogenic and central mechanisms, mast cell–mediated inflammation, and immune dysregulation indicate that IC/BPS is multifactorial and that different patients may have different primary drivers, which explains the limited efficacy of any single treatment across the population [^112icKp6] [^115E6qa4] [^1163agpw].

> Next, I should review key uncertainties so we don't overstate what is known. The absence of a validated unifying biomarker, the reliance on exclusionary diagnosis, and the heterogeneity of study populations limit causal inference; emerging biomarker panels and machine learning approaches may soon enable phenotype-specific diagnosis and mechanism-targeted therapy, but they are not yet ready for routine clinical use, so clinicians should communicate uncertainty transparently while applying guideline-concordant care [^113yNmJP] [^113oH2Nn] [^111u9HGi].

> Finally, I need to ensure the clinical takeaway is precise and practical. There is no single cause of IC/BPS; instead, overlapping mechanisms include urothelial barrier injury, inflammatory and mast cell activation, neurogenic inflammation with central sensitization, possible autoimmune or post-infectious processes, and oxidative stress, all modulated by genetic and epigenetic susceptibility; diagnosis remains clinical and exclusionary, and management should be individualized and phenotype-informed, with shared decision-making and periodic reassessment of efficacy to refine the working causal model for each patient [^112icKp6] [^116V3Frr] [^1117SAC8].

Interstitial cystitis (IC), also called bladder pain syndrome, has no single known cause; it is best understood as a multifactorial disorder involving **urothelial barrier dysfunction** with glycosaminoglycan (GAG) layer defects [^111hmkhw], **neurogenic inflammation** with central sensitization [^1163agpw], and **mast cell activation** with chronic inflammation [^111HyGdM]. Additional contributors include autoimmune phenomena, oxidative stress [^1117TFLN], and possible occult infections, while genetic predisposition and pelvic floor dysfunction likely modulate risk and severity [^112LnZNe] [^114tvEtX]. These mechanisms converge to produce bladder pain, urgency, and frequency, and explain the heterogeneity of IC and the need for individualized, multimodal therapy [^112icKp6] [^117BQrMA].

---

## Urothelial barrier dysfunction

- **GAG layer defects**: The bladder's protective GAG layer is often impaired in IC, increasing permeability and allowing irritants like potassium to penetrate, depolarize nerves, and cause pain and inflammation [^113wJUCj] [^111hmkhw].

- **Urothelial cell abnormalities**: Altered differentiation and apoptosis of urothelial cells contribute to barrier breakdown and chronic inflammation [^112dSqtx].

- **Urinary markers**: Elevated antiproliferative factor (APF) and decreased heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) reflect urothelial injury and impaired repair [^116pXjUZ].

---

## Neurogenic inflammation and central sensitization

- **Peripheral sensitization**: Injury or inflammation sensitizes bladder afferents, lowering thresholds for pain and urgency [^117SQ9jm].

- **Central sensitization**: Chronic peripheral input amplifies pain processing in the CNS, causing widespread pain and comorbidities like fibromyalgia and IBS [^1163agpw].

- **Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides**: Substance P, nerve growth factor (NGF), and ATP are upregulated, sustaining pain and inflammation [^notfound].

---

## Mast cell activation and chronic inflammation

Mast cells are increased and activated in IC bladders, releasing histamine, tryptase, and cytokines that drive pain, urgency, and inflammation [^notfound]. Chronic inflammation with lymphocytes, macrophages, and fibrosis is common, reflecting sustained immune activation [^notfound].

---

## Autoimmune and infectious hypotheses

Autoimmune phenomena — including autoantibodies and immune complexes — have been detected in some patients, suggesting an autoimmune component in a subset [^notfound]. Occult infection may also contribute, as low-grade or biofilm-associated pathogens could trigger chronic inflammation, although no specific pathogen has been confirmed [^112LnZNe].

---

## Genetic predisposition and environmental factors

Genetic susceptibility likely influences immune regulation, urothelial integrity, and nociception, contributing to familial clustering and variable severity [^112LnZNe]. Environmental triggers such as trauma, infection, and stress may precipitate or exacerbate symptoms in genetically predisposed individuals [^115TMSpw].

---

## Pelvic floor dysfunction

Pelvic floor muscle hypertonicity and dysfunction are common in IC, contributing to pain and urinary symptoms through mechanical and neuromuscular mechanisms [^112cy9EG].

---

## Summary of proposed mechanisms

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Urothelial barrier dysfunction | GAG layer defects, increased permeability, urothelial cell abnormalities |
| Neurogenic inflammation | Peripheral and central sensitization, neurotransmitter upregulation |
| Mast cell activation | Histamine, tryptase, cytokine release, chronic inflammation |
| Autoimmune phenomena | Autoantibodies, immune complexes |
| Occult infection | Low-grade or biofilm-associated pathogens |
| Genetic predisposition | Immune regulation, urothelial integrity, nociception |
| Pelvic floor dysfunction | Hypertonicity, neuromuscular dysfunction |

---

Interstitial cystitis arises from a **complex interplay** of urothelial, neurological, immune, and genetic factors, with no single cause identified. This multifactorial model explains the heterogeneity of IC and supports individualized, multimodal treatment strategies [^112icKp6].

### Targets for therapy of the painful bladder [^112gWWTH]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis is an elusive disorder. Without a defining etiology and distinctive pathophysiology, diagnosis is made on an exclusionary basis. Treatment strategies for the disease vary, as do estimates of its prevalence. Nevertheless, advances are being made in understanding this disease. Basic research is helping to define rational treatment approaches for interstitial cystitis, and new therapies based on the findings of such research are being developed. This article reviews the theories of the etiology of interstitial cystitis and reviews the evidence for clinical effectiveness of various treatments.

### Interstitial cystitis pathogenesis and treatment [^116ezQ4i]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Interstitial cystitis remains an idiopathic illness characterized by urinary frequency, urgency and pelvic pain with substantial morbidity in those affected. There is significant variability in the presentation, severity of symptoms and response to therapy. This review focuses on recent findings on the possible pathogenesis and potential treatments for this disease.

Recent Findings

Interstitial cystitis is manifested by sensory hypersensitivity. A small volume of urine will be associated with an exaggerated sensation of pain or pressure and urinary urgency. There is continued research regarding how this process is initiated and maintained and to what extent systemic dysfunction of the immune or autonomic nervous system may play a role. The urothelial lining has been demonstrated to be capable of secreting a large number of potential signaling molecules that may be significant factors in the disease.

Summary

The pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis remains uncertain and the illness has significant diversity. Additional research is needed to establish subtypes that share common processes that can be targeted for treatment as a single effective therapy for the condition remains elusive.

### What is new in bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis? [^117NF36W]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis is an important and poorly understood disorder. This review highlights current research findings that may be of benefit to the clinician who is responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of patients who suffer from this condition.

Recent Findings

The perspective from which we view bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis is evolving, as is apparent in the literature this year. It is best perceived as one of many chronic pain syndromes, some of which may be related. International efforts aimed at consistent definition and nomenclature are ongoing. Some new treatments have been reported that may be of benefit.

Summary

In the age of the internet, it is incumbent upon the clinician to keep up with current ideas, epidemiology, and treatment findings to be able to discuss these with well informed patients who come to clinics around the world. In this review we hope to bring practicing healthcare providers up to date with the literature on bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis, and the implications for their patients.

### Interstitial cystitis: an update [^112LnZNe]. Current Opinion in Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Interstitial cystitis is a chronically progressive, severely debilitating, heterogeneous syndrome affecting the urinary bladder, mainly associated with urgency, frequency and pain. Though known for over a century, its etiology is poorly understood and universally effective treatments are lacking. This review focuses on recently published literature on the disorder.

Recent Findings

Appropriate diagnostic tests for interstitial cystitis remain uncertain. The diagnostic criteria developed by the US National Institutes of Health represent research definitions which are subject to controversial debate for their overenthusiastic clinical application. The diagnosis is made clinically and by cystoscopy with hydrodistention and sometimes biopsy when other pathologies have been excluded. In symptomatic patients, glomerulations upon bladder distension are indicative but not pathognomonic for nonulcerative interstitial cystitis. Patients with ulcerative disease represent a separate subgroup with distinct characteristics and treatment implications. The role of bladder permeability tests remains controversial. Promising noninvasive markers for interstitial cystitis have been described but are not yet clinically available. Validated symptom scores are appropriate to assist in diagnostics and to monitor disease course and treatment efficacy. Lately investigated hypotheses for causative factors include occult or resistant microorganisms, urothelial hyperpermeability, neurogenic or hormonal pathomechanisms, and mast cell activation. Increasing evidence for a genetic susceptibility is emerging.

Summary

Among the multitude of oral, intravesical, interventional and complementary treatments suggested few studies have high levels of evidence. Newly proposed agents must await further controlled studies. Treatment remains empiric until radical surgical procedures should ultimately be considered for severe refractory cases.

### Recent developments in the management of interstitial cystitis [^116pXjUZ]. Current Opinion in Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Interstitial cystitis, a great enigma of urology today, is a chronic sterile inflammatory disease of the bladder of unknown etiology characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia and suprapubic pain. Although there are plenty of theories, the etiology of the condition remains obscure. This review focuses on recently published literature on interstitial cystitis.

Recent Findings

Several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed in the past few years including epithelial dysfunction, activation of mast cells, neurogenic inflammation, autoimmunity and occult infection. Evidence indicates that it is a heterogeneous syndrome and that the two subtypes, classic and nonulcer disease, represent different entities. The diagnosis is made by clinical and cystoscopic evaluation with hydrodistension and often with biopsy when other disorders are excluded. The National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases has developed criteria for clinical studies. There is a need for a noninvasive marker of interstitial cystitis. Antiproliferative factor as a urinary marker has shown promising results. The value of the bladder permeability test in interstitial cystitis needs further investigation. Many gynecologic conditions mimic the symptoms of interstitial cystitis. Multiple forms of therapy are available including self-care and dietary changes, medical and intravesical treatments, neuromodulation, multimodality treatment and surgical intervention. It is recommended that the most conservative treatments are used first and surgery should be regarded as the last resort.

Summary

Interstitial cystitis is a challenging disease of urology today. While causative factors remain unknown, treatment is based on empiricism. Intensive research may result in new and hopefully more effective treatments in the future.

### Pathophysiology and clinical biomarkers in interstitial cystitis [^113yNmJP]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is a poorly understood yet prevalent condition accounting for a significant proportion of urology office visits. Identification of reliable biomarkers for disease remains an important yet challenging area of research given the heterogeneity of disease presentation and pathophysiology. A review of the literature by the authors revealed a handful of original investigations that revealed promising biomarkers within various physiologic processes or organ systems including immunity, inflammation, neural pathways, urothelial integrity, and anesthetic bladder capacity. Although no perfect biomarker has yet been identified for IC/BPS, research in this area has greatly expanded our understanding of disease.

### A review of the etiopathology of phenotypes in interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^114YLWux]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

The aim of this manuscript was to provide a narrative review of the etiopathology of three different interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) phenotypes: Hunner lesion, widespread pain, and low bladder capacity.

Methods

IC/BPS literature was reviewed by the authors specific to the three phenotypes, focusing on etiopathology. Evidence was condensed and summarized on the different causes of each phenotype, emphasizing papers and abstracts dealing with basic science research, symptoms, and treatment options for patients afflicted with the three different IC/BPS phenotypes.

Results

Hunner lesion patients are marked by a distinct, visible inflammatory lesion in the bladder, inflammatory serum and urinary biomarkers, and respond well to bladder-centric treatments targeted specifically at the Hunner lesions. Widespread pain patients have diffuse pain attributed to central nervous system changes manifesting in the bladder, often with co-occurring non-bladder chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia and seem to respond better to systemic therapies. Low bladder capacity patients have a marked decrease in anesthetic bladder capacity during therapeutic hydrodistension of the bladder. They also tend to have higher pain scores, symptoms specifically concentrated at the bladder, and respond to localized treatments, constituting another bladder centric phenotype.

Conclusions

IC/BPS should not be thought to represent one unique type or pathophysiology, but rather a diverse group of patients, each with their own etiopathology and phenotypic manifestations.

Clinical Trial Registration

This was a narrative review and did not involve any direct intervention on patients nor direct patient contact and was not a clinical trial.

Diagnosis — Guideline Statement 1 states that the basic assessment should include a careful history, physical examination, and laboratory examination to document symptoms and signs that characterize IC/BPS and exclude other disorders that could be the cause of the patient's symptoms (Clinical Principle). The clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS requires a careful history, physical examination, and laboratory examination to document basic symptoms and exclude infections and other disorders; the clinical history should include questions about symptom duration, and symptoms should be present for at least six weeks.

### Status of international consensus on interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome / painful bladder syndrome: 2008 snapshot [^1114Wd4c]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2009). Low credibility.

Over the last 6 years there have been ongoing efforts around the world to standardize nomenclature, definition, and evaluation of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome/painful bladder syndrome. The convergence this year of several new projects stimulated an effort to bring together thought leaders from around the world to give a snapshot of current thinking with regard to this disorder. The Society for Urodynamics and Female Urology brought together thought leaders from Europe, Asia, and the United States to Miami, and a broad, structured discussion ensued which is the subject of this report. The most appropriate name of the disease remains an area of contention. A final "definition" of BPS/IC did garner substantial agreement among participants: An unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than 6 weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes. It seems that the world is moving to a presumptive diagnosis based on history and physical examination, and relying on invasive procedures for more complex cases, although this is by no means a universal opinion, being more prevalent in the United States and Asia than in Europe. It is hoped that the conference proceedings can serve as a basis for future efforts to develop formal definitions, guidelines, and best practice policies to further advancement of the field.

Management approach — The published literature regarding the typical course of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is conflicting, with some studies suggesting that IC/BPS is a chronic condition with a waxing and waning course with, on average, little improvement over time while other studies suggest that most patients seem to improve over time. It is clear, however, that there is a limited understanding of IC/BPS pathophysiology and that most treatments are targeted at symptom control.

### Exploring promising biomarkers based on pathogenic mechanisms in interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^113oH2Nn]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), characterized by bladder discomfort and lower urinary tract symptoms, is often either overtreated or undertreated owing to the complexity and variability of symptoms and the lack of reliable diagnostic tools, leading to reduced quality of life and prolonged illness. The pathophysiology of IC/BPS remains unclear, with multiple hypotheses - such as autoimmune inflammation, oxidative stress and urothelial dysfunction - offering potential explanations. Consequently, a diverse range of urinary biomarkers has emerged, although their diagnostic reliability remains inconsistent. As technology advances, biomarkers are increasingly shifting towards multiplex assays, encompassing genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and cell-based methods; however, cutting-edge research and clinical validation are not yet integrated into the limited diagnostic tools available. Clinical phenotypes from the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain Research Network studies provide multi-level biomarker research - including molecular, imaging and other modalities - to support the diagnosis of IC/BPS. Integrating these observations will advance the development of precision medicine for the diagnosis of IC/BPS, thereby improving management of this complex condition.

### Interstitial cystitis: current issues and controversies in diagnosis [^115Sx5pW]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Current tests for the diagnosis of interstitial cystitis (IC) are reviewed, including clinical assessment, urodynamic testing, cystoscopy, bladder biopsy, and urinary markers. A MEDLINE search was performed of all studies dealing with the diagnosis of IC. These studies were critically reviewed with the goal of arriving at a utilitarian approach to IC diagnosis. IC is being diagnosed with increasing frequency. However, the diagnostic criteria are nonuniform and there is significant overlap between chronic pelvic pain syndromes in men and women and IC. Diagnosis of IC can be made clinically and by cystoscopy and hydrodistention. The sensitivity and specificity of urinary markers have not been prospectively studied. Individual practitioners continue to use the various diagnostic tests. There is a clear need for uniform diagnostic criteria for clinical diagnosis as well as epidemiologic and research studies.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112mptCM]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) definition — The bladder disease complex "includes a large group of patients with bladder and/or urethral and/or pelvic pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, and sterile urine cultures", and "IC/BPS comprises a part of this complex". The Panel used the Society for Urodynamics and Female Urology (SUFU) definition: "An unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than six weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes". This definition "was selected because it allows treatment to begin after a relatively short symptomatic period", avoiding withholding associated with longer durations "(i.e., six months)", and "Definitions used in research or clinical trials should be avoided in clinical practice; many patients may be misdiagnosed or have delays in diagnosis and treatment if these criteria are employed".

### Re-imagining interstitial cystitis [^1135q6Y7]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Since the postulation of an "antiproliferative factor" in 1998 and a description, six years later, of this putative central protein in the etiologic pathway of the painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis, there have been no dramatic breakthroughs in the field. Although much potentially exciting work is in progress with regard to epidemiology, etiology, and clinical treatment, many clinicians and researchers have used this hiatus to take another look at what exactly is being studied and how the syndrome should be approached. This article explores some of the current "hot-button" issues of definition and nomenclature that have formed the basis of many international meetings in the last 5 years.

### Diagnostic criteria, classification, and nomenclature for painful bladder syndrome / interstitial cystitis: an ESSIC proposal [^115iUGai]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Because the term "interstitial cystitis" (IC) has different meanings in different centers and different parts of the world, the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis (ESSIC) has worked to create a consensus on definitions, diagnosis, and classification in an attempt to overcome the lack of international agreement on various aspects of IC.

Methods

ESSIC has discussed definitions, diagnostic criteria, and disease classification in four meetings and extended e-mail correspondence.

Results

It was agreed to name the disease bladder pain syndrome (BPS). BPS would be diagnosed on the basis of chronic pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder accompanied by at least one other urinary symptom such as persistent urge to void or urinary frequency. Confusable diseases as the cause of the symptoms must be excluded. Classification of BPS types might be performed according to findings at cystoscopy with hydrodistention and morphologic findings in bladder biopsies. The presence of other organ symptoms as well as cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and sexual symptoms, should be addressed.

Conclusions

The name IC has become misleading and is replaced by BPS. This name is in line with recent nomenclature recommendations by the European Association of Urology and is based on the axial structure of the International Association for the Study of Pain classification. To facilitate the change of the name, ESSIC agreed to include IC in the overall term (BPS/IC) during this transition period.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^113sFbae]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome — Guideline Statement 8 (Clinical Principle) directs that the IC/BPS diagnosis should be reconsidered if no improvement occurs after multiple treatment approaches, and if usual therapies provide no improvement, the clinician should revisit the diagnosis and consider whether an unidentified disorder is producing symptoms, which may require additional diagnostic workup and/or referral to appropriate specialists.

### The role of biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: what does current evidence reveal? [^111u9HGi]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This narrative expert review aims to elucidate the role of biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), highlighting their potential to enhance patient care by enabling more precise and individualized therapeutic strategies.

Methods and Results

We performed a comprehensive review of literature focused on biomarkers relevant to IC/BPS, including bladder capacity, symptom intensity, bladder wall thickness, as well as serum and urinary inflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and urothelial and extracellular matrix remodeling. Evidence indicates that biomarkers such as TNF-α, IL-8, and bladder capacity can differentiate between Hunner lesion and non-Hunner lesion IC subtypes, predict treatment responses, and guide effective interventions. Furthermore, advanced statistical methods and machine learning applications show promise in improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcome predictions through clustering of the biomarker data.

Conclusions

Reliable biomarkers are vital for improving diagnostic precision and tailoring therapies for IC/BPS patients. Ongoing research and validation of these biomarkers are essential for advancing understanding, guiding treatment decisions, and enhancing the quality of life for individuals affected by this complex syndrome. The need for integrated biomarker profiles and multipronged research approaches is crucial for the future of IC/BPS management.

### Interstitial cystitis: a chronic visceral pain syndrome [^111mmZ8f]. Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis (IC) has remained an unresolved problem in clinical urology. The etiology and pathophysiologic mechanisms of IC are still undetermined, and to date the diagnosis is based on the clinical characteristics of the disease and the exclusion of other diseases and pathology that can mimic the symptoms of IC. In clinical practice, much emphasis has been placed on finding a specific etiology and specific pathologic markers for the disease and on identifying specific events that precipitate IC; however, those have not been identified with certainty. In this review, an additional approach is proposed, taking into account the observation that IC shares many features with other chronic nonmalignant visceral pain syndromes. This approach is based on the conceptualization of 3 hypotheses: (1) a spectrum of different insults can lead to chronic visceral pain in patients with IC; (2) different underlying pathogenic pain mechanisms may require different pain treatment strategies for patients diagnosed with IC; and (3) multiple different pathogenic pain mechanisms may coexist in the same patient requiring several different pain treatment strategies (perhaps concomitantly) to successfully treat chronic visceral pain associated with IC. This concept is likely to lead to new insights into the pathophysiologic mechanisms of IC and to novel treatment avenues for patients with IC and-in a broader view-also for patients with other chronic visceral pain syndromes.

### Pathophysiology and potential multimodal therapeutic strategies for IC / BPS [^112icKp6]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2025). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a bladder disorder with no definite aetiology and currently no effective treatment. Its clinical symptoms vary widely, and the bladder condition and extra-bladder dysfunction also show different clinical presentations. This condition is considered to have multiple factors affecting the bladder and clinical symptoms, including urothelial dysfunction, mast cell activation, autoimmune response, neurogenic inflammation, viral or bacterial infection, autonomic nervous dysfunction and central nervous sensitization. Several non-pharmacological, medical, intravesical and novel bladder therapies have been advocated, but the efficacy and durability of these treatments have not been well elucidated. Multimodal therapy has been suggested based on possible pathological mechanisms; however, the most appropriate therapeutic strategy for this disorder has not been well defined. Thus, a rational algorithm for concomitant multimodal therapy for IC/BPS has been proposed.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112Uwr2E]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

American Urological Association interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) guideline — executive summary outlines purpose and evidence methods, stating it was Published 2011; Amended 2014; Amended 2022, and that a MEDLINE® database systematic review with search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09 yielded an evidence base of 86 peer-reviewed publications relevant to IC/BPS. An additional review was conducted in July 2013, and the 2013 review identified an additional 31 articles relevant to treatment. An update literature review in 2022 with search dates 06/2013–01/2021 identified 63 studies, 53 of which were added to the evidence base. When sufficient evidence existed, treatments were assigned strength ratings of A (high), B (moderate), or C (low), and when evidence was insufficient, additional treatment information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion. The purpose is to provide direction to clinicians and patients on recognizing IC/BPS, conducting a valid diagnostic process, and approaching treatment with goals of maximizing symptom control and patient quality of life while minimizing adverse events and patient burden.

### Interstitial cystitis: epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation [^112xKQbr]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis, or painful bladder syndrome, can present with lower abdominal pain/discomfort and dyspareunia, and pain in any distribution of lower spinal nerves. Patients with this condition experience some additional symptoms referable to the bladder, such as frequency, urgency, or nocturia. It can occur across all age groups, although the specific additional symptoms can vary in prevalence depending on patient age. It should be considered in patients who have other chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, irritable bowel, and vulvodynia. The cause is still largely not understood, although there are several postulated mechanisms.

### Latest insights into the pathophysiology of bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis [^1163agpw]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (BPS/IC) is a common medical problem in both sexes affecting people of all ages. Patients might report overactive bladder symptoms with additional bladder pain at maximum bladder filling, during and after micturition. This review aims to highlight pathophysiological mechanisms associated with this disease.

Recent Findings

Latest literature exposes different pathophysiological mechanisms such as impaired urothelial barrier function, alteration of urothelial factors and cytokines, chronic inflammation, vascular lesions, neurogenic inflammation and processes in the central nervous system leading to central sensitization. According to the involved mechanisms, BPS/IC may be arranged in clusters according to the clinical phenotype thus helping in clinical decision-making and treatment. Moreover, patients with BPS/IC suffer from other comorbidities such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pain and functional syndromes and psychosomatic diseases making the management challenging for medical professionals.

Summary

Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis is a complex heterogeneous medical condition involving different pathomechanisms leading to bladder pain and dysfunction, consequently, impairing quality-of-life in affected individuals. However, these mechanisms are still not fully understood, so that patient treatments often remain unsatisfactory. For this reason, continuing research is important to understand the underlying pathomechanisms to discover biomarkers and treatment targets eventually improving diagnostic and therapeutic measures of BPS/IC.

### Interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome: appropriate diagnosis and management [^113Xap69]. Journal of Women's Health (2007). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is characterized by urinary frequency, urgency, and pelvic pain in the absence of any other identifiable pathology. Initial identification of IC/PBS is challenging, as patients may have a range of symptoms that overlap with other disorders, including urinary tract infection (UTI). These patients may be treated empirically with antibiotics; however, many patients with such symptoms are actually culture negative and are later diagnosed with IC/PBS. This review describes the importance of recognizing the symptom overlap between IC/PBS and UTI and focuses on approaches to the diagnosis and management of IC/PBS. Physicians can improve patient care by considering IC/PBS early in the differential diagnosis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^116VzqKx]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome — recognition and research needs include that IC has only been recognized as a highly prevalent health problem in the last 20 years, and there is an urgent need for a long-term registry following patients over several decades prospectively to inform the natural course and effective interventions for future trials. Although progress in developing specific IC/BPS treatments has been slow, modulation of visceral nociceptive pathways can occur at peripheral, spinal and supraspinal sites with a wide variety of potential drug targets; compounds that hit several targets might be the best option in the short term, yet there is emerging evidence that a more refined approach may be achievable.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^117BQrMA]. The Journal of Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This guideline provides direction to clinicians and patients regarding how to recognize interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), conduct a valid diagnostic process, and approach treatment with the goals of maximizing symptom control and patient quality of life while minimizing adverse events and patient burden.

Methods

An initial systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE® database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of IC/BPS. The review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. In July 2013, the Guideline underwent an Update Literature Review, a process in which an additional literature search is conducted and a systematic review is produced in order to maintain guideline currency with newly published literature. The 2013 review identified an additional 31 articles relevant to treatment. An Update Literature Review in 2022 (search dates: 06/2013–01/2021) identified 63 studies, 53 of which were added to the evidence base.

Results

In contrast to the prior versions, the 2022 updated Guideline no longer divides treatments into first-line through sixth-line tiers. Instead, treatment is categorized into behavioral/non-pharmacologic, oral medicines, bladder instillations, procedures, and major surgery. This approach reinforces that the clinical approach for IC/BPS needs to be individualized and based on the unique characteristics of each patient. In addition, new statements were written to provide guidance on cystoscopy for patients with Hunner lesions, shared decision-making, and potential adverse events from pentosan polysulfate. The supporting text on major surgery also has been completely revised.

Conclusion

IC/BPS is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome. Even though patients present with similar symptoms of bladder/pelvic pain and pressure/discomfort associated with urinary frequency and strong urge to urinate, there are subgroups or phenotypes within IC/BPS. Except for patients with Hunner lesions, initial treatment should typically be nonsurgical. Concurrent, multi-modal therapies may be offered.

### Interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome: what do patients mean by "perceived" bladder pain? [^113vxZba]. Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To report the reasons patients with interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) give for the perception that the bladder is the source of their pain. The perception that the bladder is the source of pain is a necessary criterion for many definitions of IC/PBS.

Methods

Events Preceding Interstitial Cystitis was a case-control study seeking risk factors for IC/PBS. The inclusion criteria for incident cases included "lower abdominal pain" or "bladder pain" and ≥ 2 of the following symptoms: urinary frequency, urgency, and/or nocturia. The patients were systematically followed and at 18 months after the baseline interview were asked an open-ended question about their reasons for perceiving the bladder to be the source of their pain.

Results

Of the 179 patients with current pain, 164 (92%) claimed ≥ 1 bladder or lower urinary tract symptoms caused them to perceive that their pain involved the bladder. Of these, 41% noted a "bladder" location for their pain; 34% noted pain increasing with bladder filling and/or decreasing with bladder emptying; 31% claimed the presence of urgency and/or frequency; 23% described worsened pain during and/or after urination; and 17% mentioned other urinary symptoms. Finally, 8% noted only nonurinary symptoms (4 patients) or "do not know" (11 patients).

Conclusions

No predominant reason was found that patients with IC/PBS gave for suspecting the bladder to be the source of pain. The common reasons included pain location, changes with the urinary cycle, and an association with other urinary symptoms. To clarify the relationship of IC/PBS to other chronic pain syndromes, which often are comorbidities, these features of IC/PBS should be queried.

### AUA guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1126bonT]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

To provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.

Materials and Methods

A systematic review of the literature using the MEDLINE® database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Insufficient evidence-based data were retrieved regarding diagnosis and, therefore, this portion of the Guideline is based on Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion statements. The review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. These publications were used to create the majority of the treatment portion of the Guideline. When sufficient evidence existed, the body of evidence for a particular treatment was assigned a strength rating of A (high), B (moderate) or C (low). Additional treatment information is provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinion when insufficient evidence existed. See text and algorithm for definitions, and detailed diagnostic management, and treatment frameworks.

Results

The evidence-based guideline statements are provided for diagnosis and overall management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome as well as for various treatments. The panel identified first through sixth line treatments as well as developed guideline statements on treatments that should not be offered.

Conclusions

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome is best identified and managed through use of a logical algorithm such as is presented in this Guideline. In the algorithm the panel identifies an overall management strategy for the interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome patient. Diagnosis and treatment methodologies can be expected to change as the evidence base grows in the future.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^117PYpDe]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Diagnosis — the diagnostic approach notes that the diagnosis of IC/BPS can be challenging because patients present with a wide spectrum of symptoms, physical exam findings, and clinical test responses, causing significant misdiagnosis, underdiagnosis, and delayed diagnosis. Insufficient literature was identified to constitute an evidence base for diagnosis of IC/BPS in clinical practice, and the NIDDK diagnostic criteria are not appropriate for use outside of clinical trials. Therefore, this Diagnosis section is based on Clinical Principles or Expert Opinion with consensus achieved using a modified Delphi technique when differences of opinion emerged.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis in adolescents [^116uSNzy]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis (IC), or painful bladder syndrome, is characterized by irritative voiding symptoms and can be a challenging problem that affects children and adolescents. Diagnosis and management in children and adolescents is challenging because of strict diagnostic criteria and the paucity of investigations focusing on this age group, which often can lead to delayed or missed diagnosis. Clinical features suggestive of IC include bladder pain, urgency, frequency, nocturia, and pressure. Symptoms may wax and wane and often are exacerbated by menstruation, intercourse, dietary triggers, and stress. Diagnosis can be made by history, physical exam findings such as suprapubic tenderness, voiding diaries, and exclusion of other etiologies. Some diagnostic tests such as the potassium sensitivity test and cystoscopy are invasive and often impractical in younger patients. Treatment of IC consists of a multimodal approach that should be tailored to the individual needs of the patient. Therapies for younger patients include oral medication, intravesical therapy, cystoscopy with hydrodistention, and conservative measures such as dietary modification. This review of the literature focuses on diagnosing IC in younger patients and on what treatment modalities are appropriate and effective for this age group.

### Immunotherapy options for painful bladder syndrome: what's the potential? [^113jW3f1]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) is an enigmatic disease characterized by lack of evidence-based knowledge and an ongoing scientific debate regarding its definition, pathogenesis, diagnostic and treatment algorithm. An autoimmune theory for PBS/IC etiology has suggested immunotherapy as a potential treatment choice. Areas covered: In this review, the authors report existing and future immunotherapeutic options, potentially valuable to the management of PBS/IC while evidence for the immunological aspect of PBS/IC pathogenesis are also presented. Relevant data reported in human clinical studies but also in experimental studies using animal PBS/IC models have been reviewed. Expert opinion: Promising data has emerged lately regarding use of immunotherapy drugs for PBS/IC treatment. Specifically, human monoclonal antibodies inhibiting nerve growth factor and tumor necrosis factor-a have shown high efficacy in pain control for PBS/IC. Also, many other agents modulating immunopathways linked to PBS symptom etiology and leading to positive treatment effects have been reported lately mainly in experimental animal studies. Immunotherapy could potentially improve disease-related and patient-reported outcome; nevertheless, lack of consensus regarding PBS/IC diagnostic criteria, leading to high heterogeneity of patients enrolled in PBS/IC treatment studies, and low number of well-designed randomized clinical trials are limitations which must be addressed in the future.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / painful bladder syndrome: a review [^114K2LTG]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a chronic bladder disorder characterized by pelvic pain and irritative voiding symptoms. The symptoms of IC/PBS can overlap with such conditions as endometriosis, recurrent urinary tract infection, chronic pelvic pain, overactive bladder, and vulvodynia. The etiology of IC/PBS is likely multifactorial and may involve a defective urothelium, neurogenic upregulation, and mast cell activation. A thorough patient history and physical examination are critical in the differential diagnosis of IC/PBS. Frequent follow-up and patient education are important components of treatment once a condition is diagnosed. A multimodal approach to therapy can provide optimal relief for patients with IC/PBS.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: AUA guideline amendment [^113cePew]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this amendment is to provide an updated clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome based upon data received since the publication of original guideline in 2011.

Materials and Methods

A systematic literature review using the MEDLINE(®) database (search dates 1/1/83–7/22/09) was conducted to identify peer-reviewed publications relevant to the diagnosis and treatment of IC/BPS. This initial review yielded an evidence base of 86 treatment articles after application of inclusion/exclusion criteria. The AUA update literature review process, in which an additional systematic review is conducted periodically to maintain guideline currency with newly published relevant literature, was conducted in July 2013. This review identified an additional 31 articles, which were added to the evidence base of this Guideline.

Results

Newly incorporated literature describing the treatment of IC/BPS was integrated into the Guideline with additional treatment information provided as Clinical Principles and Expert Opinions when insufficient evidence existed. The diagnostic portion of the Guideline remains unchanged from the original publication and is still based on Expert Opinions and Clinical Principles.

Conclusions

The management of IC/BPS continues to evolve as can be seen by an expanding literature on the topic. This document constitutes a clinical strategy and is not intended to be interpreted rigidly. The most effective approach for a particular patient is best determined by the individual clinician and patient. As the science relevant to IC/BPS evolves and improves, the strategies presented will require amendment to remain consistent with the highest standards of care.

Regarding patient education for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to general counseling, AUA 2022 guidelines recommend to educate patients with IC/BPS regarding:

- normal bladder function

- what is known and not known about IC/BPS

- relative risks and benefits of available treatments

- the fact that no single treatment has been found effective for the majority of patients

- the fact that acceptable symptom control may require trials of multiple therapeutic options, including combination therapy.

### Excluding confusable diseases in patients with presumptive diagnosis of interstitial cystitis: a large patient cohort study [^116neq5u]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic pelvic pain or discomfort associated with the urinary bladder that severely affects the quality of life of patients. It is often accompanied by lower urinary tract symptoms, such as daytime frequency, nocturia, and urgency. During the diagnostic process, confusable diseases must be excluded as the cause of symptoms. IC is diagnosed based on the exclusion criteria. Exclusion diagnoses included malignancies and infections, including urinary tuberculosis.

There is no single optimal test for diagnosing IC. The most important test in the diagnostic process of IC is cystoscopy, to identify Hunner lesions. The classic description of Hunner lesion is "a reddened area with blood vessels radiating toward a central scar". However, the extent, location, and appearance of Hunner lesions vary from person to person, leading to no objective, standardized criteria for Hunner lesions. Therefore, correct cystoscopic detection of lesions is challenging, especially in medical institutions where patients with IC are not commonly encountered. Additionally, there is currently no universally recognized biomarker for diagnosing IC. Therefore, it is challenging to diagnose IC accurately. As a result, IC is often misdiagnosed as other diseases, such as malignancy, or overactive bladder.

To our knowledge, observational studies over a long period regarding the exclusion of confusable conditions are scarce. Here, we aimed to analyze the results of excluding confusable diseases in a patient population with presumptive IC experience over the last 15 years in actual clinical settings.

### The urothelial barrier in interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: its form and function, an overview of preclinical models [^111hmkhw]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (IC/BPS) is a well known nonbacterial inflammatory condition of the bladder. The causes of IC/BPS remain speculative, but there are similarities with other inflammatory bladder conditions, such as eosinophilic cystitis, ketamine induced cystitis and post radiation cystitis. IC/BPS and these conditions share chronic inflammatory changes in the lamina propria, including acute hemorrhage, immune cell invasion, erosion, granulation tissue formation and abnormal vascularization. They also present similar clinical symptoms as well, such as hematuria, pain, urgency, and frequency. In all these diseases, the urothelium and its barrier structures are compromised and underlaying layers are inflamed. The loss of the urothelial barrier is considered a key factor in the development of IC/BPS.

Multiple in vivo and in vitro research models have been used to explore the above-mentioned theory. However, investigating IC/BPS preclinically poses challenges due to the unclear cause of the disease, leading to unfocussed and sometimes conflicting research findings. Additionally, various research models have been used to mimic the urothelial barrier closely and replicate the disease, further complicating the research landscape. Understanding the composition and function of the urothelium is crucial for selecting appropriate research models for IC/BPS.

In response to these difficulties, this article aims to review preclinical research related to the urothelial barrier in the context of IC/BPS, focusing on cell biology, particularly the glycosaminoglycan-layer (GAG-layer), and various in vivo and in vitro models.

### The urothelial barrier in interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: its form and function, an overview of preclinical models [^115dGgs4]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, various models to compromise the urothelial barrier have been conducted and have demonstrated similar characteristics to the histopathological findings in IC/BPS biopsies. In vitro studies, along with in vivo studies, provide opportunities to identify the involvement of specific molecules and pathologic pathways in IC/BPS that may help us better stratify this heterogenous group of patients. Further research is warranted to elucidate the primary or secondary role of permeability, together with inflammatory and neurogenic causes of the disease.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) guideline — systematic review methods: Literature searches of English-language MEDLINE spanned January 1, 1983 to July 22, 2009, with an American Urological Association (AUA) update in July 2013 identifying an additional 31 articles, and a 2022 update (search dates: 06/2013–01/2021) identifying 63 studies, 53 of which were added to the evidence base. The review eliminated preclinical, pediatric, commentary, and editorial reports and excluded studies using treatments not available in the US, herbal or supplement treatments, or outcomes collapsed across multiple interventions; mixed patient groups were retained only when more than 50% were IC/BPS patients. Because individual study sample sizes were small, single studies were not deemed sufficient for a Standard, Recommendation, or Option, but were used to support Clinical Principles.

### Current updates relating to treatment for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115LDNBu]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

A constellation of incapacitating systems, which encompass discomfort in the suprapubic region, nocturia and micturition frequency and urgency, are characteristic of interstitial cystitis (IC), a condition also referred to as bladder pain syndrome (BPS). Typically, such symptoms occur when the bladder is full, and dissipate once urine has been passed. In addition to these symptoms, a major complaint of patients suffering from IC is pelvic pain, which originates from the urethra, vagina or rectum, amongst other viscera. There is at present no standard definition for this condition, nor consensus regarding its management, recommended therapy or the treatment period required.

A range of drugs directed towards the treatment of IC have been the topic of recent debate, although the largest percentage of patients cured of the condition remains in the region of 60%. It has been demonstrated that numerous factors are involved in the pathogenesis of IC. These include autoimmune phenomena, injury to the urothelial glycosaminoglycan layer, neurological discomfort and inflammatory processes.

Despite the publication of several meta-analyses as well as a network meta-analysis (NMA), these have not provided a comprehensive review of therapeutic strategies. The lack of clarity regarding the efficacy of certain therapies in helping individuals with IC, owing to the low or very low degrees of supportive evidence, was expressed in a recent Cochrane review. Although the results of numerous studies can be accessed, the majority only included small populations and so the outcomes of therapy could not be accurately evaluated. The same issue applied to a further NMA, and so the results were not apposite for the current work. Thus, studies with higher sample numbers and which are specifically targeted towards this condition are required to enhance the present quality of evidence. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been added by the current authors to the literature, and they have concurrently carried out a traditional pairwise meta-analysis and an NMA to offer more evidence-based conclusions.

There are numerous types of therapy available for IC, some of which are extremely complicated, and so as well as carrying out an NMA, a general meta-analysis by effect variables has also been performed. Additionally, meta-regression analysis was applied to ascertain the moderator effect. The study is underpinned by the hypothesis that a high level of therapeutic success can be achieved in patients with IC using a combination of approaches; this theory could subsequently be tested in RCTs.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome (IC / BPS) diagnosis: current limitations and a pragmatic clinical diagnostic definition [^112cy9EG]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To develop a consensus on diagnostic criteria for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS).

Materials and Methods

A subcommittee was identified based on expertise in IC/BPS diagnostic criteria. An outline was generated and iteratively modified until it was found to be acceptable by subcommittee members as the basis for manuscript generation. The manuscript was presented and revised in two iterations according to feedback from international key opinion leaders at the Global Consensus on IC/BPS and the AUA Annual Meeting, respectively.

Results

The patient history and physical examination are necessary components in the diagnosis of IC/BPS. Urinalysis and urine culture are necessary laboratory tests to rule out exclusionary conditions including active infection. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) criteria, which were established in 1988 for research purposes, pose several limitations and result in the exclusion of a large proportion of IC/BPS patients when applied clinically. Thus, we put forth a pragmatic and streamlined definition that is aligned with existing clinical guidance and standard diagnostic workup.

Conclusions

The clinical diagnosis of IC/BPS is based on history, physical examination, and urine studies. IC/BPS is clinically defined as an unpleasant sensation (e.g. pain, discomfort, pressure, burning) that worsens with bladder filling and improves with bladder emptying, of 3 or more months duration, in the absence of exclusionary diagnoses that would likely account for the symptomatology. A substantial number of IC/BPS patients have comorbid pelvic disorders (e.g., pelvic floor dysfunction, vulvodynia, endometriosis) which require separate treatment.

Trial Registration

This study is not a clinical trial and thus does not warrant registration as such.

### Epigenetic reprogramming: a possible etiological factor in bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis? [^115Sd96V]. The Journal of Urology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose

The etiology of bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis is poorly understood. The possibility that epigenetic reprogramming may have a role is discussed.

Materials and Methods

A literature search was performed with the Entrez-PubMed(R) database using the key words urinary bladder, epigenetics, epigenetic mechanisms, interstitial cystitis, diagnosis, etiology, urothelial cells, mast cells, nerve fibers, nerves, nerve growth factor, recurrent injury, stem cells, inflammatory mediators and demethylases.

Results

The uroepithelium is intimately associated with the nervous system. Sensory input at the apical surface of umbrella cells regulates bladder function via a transmural signaling pathway. When umbrella cells are shed in response to noxious stimuli, stem cells in the basal layer become exposed. The polycomb group genes are key in the maintenance of adult stem cells. The polycomb group genes mediate gene silencing and repress transdifferentiation by methylating lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3). Jmjd3, an enzyme demethylating H3K27me3, antagonizes polycomb group genes mediated silencing. Inflammatory stimuli are strong inducers of Jmjd3 and may reverse gene silencing in stem cells, modifying the differentiation pattern. Epigenetic processes involving H3K27 methylation are multistable processes. Transient signaling, eg by lipopolysaccharide, triggers epigenetic reprogramming and establishes one of the alternative regulatory states. Once established such states can be maintained and propagated even in the absence of the initial signal.

Conclusions

We postulate that similar epigenetic reprogramming mechanisms in the bladder may provide an explanation for uroepithelial, mast cells and nerve cell abnormalities in bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis, as well as propagation of this altered state in the absence of the signal that may have triggered it. It also provides a new experimental paradigm for exploring the etiology of bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis. Data supporting this hypothesis would provide a rationale for new diagnostic as well as treatment options for bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^111zGemF]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and differential diagnosis in suspected interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) should prioritize exclusion of overlapping conditions, as disorders such as bacterial cystitis, urinary calculi, vaginitis, carcinoma in situ of the bladder, and chronic bacterial prostatitis must be systematically excluded, and the role of other tests has poor specificity for IC/BPS. Clinicians should weigh test risks and benefits; urodynamic evaluation can identify bladder outlet obstruction or detrusor overactivity, but sensory urgency at low bladder volumes with or without detrusor overactivity is not specific for IC/BPS. In general, additional tests should be undertaken only if findings will alter the treatment approach.

### Variations in bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis (IC) definitions, pathogenesis, diagnostics and treatment: a systematic review and evaluation of national and international guidelines [^114MEdFJ]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

Interstitial cystitis (IC) and bladder pain syndrome (BPS) are challenging and encompassing hypersensitivity disorders of the lower urinary tract. A variety of national and international guidelines have been published including guidance on nomenclature, definitions, etiopathology, diagnostics and treatment. A lack of universally established clinical guidance is apparent. The aim of this review is to evaluate key guidelines on this area of practice, identify variations, compare their recommendations and grade them using AGREE II.

Methods

Literature searches were performed using the PUBMED and CINAHL database from January 1, 1983, to December 1, 2018, referring to the search strategy of AUA. Ten national and international guidelines were included into the analysis. We assessed the guidelines with the updated AGREE II.

Results

Symptoms congruent in all guidelines are: pain, pressure, discomfort and frequency, urgency and nocturia. Urinalysis is a prerequisite for diagnostics, cystoscopy for most and urodynamics not part of the routine assessment. Treatment options are recommended stepwise. The highest level of evidence and consensus was identified for oral therapies. Nine guidelines had an overall quality score ≥ 50% and three scored ≥ 70% (AUA, GG, RCOG).

Conclusions

The guidelines are congruent in symptom reporting, quite congruent in diagnostics and vary to a high degree on treatment recommendations. The complexity of BPS and emerging evidence indicate the need for regular updating of the guidelines and a wider consensus.

### Mechanisms of oxidative stress in interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1117TFLN]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2024). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is characterized by bladder and/or pelvic pain, increased urinary urgency and frequency and nocturia. The pathophysiology of IC/BPS is poorly understood, and theories include chronic inflammation, autoimmune dysregulation, bacterial cystitis, urothelial dysfunction, deficiency of the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) barrier and urine cytotoxicity. Multiple treatment options exist, including behavioural interventions, oral medications, intravesical instillations and procedures such as hydrodistension; however, many clinical trials fail, and patients experience an unsatisfactory treatment response, likely owing to IC/BPS phenotype heterogeneity and the use of non-targeted interventions. Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of IC/BPS as reactive oxygen species impair bladder function via their involvement in multiple molecular mechanisms. Kinase signalling pathways, nociceptive receptors, mast-cell activation, urothelial dysregulation and circadian rhythm disturbance have all been linked to reactive oxygen species and IC/BPS. However, further research is necessary to fully uncover the role of oxidative stress in the pathways driving IC/BPS pathogenesis. The development of new models in which these pathways can be manipulated will aid this research and enable further investigation of promising therapeutic targets.

### The mast cell in interstitial cystitis: role in pathophysiology and pathogenesis [^111HyGdM]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Current evidence from clinical and laboratory studies confirms that mast cells play a central role in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of interstitial cystitis (IC). In this article, we focus on the role of the mast cell in IC and examine the ways in which mast cells and other pathophysiologic mechanisms are interrelated in this disease. Identifying the patients with IC who have mast cell proliferation and activation will enable us to address this aspect of disease pathophysiology in these individuals with targeted pharmacotherapy to inhibit mast cell activation and mediator release.

### In vivo models of interstitial cystitis [^114Bx4rV]. The Journal of Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

We systematically identified and evaluated various animal models that have been studied to help identify the underlying mechanisms of and possible treatment options for interstitial cystitis.

Materials and Methods

Models of interstitial cystitis published between 1983 and 2001 were obtained by searching MEDLINE and other Internet databases using cystitis and model as the primary key words. Models with characteristics of interstitial cystitis similar to those defined by National Institutes of Arthritis, Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases criteria were reviewed. Some articles describing animal models with similar pathological conditions in other organs were also included to enlarge the base of potentially relevant material.

Results

We identified and evaluated some 16 animal models of interstitial cystitis, which we categorized as bladder inflammation induced by intravesical administration of an irritant or immune stimulant, systemic and environmentally induced inflammation, and a naturally occurring model of interstitial cystitis that occurs in cats. Some abnormalities identified in humans and cats with interstitial cystitis can be reproduced in healthy animals using luminal, systemic or environmental stimuli. At the level of the bladder the source of stimulation cannot be discriminated. Variability in the extent of bladder distention complicated the interpretation of some studies. In addition, the noxious stimuli used can affect many epithelial surfaces as well as the urothelium, suggesting they are nonspecific responses to injury rather than specific to interstitial cystitis.

Conclusions

No model in bladder injury in healthy animals currently reproduces as many features of interstitial cystitis as the naturally occurring disease in cats. While induced models of relative injury may help to provide insight into the bladder response to injury, feline interstitial cystitis follows a similar chronic waxing and waning time course as does interstitial cystitis in humans, which may be more suitable for studying the effects of stressors on the severity of clinical signs as well as newly proposed therapies.

### The historical origins of interstitial cystitis [^115xXkdB]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We identify early descriptions of interstitial cystitis and trace its evolution as a clinical entity during the 19th century.

Materials and Methods

Primary and secondary source documents relating to interstitial cystitis, bladder inflammation and bladder stones were reviewed.

Results

What is believed to be the earliest published record of interstitial cystitis appeared in an 1836 textbook by the Philadelphia surgeon Joseph Parrish, who documented a syndrome of chronic frequency, urgency, dysuria and pelvic pain he called "tic doloureux of the bladder". Tic doloureux was a contemporaneous diagnosis used to describe painful, idiopathic disorders of nerves. Parrish attributed this term to his mentor, Dr. Phillip Syng Physick, who applied it to patients with severe lower urinary tract symptoms with no discernible etiology, with the most common etiology during the 19th century being bladder stones. A review of archival material from the Philadelphia College of Physicians indicates that by 1808 Physick had developed a concept of bladder inflammation, a "bladder ulcer", that produced lower urinary tract symptoms in the absence of bladder stone.

Conclusions

By 1808 Philip Syng Physick had described an inflammatory condition of the bladder producing the same lower urinary tract symptoms as a bladder stone. By 1836 he had expanded this concept to include a chronic frequency, urgency and pain syndrome occurring in the absence of demonstrable etiology. We propose that these are the earliest known descriptions of bladder inflammation and interstitial cystitis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^115TMSpw]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Behavioral and non-pharmacologic treatments for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) — patients should be educated about normal bladder function, what is known and not known about IC/ BPS, the benefits versus risks/burdens of available treatment alternatives, the fact that no single treatment has been found effective for the majority of patients, and that acceptable symptom control may require trials of multiple therapeutic options (including combination therapy) before it is achieved (Clinical Principle). Self-care practices and behavioral modifications that can improve symptoms should be discussed and implemented as feasible (Clinical Principle). Patients should be encouraged to implement stress management practices to improve coping techniques and manage stress-induced symptom exacerbations (Clinical Principle).

### The urothelial barrier in interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: its form and function, an overview of preclinical models [^111gFmyC]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Investigating bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis (IC/BPS) preclinically is challenging. Various research models have been used to mimic the urothelial barrier closely and replicate the disease. The aim of this review is to discuss preclinical research related to the urothelial barrier in context of IC/BPS.

Recent Findings

In vivo models mimic IC/BPS mainly with toxic substances in the urine, with protaminesulfate and proteoglycan deglycolysation resembling a temporary impaired barrier as seen in IC/BPS. This temporary increased permeability has also been found in vitro models. Glycosaminoglycan replenishment therapy has been described, in vivo and in vitro, to protect and enhance recover properties of the urothelium. The roles of immune and neurogenic factors in the pathogenesis of IC/BPS remains relatively understudied.

Summary

Preclinical studies provide opportunities to identify the involvement of specific pathologic pathways in IC/BPS. For further research is warranted to elucidate the primary or secondary role of permeability, together with inflammatory and neurogenic causes of the disease.

Management approach for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) — treatment decisions should be made after shared decision-making, with the patient informed of the risks, potential benefits, and alternatives, and except for patients with Hunner lesions, initial treatment should typically be nonsurgical (Expert Opinion). Efficacy of treatment should be periodically reassessed, and ineffective treatments should be stopped (Clinical Principle). Multimodal pain management approaches should be initiated, pain management should be continually assessed for effectiveness, and if inadequate, consideration should be given to a multidisciplinary approach and the patient referred appropriately (Clinical Principle). The IC/BPS diagnosis should be reconsidered if no improvement occurs after multiple treatment approaches (Clinical Principle).

### Diagnostic criteria, classification, and nomenclature for painful bladder syndrome / interstitial cystitis: an ESSIC proposal [^1149y9Nx]. European Urology (2008). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "ESSIC diagnostic criteria for bladder pain syndrome" for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and chronic pelvic pain in women.

The ESSIC diagnostic criteria for bladder pain syndrome, also known as the European Society for the Study of Interstitial Cystitis (ESSIC) criteria, is a clinical calculator used in the diagnosis of bladder pain syndrome (BPS), a chronic bladder condition. This calculator is applicable to patients presenting with persistent or recurrent chronic pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, accompanied by at least one other urinary symptom such as persistent urge to void or frequency.

The clinical utility of the ESSIC diagnostic criteria lies in its ability to standardize the diagnosis of BPS, which can be challenging due to the variability of symptoms and lack of definitive diagnostic tests. It helps clinicians to differentiate BPS from other conditions with similar symptoms, such as urinary tract infections or overactive bladder syndrome.

Exclusion criteria for the use of the ESSIC diagnostic criteria include the presence of any other identifiable causes of the symptoms, such as active urinary tract infection, bladder stones, tumors, tuberculosis of the urinary tract, radiation cystitis, and specific neurological diseases.

The ESSIC diagnostic criteria for bladder pain syndrome integrate information from clinical symptoms, cystoscopy, and biopsy findings to identify and categorize the condition into specific types.

The evaluation process starts with the clinical symptoms that must be present for further assessment:

- Chronic pelvic pain, pressure, or discomfort in the bladder area
- At least one other urinary symptom, such as a persistent urge to void or increased frequency
- Exclusion of alternative causes for these bladder symptoms

If any of these clinical criteria are not met, a diagnosis cannot proceed.

Once these clinical symptoms are confirmed, the next step is to analyze findings from cystoscopy and biopsy:

- Cystoscopy findings may include:

- Not done
- Normal
- Glomerulations, grade II or III
- Hunner's lesions

- Biopsy findings might be:

- Not done
- Normal
- Inconclusive
- Inflammatory infiltrates, granulation tissue, detrusor mastocytosis, or intra-fascicular fibrosis

The possible diagnostic results, based on combinations of these findings, are:

- If neither cystoscopy nor biopsy is performed, the result is "Bladder pain syndrome type XX".
- If cystoscopy is not done, but the biopsy is normal, inconclusive, or has specific abnormal findings, it results in "Bladder pain syndrome type XA", "XB", or "XC", respectively.
- With normal cystoscopy findings, the types align similarly: "1X" for no biopsy, "1A" for normal biopsy, "1B" for inconclusive biopsy, and "1C" for specific abnormalities.
- For cystoscopic findings of glomerulations (grade II or III), the types "2X", "2A", "2B", or "2C" are assigned following similar logic.
- The presence of Hunner's lesions leads to results of "3X", "3A", "3B", or "3C", depending on corresponding biopsy results.

This method meticulously categorizes bladder pain syndrome by ensuring clinical criteria are met and then using specific findings from cystoscopy and biopsy to assign a diagnostic type.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: why a global patient registry is critically needed [^115JZQfg]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this article is to establish expert consensus on the rationale for, and components of, a global patient registry for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Our goal is to highlight what a comprehensive international patient registry can add to the growing body of IC/BPS-focused research and summarize the committee's rationale for inclusion or exclusion of certain patient and diagnostic characteristics to identify sub-groups of patients who will benefit from targeted therapy.

Materials and Methods

An expert working group was formed from members of the Global Consensus on IC/BPS meeting. The working group consisted of four Urologists and a Urogynaecologist, and held a series of meetings in 2025 to achieve consensus on the benefits, hurdles and practical aspects of developing a global registry for IC/BPS. Literature search of the PubMed database was also performed where relevant, and all members agreed on the final proposals.

Results

The framework for an IC/BPS global registry was developed inclusive of male and female patients ages 18 years and older, who have symptoms of pain, pressure or discomfort related to the bladder, along with lower urinary tract symptoms, that have persisted for 3 or more months, in the absence of confusable disorders. A comprehensive list of patient data points including demographic, history-related, and comorbid conditions was developed. Additionally, validated questionnaires were identified for inclusion that assess domains of pain, urinary symptoms and quality of life. Consensus was reached regarding collecting data on prior treatment, cystoscopy findings and biopsy results where applicable. Lastly, importance was placed on patient-reported questionnaire data that can be input longitudinally by patients to lessen the burden of data collection by providers. Technical, legal and financial aspects were addressed as potential barriers.

Conclusions

A global registry for IC/BPS would overcome the limitations of current regional registries by including large numbers of patients from varied geographical locations, allowing for more efficient recruitment of patients for clinical trials. Understanding epidemiological trends and global variation in practice would enable optimization of care and quality improvement worldwide.

### The urothelial barrier in interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: its form and function, an overview of preclinical models [^1143cASD]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

FUTURE RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES INTO MECHANISMS

This review examined the urothelial barrier in IC/BPS, through in vivo and in vitro studies. Numerous papers show loss of the barrier as an important pathophysiological characteristic. Most studies focus on specific disruption of the urothelial barrier, although some studies investigate inflammatory or neurogenic causes as well. These models appear to be interconnected, as disruption of the apical layer triggers: inflammation, increased noxious neural signaling, increased bowel permeability, and loss of the barrier function. Bowel inflammation alone can induce bladder- inflammation and increased permeability through neuroinflammatory crosstalk, which might explain the common occurrence of IC/BPS and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IC/BPS shows clear signs that it is a systemic disease with heavy involvement of the immune system. Transcriptome studies further reinforce this perspective, emphasizing the importance of inflammatory and immune pathways.

However, there is no definite explanation yet for the failure of the normally rapid recovery of the apical layer and normal impermeability in response to injury. Further research is needed to determine whether inflammation or permeability plays primary or secondary roles. In vitro studies, as well as in vivo studies, offer possibilities to identify the involvement of specific molecules in specific subtypes of IC/BPS. In addition to functionality, the influences on cellular level or secondary cascading effects that explain the full pallet of IC/BPS symptoms are given more consideration.

### The role of the urinary epithelium in the pathogenesis of interstitial cystitis / prostatitis / urethritis [^113wJUCj]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

The urothelium plays a pivotal role as a barrier between urine and its solutes and the underlying bladder. Bladder surface mucus is a critical component of this function. The biologic activity of mucus that imparts this barrier function is generated by the highly anionic polysaccharide components (eg, glycosaminoglycans), which are extremely hydrophilic and trap water at the outer layer of the umbrella cell. This trapped water forms a barrier at the critical interface between urine and the bladder. The result is a highly impermeable urothelium that serves as a key protective barrier for the bladder interstitium. In interstitial cystitis (IC), disruption of the urothelial barrier may initiate a cascade of events in the bladder, leading to symptoms and disease. Specifically, epithelial dysfunction leads to the migration of urinary solutes, in particular, potassium, that depolarize nerves and muscles and cause tissue injury. Exogenous heparinoids can restore the barrier function of the urothelium and thus successfully treat patients with IC. Groups of patients who have been given a diagnosis of IC, chronic prostatitis, and urethritis have been shown to have IC by virtue of their shared potassium sensitivity. It would seem, therefore, that mucous deficiency may be present throughout the lower urinary tract. If one is to rename these diseases, perhaps it is best to do so in reference to a shared loss of epithelial barrier function. A name such as lower urinary dysfunctional epithelium would incorporate all of these diseases under a single pathophysiologic process. As a result of these discoveries, a new paradigm for diagnosis and treatment is emerging.

Conclusions

In patients with IC, therapy is not straightforward. The current work has led to the recognition of a therapeutic combination for this condition that could be anticipated to have a positive clinical outcome. It was established that ongoing therapy is of value, and that the efficacy of treatments is diminished in individuals of advancing years. Additional RCTs are required to ascertain the efficacy of combined therapeutic approaches, such as immunomodulatory compounds, intravesical injection or instillation with BTX or HA, or HA and CS and diet modification.

### Intravesical interferon therapy vs hyaluronic acid for pain among female individuals with interstitial cystitis: a randomized clinical trial [^112jDGxL]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a chronic and debilitating condition that can significantly diminish a patient's quality of life, with increased urinary frequency, urgency, and pelvic discomfort or pain, particularly during bladder filling, without any other identifiable pathological findings. The prevalence of IC in the general population varies from 2% to 17.3%, with rates typically higher in female patients. Despite extensive research, the precise pathogenesis and underlying mechanisms of IC remain elusive, leading to challenges in diagnosis and treatment. In some cases, approximately 10% of diagnosed patients resort to invasive surgical procedures, with a 23% risk of failure to improve symptoms, emphasizing the urgent need for a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms.

The possible pathogenesis includes postinfection autoimmune responses, mast cell activation, urothelial dysfunction, neurogenic inflammation, and metabolic disorders. Increasing evidence suggests that Hunner-type IC (HIC) and non-Hunner-type IC (NHIC) are distinct conditions with varying etiologies and pathophysiological mechanism. Urothelial denudation within IC bladders results in reduced production of crucial cell surface protectants. While intravesical hyaluronic acid (HA) instillation could help improve the defective bladder glycosaminoglycan layer, relapse often occurs upon discontinuation, as most retrieved studies were nonrandomized and had scarce numbers, and the long-term follow-up outcomes are limited.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^111jj4Ja]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) — urodynamic evaluation is characterized by the absence of agreed-upon diagnostic criteria, with bladder sensations during cystometric filling that may be normal or markedly abnormal and pain with filling (hypersensitivity) consistent with IC/BPS; most patients will have normal filling pressure and compliance. Detrusor overactivity (DO) is seen in approximately 12–20% of IC/BPS patients, and if the patient also meets the clinical definition criteria for IC/BPS, then it is reasonable to diagnose both conditions. Urodynamic evaluation may provide information regarding concomitant voiding dysfunction, and specific indications that urodynamic evaluation may be useful include suspicion of outlet obstruction in either sex, possibility of poor detrusor contractility, or other conditions that could explain why patients are ultimately refractory to first-line therapy; in general, however, urodynamics are not recommended for routine clinical use to establish an IC/BPS diagnosis.

The urologic chronic pain conditions such as chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome and interstitial cystitis are syndromes whose evaluation and management are controversial. Part of the difficulty in diagnosis and therapy is the heterogeneity of etiologies and symptoms. We propose a six-domain phenotype, which can classify these patients clinically and can direct the selection of therapy in the most evidence based multimodal manner. The domains are urinary, psychosocial, organ specific, infection, neurologic and tenderness of skeletal muscles. This system is flexible and responsive to new biomarkers and therapies as their utility and efficacy are proven.

### Does cystoscopy method affect the investigation of bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis? [^117Kd7Ep]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Bladder pain syndrome is described alongside interstitial cystitis (IC), standardised as BPS/IC. IC alone is a controversial term, it is used for reimbursement in some healthcare systems, but is currently mostly considered synonymous with BPS. There is discussion amongst the scientific community that IC could represent a separate phenotype or subtype under the overall umbrella diagnosis of BPS. The characteristic feature of IC is the finding of a typical bladder lesion as originally described by Hunner in 1915; this is the appearance of patches of red mucosa exhibiting small vessels radiating to a central pale scar. This Hunner's lesion can rupture with increasing bladder distension, demonstrating petechial bleeding or bleeding in a waterfall manner at the margins of the lesion. Following distension, a typical bullous oedema can develop.

The diagnosis of BPS is typically a clinical one. Cystoscopy is recommended to investigate alternative causes of the symptoms such as bladder carcinoma, bladder stones or endometriosis. However, ESSIC and the ICS standardisation working group specifically recommend investigation by cystoscopy to identify Hunner's lesions and further classify BPS/IC. ESSIC describes a standardised method using rigid cystoscopy (RC) with hydrodistension to evaluate patients with BPS/IC. Owing to the anticipated discomfort of the procedure, spinal or general anaesthesia is stipulated. The use of a rigid cystoscope is thought to facilitate adequate biopsy sampling and also allows for coagulation after biopsy. Flexible cystoscopy (FC) in an office setting for the initial assessment of BPS/IC is also practiced. This is reported to be a well-tolerated procedure carried out in an office setting, making it cost effective. Associated cystoscopic findings include petechiae, glomerulations and increased bladder vascularity. These findings can also be observed in women with no history of bladder pain and are therefore alone not diagnostic of BPS/IC.

### Interstitial cystitis: urgency and frequency syndrome [^116Dykcv]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis is a chronic, severely debilitating disease of the urinary bladder. Excessive urgency and frequency of urination, suprapubic pain, dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain and negative urine cultures are characteristic of interstitial cystitis. The course of the disease is usually marked by flare-ups and remissions. Other conditions that should be ruled out include bacterial cystitis, urethritis, neoplasia, vaginitis and vulvar vestibulitis. Interstitial cystitis is diagnosed by cystoscopy and hydrodistention of the bladder. Glomerulations or Hunner's ulcers found at cystoscopy are diagnostic. Oral treatments of interstitial cystitis include pentosan polysulfate, tricyclic antidepressants and antihistamines. Intravesicular therapies include hydrodistention, dimethyl sulfoxide and heparin, or a combination of agents. Referral to a support group should be offered to all patients with interstitial cystitis.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112SN6RN]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Surgical method selection and conclusions for major surgery in interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome emphasize study design limits, expert performance, and patient selection. Essentially all publications on major surgery are retrospective reviews in which choice of operation was based on surgeon and patient-specific factors, and each procedure has advantages and disadvantages. The Panel notes that major surgery should be performed only by surgeons with extensive experience in IC/BPS and dedication to long-term care for the patient. Diligent patient selection, to ensure bladder-centric pain, is the most important factor affecting outcome, and the best-documented predictors of success are presence of Hunner lesions and reduced capacity under anesthesia.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1146S8pH]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome — treatment categories and evidentiary designations state that most treatments are designated as Options, except for physical therapy in the setting of pelvic floor tenderness (Standard) and triamcinolone injection and/or fulguration of Hunner lesions (Recommendation). The designation of Option reflects the Panel's judgment that uncertainty existed for the balance between benefits and risks/burdens, including that most treatments may benefit a subset not readily identifiable pre‑treatment and that no treatment reliably benefits most or all patients; uncertainty also arises when studies suggest efficacy but total exposure is small (e.g., cimetidine), and for oral PPS, several randomized trials were contradictory, supporting an Option designation. Given limited understanding of pathophysiology and the goal to control symptoms to optimize QoL, the Panel judged that treatments are best presented as clinical choices when some efficacy for some patients was demonstrated and the risk of serious harms was acceptable.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome in men [^113kbowA]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

In April 2025, the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine hosted a Global Consensus meeting on interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) in Winston-Salem, NC. The goal of this meeting was to establish attainable targets in phenotyping, diagnosis, and biomarkers for IC/BPS. Our subcommittee focused on developing a consensus document addressing IC/BPS in men.

Methods

Narrative review.

Results

Within this document, we discuss prevalence, clinical characteristics, evaluation/investigation, and treatment of IC/BPS in men. The is limited literature specifically addressing IC/BPS within the male population, as IC/BPS has traditionally been considered a disease of women. Thus, prevalence data varies widely. Diagnosis of IC/BPS in men is fraught with difficulty, as there is much overlap with other chronic pelvic pain syndrome, specifically chronic prostatitis. Key clinical features specific to IC/BPS are pain with bladder filling and relief with voiding. Painful ejaculation may be indicative of pelvic floor dysfunction. Physical exam, including extensive pelvic exam with analysis of pelvic floor tenderness, is critical in correct diagnosis. Ultrasound ± urodynamics may be used to rule out obstructive disease, and urinalysis ± culture must be used to rule out infection. There are no treatments specific to men with IC/BPS.

Conclusions

We have described the prevalence, clinical characteristics, evaluation, and treatment of IC/BPS in men. There is a significant need for more sex-specific research of IC/BPS with consideration for hormonal and anatomical factors that may differentiate the disease in men.

Clinical Trial Registration

No new data were generated for this manuscript; no clinical trial was conducted.

### Neural upregulation in interstitial cystitis [^117SQ9jm]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a syndrome of bladder hypersensitivity with symptoms of urgency, frequency, and chronic pelvic pain. Although no consensus has been reached on the underlying cause of IC, several pathophysiologic mechanisms, including epithelial dysfunction, mast cell activation, and neurogenic inflammation, have been proposed. Despite multiple different causes of urinary cystitis, the bladder's response to cystitis is limited and typical. Animal experiments have shown upregulation of proteinase-activated receptors, tryptase, beta-nerve growth factor, inducible nitric oxide synthase, nuclear transcription factor-kappaB, c-Fos, phosphodiesterase 1C, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase, and proenkephalin B. After the noxious stimulus has abated, downregulation of genes appears to follow. Distention of the bladder results in the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from urothelial cells, which activates purinergic P2X3 receptors. Activation by ATP of P2X3-expressing afferents is a fundamental signaling factor in bladder sensation and appears to play a role in bladder reflexes. Fos proteins present in spinal cord neurons have been shown to be upregulated in animals that have undergone cyclophosphamide-induced chemical cystitis. These and other findings suggest that neural upregulation occurs both peripherally and centrally in subjects with chronic cystitis. It is unclear whether neural mechanisms and inflammation are the cause of IC or the result of other initiating events. Neural upregulation is known to play a role in the chronicity of pain, urgency, and frequency and represents an exciting area of research that may lead to additional treatments and a better understanding of IC.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112MG4rS]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

IC/BPS epidemiology — "Since there is no objective marker to establish the presence of IC/BPS, studies to define its prevalence are difficult to conduct". Population-based work has used three methods: "surveys that ask participants if they have ever been diagnosed with the condition (self-report studies); questionnaires administered to identify the presence of symptoms that are suggestive of IC/BPS (symptom assessments); and, administrative billing data used to identify the number of individuals in a population who have been diagnosed with IC/BPS (clinician diagnosis)", and "the use of different methods yields widely disparate prevalence estimates".

### EAU guidelines on chronic pelvic pain [^112jhJti]. EAU (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, more specifically with respect to cystoscopy, EAU 2025 guidelines recommend to perform rigid cystoscopy under general anesthesia in patients with bladder pain, in order to exclude other diseases, and to classify IC/BPS into subtypes.

### Current updates relating to treatment for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116YrH1B]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the publication of several meta-analyses regarding the efficacy of certain therapies in helping individuals with interstitial cystitis (IC) / bladder pain syndrome (BPS), these have not provided a comprehensive review of therapeutic strategies. The study aimed to determine the efficacy of various therapies for IC/BPS and identify potential moderating factors using randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

We queried the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases to identify prospective RCTs using inclusion criteria: 1) patients diagnosed with IC, 2) interventions included relevant treatments, 3) comparisons were a specified control or placebo, 4) outcomes were mean differences for individual symptoms and structured questionnaires. The pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA) were performed to compare the treatments used in IC/BPS. Hedges' g standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used for improvement in all outcomes using random-effects models. Efficacy outcomes included individual symptoms such as pain, frequency, urgency, and nocturia, as well as structured questionnaires measuring IC/BPS symptoms.

Results

A comprehensive literature search was conducted which identified 70 RCTs with 3,651 patients. The analysis revealed that certain treatments, such as instillation and intravesical injection, showed statistically significant improvements in pain and urgency compared to control or placebo groups in traditional pairwise meta-analysis. However, no specific treatment demonstrated significant improvement in all outcomes measured in the NMA. The results of moderator analyses to explore influential variables indicated that increasing age was associated with increased nocturia, while longer follow-up periods were associated with decreased frequency.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis provide insights into the efficacy of various treatments for IC. Current research suggests that a combination of therapies may have a positive clinical outcome for patients with IC, despite the fact that treatment for this condition is not straightforward.

### Interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: management of the pain disorder: a urogynecology perspective [^115BXLpV]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Our understanding of interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/BPS) has evolved with the advancements in our understanding of visceral pain syndromes. The concept of IC/BPS as a visceral pain disorder is used as a model to base a targeted approach to the management of patients with IC/BPS. Guidelines for the treatment of both the bladder and nonbladder pain disorders are reviewed.

### Bladder defense molecules, urothelial differentiation, urinary biomarkers, and interstitial cystitis [^112dSqtx]. Urology (2007). Low credibility.

It has long been recognized that interstitial cystitis (IC) is a disease of the urothelium. In this article, we review the results of published studies and present new data concerning the precise role of the bladder epithelium in IC. We discuss bladder defenses against both the penetration of urinary solutes and bacterial adherence, and we present new information about the proteoglycans that are present on the normal bladder. Previously published results and new data presented here support the conclusion that IC involves an aberrant differentiation program in the bladder urothelium that leads to altered synthesis of several proteoglycans, cell adhesion and tight junction proteins, and bacterial defense molecules such as GP51. These findings lend support to the rationale for glycosaminoglycan replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with IC.

### About interstitial cystitis… [^111K9f34]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

About Interstitial Cystitis Interstitial Cystitis is a chronic bladder condition resulting in recurring discomfort or pain in the bladder or surrounding pelvic region. People with IC usually have inflamed or irritated bladder walls which can cause scarring and stiffening of the bladder. Who is at risk for IC? IC affects men and women of all racial and ethnic backgrounds and ages. However, it is more common in women than men. Early prevalence research suggested that IC ranged from 1 out of every 100, 000 to 5. 1 out of every 100, 000 in the general population; but updated epidemiologic research conducted in 2006 suggests that up to 12% of women may have early symptoms of IC. What causes IC? The cause of IC is currently unknown. Its diagnosis is often made only after excluding other urinary bladder causes.

### Diagnostic criteria for… [^114uZm2E]. AAFP (2001). Low credibility.

Patients with irritative voiding symptoms and negative urine cultures frequently present a diagnostic challenge for primary care physicians. Interstitial cystitis is a severely debilitating disease of the urinary bladder. Symptoms of interstitial cystitis include excessive urgency and frequency of urination, suprapubic pain, dyspareunia and chronic pelvic pain. 1 Interstitial cystitis interferes with employment, social relationships and sexual activity. The course of the disease is usually marked by flare-ups and remissions. Interstitial cystitis is a chronic disease that persists throughout the patient's life. On clinical evaluation, patients with interstitial cystitis should have no other definable pathology, such as urinary infections, carcinoma, or radiation-induced or medication-induced cystitis. Epidemiology The nonulcer type of interstitial cystitis occurs in about 90 percent of patients. The more severe form of the disease involves Hunner's ulcers, which are lesions that involve all of the layers of the bladder wall and appear as brownish-red patches on the bladder mucosa. Most patients consult at least five physicians, including psychiatrists, over a period of more than four years before interstitial cystitis is diagnosed. Symptomatic patients require considerably more medical care than their age-matched cohorts.
7. Etiology While the exact cause of interstitial cystitis is not known, it is probably related to many factors, including autoimmune, allergic and infectious etiologies.

2 According to one widely held theory, the symptoms of interstitial cystitis originate from a defect in the glycosaminoglycan component of the mucin layer that covers and protects the bladder urothelium. The most typical symptom of interstitial cystitis is pelvic pain. The pain is relieved by voiding small amounts of urine from the bladder, but soon recurs as the bladder fills. Another common symptom is an uncomfortable, constant urge to void that does not go away even after the patient has voided. Incontinence is not typical of interstitial cystitis and, if present, requires that other diagnoses be diligently sought. Dyspareunia is not uncommon in patients with interstitial cystitis.
