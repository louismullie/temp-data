## Question

Contrast or no contrast for a CT for rib pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether CT for rib pain should be performed with or without IV contrast, and under what circumstances contrast is indicated. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context driving the CT request. Then, I should verify what the ACR Appropriateness Criteria say for suspected rib fractures and whether they specify contrast use. Next, I will consider trauma-related scenarios where adjacent organs might be injured and contrast could change management. After that, I should review oncologic or infectious contexts where contrast is typically needed. Finally, I will synthesize a practical decision framework and confirm any exceptions or caveats that could modify the choice in real-world practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts that commonly trigger CT for rib pain: isolated rib fracture after minor trauma, suspected associated thoracoabdominal organ injury, suspected pathologic fracture or neoplasm, suspected infection or inflammatory process, and postoperative or chronic pain scenarios such as nonunion. I need to ensure I anchor the contrast decision to these buckets because the indication drives the protocol more than the symptom alone [^113Jt7Rh] [^1158vozm] [^116WEi5v] [^114y9pvY].

> Now, I should verify the ACR guidance for suspected rib fracture itself; wait, let me double-check the exact wording. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria recommend chest radiography as the initial study for suspected rib fractures, and when CT is pursued for further characterization, they specify chest CT without IV contrast or a technetium-99m bone scan as complementary to CXR, particularly in suspected pathologic fracture, which directly implies that routine IV contrast is not needed for diagnosing rib fractures per se [^1122Tk42] [^111DS3a5] [^113bAgNK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought "contrast helps define bone detail", but wait, that's not correct for cortical bone and fracture lines, which are best depicted on non-contrast bone windows, so I should correct that assumption and emphasize that IV contrast does not improve visualization of rib cortical breaks or callus and may obscure subtle fractures in some settings, reinforcing the non-contrast approach for isolated rib injury evaluation [^111DS3a5].

> Next, I should review trauma scenarios where rib pain might herald deeper injury. I need to check whether lower rib pain raises concern for splenic or renal trauma. The AUA and contemporary trauma guidance recommend IV contrast-enhanced CT when there is concern for renal injury, including mechanisms such as a blow to the flank, rapid deceleration, or associated rib fractures, and a prospective study showed that a small but clinically important subset of patients with isolated left lower rib pain had occult splenic injuries, so if there is any concern for solid organ injury, contrast-enhanced CT is appropriate to detect active extravasation and organ injuries that change management [^115tHmc6] [^114kYXbJ] [^114tmgbv] [^116R9bCd] [^116GJj2G].

> Let me consider oncologic or infectious etiologies. I should confirm whether contrast is advised when a bone lesion or soft-tissue mass is suspected. The musculoskeletal oncology consensus recommends CT with IV contrast for staging when a destructive bone lesion suspicious for metastasis is present, and case-based imaging literature shows that contrast-enhanced CT helps characterize aggressive rib and chest wall masses with soft-tissue components; similarly, when infection is suspected, contrast improves detection of abscess and phlegmon, so in these non-traumatic scenarios, IV contrast is typically indicated to define disease extent and plan care [^114y9pvY] [^112dX1vd] [^116NV9Gp] [^113jAEYK].

> I will now examine postoperative or chronic pain contexts. I should confirm whether nonunion workups require contrast. The Rib Fracture Colloquium suggests chest CT for suspected nonunion and persistent pain, and while the guidelines do not mandate contrast for nonunion imaging, the clinical question is bony continuity and hardware assessment, which are optimally evaluated with non-contrast CT; if there is concern for infection around hardware or soft-tissue complications, adding contrast can be considered selectively, but routine contrast is not required for nonunion evaluation [^1158vozm] [^115YzacB] [^114zdnDk].

> But wait, what if the request is simply "rib pain CT" without context? I should double-check that I am not over-calling contrast. In the absence of red flags for solid organ injury, infection, or malignancy, the default for suspected rib fracture should be non-contrast chest CT, reserving contrast for specific indications such as suspected renal or splenic injury, hemodynamic instability with concern for thoracic vascular injury, or when a mass or destructive lesion is suspected; this aligns with ACR principles and avoids unnecessary contrast risks and delays [^111DS3a5] [^115tHmc6] [^116GJj2G] [^1123VV7k] [^114y9pvY] [^116WEi5v].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework and make sure I have not missed anything: if the clinical question is isolated rib fracture after minor trauma, use non-contrast CT. If there is lower rib pain with pleuritic features or mechanism concerning for splenic or renal injury, use IV contrast-enhanced CT. If there is a suspected pathologic fracture, mass, or infection, use IV contrast-enhanced CT. If the study is for suspected nonunion, non-contrast CT is usually sufficient unless there is concern for infection or soft-tissue complications. And if the patient is unstable with suspected thoracic vascular injury, contrast-enhanced CT or CTA is indicated, which is a different clinical pathway than routine rib pain imaging [^115tHmc6] [^114y9pvY] [^1158vozm] [^1123VV7k] [^111DS3a5] [^111D2YvX].

> Finally, I should confirm safety and quality considerations. I need to ensure we do not compromise diagnostic yield by under-dosing contrast when it is actually indicated, and I should remember pregnancy screening in women of childbearing age before ionizing studies. The Canadian Association of Radiologists advises against reducing iodinated contrast dose because it degrades enhancement, and AHA/ACC chest pain guidance reminds us to screen for pregnancy when radiation is involved, so when contrast is warranted, use full-dose protocols and follow local policies for pregnancy and renal function assessment [^116ytynq] [^113a1rSG] [^112chBhE].

For rib pain, **non-contrast CT is preferred** for suspected rib fractures or bony abnormalities because it provides superior bone detail and avoids contrast risks [^111DS3a5]. Use **IV contrast** when soft-tissue or visceral injury is suspected (e.g. hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, vascular injury, infection, or malignancy) [^116WEi5v] [^113DtwtJ] [^114y9pvY]. Start with a chest X-ray [^1122Tk42]; reserve CT for inconclusive cases or when complications are suspected [^113Jt7Rh].

---

## Indications for CT imaging in rib pain

CT is **not first-line** for isolated rib pain; reserve it for specific clinical scenarios:

- **Suspected rib fractures**: Especially in trauma or when radiographs are inconclusive [^113JC24Y].
- **Suspected complications**: Hemothorax, pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, or vascular injury [^116WEi5v].
- **Suspected pathological fractures**: Osteoporosis, malignancy, or metabolic bone disease [^111DS3a5].
- **Suspected infection or malignancy**: Soft-tissue involvement or systemic symptoms [^1143qtez].

---

## Contrast use in CT imaging for rib pain

The decision to use **IV contrast** depends on the clinical indication:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Contrast use** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Suspected rib fracture (isolated) | Non-contrast CT | Superior bone detail; avoids contrast risks [^111eQGpZ] |
| Suspected soft-tissue injury (hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, vascular injury) | IV contrast CT | Enhances visualization of soft tissues and vascular structures [^116WEi5v] |
| Suspected infection or malignancy | IV contrast CT | Enhances visualization of inflammatory or neoplastic lesions [^114y9pvY] |
| Suspected pathological fracture | Non-contrast CT initially; IV contrast if soft-tissue involvement suspected | Bone detail first; contrast if soft-tissue or visceral involvement suspected [^111DS3a5] |

---

## Risks and benefits of contrast use

### Benefits

Contrast-enhanced CT improves **soft-tissue and vascular visualization**, aiding detection of hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, vascular injury, infection, and malignancy [^116iv17Z] [^1123VV7k] [^111D2YvX]. Non-contrast CT provides **superior bone detail** for rib fractures and avoids contrast-related risks [^111eQGpZ] [^1132z49B].

---

### Risks

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare but potentially serious [^notfound].
- **Contrast-induced nephropathy**: Risk in patients with renal impairment [^114Y8PGw].
- **Extravasation**: Local tissue injury at injection site [^116HjJqT].
- **Increased cost and time**: Additional resources and monitoring required [^113wEo8K].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **ACR guidelines**: Non-contrast CT is recommended for suspected rib fractures; IV contrast reserved for suspected soft-tissue or visceral injury [^111DS3a5].
- **ACS guidelines**: Contrast-enhanced CT is recommended in hemodynamically stable trauma patients with suspected thoracic injury [^116WEi5v].
- **AAOS guidelines**: IV contrast recommended for suspected infection or malignancy involving bone or soft tissue [^114y9pvY].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Non-contrast CT**: Preferred for isolated rib fractures or bony abnormalities [^111DS3a5].
- **IV contrast CT**: Recommended for suspected soft-tissue injury, infection, malignancy, or vascular injury [^1123VV7k] [^114y9pvY].
- **Initial imaging**: Start with chest radiography; use CT selectively based on clinical suspicion and initial results [^1122Tk42].

Chest computed tomography (CT) after chest radiography — additional injuries and management changes: Chest CT identifies additional unsuspected injuries in a majority of major trauma patients who have evidence of chest injury on their initial chest radiograph, and significant management changes result in up to a third of patients; in patients with a "normal" screening chest radiograph, 15 percent of patients had findings that altered management, further encouraging the liberal use of chest CT. Contrast-enhanced chest CT is also necessary in the diagnosis and treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with suspected transmediastinal gunshot wounds.

### Is unenhanced CT sufficient for evaluation of acute abdominal pain? [^113QUSmb]. Clinical Imaging (2002). Low credibility.

Background

To determine whether intravenous contrast improves the ability of radiologists to establish the cause of acute abdominal pain after nondiagnostic or normal unenhanced CT.

Methods

Out of 164 consecutive emergency department patients presenting with less than 48 h of nontraumatic, acute abdominal pain, a confident diagnosis for cause of pain was made prospectively in 71/164 (43%) patients on these unenhanced scans by the monitoring radiologist. In the other 93 patients, our study sample, intravenous contrast-enhanced CT was obtained. At a later date, retrospectively, two experienced abdominal CT radiologists independently evaluated unenhanced CT scans alone for potential causes of pain and diagnostic confidence level on a 1–3 scale. At least 2 weeks later, intravenous enhanced and unenhanced scans were read side-by-side for the same assessment.

Results

There was no significant difference in diagnostic confidence levels comparing unenhanced CT alone (2.59) vs. intravenous enhanced and unenhanced CT together (2.64). Chi-square analysis found no significant difference in finding a cause for pain when intravenous contrast was added compared to the initial unenhanced scan alone.

Conclusions

Intravenous contrast did not significantly improve the ability of CT to establish a cause of abdominal pain after a negative or nondiagnostic unenhanced CT.

### ESR essentials: imaging of suspected child abuse-practice recommendations by the European society of paediatric radiology [^113JC24Y]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

Children younger than 1 year of age

In the acute clinical setting of suspected child abuse, the appropriate imaging protocol is a skeletal survey and an unenhanced CT brain with 3-D reformats. If the head CT is normal but there is abnormal neurology, or a high index of clinical suspicion for physical abuse, a brain and whole spine MRI should be performed within 2–5 days, see flowchart. A limited follow-up skeletal survey (omitting the axial skeleton and the pelvis) after 11–14 days should be performed.
Chest CT can be considered in children in this age group with negative skeletal survey and high clinical suspicion for child abuse, and when the radiographic diagnosis of rib fractures is indeterminate.
Children with suspected injury to the abdomen should have a contrast-enhanced CT scan.

Children 1–2 years of age

Initial and follow-up skeletal surveys and CT chest and abdomen are performed as for children below 1-year-old (see 'Children younger than 1 year of age').
Neuroimaging is performed as for children above 2-years-old (see 'Children above 2 years of age').

Children above 2 years of age

Children above 2-years-old who present with a history of falls or unexplained physical findings such as bruising will usually have a CT brain performed in the acute setting, with the advantage of its exquisite sensitivity for fracture. Where the history is more vague and the symptoms less specific, an MRI within 2–5 days may be the first investigation of the neuroaxis. A skeletal survey is of less value in children above 2, and should be considered on a case-by-case basis. Alternatively, the radiographs may be tailored to the area(s) of suspected injury.
All children with suspected injury to the chest or abdomen should have a contrast-enhanced CT scan.

### Management of genitourinary injuries [^116R9bCd]. ACS (2025). High credibility.

Renal trauma imaging — contrast-enhanced abdominal/pelvic CT is the gold standard for the patient who is hemodynamically stable or was stabilized after blunt or penetrating trauma, and if imaging has not been obtained, perform CT imaging for suspected renal injury in patients with any of the following: gross hematuria; microhematuria and hypotension without indications for emergent operative interventions; a significant injury mechanism (fall from height, blow to flank, rapid deceleration, etc.); penetrating injuries to the abdomen or flank; or clinical findings suggestive of renal trauma, including flank ecchymosis on physical exam and rib fractures seen on initial trauma radiograph studies. Degree of hematuria can be used to reduce imaging burden, and for individuals with only microhematuria or no hematuria and no hypotension, imaging of the GU system can be omitted. Plain film radiograph or ultrasound is not recommended as a diagnostic tool for initial evaluation and diagnosis of trauma patients with a suspected kidney injury.

### Chest pain: a clinical assessment [^115HEPS2]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Chest pain is one of the most common presentations in emergency medicine. The initial evaluation should always consider life-threatening causes such as aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, pericarditis, and esophageal perforation. Radiographic imaging is performed in tandem with the initial clinical assessment and stabilization of the patient. Radiologic findings are key to diagnosis and management of this entity.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^111evWxp]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Recurrent/Stage IV breast cancer — staging evaluation includes: history and physical examination; the performance of a CBC, LFTs, chest diagnostic CT, bone scan, and radiographs of any long or weight-bearing bones that are painful or appear abnormal on bone scan; diagnostic CT of the abdomen (with or without diagnostic CT of the pelvis) or MRI scan of the abdomen; and biopsy documentation of first recurrence if possible. The NCCN Panel generally discourages the use of sodium fluoride PET or PET/CT scans for the evaluation of patients with recurrent disease. In general, the non-diagnostic CT scans used for PET under-evaluate the lungs and the liver compared with contrast-enhanced diagnostic CT scans, and the Panel considers biopsy of equivocal or suspicious sites to be more likely than PET/CT scanning to provide accurate staging information. The consensus of the NCCN Panel is that FDG-PET/CT is optional and most helpful in situations where standard imaging results are equivocal or suspicious. The NCCN Panel recommends bone scan or sodium fluoride PET/CT (category 2B) to detect bone metastases, and if the FDG-PET results clearly indicate bone metastases, these scans can be omitted. The NCCN Panel recommends that metastatic disease at presentation or first recurrence of disease should be biopsied as a part of the workup, and soft tissue tumor biopsy is preferred over bone sites unless a portion of the biopsy can be protected from harsh decalcification solution to preserve more accurate biomarker assessment.

CTAP contrast requirements — prior evaluation considerations for undifferentiated abdominal pain: The writing group discussed whether prior CTAP without contrast should count as adequate evaluation and noted that CTAP with intravenous (IV) contrast best detects most causes of abdominal pain, including vascular dissections and occlusions and conditions requiring preparation for diagnosis such as small malignancies or abscesses. IV contrast is not required for all conditions, and some patients may not receive IV contrast due to contrast allergy, inadequate vascular access, or renal dysfunction. When pain remains undifferentiated after noncontrast CTAP, physicians should consider the limitations of noncontrast CTAP relative to the differential diagnosis to determine whether CTAP with IV contrast is indicated.

### Methods for staging non-small cell lung cancer: diagnosis and management of lung cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116iv17Z]. Chest (2013). Medium credibility.

Lung cancer mediastinal evaluation by CT — modality and technique emphasizes availability, contrast use, section thickness, and universal application. CT scanning of the chest is the most widely available and most commonly used noninvasive modality for evaluation of the mediastinum in lung cancer. Intravenous (IV) contrast is not absolutely necessary in performing chest CT scans for this indication but it may be useful in helping distinguish vascular structures from lymph nodes and delineating mediastinal invasion by centrally located tumors; experienced chest radiologists can usually make this distinction provided appropriately thin sections (≤ 5 mm) are used. A CT scan of the chest should be performed in all cases of lung cancer unless the patient is so debilitated that no treatment is planned or he/she is unwilling to undergo further evaluation.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^115b8Tqx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Index test(s)

Chest computed tomography (CT)

Chest CT refers to the acquisition of images of the chest using computed tomography. Typical imaging protocols would not use intravenous (IV) contrast; however, in this review we considered all variations of imaging protocols with the exception of studies specifically targeted at evaluating the coronary arteries or the heart, which did not include the entire lungs in the field of view. This includes, but is not limited to, non‐contrast chest CT, low‐dose chest CT (with or without contrast), high‐resolution chest CT, and chest CT with IV contrast (routine or pulmonary angiogram).

Chest radiographs/chest X‐rays

Chest radiography refers to the evaluation of the lungs using X‐rays. This often involves two orthogonal views, posterior‐anterior (PA) and lateral, but may be done by a portable machine and only acquire an anterior‐posterior (AP) view. In this review, we considered any and all variations of chest radiography protocols that evaluated the lungs. We did not include protocols that did not include the entire thorax and were done for reasons other than for assessment of pulmonary status (e.g. assessment of feeding tube position, which typically only includes the lower thorax, or dedicated evaluation of the ribs).

Ultrasound of the lungs

Ultrasound of the lungs refers to any ultrasound of the thorax done with the intention of evaluating the status of the lungs. This includes, but is not limited to, point‐of‐care ultrasound, done at the bedside by a physician, as well as what is often termed 'consultative' ultrasound, which is done by a technologist and subsequently interpreted by a physician (typically a radiologist).

We considered all possible technical parameters (e.g. type of probe, transducer frequency, use of contrast). This did not include ultrasound done with the intended purpose of evaluating only the heart or vessels of the chest.

Clinical pathway

At present, the optimal diagnostic pathway and the role of thoracic imaging for identifying people with COVID‐19 is unclear. Compared to RT‐PCR testing, a potential major advantage of thoracic imaging is that results are available faster and that it provides a better insight into the status of the lungs. However, chest CT imaging is typically only available in secondary and tertiary healthcare settings, and availability varies across these settings.

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^1137wtDJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Description of included studies (diagnostic accuracy in suspected participants)

We included 94 studies (64 CT, 12 X‐ray, 11 ultrasounds, three both CT and X‐ray, two both CT and ultrasound, and two both X‐ray and ultrasound) with a total of 37,631 participants suspected of having COVID‐19, of whom 19768 (53%) had a final diagnosis of COVID‐19. This could be on the basis of symptoms or epidemiological risk factors such as close contact with confirmed case.

The median sample size was 234 (interquartile range (IQR) 101.25 to 478.75). Sixty‐five studies were conducted in Europe (Italy 19, the Netherlands 9, France 9, Belgium 5, Turkey 6, Germany 7, UK 4, Switzerland 2, Czech Republic 1, Ireland 1, Spain 1, Denmark 1), 19 were conducted in Asia (China 9, Korea 1, India 4, Iran 2, Japan 1, Pakistan 1, United Arab Emirates 1), and the remaining studies were conducted in North America (USA 6, Canada 1) and South America (Brazil 3). Index test readings were performed by radiologists in 49 studies (52%), radiology residents in two studies (2%), both radiologists and residents in three (4%) study, and radiographers and radiologist in one study (1%); 39 studies (37%) did not clearly report the level of training of readers. Technical parameters regarding the protocol of chest CT used in 69 studies were not clearly reported in 31 (44%) studies, while non‐contrast CT was used in 25 (36%) studies, high‐resolution chest CT was used in eight (11%) studies, low‐dose CT with or without contrast was used in 11 (15%) studies and CT with IV contrast was used in five (7%) studies. Manuscripts of three (3%) of the studies were available only as preprints at the time of the search. Characteristics of the included studies are summarized in Table 2, and outlined in detail in the Characteristics of included studies.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^116WEi5v]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Computed tomography (CT) for thoracic trauma — role and appropriateness — indicates that use of a multi-detector CT scanner is an integral part of evaluating and treating patients sustaining high-energy torso trauma and that CT is critical in serious trauma because it often influences or changes management. Contrast-enhanced chest CT is rated "usually appropriate" by the ACR Appropriateness Criteria in blunt chest trauma with a high-energy mechanism, and in patients with abnormal chest radiographs, altered mental status, distracting injuries, or clinically suspected thoracic injury the ACR Appropriateness Criteria recommend that chest CT be strongly considered.

### ACR appropriateness criteria acute nonspecific chest pain-low probability of coronary artery disease [^111W3Xec]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Primary imaging options in patients at low risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) who present with undifferentiated chest pain and without signs of ischemia are functional testing with exercise or pharmacologic stress-based electrocardiography, echocardiography, or myocardial perfusion imaging to exclude myocardial ischemia after rule-out of myocardial infarction and early cardiac CT because of its high negative predictive value to exclude CAD. Although possible, is not conclusive whether triple-rule-out CT (CAD, pulmonary embolism, and aortic dissection) might improve the efficiency of patient management. More advanced noninvasive tests such as cardiac MRI and invasive imaging with transesophageal echocardiography or coronary angiography are rarely indicated. With increased likelihood of noncardiac causes, a number of diagnostic tests, among them ultrasound of the abdomen, MR angiography of the aorta with or without contrast, x-ray rib views, x-ray barium swallow, and upper gastrointestinal series, can also be appropriate. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment. This recommendation is based on excellent evidence, including several randomized comparative effectiveness trials and blinded observational cohort studies.

### Treatment of pleural mesothelioma: ASCO guideline update [^113brdXT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Table 2 — imaging and staging procedures: A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and upper abdomen with intravenous (IV) contrast is recommended as the initial staging in patients with mesothelioma. An fludeoxyglucose-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) should be obtained for initial staging of patients with mesothelioma, and this may be omitted in patients who are not being considered for definitive surgical resection. If abnormalities that suggest metastatic disease in the abdomen are observed on a chest and upper abdomen CT or on a PET/CT, then a dedicated abdominal (± pelvic) CT scan, preferably with IV and oral contrast, should be performed. An MRI (preferably with IV contrast) may be obtained to further assess invasion of the tumor into the diaphragm, chest wall, mediastinum and other areas. For patients being considered for maximal surgical cytoreduction, a mediastinoscopy and/or endobronchial ultrasound should be considered if enlarged and/or PET avid mediastinal nodes are present. In the presence of contralateral pleural abnormalities detected on initial PET/CT or chest CT scan, a contralateral thoracoscopy may be performed to exclude contralateral disease. In patients with suspicious findings for intra-abdominal disease on imaging and no other contraindications to surgery, it is strongly recommended that a laparoscopy be performed.

### Consensus guidelines on interventional therapies for knee pain (STEP guidelines) from the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience [^113NWopa]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

X-ray, MRI, CT, Bone Scan

X-ray: According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria, radiographs should be the initial imaging modality utilized for the evaluation of knee pain. Radiographs provide adequate evaluation of the joint space, osteophyte and subchondral cyst formation, displaced or chronic stress fractures, joint effusions, and sclerosis in the subarticular region.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): If radiographs are normal, or demonstrate a joint effusion, the ACR recommends an MRI without intravenous (IV) contrast as the next most appropriate study. MRI accurately demonstrates the soft tissues of the knee, without the use of ionizing radiation, and depicts tendon and ligamentous damage, tears and other abnormalities of the meniscus, the presence of synovitis, the extent of effusions, the presence and/or rupture of a popliteal cyst, the extent of cartilage loss, bone marrow lesions, subchondral insufficiency fractures, tibial stress fractures, and osteonecrosis.
MRI with and without IV contrast is not usually indicated when initial radiograph is negative or a joint effusion is detected. However, the utilization of IV contrast may be beneficial to help more accurately diagnose such causes of chronic knee pain as infrapatellar bursitis, adhesive capsulitis, patellofemoral friction syndrome ("runner's knee"), pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS), and Hoffa's fat pad syndrome.
Computed tomography (CT): While not a first-line imaging modality for the evaluation of knee pain, according to the ACR, under certain circumstances, a CT without IV contrast may be indicated for the evaluation of knee pain, especially in settings where MRI may be contraindicated (ie, in a patient with a non-MRI compatible pacemaker, spinal column stimulator, or deep brain stimulator). CT offers enhanced bony detail and may be useful to confirm a prior osseous injury such as a subtle acute non-displaced fracture or chronic stress fracture. In the setting of chronic knee pain related to patellofemoral syndrome, CT may be helpful in evaluating the patellofemoral anatomy.CT with IV contrast is not usually indicated but may be used to evaluate the menisci, articular cartilage, and the presence of loose bodies.
Bone scan: Bone scan is not usually indicated to evaluate patients with knee pain. Bone scan has low specificity and decreased anatomic resolution when compared to CT or MRI. However, bone scan may help to distinguish between bone and soft-tissue origins for pain.
Ultrasound: Ultrasound is not often useful as a diagnostic tool for the comprehensive examination of the knee. It may be appropriate to use ultrasound to confirm a suspected effusion or popliteal cyst, and can be utilized to guide in aspiration of synovial fluid which can be evaluated for crystal disease or infection. It also may be utilized to evaluate for synovial pathology, where the use of power Doppler ultrasound can demonstrate increased synovial blood flow that is associated with knee pain. Ultrasound is also useful for following patients with iliotibial (IT) band syndrome and in evaluating medial plicae. Ultrasound can also demonstrate an extrusion of the meniscus (with is suggestive of an underlying meniscal tear) and, on occasion, can detect peripheral meniscus tears, and chondrocalcinosis.

### Do all patients with left costal margin injuries require radiographic evaluation for intraabdominal injury? [^116GJj2G]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine whether all patients with pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs after blunt traumatic injury require abdominal computed tomography (CT) scanning for the detection of splenic injury.

Methods

This was a prospective, observational cohort of all blunt-trauma patients who had pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs and presented to the emergency department (ED) of a Level I trauma center. Patients were enrolled if they had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score greater than 13 and pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs (ribs 7 to 12). Patients with pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs were considered to have pleuritic pain if the pain increased with inspiration or cough. All hemodynamically stable patients underwent abdominal CT scanning for detection of intraabdominal injuries. Data forms collecting information on the medical history and physical examination of all patients were completed before radiographic imaging. Patients with left lower rib pain or tenderness were considered to have "isolated" left lower rib injury if they were without all of the following: ED or out-of-hospital systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, abdominal or flank tenderness, pelvic or femur fractures, and gross hematuria.

Results

Eight hundred seventy-five patients had left lower rib pain or tenderness, 63 (7.2%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5.6% to 9.1%) patients had splenic injuries, and 20 (2.3%; 95% CI 1.4% to 3.5%) patients had left renal injuries. Five hundred seventy-four patients had additional indications for abdominal imaging, leaving 301 patients with "isolated" left lower rib injury. Of the 301 patients, 9 (3.0%; 95% CI 1.4% to 5.6%) had splenic injuries. All 9 patients had a pleuritic component to their rib tenderness, and 3 (33%) patients underwent splenectomy.

Conclusion

A small but important percentage of patients with pain or tenderness to the left lower ribs has splenic injuries. All patients with splenic injury had pleuritic pain.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^111eQGpZ]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Other imaging — children with suspected intentional injury: CT of the chest with intravenous (IV) contrast is recommended when clinical suspicion of intrathoracic vascular injury exists, whereas CT of the chest without contrast has higher sensitivity for rib fractures than radiograph but is considered an adjunctive exam and routine use is not recommended. Tc-99m whole-body bone scan is an adjunctive examination for the detection of fractures and has utility when clinical suspicion is high but the skeletal survey is negative or findings are equivocal or subtle; venipuncture is required for radiotracer injection and sedation is often required because image acquisition requires a stationary patient for a longer interval compared to other modalities. Ultrasound does not have a role in the imaging work-up of children with suspected intentional injury.

### Gadofosveset trisodium (Vasovist) [^113r95aQ]. FDA (2009). Low credibility.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Instruct patients receiving VASOVIST Injection to inform their physician or healthcare provider if they:

are pregnant or breast feeding
have a history of allergic reaction to contrast media, a history of bronchial asthma or allergic respiratory disorder
have a history of kidney and/or liver disease
have recently received a gadolinium-based contrast agent
have a history of heart rhythm disturbances, or cardiac disease
are taking any prescription or over-the counter medications

Gadolinium-based contrast agents, including VASOVIST, increase the risk for NSF in patients with severe renal insufficiency or acute renal insufficiency of any severity due to the hepato-renal syndrome or in the perioperative setting of liver transplantation. Patients with less severe renal insufficiency who receive repetitive administrations of a gadolinium-based contrast agent may have an increased risk for the development of NSF, especially if the time interval between the administrations precludes clearance of the previously administered contrast agent from the body. If VASOVIST is administered in these situations, instruct patients to contact their physician or healthcare provider if they develop signs or symptoms of NSF, such as burning, itching, swelling, scaling, hardening and tightening of the skin, red or dark patches on the skin, stiffness in joints with trouble moving, bending or straightening of the arms, hands, legs, or feet, pain deep in the hip bones or ribs, or muscle weakness [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Inform patients that they may experience:

reactions at the injection site, such as: redness, mild and transient burning or pain or feeling of warmth or coldness
side effects of itching or nausea

### Bilateral 11th rib disarticulation and resection for chronic rib pain: a case report [^112hQQHT]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical Presentation

A 17-year-old female patient presented for surgical evaluation regarding chronic rib pain due to bilateral 11th rib "dislocation". This diagnosis was made 1 year before the initial surgical consult. She underwent chiropractic manipulation to reduce the dislocation several times, with 5 days being the greatest length of time before another dislocation. Conservative treatments including trigger-point injections with local anesthetic and tramadol were not helpful.

Physical examination noted a slight paraspinal gap on the right side with a similar but less discernable gap located lower on the left. Her Zubrod/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score was a 1, and her pain score was a 7 of 10. Otherwise, the physical examination was unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed without contrast, which revealed no dislocations, fractures, or other intrathoracic abnormalities (Figure 1).

Figure 1
Axial computed tomography scan showing unremarkable insertion of the 11th rib on the vertebral body.

During the operation, a right-sided chest incision parallel to the rib was made, exposing the costovertebral joint of the 11th rib and vertebra. The 11th rib was completely disarticulated from the vertebrae and approximately one half of the rib was resected. The residual 11th rib was secured to the 10th rib with #2 absorbable suture after drilling the inferior rib to avoid disturbing the neurovascular bundle. A 24-French straight chest tube was placed and secured. The surgical incision was closed in layers. Complications were not observed during the operation, and she was discharged home on postoperative day 1 after chest tube removal. At her 2-month postoperative follow-up, her chronic pain on the right side had completely resolved. However, with the improvement on the right-sided pain, her contralateral pain was becoming increasingly noticeable. The patient had not been taking pain medications due to their inability to relieve her pain.

### Diagnostic accuracy of unenhanced computed tomography for evaluation of acute abdominal pain in the emergency department [^114Y8PGw]. JAMA Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Intravenous (IV) contrast medium is sometimes withheld due to risk of complication or lack of availability in patients undergoing computed tomography (CT) for abdominal pain. The risk from withholding contrast medium is understudied.

Objective

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of unenhanced abdominopelvic CT using contemporaneous contrast-enhanced CT as the reference standard in emergency department (ED) patients with acute abdominal pain.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was an institutional review board-approved, multicenter retrospective diagnostic accuracy study of 201 consecutive adult ED patients who underwent dual-energy contrast-enhanced CT for the evaluation of acute abdominal pain from April 1, 2017, through April 22, 2017. Three blinded radiologists interpreted these scans to establish the reference standard by majority rule. IV and oral contrast media were then digitally subtracted using dual-energy techniques. Six different blinded radiologists from 3 institutions (3 specialist faculty and 3 residents) interpreted the resulting unenhanced CT examinations. Participants included a consecutive sample of ED patients with abdominal pain who underwent dual-energy CT.

Exposure

Contrast-enhanced and virtual unenhanced CT derived from dual-energy CT.

Main Outcome

Diagnostic accuracy of unenhanced CT for primary (ie, principal cause[s] of pain) and actionable secondary (ie, incidental findings requiring management) diagnoses. The Gwet interrater agreement coefficient was calculated.

Results

There were 201 included patients (female, 108; male, 93) with a mean age of 50.1 (SD, 20.9) years and mean BMI of 25.5 (SD, 5.4). Overall accuracy of unenhanced CT was 70% (faculty, 68% to 74%; residents, 69% to 70%). Faculty had higher accuracy than residents for primary diagnoses (82% vs 76%; adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.83; 95% CI, 1.26–2.67; p = 0.002) but lower accuracy for actionable secondary diagnoses (87% vs 90%; OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.35–0.93; P < .001). This was because faculty made fewer false-negative primary diagnoses (38% vs 62%; OR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.13–0.41; P < .001) but more false-positive actionable secondary diagnoses (63% vs 37%; OR, 2.11, 95% CI, 1.26–3.54; p = 0.01). False-negative (19%) and false-positive (14%) results were common. Interrater agreement for overall accuracy was moderate (Gwet agreement coefficient, 0.58).

Conclusion

Unenhanced CT was approximately 30% less accurate than contrast-enhanced CT for evaluating abdominal pain in the ED. This should be balanced with the risk of administering contrast material to patients with risk factors for kidney injury or hypersensitivity reaction.

### Intravenous contrast in computed tomography imaging for acute abdominal pain… [^111apDFX]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Shaish et al1 tested the diagnostic accuracy of unenhanced computed tomography scans by digitally subtracting contrast media and asking blinded radiologists to interpret the unenhanced scans ordered in the emergency department for evaluation of acute abdominal pain. Of note, this excellent study used double contrast in the reference standard, including both intravenous and oral contrast, but oral contrast is not often used in time-sensitive emergency department settings. Furthermore, it is important to note that to minimize study bias, the study participants did not have access to clinical or other imaging data and health care professional–radiologist communication, which reflects real life in that abdominal pain may be the only history provided to the radiologist and images may be interpreted before a physical examination is documented in the electronic medical record.

Despite these impediments, faculty and residents found the primary diagnosis 82% and 76% of the time, respectively, indicating the high value of CT imaging even in the absence of a detailed patient history or physical examination findings.

For malignant soft-tissue lesions, MRI with and without IV contrast, CT scan without contrast, and core needle biopsy were perceived to be the most effective diagnostic studies by our providers. MRI with and without IV contrast and CT scan without contrast were considered the most effective and cost-effective overall (Figure 2 and Supplemental Figure 3). In particular, MRI with contrast and MRI without contrast were determined to be the two most effective studies for evaluating a malignant soft-tissue lesion. Ultrasonography and bone scan were considered the least useful studies, with positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan being considered the lowest in usefulness and cost-effectiveness.

Child abuse — thoracic imaging states that other than rib fractures, injuries to the chest are uncommon among abused children, and radiographs are usually sufficient to diagnose significant pleural effusion, hemothorax, pneumothorax, or pulmonary contusion. Chest computed tomography (CT) with intravenous (IV) contrast may be indicated if conditions such as hemopericardium, cardiac contusion, or laceration are suspected clinically. Routine CT of the chest is not recommended; however, consider low dose CT to better evaluate suspected rib fractures and to detect scapular or spine fractures not seen on radiographs.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRib fractures [^113Jt7Rh]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rib fractures are the most common thoracic injury after minor blunt trauma. Although rib fractures can produce significant morbidity, the diagnosis of injuries to underlying organs is arguably more important as these complications are likely to have the most significant clinical impact. Isolated rib fractures have a relatively low morbidity and mortality and treatment is generally conservative. As such, evaluation with standard chest radiographs is usually sufficient for the diagnosis of rib fractures, and further imaging is generally not appropriate as there is little data that undiagnosed isolated rib fractures after minor blunt trauma affect management or outcomes. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation frequently results in anterior rib fractures and chest radiographs are usually appropriate (and sufficient) as the initial imaging modality in these patients. In patients with suspected pathologic fractures, chest CT or Tc-99m bone scans are usually appropriate and complementary modalities to chest radiography based on the clinical scenario. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Coronal reformatted CECT images depicts extravasated contrast in the upper extremity soft tissues. b: CT scout image after extravasation of intravenously administered contrast in the left upper extremity allows assessment of the extent of extravasation and permits evaluation of possible compartment syndrome

ACR Manual on Contrast Media discusses the treatment of contrast extravasation. Raising the affected limb above the level of the heart may reduce swelling and facilitate absorption of extravasated fluid. Some favor cold compresses to decrease pain at the extravasation site and others prefer warm compresses to improve blood flow to the extravasation site and increase absorption of the contrast from the tissues into the vasculature and lymphatics. In addition, attempts to remove the extravasated contrast via aspiration have not been shown to be consistently beneficial. Regardless of the post-extravasation treatment method, patients should be evaluated by the radiologist. If pain is the main symptom, we use cold compresses, and if the extravasation has occurred in a location where there is a higher likelihood of compartment syndrome, we use hot compresses. We observe the patient in the radiology department for at least 1 h to ensure that there are no new symptoms, such as pain or numbness to suggest development of compartment syndrome. Before discharge, a radiologist discusses the findings that would suggest a developing compartment syndrome with the patient. The patient is instructed to seek medical attention if new neurologic or circulatory symptoms or skin ulceration develop.

Extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma

The second most common primary malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents is the Ewing sarcoma, with a slight male predilection (male-to-female ratio of 1.5:1). The primary complaint of patients is pain, which depends on the location, the feeling of a mass, or swelling. Ewing sarcoma can occur in extraskeletal sites in the chest, such as pleural and paravertebral sites. Most lesions have an aggressive appearance with locoregional bone destruction and a large soft-tissue component (Figs. 12, 13).

Fig. 12
Diagnosis: Ewing sarcoma. Technique: standard chest radiography and contrast-enhanced chest CT. Description: A 23-year-old man was referred for a chest radiograph due to pain at the right hemithorax. The postero-anterior chest radiographs (a, b) show an opacity (arrow) projecting at the level of the 7th right rib. An external radio-opaque marker was placed on the painful area. The additional contrast-enhanced CT further characterizes the mass encasing the 7th right rib with a locoregional aggressive periosteal sunburst type reaction and a surrounding soft tissue component (c, d). On the axial T1-weighted MR image (e) the lesion has an isointense signal to muscle and a high signal intensity on the axial FS T2-WI (f) with invasion of the muscles of the chest wall (arrows). After intravenous contrast administration, the lesions show a heterogeneous enhancement (g), predominantly at the periphery of the lesion. The coronal T2-weighted MR image (h) shows the extrinsic impression of the lesion on the liver

### Thoracic imaging tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19 [^115wcoWS]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Description of included studies

We included 51 studies (38 CT, seven X‐ray, two ultrasound, one both CT and X‐ray, two both CT and ultrasound, and one both X‐ray and ultrasound) with a total of 19,775 participants suspected of having COVID‐19, of whom 10,155 (51%) had a final diagnosis of COVID‐19.

The median sample size was 211 (interquartile range 94.5 to 486). Thirty‐three studies were conducted in Europe (Italy 11, the Netherlands 7, France 5, Belgium 3, Turkey 3, Germany 2, UK 2), 13 were conducted in Asia (China 10, Korea 1, India 1, Japan 1) and the remaining studies were conducted in North America (USA 3) and South America (Brazil 2).

Index test readings were performed by radiologists in 39 studies (76%), radiology residents in two studies (4%), both radiologists and residents in one (2%) study, and radiographers in one study (2%); eight studies (16%) did not clearly report the level of training of readers.

### Does clinical decision support system promote expert consensus for appropriate imaging referrals? Chest-abdominal-pelvis CT as a case study [^113SLoLw]. Insights Into Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

Proportion of agreement with ED decision to perform Chest–Abdominal–Pelvis CT scan was higher for referrals by surgeons than by non-surgeons, including internal medicine and emergency medicine. This was expected as surgery clinical cases are usually more straightforward (ex. Query for Appendicitis) while internal medicine deals with "less well-defined problems" where CT is not always a first choice.

In-line with our results, Young et al. found that primary care physicians (internal medicine and family medicine) were almost twice as likely to order an inappropriate MRI as orthopedists, neurologists and surgeons.

Along with a personal responsibility for patients, primary care physicians see a wide range of clinical conditions for the patients they treat and play a gatekeeper role that involves assessing which patients should be referred for imaging and specialist health services. This role can be difficult for primary care physicians to maintain, and fear of conflict can make it difficult for them to resist requests from patients for referrals that are not medically justified.

Based on expert physicians, for 15 cases out of 100, a low appropriateness assessment (mean physicians' rate < 4) was found. Most of them were exams for patients with unspecified abdominal pain, suspected renal failure or fatigue/malaise. On the other hand, the highest appropriateness assessment (mean physicians' rate > 6.5) was found for patients with symptoms suggestive of appendicitis, peritonitis, intestinal obstruction and cirrhosis.

These results are inconsistent with previous findings. Francisco et al. found that the most frequent inappropriate uses of CT were evaluation of biliary disease, pancreatitis, renal failure, and uncomplicated pyelonephritis. Other less common inappropriate orders were related to the lack of intravenous (IV) contrast when it is usually indicated (acute abdominal pain, small bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, appendicitis), or using IV contrast when it is not indicated (e.g. urolithiasis). However, Giannitto et al. found that unindicated scans were most frequent for appendicitis and unlocalized abdominal pain.

### Hepatobiliary imaging and its pitfalls [^11721Yne]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

In summary, US is the initial imaging modality for the evaluation of acute right upper quadrant pain. It permits accurate diagnosis of acute cholecystitis and successfully identifies multiple other causes of patient symptomatology. Some of these processes lie outside the hepatobiliary system and include renal infection and obstruction, pancreatitis and its sequelae, duodenal or colonic perforation or mass lesions, peritoneal tumor spread, adrenal hemorrhage, and even remote problems, such as pneumonia. The limitations on US include incomplete imaging of the liver, most often at the dome or beneath ribs on the surface, and incomplete visualization of lesion boundaries, particularly with some infections and tumors. For these clinical scenarios, contrast-enhanced CT is complementary to US and should be encouraged. In the biliary tree, US has limitations in situations in which the ducts are not dilated and sometimes with imaging the extra hepaticducts, especially distally. For these patients, CT or MR imaging (MRCP) is especially useful. If one keeps the clinical scenario in mind and always images a patient where he or she hurts, US is a powerful and effective diagnostic method for evaluating acute right upper quadrant pain.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^115Jeywp]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Rib fracture pain management — Management of rib fracture pain requires a multimodal approach; begin scheduled acetaminophen and NSAIDS as soon as possible. If a regional block is likely, select a COX-2 inhibitor to avoid platelet inhibition. Muscle relaxants, if not contraindicated, may help relieve chest wall muscle spasm, and evidence suggests they reduce length of stay and respiratory complications in rib fracture patients. Consider the early use of regional analgesia to avoid the potential complications of opioids. An epidural is preferred for treatment of patients with bilateral rib fractures, but paravertebral blocks can be used when an epidural is contraindicated. Intercostal blocks with liposomal bupivacaine are another option when patients may have contraindications to paravertebral or epidural blocks such as coagulopathy or spine fractures. The addition of opioids begins with oral administration and may include breakthrough rescue doses of intermittent IV opioids with escalation to a PCA if multiple rescue IV doses are required. For continued rib pain, consider operative rib fixation.

### Oral contrast for CT in patients with acute non-traumatic abdominal and pelvic pain: what should be its current role? [^113wEo8K]. Emergency Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Positive oral contrast agents, including barium suspensions and water-soluble iodinated solutions, have traditionally been used in conjunction with the CT evaluation of patients with abdominal and pelvic pain. Due to continued advancements in CT technology, and due to increasing obesity and correspondingly a general increase in the intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic fat separating bowel loops in North American patients and in patients in other parts of the world over the past few decades, the ability of radiologists to accurately evaluate the cause of acute symptoms has substantially improved. Recent research and evolving imaging society guidelines/systematic reviews increasingly support performing CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis without the need for positive oral contrast in these types of adult patient populations, in most clinical situations. Increased patient throughput, patient preference, patient safety, and most importantly, retention of high diagnostic accuracy, are reasons for this recent change in practice to routinely omit the use of enteric contrast agents for the majority of patients presenting with acute abdominal and pelvic pain whom are undergoing emergency CT.

### A new low-dose multi-phase trauma CT protocol and its impact on diagnostic assessment and radiation dose in multi-trauma patients [^114hrzbq]. Emergency Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Our low-dose multi-phase trauma CT protocol uses a single contrast injection for WBCT angiography followed by an abdominal scan in venous phase. Compared to a requested complementary CT angiography, this method saves time and does not increase the intravenous contrast load. It has been shown that the request for a complementary CT angiography leads to a risk of delayed diagnoses in the emergent situation.

We also assessed the incidence of missed non-arterial injuries in both groups and did not find a statistically significant difference. Therefore, the diagnostic accuracy of trauma-related non-arterial injuries is not affected by the low-dose multi-phase trauma CT protocol. Among the most frequently missed injuries in both groups were fractures of the ribcage, the midface, and the transverse vertebral processes. Similarly, several others have shown that the most frequently missed diagnoses during a trauma CT are skeletal injuries. This has been reasoned with the explanation that, e.g. broken nasal bones and fractured ribs do not affect the emergency handling of a potentially critically injured patient and that the radiologists purposely direct their main attention to obvious and vitally important injuries, such as arterial or organ injuries, mostly only found during the arterial phase of a CT scan.

Computed tomography (CT) scan — A CT scan is a series of x-rays that give more detail than regular x-rays; CT scan pictures show soft tissue and bones, and the CT machine looks like a large donut that your head, neck, and chest will go through; patients without an allergy to contrast will need an IV — that is, a needle inserted into a vein — for contrast to enhance the pictures. Risks include contrast allergy and discomfort with IV placement, patients with claustrophobia have minimal anxiety during this brief scan (3–5 minutes), and a CT scan uses radiation — about as much as 150 chest x-rays.

### Can obstructive urolithiasis be safely excluded on contrast CT? A retrospective analysis of contrast-enhanced and noncontrast CT [^114nwJMM]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The aim of this study was to determine if contrast-enhanced CT can safely exclude obstructive urolithiasis in patients with flank plain. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis to compare the negative predictive values of contrast-enhanced and non-contrast CTs for the detection of obstructing urolithiasis.

Methods

Through report analysis, we identified all non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis performed on adult patients in the emergency department at a single, multi-site academic medical institution in 2017 with an indication of flank pain. The prevalence of obstructive urolithiasis in each group was calculated. We subsequently analyzed 200 consecutive studies from each of these groups (reported negative for obstructive urolithiasis) for negative predictive value calculation. Follow up abdominal imaging within 7 days from original presentation was used as a reference standard for analysis.

Results

In the noncontrast group, 1 study out of 200 was false negative (negative predictive value = 99.5%). In the contrast-enhanced group, there were no false negatives (negative predictive value = 100%). The prevalence of obstructive urolithiasis was 44.0% (351/797) in the noncontrast group and 18.7% (86/459) in the contrast-enhanced group.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that contrast-enhanced CT can safely exclude obstructing ureteral calculi in the setting of acute flank pain. This finding is of clinical relevance given the inherent benefit of IV contrast in diagnosing abdominopelvic pathology.

### Chest CT examinations in patients presenting with acute chest pain: a pictorial review [^114eZciL]. Insights Into Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusion

The expected increase in thoracic, tailored rule-out CT examinations will urge the (general) radiologist to gain confidence in detecting and reporting alternative diagnoses on regular thoracic CT or CTA examinations requested in the setting of acute chest pain. Familiarity with some of the aortic, coronary, pericardial, and pulmonary diagnoses, and the sometimes subtle imaging findings will help to suggest alternative diagnoses, thereby avoiding diagnostic delay.

### Computed tomography imaging of septic shock. beyond the cause: the "CT hypoperfusion complex". A pictorial essay [^111D2YvX]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic imaging

The importance of imaging for the establishment of the infection source is well recognised. A wide range of imaging tools is currently available for the investigation of septic shock. The choice of imaging modality depends on several factors, the most important of which include the overall clinical condition of the patient and the presence or absence of localising signs and symptoms as summarised in Table 1.

The diagnostic accuracy of CT for the identification of the source of clinically suspected septic shock has been well established, allowing for the rapid and detailed study of multiple body areas simultaneously. CT provides a standardised method for patient evaluation, which is not operator-dependent. In a few minutes, CT can provide images of multiple body regions, simultaneously, improving the ability to identify the septic source, which can improve patient management. CT also played an increasingly important role in the guidance of aspiration and drainage, with a high degree of accuracy. CT should be performed in all patients with a spiral technique, craniocaudal acquisition and in a supine position with abducted upper limbs, to reduce the radiation dose and guarantee a higher image quality of the thoraco-abdominal organs. Breath-hold acquisitions can ensure the avoidance of motion artefacts. In emergency settings, CT examinations should include both unenhanced and contrast-enhanced acquisitions of the abdomen. High concentrations (370–400 mg I/mL) of intravenous (IV) contrast medium (80–130 mL iodinated contrast medium, depending on the patient's weight), injected at 3.5–4 mL/s through an 18-gauge needle into the antecubital vein should be administered, followed by a bolus of 40 mL saline at the same flow rate. The acquisition of the arterial phase is timed with the bolus tracking by placing the region of interest (ROI) on the aortic arch and starting at an attenuation threshold of 100 Hounsfield Unit (HU). The portal-venous phase is acquired with a delay of 60–70 s after the beginning of the injection. The suggested acquisition volume in emergency settings includes the abdomen and pelvis scan in arterial phase and the chest, abdomen, and pelvis in portal phase, to obtain a complete examination. An additional, late scan of the abdomen and pelvis at 3–5 min may also be acquired to address various causes of abdominal pain. The rectal administration of contrast material is not typically useful. For adequate analysis and post-processing, with maximum intensity projection (MIP) and multiplanar reformation (MPR), an effective slice thickness of 2.5 mm, with reconstruction at 0.625 mm, is recommended. Automatic tube current modulation should be adopted to reduce radiation exposure, and the standard reconstruction algorithm should be applied. Head CT should be considered for patients presenting with altered mental status, without IV contrast medium administration; head CT should be performed before the total body study to exclude the presence of intracranial haemorrhage. Head CT can also be performed after the late phase of the total body study to exclude intracranial abscess or malignancy.

Acute chest pain with suspected myopericarditis — imaging recommendations: In patients with acute chest pain and myocardial injury who have nonobstructive coronary arteries on anatomic testing, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with gadolinium contrast is effective to distinguish myopericarditis from other causes, including myocardial infarction and nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) (Class 1, Level B-NR). In patients with acute chest pain with suspected acute myopericarditis, CMR is useful if there is diagnostic uncertainty or to determine the presence and extent of myocardial and pericardial inflammation and fibrosis (Class 1, Level B-NR). In patients with acute chest pain and suspected myopericarditis, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is effective to determine the presence of ventricular wall motion abnormalities, pericardial effusion, valvular abnormalities, or restrictive physiology (Class 1, Level C-EO). In patients with acute chest pain with suspected acute pericarditis, noncontrast or contrast cardiac CT scanning may be reasonable to determine the presence and degree of pericardial thickening (Class 2b, Level C-LD).

### ACR appropriateness criteria® acute nonspecific chest pain-low probability of coronary artery disease [^117KRpL3]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

This document outlines the usefulness of available diagnostic imaging for patients without known coronary artery disease and at low probability for having coronary artery disease who do not present with classic signs, symptoms, or electrocardiographic abnormalities indicating acute coronary syndrome but rather with nonspecific chest pain leading to a differential diagnosis, including pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or musculoskeletal pathologies. A number of imaging modalities are available to evaluate the broad spectrum of possible pathologies in these patients, such as chest radiography, multidetector CT, MRI, ventilation-perfusion scans, cardiac perfusion scintigraphy, transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography, PET, spine and rib radiography, barium esophageal and upper gastrointestinal studies, and abdominal ultrasound. It is considered appropriate to start the assessment of these patients with a low-cost, low-risk diagnostic test such as a chest x-ray. Contrast-enhanced gated cardiac and ungated thoracic multidetector CT as well as transthoracic echocardiography are also usually considered as appropriate in the evaluation of these patients as a second step if necessary. A number of rest and stress single-photon emission CT myocardial perfusion imaging, ventilation-perfusion scanning, aortic and chest MR angiographic, and more specific x-ray and abdominal examinations may be appropriate as a third layer of testing, whereas MRI of the heart or coronary arteries and invasive testing such as transesophageal echocardiography or selective coronary angiography are not considered appropriate in these patients. Given the low risk of these patients, it is mandated to minimize radiation exposure as much as possible using advanced and appropriate testing protocols. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria® are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 2 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaBack pain-child [^113nJW8F]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

It is now generally accepted that nontraumatic back pain in the pediatric population is common. The presence of isolated back pain in a child has previously been an indication for imaging; however, recently a more conservative approach has been suggested using clinical criteria. The presence of constant pain, night pain, and radicular pain, alone or in combination, lasting for 4 weeks or more, constitute clinical red flags that should prompt further imaging. Without these clinical red flags, imaging is likely not indicated. Exceptions include an abnormal neurologic examination or clinical and laboratory findings suggesting an infectious or neoplastic etiology, and when present should prompt immediate imaging. Initial imaging should consist of spine radiographs limited to area of interest, with spine MRI without contrast to evaluate further if needed. CT of the spine, limited to area of interest, and Tc-99m bone scan whole body with single-photon emission computed tomography may be useful in some patients. The addition of intravenous contrast is also recommended for evaluation of a potential neoplastic or infectious process. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Automated rib fracture detection on chest X-ray using contrastive learning [^115fm86H]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2023). Medium credibility.

There were some limitations in this study. First, this study was retrospective, and although various types of fractures were detected, clinical work with cortical bone distortion and old lesions may not be of significant clinical significance for emergency management. Thus, further important features will be detected according to clinical needs. Second, we did not compare the performance of our model with physician-based models in terms of key factors, such as clinical outcomes and the time required to obtain a diagnosis. Finally, the size of the validation set selected in our model was relatively small. Additional data should be obtained, and prospective studies should be subsequently performed to validate the convolutional neural network (CNN) model.
