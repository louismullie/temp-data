## Question

Smooth muscle antibody 1:40

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a smooth muscle antibody (SMA) titer of 1:40 and what to do next. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what SMA measures and how 1:40 is defined in guidelines. Then, I should verify how sensitive and specific a 1:40 SMA is for autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) versus other liver diseases and healthy individuals. Next, I will consider how clinical context — especially aminotransferases and IgG — changes the predictive value. After that, I should outline immediate and secondary steps in the diagnostic workup, including when to pursue liver biopsy. Finally, I will address common pitfalls and provide a practical, cautious interpretation with clear next steps and a succinct summary.

> Let me first confirm the basics: SMA is a non–organ-specific autoantibody that reacts with components of the cytoskeleton, notably actin, and is typically detected by indirect immunofluorescence on rodent liver–kidney–stomach substrates, with the clinical relevance of the titer interpreted against guideline cutoffs [^115Lgaus] [^112SDM8k] [^1178Hq9D].

> Now, I need to check the titer threshold. Wait, let me verify the adult cutoff: in adults, an SMA titer of 1:40 or higher is considered clinically significant by multiple hepatology guidelines, whereas in children lower thresholds are used due to the rarity of autoantibodies in that population, which aligns with the 1:40 value reported here [^112SDM8k] [^113o4zeN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about disease specificity. I should confirm how often SMA 1:40 appears outside AIH: population data and liver disease cohorts show low-titer ANA and SMA are common in adults without AIH, including in chronic hepatitis C, NAFLD/NASH, and even healthy individuals, and ACG DILI guidance notes that titers less than 1:80 are of limited help because roughly 30% of adults may be positive, particularly women [^112NXMJY] [^112qscXM] [^113Hd2Gw] [^1117mkfe]. But wait, what if the staining pattern is VG/VGT or there is anti–F-actin positivity? That would increase specificity for AIH type 1, so I should request pattern reporting and consider F-actin confirmation if the pattern is not available [^115Lgaus] [^111SmT4J] [^117KdcuE].

> Next, I should review predictive value in context. I will now examine how the titer performs alongside liver enzymes: in a cohort with normal ALT, progression to AIH after a positive SMA was extremely rare (about 0.5%), whereas with raised ALT the positive predictive value approximated 22%, and many AIH diagnoses were made within 3 months when ALT was elevated, reinforcing that the biochemical context drives meaning [^114siUAH]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost said "1:40 equals probable AIH", but that would be an overstatement; 1:40 contributes points in the simplified IAIHG score but does not by itself establish the diagnosis, and titers around 1:40 are relatively nonspecific without corroborating features [^115H9edo] [^111igeg5].

> Let me consider disease subtypes and special populations. I should confirm that SMA is a hallmark of AIH type 1 and that seronegative AIH exists in a meaningful minority, which means a negative or low-titer SMA does not exclude AIH and a positive SMA at 1:40 is not diagnostic on its own; pediatric thresholds and serologic patterns differ, and SMA positivity can also be seen in PSC/AIH overlap contexts and after infections or drugs, so I need to keep the differential broad and avoid anchoring [^111tMAnb] [^113YDrvd] [^111vQQuR] [^117QbsiE].

> I need to ensure the immediate workup is targeted. First, I should double-check liver chemistries: AST, ALT, ALP, GGT, and bilirubin; second, I should verify IgG and consider IgM for cholestatic clues; third, I should review a complete autoantibody panel including ANA, anti-LKM1, AMA, and consider anti-SLA/LP if the clinical picture is compatible; fourth, I should exclude viral, metabolic, and drug etiologies per ACG abnormal liver chemistries and DILI guidance, reserving biopsy for unresolved cases or when the pattern suggests AIH rather than NAFLD or viral disease [^111mYLBN] [^111dc2ys] [^1117mkfe].

> But wait, what if the patient has persistent transaminase elevation and elevated IgG with compatible serology? In that scenario, I should confirm the next step: liver biopsy becomes important because interface hepatitis on histology is a core diagnostic pillar of AIH and helps distinguish mimics such as steatohepatitis or viral hepatitis; in diagnostically challenging or severe presentations, biopsy is recommended by major societies, and scoring systems should be applied in context rather than in isolation [^111tMAnb] [^111L1MSp] [^111igeg5].

> I should double-check for common pitfalls. Let me verify that transient viral infections like HAV and HEV can induce autoantibodies and nonspecific SMA patterns, and that drug-induced liver injury can phenocopy AIH; also, in PBC or PBC/AIH overlap, AMA and IgM profiles often dominate, and SMA may be less informative, so I must not over-interpret an isolated SMA 1:40 without pattern or IgG support [^116nu4T3] [^111dc2ys] [^112oSCpy] [^111cBUpw].

> Next, I should review what to do if everything is normal. If AST/ALT, ALP, GGT, bilirubin, and IgG are normal and there are no risk factors or suggestive symptoms, observation with periodic reassessment is reasonable, given the low PPV of isolated SMA in this setting; repeating autoantibodies is not routinely helpful because titers fluctuate and do not track disease activity, and guidelines emphasize using serology within a diagnostic framework rather than as a standalone test [^114siUAH] [^111mYLBN] [^113o4zeN].

> Let me synthesize a practical interpretation. An SMA titer of 1:40 in an adult is a weakly positive, nonspecific signal that can be seen in healthy individuals and in many non-AIH liver diseases; it becomes meaningful when combined with elevated aminotransferases, hypergammaglobulinemia, and a compatible biopsy, so the next steps are to verify liver tests and IgG, expand autoantibody testing, exclude alternative etiologies, and proceed to biopsy if enzymes remain elevated or clinical suspicion persists, while requesting SMA staining pattern and considering anti–F-actin confirmation to increase specificity if available [^111tMAnb] [^111mYLBN] [^115Lgaus] [^117KdcuE].

> In summary, I should confirm that a 1:40 SMA alone is insufficient to diagnose AIH; it warrants attention when aligned with biochemical and histologic features, but in isolation it most often reflects low-level autoimmunity without disease, so I will contextualize with liver tests, IgG, viral and drug screens, and histology when indicated, keeping a cautious, guideline-concordant approach to avoid overdiagnosis while not missing treatable AIH [^111tMAnb] [^111L1MSp] [^113YDrvd].

An SMA titer of 1:40 is a **low-positive result** that is not diagnostic on its own [^1117mkfe] [^111L1MSp]. It has **limited specificity** and may be seen in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) [^111tMAnb], viral hepatitis, drug-induced liver injury, and even healthy individuals — especially older adults or women [^112NXMJY] [^1117mkfe]. Clinical significance depends on liver enzymes, IgG, and histology [^111L1MSp]; if AST/ALT and IgG are elevated, AIH is more likely and a liver biopsy should be considered [^113YDrvd]. If liver tests are normal, observe and repeat testing if indicated [^notfound]. Higher titers (≥ 1:80) are more specific for AIH [^115Lgaus], whereas 1:40 is only weakly suggestive.

---

## Clinical significance of SMA 1:40

- **Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)**: SMA is a hallmark of AIH type 1 [^1178Hq9D], but a 1:40 titer is only weakly positive. Higher titers (≥ 1:80) are more specific for AIH, whereas 1:40 may be seen in healthy individuals or other liver diseases [^1117mkfe] [^115Lgaus].

- **Other liver diseases**: SMA 1:40 can occur in viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis C) [^112qscXM], drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^115Lgaus], and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [^1148Nv4C], reflecting nonspecific immune activation rather than AIH [^113Hd2Gw].

- **Healthy individuals**: Low-titer SMA (including 1:40) may be found in healthy individuals, particularly older adults or women, and is often clinically insignificant [^112NXMJY] [^1117mkfe].

---

## Factors influencing SMA positivity

Several factors can influence SMA positivity at a 1:40 titer:

| **Factor** | **Influence on sma positivity** |
|-|-|
| Age | More common in older adults [^notfound] |
| Gender | More common in females [^1117mkfe] |
| Autoimmune diseases | Higher prevalence in autoimmune conditions [^111tMAnb] |
| Viral infections | Associated with SMA positivity (e.g. hepatitis C) [^112qscXM] |
| Medications | Drug-induced liver injury can cause SMA positivity [^115Lgaus] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) provide the following recommendations regarding SMA 1:40:

- **Interpretation**: SMA positivity alone, especially at low titers (1:40), is not diagnostic of AIH. Diagnosis requires integration with clinical, biochemical, and histological findings [^111L1MSp] [^1117mkfe].

- **Additional testing**: If SMA 1:40 is detected, further evaluation should include liver function tests (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT), immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, and other autoantibodies (ANA, anti-LKM1) [^111L1MSp] [^113YDrvd].

- **Liver biopsy**: Histological examination is often required to confirm AIH, especially when autoimmune features are present but not definitive [^111L1MSp] [^113YDrvd].

- **Monitoring**: If liver enzymes are normal, observe and repeat testing if clinically indicated [^114siUAH].

---

## Clinical actions based on SMA 1:40 results

The following clinical actions are recommended based on SMA 1:40 results:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended actions** |
|-|-|
| Elevated liver enzymes and/or IgG | - Further autoimmune evaluation <br/> - Consider liver biopsy [^113YDrvd] |
| Normal liver enzymes and IgG | - Observe <br/> - Repeat testing if indicated [^114siUAH] |
| Suspected drug-induced liver injury | - Evaluate medication history <br/> - Consider DILI diagnosis [^111dc2ys] |
| Suspected viral hepatitis | - Test for hepatitis B and C <br/> - Consider viral etiologies [^111dc2ys] |

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Assay variability**: Different laboratories may use varying methods and cutoffs, leading to variability in results [^1178Hq9D].

- **False positives**: Low-titer SMA results can be false positives or reflect nonspecific immune activation [^1117mkfe].

- **Clinical context**: Always interpret SMA results within the broader clinical context, including symptoms, liver function tests, and other diagnostic findings [^111L1MSp].

---

An SMA titer of 1:40 is a **low-positive result** with limited specificity [^1117mkfe]. It may be seen in AIH, other liver diseases, or healthy individuals [^112NXMJY]. Clinical significance depends on liver enzymes, IgG, and histology [^111L1MSp]; if AST/ALT and IgG are elevated, AIH is more likely and a liver biopsy should be considered [^113YDrvd]. If liver tests are normal, observe and repeat testing if indicated [^114siUAH]. Higher titers (≥ 1:80) are more specific for AIH, whereas 1:40 is only weakly suggestive [^1117mkfe].

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in inflammatory bowel disease — epidemiology and serologic types include reported AIH frequency in IBD ranging from 0.6% to 1.6%, whereas a population-based Utah study found 0.3% and that autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC) was 5 times more frequent. Two broad AIH types are recognized: type 1 with antinuclear antibodies and/or smooth muscle antibodies positive, and type 2 with antibodies to liver/kidney microsomal type 1 and/or anti–liver cytosol type 1; in children, diagnostic titers considered significant include 1:20 for ANA or SMA and 1: 10 for anti–liver/kidney microsomal type 1, whereas in adults 1:40 is clinically relevant. p-ANCA is frequently positive in AIH type 1 and typically negative in AIH type 2, and AIH type 1 accounts for two-thirds of cases, often presenting around puberty, while type 2 tends to present at a younger age.

Results

Cohort characterization at time of biopsy

A total of 43 patients with ALF receiving TJLB were included into the study (Table 1). The median (interquartile range (IQR)) age was 55 (37–64) years and the majority of 30 patients (69.8%) were female. At time of TJLB, all patients had manifest hepatic encephalopathy (HE), with grade I HE in 16 (37.2%), grade II HE in five (11.6%) and grade III HE in 22 (51.2%) patients, respectively. At this time, 17 (39.5%) patients were already admitted to the ICU, one patient (2.3%) was invasively ventilated, five patients (11.6%) were receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) and ten patients (23.2%) therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). The median (IQR) MELD-Score was 30 (27–35) points. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) antibodies were detectable before biopsy obtainment in the majority of patients, e.g. antinuclear antibodies (ANA) in 26 (60.4%) and smooth-muscle (SMA) in 28 (65.1%) patients, respectively. Median ANA and SMA-titers were 1:160 and 1:80, respectively.

Within 28 days following TJLB, 14 (32.6%) patients died. 15 (34.9%) patients, fulfilling Kings-College criteria, were HU listed for LTX and 14 (32.6%) received a graft. The one patient listed for HU-LTX but not getting transplanted was admitted with acute liver failure fulfilling Kings-College criteria. During the course of treatment, she developed a severe systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which resulted in cardiac arrest and unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation two days after transplant listing.

### Low incidence of positive smooth muscle antibody and high incidence of isolated IgM elevation in Chinese patients with autoimmune hepatitis And primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome: a retrospective study [^113TRhUX]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

5. Conclusion

Overlap syndrome of autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis was not rare in Chinese patients with clinical manifests of autoimmune liver diseases. Overlap of the diseases should not be disregarded when isolated IgM elevation was exhibited, and smooth muscle antibody might have little diagnostic significance in the overlap syndrome. If it was difficult to make a definite diagnosis, liver biopsy was necessary.

### Do anti-smooth muscle antibodies predict development of autoimmune hepatitis in patients with normal liver function? – A retrospective cohort review [^114siUAH]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The presence of anti-smooth muscle autoantibody (SMA) in Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) is well established. However, there are no data demonstrating the clinical significance in patients with normal liver function and few showing positive predictive value for AIH when alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is raised.

Methods

We retrospectively established outcomes in a cohort of 251 consecutive patients with positive tubular or glomerular SMA. Patient records were checked for 12years after the positive SMA result to identify development of AIH.

Results

Of 202 patients with SMA and ALT < 55IU/L, one (0.5%) had a subsequent diagnosis of AIH and this patient probably had abnormal ALT at the time of SMA detection. 22% of 45 patients with raised ALT (> 55IU/L) and 23% of 43 patients with persistently raised ALT (> 3months duration), had a diagnosis of AIH on follow up. Of 10 patients with AIH, 80% were diagnosed within three months of the positive SMA.

Conclusions

Progression to AIH in patients with normal liver function and positive SMA-T/G is rare but patients with positive SMA and raised ALT (> 55IU/L) should be referred to secondary care for investigation. Positive predictive value of SMA with raised ALT for AIH was 22%.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury [^1117mkfe]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) injury in the DILI differential — AIH should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all cases of DILI, serum autoantibodies (antinuclear antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody) and IgG levels should be routinely obtained, and a liver biopsy may be considered in selected cases; low levels (e.g., titers less than 1:80 dilutions) are of little help because ~30% of adults, especially women, may have positive autoantibodies, and a rapidly emerging entity is liver injury associated with ICI use in which traditional autoimmune marker elevations are absent and histology does not necessarily mirror idiopathic AIH.

### Serologic markers do not predict histologic severity or response to treatment in patients with autoimmune hepatitis [^113BAiF2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies, hypergammaglobulinemia, necroinflammatory histology, and a response to immunosuppressive drugs. The goal of this retrospective study was to determine whether the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) or anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMAs) in patients with AIH correlated with clinical presentation, histologic findings, or response to immunosuppressive therapy.

Methods

Fifty-two patients diagnosed with AIH, on the basis of the revised scoring system of International Autoimmune Hepatitis group, were reviewed. Data on age, gender, aminotransferase levels, autoantibody titers, treatment regimens, and response to treatment were recorded. Seropositivity was defined as ANA > 1:40 or ASMA > 1:40. Percutaneous liver biopsies obtained at the initial presentation were reviewed.

Results

Forty-two patients with AIH (81%) were seropositive, and 10 (19%) were seronegative. Both groups were similar with respect to demographics, treatment regimens, and response to therapy. Histologic parameters were similar among the 2 groups, including portal and lobular inflammation, piecemeal necrosis, and centrilobular necrosis. There were no significant differences in aminotransferase levels at diagnosis or after treatment.

Conclusions

The prevalence of ANAs or ASMAs did not correlate with the clinical or histologic severity of AIH at diagnosis. Furthermore, there was no correlation between antibody status and response to immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, patients who meet the diagnosis of AIH on the basis of the revised scoring system of International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group should be given immunosuppressive therapy, regardless of antibody status.

### Prevalence and significance of autoantibodies in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [^114sVoYm]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Goals

The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence and the clinical and histologic correlates of autoantibodies in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).

Background

Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) have been identified in patients with NASH. The significance of autoantibodies in NASH is uncertain.

Study

Clinical data from patients with a histologic diagnosis of NASH at a university hospital in Chicago, Illinois between January 1999 and April 2003 were reviewed retrospectively. Seventy-four patients who were tested for autoantibodies and had no history of alcohol abuse or a systemic autoimmune disease were included. Demographic information and laboratory data were collected. Autoantibody titers ≥ 1:40 were considered positive. A single pathologist reviewed all liver biopsies and scored features of NASH and identified characteristics of autoimmune hepatitis.

Results

Thirty-four percent of patients with NASH had positive ANA titers and 6% were ASMA positive. Demographic and laboratory parameters did not differ by ANA status, except that women were more frequently ANA positive then men (P = 0.01). The severity of steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis on liver biopsy were similar in the ANA positive and negative groups. Only 15% of ANA positive patients with NASH had a plasma cell infiltrate on liver biopsy and there was no difference in the frequency of histologic features of autoimmune hepatitis between ANA positive and negative patients.

Conclusions

Antinuclear antibodies are common in patients with NASH and most frequently represent a nonspecific antibody response that is not associated with the pattern or severity of injury on liver biopsy.

Anti-Smooth Muscle and Anti-Actin Antibodies

The description of anti-SMA in 1965 contributed significantly to discriminate AIH from lupus erythematosus, this reactivity being absent in the latter condition. On triple rodent tissue, anti-SMA stains the smooth muscle of the muscularis mucosa of the gastric wall, but also the smooth muscle of the mesangium of renal glomeruli and arterial walls (Fig. 3). Bottazzo et al. recognized in 1976 three distinct IIF staining patterns on kidney tissue, namely vessel (V), vessel glomerular (VG), and vessel glomerular tubular (VGT) patterns (Fig. 3). While the V pattern was detected also in serum of patients with viral infections, drug-induced liver injury, malignancies, fatty liver disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and PBC, the VG and VGT patterns were predominantly detected in serum of patients with AIH, at that time referred to as chronic active hepatitis. This association was validated in later studies. Therefore, clinical laboratory reports should include the IIF staining pattern of SMA-positive sera. The clinician, however, should be aware that some 20% of AIH SMA-positive patients lack the VG- or VGT-patterns, and, conversely, these patterns can be observed in liver diseases different from AIH, particularly viral hepatitis. The SMA titre is also of clinical significance, since higher titres have higher AIH-specificity. If vascular smooth muscle cells (VSM) 47 cells, derived from rat embryonic thoracic aorta, are used as a substrate, sera giving the VGT pattern on kidney substrate give a typical cytoskeletal pattern (Fig. 3 E). On a fibroblast substrate, these sera stain components of the cytoskeleton, giving the so called microfilament or F-actin pattern, suggesting that their antigenic target is an actin component (Fig. 3 F). This observation led to the establishment of solid-phase assays using filamentous actin as an antigenic source, the results of which, however, are negative in some 20% of the VGT positive sera, indicating that additional, yet unknown, autoantigens are targeted by this reactivity, or, alternatively, that B cell epitopes are lost during protein purification. Therefore, anti-actin molecular assays should be used in a complementary manner to IIF on triple rodent tissue. On the other hand, anti-actin positivity is rarely found in SMA-negative AIH sera. Moreover, low-titre anti-actin antibody can be found in patients with non-AIH liver diseases, particularly PBC and chronic hepatitis C, but are virtually absent in healthy controls. One study found an association of anti-actin antibody with more aggressive AIH.

### Expression and clinical significance of antinuclear antibody in hepatitis C virus infection [^111XCpcK]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The prevalence of antinuclear antibody (ANA) has been documented in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We attempted to determine the titer and to characterize the patterns and clinical significance of ANA in HCV infection.

Study

Forty-eight consecutive patients with positive anti-HCV antibody and positive HCV RNA were included in this study. Sera from patients were tested for ANA and anti-smooth muscle antibody by indirect immunofluorescence. Serum aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, alpha-fetoprotein, and cryoglobulin levels also were determined.

Results

Eleven (23%) of 48 HCV-infected patients were positive for ANA. Antinuclear antibody revealed speckled pattern in 10 (91%) of the 11 ANA-positive HCV-infected patients. Twenty (54%) of 37 ANA-negative HCV-infected patients had detectable pattern with equivocal titer (titer < 1.5). The ANA pattern was speckled in all 20 patients. Hepatitis C virus-infected patients with positive ANA were older than the HCV-infected patients with negative ANA (62.90 ± 11.05 years vs. 56.46 ± 14.94 years, respectively; p < 0.1). Serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (39.36 ± 14.98 IU/L vs. 30.70 ± 23.15 IU/L, p < 0.05), alkaline phosphatase (189.00 ± 75.63 IU/L vs. 122.41 ± 40.88 IU/L, p < 0.01), and alpha-fetoprotein (47.72 ± 80.47 pg/dL vs. 7.00 ± 8.28 pg/dL, p < 0.01) were higher in ANA-positive HCV-infected patients than in ANA-negative HCV-infected patients, respectively. There were no significant differences in gender, alanine aminotransferase, anti-smooth muscle antibody, or cryoglobulin between the two groups.

Conclusions

Antinuclear antibody was present in 11 (23%) of 48 patients with HCV infection in our study. Speckled pattern is the major expression pattern of ANA in HCV infection. Antinuclear antibody-positive HCV-infected patients have significantly higher serum aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, and alpha-fetoprotein levels than ANA-negative HCV-infected patients.

### Prospective evaluation of the prevalence and clinical significance of positive autoantibodies after pediatric liver transplantation [^1177qwNc]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

De novo autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) recently was recognized as an important cause of late graft dysfunction after pediatric liver transplantation (LT). However, the significance of isolated elevation of autoantibodies in children after LT without history of prior autoimmune liver disease scarcely has been studied. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for autoantibodies production in pediatric LT recipients and to assess the impact of isolated elevation of autoantibodies over time on graft function.

Methods

Sixty-eight children without history of autoimmune disease were recruited over the course of 1 year into this cross-sectional study. A single blood specimen was drawn at study entry to determine titers of autoantibodies. Clinical and laboratory assessment and medical history were obtained at study entry as well. Patients were then divided into positive and negative autoantibodies groups, and prospectively followed for 18 months for evidence of abnormal liver function tests.

Results

One or more autoantibodies were detected in 18 (26%) patients. Anti-smooth muscle was the most common (n = 13) antibody. Time since transplant (> 4 years) was the only risk factor identified for the presence of autoantibodies (univariate risk ratio, 3.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.2–9). During the follow-up period, 5 patients with positive autoantibody screen developed de novo AIH (n = 3) or chronic rejection (n = 2), compared with 0 in the negative autoantibody group. Children with positive autoantibody screen were at higher risk for development of de novo AIH or chronic rejection (univariate risk ratio 13.9; 95% confidence interval, 1.7–111; P = 0.004).

Conclusions

Positive autoantibodies are common in children after LT and their presence may denote a higher risk for the development of de novo AIH or chronic rejection over time.

### Smooth muscle autoantibodies with F-actin specificity [^111SmT4J]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of autoantibodies, among other features. Anti-smooth muscle autoantibodies with F-actin reactivity have long been considered specific markers of this disease, representing a valuable diagnostic element because they are distinctive of a subtype of autoimmune hepatitis: type 1. Indirect immunofluorescence is considered the best available method for detection of these autoantibodies, mainly because of its elevated sensibility, but it has some flaws: it is highly operator-dependent, and the standardization of the technique has not been achieved until now. We compared ELISA and Immunodot methods for confirming indirect immunofluorescence results in what concerns smooth-muscle autoantibodies' F-actin reactivity and concluded that ELISA is the most useful one. A new substrate is available for indirect immunofluorescence detection of anti-F-actin specificity, and seems to be a promising one, but further evaluation is needed.

Serum autoantibodies and IgG4 in PSC — detection of antinuclear, anti–smooth muscle, and perinuclear antineutrophil antibodies is highly variable and likely represents an immune dysregulation state; in contrast to primary biliary cholangitis and AIH, autoantibodies have minimal diagnostic implications for PSC; elevation of serum IgG4 occurs in up to 15% of patients with PSC but its clinical significance is unclear; high-titer IgG4 (> 5.6 g/L) is rare and suggests IgG4-sclerosing cholangitis, and an IgG4/IgG1 ratio < 0.24 can exclude IgG4-sclerosing cholangitis when serum IgG4 is 1.4–2.8 g/L.

Laboratory investigation

Biochemistry

Bilirubin and aminotransferase levels vary from just above the upper limits of normal (ULN) to very high levels. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is usually normal or moderately elevated, while γ-glutamyl-transpeptidase (γ-GT) can increase variously. Spontaneous normalization of aminotransferases and γ-GT can be observed, although there is usually evidence of continuing inflammatory activity at the histological level. This phenomenon may result in delay and/or underestimation of AIH diagnosis, as the next AIH hit can be pronounced after many months or years or may even be absolutely asymptomatic, explaining at least partially the presence of cirrhosis in one third of patients at diagnosis.

Irrespectively of the presence of cirrhosis, the majority of patients have high serum γ-globulins or IgG, a distinctive feature of AIH. However, 25–40% of patients with acute AIH have normal IgG. It should be noted that the range of "normal" IgG is ample, as it is impractical to have the "real normal ranges" of the respective population where an index case resides.

Liver autoimmune serology

Conventional antibodies

Autoantibodies are the hallmark for AIH diagnosis. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF), preferably on freshly frozen rodent substrates including kidney, liver and stomach, is the technique of choice for routine screening (Fig. 2). Significant titers are ≥ 1:40 in adults, while ≥ 1:20 for ANA or SMA and ≥ 1:10 for anti-LKM1 are supportive of AIH diagnosis in children in association with other laboratory and clinical findings. Other assays, such as ELISA or immunoblotting, are available for anti-LKM1, anti-LKM3, anti-LC1 and anti-SLA/LP testing.

### Role of auto-antibodies for the diagnosis of chronic cholestatic liver diseases [^112CNZhC]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2005). Low credibility.

Auto-antibodies are an integral part of the diagnostic armentarium in chronic cholestatic liver disorders, such as primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), auto-immune cholangitis, or overlap syndromes among these disorders. However, care should be taken not to overestimate the diagnostic specificity. Auto-antibodies to mitochondrial antigens(AMAs) with reactivity to the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex represent the hallmark antibody for the diagnosis of PBC, whereas antinuclear antibodies (ANAs)with low disease specificity are found in up to 50% of these sera. Antibodies that recognize nuclear envelope proteins exert a similarly high diagnostic specificity as AMA in PBC but occur at a rather low prevalence. The role of auto-antibodies is less well-studied for patients with PSC, but there is growing evidence that only antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies(ANCAs) are of relevant diagnostic significance. In contrast, auto-antibodies-particularlyAMAs-do not contribute to the diagnosis of auto-immune cholangitis, whereas ANCAs, ANAs, smooth muscle antibodies, and AMAs are of varying significance in PBC-auto-immune hepatitis (AIH) or PSC-AIH overlap syndromes. It has been widely accepted that the course of the auto-antibody serum end point titers are not suited for the clinical management of patients with chronic cholestatic liver disorders. Additionally, auto-antibodies in these disorders usually do not contribute to the immunopathogenesis of the disease.

### Autoimmune hepatitis related autoantibodies in children with type 1 diabetes [^112UmaK3]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2014). Low credibility.

Background and objectives

The frequency of Type 1 diabetes (T1D)-related autoantibodies was determined in children with autoimmune hepatitis. However, the incidence of autoimmune hepatitis related autoantibodies in children with T1D has been poorly investigated. The aim of the present cross sectional prospective study was to determine the occurrence of autoimmune hepatitis-related autoantibodies in children with T1D.

Methods

Children with T1D following in diabetic clinic in our center were screened for existence of liver related autoantibodies from November 2010 to November 2011. The patients' sera were analyzed for the existence of autoantibodies such as anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, and anti-Liver Kidney microsomal antibody, using enzyme linked immunoassay and indirect immunofluorescence methods. A titer of anti-nuclear antibody ≥ 1/40 was considered positive and titer of < 1/40 was considered negative. Anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody titer of < 3 U/ml was considered negative, 3–5 U/ml borderlines, and > 5 U/ml was considered positive.

Results

106 children with T1D have been examined over a one-year period: age ranges between 8 months to 15.5 years, sixty two patients were females. Autoantibody screen revealed a girl with positive anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody (1%) and 8 children had positive anti-nuclear antibody (7.5%), without clinical, biochemical or radiologic evidence of liver disease. None of the patients had positive smooth muscle antibody.

In conclusion

Anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody is rarely found in sera of children with T1D; the clinical significance of which is unknown.

Unlabelled

Background

Up to now, few data are available regarding the clinical characteristics of autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome. The study was to investigate and analyze the prevalent and clinical features of Chinese patients with this disease.

Methods

Clinical data on patients diagnosed as autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome in our hospital from January 2001 to December 2006 were collected and analyzed.

Results

Overlap syndrome of autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis accounted for 10.33% of patients with autoimmune liver diseases during the past six years. For these patients with overlap syndrome, xanthochromia, lethargy and anorexia were the predominant complaints; a low incidence (14/146) of smooth muscle antibody positivity and a high incidence (37/89) of isolated IgM elevation were the main serological characteristics.

Conclusions

Overlap syndrome of autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis was not rare in Chinese patients with clinical manifests of autoimmune liver diseases. Overlap of the diseases should not be disregarded when isolated IgM elevation was exhibited, and smooth muscle antibody might have little diagnostic significance in the overlap syndrome. If it was difficult to make a definite diagnosis, liver biopsy was necessary.

### Low incidence of positive smooth muscle antibody and high incidence of isolated IgM elevation in Chinese patients with autoimmune hepatitis And primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome: a retrospective study [^113n63PS]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

1. Background

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are three major clinicopathologic entities of autoimmune liver diseases. Besides, some patients with autoimmune liver disease present with characteristics of a second autoimmune liver disease (i.e. AIH and PBC overlapping). These cases have been defined as overlap syndrome. Patients with overlap syndrome usually present with nonspecific symptoms, including lethargy, arthralgias, and myalgias. A combination of clinical and laboratory or pathologic criteria is necessary for the diagnosis of the disease. In the laboratory test, autoantibodies are the serological hallmarks. Serum antinuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA) and antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) are routinely detected in these patients.

Although combined features of both PBC and PSC have been reported in single cases, there is no clear evidence for the existence of an overlap of PBC and PSC. The overlap syndrome of AIH and PBC is the most common form, and it shows a more progressive course towards liver cirrhosis and liver failure than AIH or PBC alone. However, up to now, the pathogenesis of overlap syndrome is poorly understood, and few data are available regarding the clinical characteristics of this disease, and moreover, reports on the prevalent and serological features of this condition in Chinese population are still lacking. The aim of this retrospective study is to investigate and analyze the prevalent and clinical features of Chinese patients with AIH and PBC overlap syndrome.

Clinical manifestations

Clinical characteristics

AIH is a discrete clinical syndrome characterized by considerable demographic, clinical, laboratory and histological heterogeneity (Table 1). Therefore, extended differential diagnosis should be performed, considering the possibility of AIH in any acute or chronic liver disease (Tables 2, 3). Both sexes in all ethnic groups can be affected at any age. Disease onset has a bimodal distribution during the childhood/teenage and 4 th -6 th decades, but recently many patients have been diagnosed at older ages (> 65 years). The disease may accumulate in first-degree relatives, but the absolute risk is very low. High rates of depression and anxiety have recently been recognized in AIH patients.

Table 1
Clinical manifestations of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)

Table 2
Differential diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis

Table 3
Common concurrent autoimmune or immune-mediated diseases in patients with autoimmune hepatitis

The manifestations are variable, ranging from asymptomatic to acute/severe or even fulminant hepatitis (Table 1). The acute onset accounts for 25–40% of patients and does not differ from other causes of acute hepatitis. Two different syndromes are recognized in acute AIH: one is the acute worsening of a previously undiagnosed or misdiagnosed chronic AIH and the second is the original acute disease without chronic lesions on histology (Table 1). Interestingly, some patients with acute AIH have normal IgG levels, while 9–17% of patients have negative results at first screening for antinuclear (ANA) or smooth muscle (SMA) antibodies; consequently, physicians may not consider AIH.

Biotherapies and aSMC

No biotherapy directly targeting aSMC is currently under clinical development to our knowledge. However, available biotherapies that target inflammation can have implication in aSMC (table 2).

Table 2
Effect of approved biotherapies on pulmonary function tests in allergic and eosinophilic severe asthma (phase III trials)

Omalizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody targeting immunoglobulin (Ig) E to treat severe allergic asthmatic patients. Phase III study demonstrated that omalizumab significantly improves asthma exacerbation rate compared with placebo. It also showed that omalizumab could slightly improve morning peak expiratory flow and FEV1. Monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-5 pathway namely mepolizumab, reslizumab and benralizumab are now approved to be used to treat severe eosinophilic asthma. Considering improvement of prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator FEV1, biotherapies targeting IL-5 reached statistic significance overall, though clinical significance remains questionable (about+100 mL vs placebo). Conversely, dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting IL-4 receptor α also demonstrated a significant reduction of exacerbation rate and efficient oral corticosteroid tapering in patients suffering of uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma. Interestingly, a significant improvement of FEV1 under treatment with dupilumab was observed at 24 weeks of treatment with mean difference above 200 mL. In a real-life asthma cohort, dupilumab also improved FEV1 by 10% (predicted values) after 1 year of treatment. Recently, a treatment with tezepelumab, a human monoclonal antibody targeting the TSLP, lead to a 130 mL increase of pre bronchodilator FEV1 in comparison with the control group. Such improvements, to be confirmed in the long term, tends to underline the importance of the interactions between inflammation and bronchial smooth muscle and the interest in simultaneously targeting multiple actors.

Few trials specifically studied the effect of biotherapies on pulmonary functions. Benralizumab failed to significantly improve prebronchodilator FEV1 and hyperinflation in SOLANA trial. To note, this trial aimed at assessing benralizumab efficiency at short-term (84 days) and potentially lack interesting effects on obstruction through prolonged treatment. Small-sized clinical studies have shown that mepolizumab could possibly improve small airway function evaluated by multiple-breath nitrogen washout test and forced oscillometry after a few months of treatments.

### Value and risk of percutaneous liver biopsy in patients with cirrhosis and clinical suspicion of autoimmune hepatitis [^115G4Fv2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Methods

Study population

We search clinical and liver biopsy databases to identify patients with a clinical suspicion of AIH in Siriraj Hospital (Bangkok, Thailand) during 2000–2015. The eligible criteria were as follows: (1) unexplained elevation of aminotransferase with elevated γ-globulin, and positive for the non-organ-specific antibodies known to be associated with AIH and (2) appropriate exclusion of other liver diseases, such as hepatitis B or C virus, alcohol, haemochromatosis, Wilson's disease and drug-induced hepatotoxicity. A total of 386 patients with suspected AIH were identified. Empiric treatment with immunosuppressants was initiated for 144 patients who presented with acute liver failure (n = 22), acute severe hepatitis (n = 56), acute flares on chronic liver disease (n = 29), and cirrhosis with hepatic decompensation (n = 37), as shown in figure 1. This group of patients with probable or definite AIH based on the 1999 revised IAIHG criteria were excluded due to the lack of histological evaluation before treatment. For the main objective of the study, 207 patients with available pathological slides for review were included in the analysis. Before the liver biopsy examination, the diagnosis of cirrhosis was established by the clinical manifestations, laboratory investigations and imaging studies.

Flow chart of the study population. AIH, autoimmune hepatitis.

Clinical and laboratory evaluations

Relevant clinical, biochemical and serological information at the time of liver biopsy were collected. Laboratory tests included serological markers, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), total bilirubin, albumin, γ-globulin, immunoglobulins and standard haematological indices. Antinuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), liver-kidney-microsomal antibody and antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) were detected by indirect immunofluorescence, and a titre of 1:40 or greater was considered positive. The revised IAIHG score with and without histology assessment was calculated before the administration of specific therapy. Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score and the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score were calculated at the time of liver biopsy.

### Clinical features of autoimmune hepatitis Diagnosed based on simplified criteria of the international autoimmune hepatitis group [^115H9edo]. Digestive and Liver Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Recently, simplified diagnostic criteria for autoimmune hepatitis have been proposed.

Aim

We aimed to evaluate usefulness of the simplified criteria.

Methods

We applied the simplified criteria to 176 autoimmune hepatitis patients diagnosed according to the revised scoring system proposed in 1999 (original criteria). Furthermore, in order to compare predictabilities between these two diagnostic criteria, we included 168 patients with other liver disease than autoimmune hepatitis.

Results

Of 176 autoimmune hepatitis patients, 85% were diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis according to the simplified criteria, and patients diagnosed according to the simplified criteria showed a higher frequency of antinuclear antibodies and/or smooth muscle antibodies of 1:80 or greater and slightly higher serum levels of immunoglobulin G than those diagnosed according to the original criteria. However, 30% of male patients, 23% of patients with acute presentation, 50% of patients showing histological acute hepatitis and 46% of patients negative for antinuclear antibodies at presentation were not diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis according to the simplified criteria. The simplified criteria showed lower sensitivity (85% vs. 100%) and higher specificity (99% vs. 93%) for autoimmune hepatitis than the original criteria.

Conclusions

The simplified criteria may be useless for the diagnosis of patients with atypical features, especially patients with histological acute hepatitis.

### Autoimmune hepatitis: serum autoantibodies in clinical practice [^1178Hq9D]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Circulating autoantibodies are a key diagnostic tool in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), being positive in 95% of the cases if tested according to dedicated guidelines issued by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group. They also allow the distinction between type 1 AIH, characterized by positive anti-nuclear and/or anti-smooth muscle antibody, and type 2 AIH, characterized by positive anti-liver kidney microsomal type 1 and/or anti-liver cytosol type 1 antibody. Anti-soluble liver antigen is the only AIH-specific autoantibody, and is found in 20–30% of both type 1 and type 2 AIH. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody is frequently positive in type 1 AIH, being associated also with inflammatory bowel disease and with primary/autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis. The reference method for autoantibody testing remains indirect immunofluorescence on triple tissue (rodent liver, kidney and stomach), allowing both the detection of the majority of liver-relevant reactivities, including those autoantibodies whose molecular target antigens are unknown. Of note, the current knowledge of the clinical significance of autoantibodies relies on studies based on this technique. However, immunofluorescence requires trained laboratory personnel, is observer-dependent, and lacks standardization, leading to ongoing attempts at replacing this method with automated assays, the sensitivity, and specificity of which, however, require further studies before they can be used as a reliable alternative to immunofluorescence; currently, they may be used as complementary to immunofluorescence.

2. Methods

2.1. Patients

Patients diagnosed as overlap syndrome of AIH and PBC in 302 hospital from January 2001 to December 2006 were included in the retrospective study. The diagnosis was based on the criteria established by Chazouillères O, et al. Exclusion criteria included coinfection with hepatitis A, C, D, E, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus or HIV; the presence of other forms of liver diseases such as alcoholic liver disease, drug hepatitis or Wilson's disease. 146 patients were eventually enrolled in our study. Informed written consent for the analysis was obtained from each patient. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Beijing 302 Hospital.

2.2. Serological markers and liver histopathology

Serum autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA) and antimitochondrial antibody (AMA) were tested using indirect immunofluorescence with the standard methods (Euroimmun Medizinnische Labordiagnostika AG, Germany), and sera were considered to be positive when they produced a reaction at a dilution of ≥ 1:100. Immunoglobulin (Ig) assay were taken with the mothod of immunological turbidimetry (Diasys Diagnostic Systems, China). The normalized levels of IgG, IgM and IgA were respectively 7.23–16.6 g/L, 0.63–2.77 g/L and 0.69–3.82 g/L.

Biochemical profiles, including alanine transarninase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBil), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured using standard laboratory procedure. The normalized levels of ALT, AST, TBil, GGT and ALP were respectively < 40 U/L, < 40 U/L, < 17.1 umol/L, 7–32 U/L, and 40–150 U/L.

Liver biopsy was performed in some cases for definite diagnosis, and biopsy specimens were examined in the Pathology Department.

2.3. Statistical analysis

Data analysis were performed using SAS 9.2 software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC, USA) and the quantitative data were expressed as mean and standard deviation.

SMA, as mentioned before, defines AIH-1, being positive in 85% of the cases, associated with ANA in 50%. The same autoimmune serological profile is shared with the paediatric condition referred to as autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis (ASC), which represents an overlap of AIH with an autoimmune attack to intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile ducts.

ANA, coupled with SMA, defines AIH-1, being positive in about two thirds of the patients, associated with SMA in half of the cases. Seronegative AIH is rare, > 95% of the cases being positive for ANA and/or SMA, provided that autoantibodies are tested according to recommended cut-offs. The clinician should be aware that ANA lacks disease specificity, being detected also in liver diseases different from AIH-1, particularly viral hepatitis B, C, D, and E, drug-induced liver injury, Wilson disease, alcohol-induced liver disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A variety of extrahepatic organ-specific and systemic autoimmune diseases are also typically associated with ANA-positivity, such as lupus erythematosus, Hashimoto thyroiditis, systemic sclerosis, or celiac disease, which may coexist with AIH. Moreover, ANA may be positive even in healthy individuals, with frequency and titres increasing with age.

Two ANA nuclear staining patterns are of particular clinical importance in the context of liver disease, i.e. the rim-like (also referred to as membranous) and the multiple-nuclear dot patterns (Fig. 2 D, E), which, in association with a cholestatic biochemical profile, are characteristic of PBC, being particularly helpful in the diagnosis of AMA-negative PBC. The main target antigen of the latter reactivity is sp100, whereas the anti-rim like antibody targets mainly gp210; molecular tests are available using these antigens, which however are not the only targets of the rim-like and multiple nuclear dot ANA, since both the nuclear membrane and the nuclear bodies, stained by the anti-rim-like and the anti-multiple nuclear dots, respectively, are complex structures.

Autoantibodies in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — serologic repertoire and diagnostic performance — include antinuclear antibodies (ANA), smooth muscle antibodies (SMA), and anti–liver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1), which constitute the conventional serological repertoire for the diagnosis of AIH. At presentation in white North American adults with AIH, ANA are detected in 80%, SMA are present in 63%, and anti-LKM1 are present in 3%. Forty-nine percent of patients with AIH have ANA, SMA, or anti-LKM1 as an isolated serological finding at presentation; and 51% have multiple autoantibodies. ANA and SMA occur in other diseases and may be detected in < 10% of liver diseases outside of AIH, and the diagnostic accuracy for AIH improves from ~58% to 74% if two autoantibodies are detected at presentation. Anti-LKM1 are commonly detected in the absence of ANA and SMA; however, anti-LKM1 have a low sensitivity for AIH in North American adults (1%), and they are detected in 13%-38% of British and Canadian children with AIH. Autoantibody titers in adults and children roughly reflect disease severity and treatment response, but they are not established biomarkers of disease activity or treatment outcome. Antibodies to soluble liver antigen (anti-SLA) are present in 7%-22% of patients with type 1 AIH.

### Evaluation of F-actin ELISA for the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis [^114FiptD]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Antibodies to F-actin have been proposed to increase specificity in the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). We compared the diagnostic value of a new F-actin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with the current gold standard of detection of smooth muscle antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence (SMA-IFT).

Methods

Archived sera of 47 patients with SMA positive AIH were tested with the F-actin ELISA and SMA-IFT. Prospectively collected sera of 123 patients with various liver diseases, 35 of whom had AIH, were analyzed by both assays. Different cutoff limits were considered for the F-actin ELISA (increments between 20 and 60 ELISA units) and SMA-IFT (titers of 1:40, 1:80, and 1:160).

Results

The F-actin ELISA had a sensitivity of 100% to detect all of 47 SMA positive AIH sera and the value of the ELISA units correlated with that of SMA titers (p < 0.0001). In prospective analysis, F-actin ELISA showed a superior sensitivity (74% vs 34%) and a similar specificity (98% vs 99%) and positive predictive value (88% vs 92%), compared with SMA-IFT. Combining both assays improved neither sensitivity nor specificity.

Conclusions

The new F-actin ELISA seems to be a useful diagnostic tool with similar specificity and superior sensitivity for the diagnosis of AIH, compared with standard SMA-IFT. Due to its simplicity and operator independency, the F-actin ELISA may become a preferred screening technique for detection of autoantibodies in patients with suspected AIH.

Major autoantibodies and their significance in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) (adapted from:)

SMA and ANA can be detected in various liver diseases, several extrahepatic autoimmune diseases concurrently with AIH, or in healthy individuals, and therefore they lack specificity. However, SMA of VG (staining of arterial vessels and mesangium of renal glomeruli) or VGT patterns (staining of arterial vessels, glomeruli, and intracellular fibrils in renal tubule) by IFA seem quite specific for AIH (Table 3). It should be emphasized that both SMA and ANA are only useful for AIH diagnosis, as they are not associated with prognosis and outcome. Typically, SMA are detected in association with ANA in about 50% of patients (isolated ANA or SMA in approximately 15% and 35%, respectively).

### Autoimmune hepatitis in India: profile of an uncommon disease [^116kHTDp]. BMC Gastroenterology (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

Study population

Consecutive patients with chronic or acute liver disease seen at a tertiary care center Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India from January 1999 to June 2002 were evaluated for etiology.

Clinical assessment

In all patients, a detailed history was taken and clinical examination was carried out. History of onset of illness, acute or precipitating events, blood transfusion, surgery, menstrual abnormalities, and presence of extra-hepatic manifestations of autoimmune diseases were specifically noted. Family history of autoimmune diseases was also noted.

Laboratory tests and virological assessment

All patients underwent biochemical evaluation using standard automated techniques. Liver function tests and serum proteins and serum globulins were done in all patients. HBsAg, HBeAg, Anti-HBe were measured by immunoenzymatic assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays, Hepanostika, Organon Technika, Boxtel). Anti-HCV was done using a commercially available qualitative ELISA against peptides corresponding to highly antigenic segments of core, NS3, NS4, NS5 regions of hepatitis C (UBI HCV EIA 4.0, Beijing United Biomedical Co. Ltd. China). Patients who were anti-HCV positive were further tested for HCV-RNA using a RT-PCR technique. IgM-anti HEV immunoenzymatic assays (enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays, Hepanostika, Organon Technika, Boxtel) were also done in patients presenting with acute hepatitis.

Immunoserologic assessment

Serological tests for autoantibodies antinuclear antibody (ANA), anti smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibodies (anti-LKM-1) were done using the standard immunofluorescence technique. Briefly, cryostat sections of rat liver, kidney and stomach composite block were incubated with test sera (diluted 1:10) at 37°C for 30 min. After washing thrice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 15 min each, the sections were incubated with fluoroscein isothiocyanate-conjugate rabbit anti-human polyclonal immunoglobulin (Dako, Copenhagen, Denmark) diluted 1:40 in PBS at 37°C for 30 min. The sections were washed thrice with PBS, mounted and examined under a fluorescent microscope. Titers of ANA, ASMA, and anti-LKM-1 of 1:80 or more is taken as positive in adults.

### Update of the simplified criteria for autoimmune hepatitis: evaluation of the methodology for immunoserological testing [^111igeg5]. Journal of Hepatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

The simplified criteria for the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) include immunofluorescence testing (IFT) of antinuclear and smooth muscle autoantibodies (ANA and SMA) on rodent tissue sections. We aimed to establish scoring criteria for the implementation of ANA IFT on human epithelioma-2 (HEp-2) cells and ELISA-based testing.

Methods

ANA and SMA reactivity of 61 AIH sera and 72 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease controls were separately assessed on tissue sections and HEp-2 cells to compare the diagnostic value at increasing titers. A total of 113 patients with AIH at diagnosis and 202 controls from 3 European centers were assessed by IFT as well as 3 different commercially available ANA ELISA and 1 anti-F-actin ELISA.

Results

ANA assessment by IFT on liver sections had 83.6% sensitivity and 69.4% specificity for AIH at a titer of 1:40. On HEp-2 cells, sensitivity and specificity were 75.4% and 73.6%, respectively, at an adjusted titer of 1:160. Area under the curve (AUC) values of ANA ELISA ranged from 0.70–0.87, with ELISA coated with HEp-2 extracts in addition to selected antigens performing significantly better. SMA assessment by IFT had the highest specificity for the SMA-VG/T pattern and anti-microfilament reactivity on HEp-2 cells. ELISA-based anti-F-actin evaluation was a strong predictor of AIH (AUC 0.88) and performed better than SMA assessment by IFT (AUC 0.77–0.87).

Conclusion

At adjusted cut-offs, both ANA IFT using HEp-2 cells and ELISA-based autoantibody evaluation for ANA and SMA are potential alternatives to tissue-based IFT for the diagnosis of AIH.

Lay Summary

Autoantibodies are a hallmark of autoimmune hepatitis and are traditionally tested for by immunofluorescence assays on rodent tissue sections. Herein, we demonstrate that human epithelioma cells can be used as a reliable substrate for immunofluorescence testing. ELISA-based testing is also a potentially reliable alternative for autoantibody assessment in autoimmune hepatitis. We propose the implementation of these testing methods into the simplified criteria for the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) guidance statements — diagnosis: The diagnosis of AIH requires compatible histological findings and is further supported by elevated serum aminotransaminase levels, elevated serum IgG level and/or positive serological marker(s), and exclusion of viral, hereditary, metabolic, cholestatic, and drug-induced diseases that may resemble AIH. Initial serological testing should include determinations of antinuclear antibody (ANA) and smooth muscle antibody (SMA) in adults and ANA, SMA, and anti–liver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1) in children, with consideration of additional autoantibody tests if warranted to secure the diagnosis. Diagnostically challenging cases should be reviewed by or referred to an experienced liver center prior to initiating therapy.

### Protracted, but not acute, hepatitis A virus infection is strongly associated with HLA-DRB✱1301, a marker for pediatric autoimmune hepatitis [^114RMkqm]. Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

HLA alleles are known to be associated with susceptibility to develop autoimmune hepatitis (AH), and hepatitis A virus (HAV) infection is postulated as a putative trigger for AH. We investigated whether HLA may influence the outcome of the HAV infection by studying 67 children with self-limited and 39 children with protracted forms of this infection. HLA typing of the uncomplicated forms showed no significant increase of any HLA class I or II alleles. In contrast, DRB1✱1301 was present in 46.1% of the children with protracted forms (vs. 9.8% in healthy controls; relative risk [RR]: 7.6; χ² = 33.3; P = 2 × 10⁻⁹)). In uncomplicated hepatitis, 45% developed anti-smooth muscle antibody (SMA)/actin antibodies, but only 1 child had detectable antibodies after 3 months of infection onset. In contrast, after 1 year, 69% of the patients suffering protracted forms had titers of anti-SMA/actin antibodies that ranged between 1:40 and 1:160. Within their follow-up, 2 patients developed a Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but the remaining patients showed no signs of developing autoimmune hepatitis. We conclude that the DRB1✱1301 haplotype is strongly associated with the protracted forms of HAV infection and suggest that the infection allows a sustained release of liver self-antigens. However, other still-unknown susceptibility genes are required for the full development of pediatric AH.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112oSCpy]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis — autoantibodies and serologic testing emphasize that anti‑mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are found in 95% of PBC patients, yet in approximately 5% to 10% AMA is absent or present only in low titer (≤ 1/80) by immunofluorescence, while antinuclear antibody and anti‑smooth muscle antibody are found in nearly half. Detection options include indirect immunofluorescence, immunoblotting, enzyme immunoassay, Luminex beads assay, and enzyme inhibition assay, with indirect immunofluorescence having the lowest sensitivity because over 15% of AMA‑negative sera by this method show reactivity to MIT3. Nearly all AMA‑negative PBC patients have PBC‑specific antinuclear antibodies such as sp100 and gp210, which are present in over 30% of PBC patients negative for AMA by indirect immunofluorescence; newer antibodies anti‑kelch‑like 12 and anti‑hexokinase 1 have been found in 35% and 22% of AMA‑negative PBC patients, respectively, but are not yet widely available. Longitudinally, a cohort of 229 individuals followed for up to 7 years found a 5‑year incidence rate of PBC of 16%, and only 1 in 6 patients with a positive AMA and normal ALP will develop PBC after 5 years; if liver tests are initially normal, following at 2‑ to 3‑year intervals until age 65 seems reasonable, but there are no data regarding this.

B- Anti-smooth muscle antibodies (SMA)

Anti-Smooth Muscle Antibodies were detected using solid phase enzyme immunoassays using INOVA Diagnostics (San Diego, CA) ELISA kit. Antigens coated 96 wells plates were incubated for 30 minutes with calibrators, positive and negative controls and diluted serum sample specimens. During incubation, antibody present in the test sample binds to the coated well. Following the 30 minutes incubation, the wells were washed and horseradish peroxidase-conjugate anti-human IgG was added to the wells. Then the substrate was added for 30 minutes and the reaction stopped. The optical density was measured by spectrophotometer. The cutoff was < 20 U/IU and whenever the result was positive, we performed F-actin IgG enzyme linked immunoassay kit from INOVA Diagnostics (San Diego, CA) as confirmatory test.

Alternatively, anti-SMA screening was done by Immunofluorescence assay using INOVA Diagnostics (San Diego, CA) kit, serum sample was diluted to 1:20 then added on a slide and incubated for 30 minutes. After washing, the FITC-labeled conjugate was added for 30 min incubation. After 10 min washing step, the mounting media was added and the slides were cover slipped and viewed for fluorescent patterns under florescent microscope. Observation of specific patterns on the substrate indicates the presence of anti-SMA in the test sample. A titer of Anti-SMA > 1/20 was considered positive and titer of < 1/20 was considered negative. Any time the results were positive, a confirmatory assay was done using anti-F-actin autoantibodies screening using enzyme linked immunoassay kit from INOVA Diagnostics (San Diego, CA).

Initial evaluation of suspected NAFLD — diagnostic requirements and laboratory considerations specify that the diagnosis of NAFLD requires that there is HS by imaging or histology, no significant alcohol consumption, no competing etiologies for HS, and no coexisting causes of CLD; if serum ferritin and transferrin saturation are elevated, genetic hemochromatosis should be excluded, and although the data are somewhat conflicting, serum ferritin > 1.5 upper limit of normal (ULN) was associated with more advanced fibrosis in a retrospective cohort of 628 adults; mutations in the HFE gene occur with variable frequency and the clinical significance is unclear; liver biopsy should be considered in the setting of high ferritin and a high iron saturation; low‑titer autoantibodies are common and often prompt biopsy to exclude autoimmune disease, and in a study of 864 NAFLD subjects, significant autoantibody elevations (antinuclear antibodies > 1:160 or antismooth muscle antibodies > 1:40) were present in 21% and were not associated with more advanced disease or atypical histological features.

Table 2
Common and uncommon variants and specific forms of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)

Manifestations of the disease vary considerably, from entirely asymptomatic to acute liver failure (ALF). Acute presentation occurs in about 30% of patients and is indistinguishable from viral or other causes of hepatitis. Acute AIH, either icteric or non-icteric, can present as an acute flare of chronic AIH that had not been diagnosed previously, or as a genuine episode of acute hepatitis without lesions of chronic disease on liver histology. Some of these patients can present an acute–severe type of AIH (AS-AIH) (Table 2).

Most patients (65%-70%) are either completely asymptomatic or present with general symptoms of various severity, such as weakness, fatigue, malaise, amenorrhea, lethargy, anorexia, weight loss, upper right quadrant pain, nausea, low-grade fever and polyarthralgia, usually involving the small joints, without arthritis, dating back even for years. Almost a third of adults and 40–50% of children already have cirrhosis at baseline, even though these figures seem to be declining in recent studies from several countries, including Greece, probably reflecting improvements in early diagnosis and treatment.

AIH is classified in 2 subtypes, AIH-type 1 (AIH-1) and AIH-type 2 (AIH-2), according to the circulating autoantibodies, although the importance of this distinction is still uncertain. Indeed, a recent long-term observational study in children with AIH showed that disease severity, treatment response and outcomes were not associated with the type of AIH. Patients with AIH-1 have seropositivity for antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA), smooth muscle autoantibodies (SMA) and/or soluble liver antigens/liver pancreas antibodies (anti-SLA/LP), while those with AIH-2 have seropositivity for anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibody type-1 (anti-LKM1) and/or antibodies against liver cytosol type-1 antigen (anti-LC1) or rarely anti-LKM-type 3 (anti-LKM3).

FIGURE 1
Frequency and quantity of autoantibodies in each cohort

Representative slides of epidermal, skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle autoantibodies are shown in Figure 2. In the acute non‐COVID‐19 ITU patients there were many different causes of their illness (Supporting information, Table S1) and autoantibodies were found against nearly all (12 of 13) the different autoantigens examined, indicating a more random distribution. A higher proportion of acute COVID‐19 ITU patients had autoantibodies (60 versus 41%), but to a narrower range of autoantigens (seven of 13) with a preponderance of epidermal (41%) and skeletal antibodies (17%). This preponderance was seen in convalescent, COVID‐19, post‐ITU with epidermal (19%) and skeletal antibodies (19%), but additionally cardiac muscle antibodies (28%) and smooth muscle antibodies (31%). Representative slides of epidermal, smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle autoantibodies are shown in Figure 2.

Tissue‐specific staining patterns following coronavirus 19 (COVID‐19). (a) Intracellular cement staining pattern, weak positive (P24), (b) smooth muscle staining pattern, 1/100 titre (P85), (c) skeletal muscle staining pattern, weak positive (P106), (d) cardiac muscle staining pattern demonstrating striations (P87)

In the convalescent, COVID‐19, non‐hospitalized cohort, fewer individuals had autoantibodies than the convalescent ITU cohort (54 versus 75%) and against only four autoantigens: epidermal (25%), smooth muscle (17%), ANCA (8%) and gastric parietal (4%). These results suggest that COVID‐19 infection is associated with autoantibody induction, and that these antibodies target a limited repertoire of self‐antigens.

### Diagnostic criteria of autoimmune hepatitis [^116T8zfL]. Autoimmunity Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic immune-mediated liver disorder characterised by female preponderance, elevated transaminase and immunoglobulin G levels, seropositivity for autoantibodies and interface hepatitis. Presentation is highly variable, therefore AIH should be considered during the diagnostic workup of any increase in liver enzyme levels. A set of inclusion and exclusion criteria for the diagnosis of AIH have been established by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG). There are two main types of AIH: type 1, positive for anti-nuclear (ANA) and/or anti-smooth muscle antibodies (SMAs) and type 2, defined by the presence of anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody type 1 (LKM-1) and/or anti-liver cytosol type 1 (LC-1) autoantibodies. The central role of autoantibodies in the diagnosis of AIH has led the IAIHG to produce a consensus statement detailing appropriate and effective methods for their detection. Autoantibodies should be tested by indirect immunofluorescence at an initial dilution of 1/40 in adults and 1/10 in children on a freshly prepared rodent substrate that includes kidney, liver and stomach sections to allow for the simultaneous detection of all reactivities relevant to AIH. Anti-LKM-1 is often confused with anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA) if rodent kidney is used as the sole immunofluorescence substrate. The identification of the molecular targets of anti-LKM-1 and AMA has led to the establishment of immuno-assays based on the use of the recombinant or purified autoantigens. Perinuclear anti-nuclear neutrophil antibody (p-ANNA) is an additional marker of AIH-1; anti soluble liver antigen (SLA) antibodies are specific for autoimmune liver disease, can be present in AIH-1 and AIH-2 and are associated with a more severe clinical course. Anti-SLA are detectable by ELISA or radio-immuno-assays, but not by immunofluorescence. AIH is exquisitely responsive to immunosuppressive treatment, which should be instituted promptly to prevent rapid deterioration and promote remission and long-term survival.

### Patients with typical laboratory features of autoimmune hepatitis rarely need a liver biopsy for diagnosis [^117PL1uv]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The importance of histologic analysis of biopsy samples in the diagnosis and management of patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is unclear.

Methods

Patients with AIH were identified from a 10-year database. Individuals with overlap syndromes and decompensated liver disease were excluded. The proportion of patients who fulfilled the new simplified criteria for AIH was calculated.

Results

A total of 257 patients (203 female) with a median age of 52 years (interquartile range, 39–63 y) were diagnosed with AIH. Overall, 183 of 257 (71%) were positive for antinuclear antibodies, 116 (45%) had positive smooth muscle antibodies, and 29 of 257 (11%) were seronegative. A total of 250 (97%) patients had increased levels of autoantibodies and/or γ-globulins. In 95% (243 of 257 cases), the histology was compatible with AIH whereas 5% (14 cases) had atypical histology. Overall, 77% had a score of at least 6, indicating probable or definite AIH according to most recent criteria; 22% were diagnosed with AIH with less than 6 points and 1 patient had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis based on biopsy analysis. Immunosuppression occurred in 93% of patients. Patients with atypical versus compatible histology were similar in terms of seronegativity or γ-globulins; 86% (12 of 14) received immunosuppressive therapy despite atypical histology.

Conclusions

Most patients with features of AIH, based on laboratory analyses, are likely to have a compatible liver histology. Few patients have atypical histology and these findings have little impact on patient management. These findings indicate biopsy samples might not need to be collected from patients who meet other clinical criteria for AIH.

### Striational antibodies in a paraneoplastic context [^117XP7WM]. Muscle & Nerve (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

The clinical significance of striational antibodies (StrAbs) detected in the course of paraneoplastic antibody testing is unknown.

Methods

We compared all 203 striational antibody (StrAb)-seropositive patients identified (2004–2005) during evaluation for paraneoplastic antibodies with age- and sex-matched seronegative controls.

Results

Thymoma and myasthenia gravis (MG) were significantly more common among cases (P < 0.0001). Cancers more rarely detected after StrAb detection were adenocarcinoma in 5 patients and sarcoma in 3 patients. All patients who had a cancer identified after StrAb testing had a titer of ≥ 1:7680 or a coexisting muscle AChR-binding antibody. Autoimmune disorders more commonly observed among cases (with any StrAb value) included: hypothyroidism; rheumatoid arthritis; and pernicious anemia (all P < 0.05).

Conclusions

StrAbs may serve as a diagnostic clue for an autoimmune diagnosis. There is a low likelihood of oncological significance in patients with StrAb titers < 1:7680 without coexisting paraneoplastic Abs.

### Diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis in adults and children: 2019 practice guidance and guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^113YDrvd]. Hepatology (2020). High credibility.

Diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) — diagnostic requisites and subtypes — is based on histology, laboratories, and autoantibodies: the diagnosis is based on histological abnormalities (interface hepatitis), characteristic clinical and laboratory findings (elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT] levels and increased serum IgG concentration), and the presence of one or more characteristic autoantibodies. AIH lacks a signature diagnostic marker, and the diagnosis requires characteristic features and the exclusion of other diseases that may resemble it. There are two types of AIH based on autoantibodies: type 1 characterized by antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and/or smooth muscle antibodies (SMA)/anti-actin antibodies, and type 2 characterized by antibodies to liver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1), usually in the absence of ANA and SMA. In addition, up to 20% of AIH cases are negative for ANA, SMA, and LKM1 autoantibodies despite other characteristic features (seronegative AIH); if seronegative AIH is suspected, other autoantibodies may be sought. Classification of AIH into types assists in management and aids in predicting outcomes in children, but it may be less informative in adults.

### Autoantibodies to vascular smooth muscle are pathogenic for vasculitis [^112HUBKv]. The American Journal of Pathology (2005). Low credibility.

We have previously shown that microvascular smooth muscle activates CD4+ T lymphocytes in sterile co-culture, presents antigen, and produces inflammatory cytokines. Adoptive transfer of lymphocytes co-cultured with syngeneic smooth muscle cells to healthy recipient mice results in vasculitic lesions predominantly in postcapillary venules. The present study assessed the pathogenic role of immunoglobulin and B cells in a murine model of vasculitis. Here, we show that transferred B cells, including plasmablast cells, accumulated, persisted, and proliferated in lung and secondary lymphoid organs of recipient mice. The induction of vasculitis was accompanied by production of IgM and IgG2a autoantibodies specific for vascular smooth muscle intracellular antigens. Circulating immunoglobulin had a pathogenic role in this vasculitis model, because the disease could be induced by transfer of serum from vasculitic mice to untreated animals but not by transfer of serum depleted of anti-smooth muscle autoantibodies. Additionally, the pathogenic mechanisms triggered by the transfer of vasculitogenic serum were dependent on T lymphocytes because both wild-type and B cell-deficient mice developed the disease after serum transfer, whereas RAG2-deficient mice did not. Thus, immunoglobulin and cell-mediated pathways work in concert to produce vasculitis in this model.

### Easy recognition and high autoimmune hepatitis specificity of smooth muscle antibodies giving an actin microfilament immunofluorescent pattern on embryonal vascular smooth muscle cells [^117KdcuE]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2024). Medium credibility.

Smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) with anti-microfilament actin (MF-SMA) specificity are regarded as highly specific markers of type 1 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH-1) but their recognition relying on immunofluorescence of vessel, glomeruli, and tubules (SMA-VGT pattern) in rodent kidney tissue, is restricted by operator-dependent interpretation. A gold standard method for their identification is not available. We assessed and compared the diagnostic accuracy for AIH-1 of an embryonal aorta vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cell line-based assay with those of the rodent tissue-based assay for the detection of MF-SMA pattern in AIH-1 patients and controls. Sera from 138 AIH-1 patients and 295 controls (105 primary biliary cholangitis, 40 primary sclerosing cholangitis, 50 chronic viral hepatitis, 20 alcohol-related liver disease, 40 steatotic liver disease, and 40 healthy controls) were assayed for MF-SMA and SMA-VGT using VSM-based and rodent tissue-based assays, respectively. MF-SMA and SMA-VGT were found in 96 (70%) and 87 (63%) AIH-1 patients, and 2 controls (P < 0.0001). Compared with SMA-VGT, MF-SMA showed similar specificity (99%), higher sensitivity (70% vs 63%, P = ns) and likelihood ratio for a positive test (70 vs 65). Nine (7%) AIH-1 patients were MF-SMA positive despite being SMA-VGT negative. Overall agreement between SMA-VGT and MF-SMA was 87% (kappa coefficient 0.870, [0.789–0.952]). MF-SMA were associated with higher serum γ-globulin [26 (12–55) vs 20 g/l (13–34), P < 0.005] and immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels [3155 (1296–7344) vs 2050 mg/dl (1377–3357), P < 0.002]. The easily recognizable IFL MF-SMA pattern on VSM cells strongly correlated with SMA-VGT and has an equally high specificity for AIH-1. Confirmation of these results in other laboratories would support the clinical application of the VSM cell-based assay for reliable detection of AIH-specific SMA.

On physical examination, he had a temperature of 37.4 °C, pulse of 80 beats per minute, blood pressure of 119/65 mmHg, respiratory rate of 16/min, and normal oxygenation on ambient air. His weight was 63 kg with a BMI 22.6 kg/m 2. He exhibited conjunctival icterus and jaundice of the skin. The abdomen was soft without tenderness or hepatosplenomegaly. There were no stigmata of chronic or advanced liver disease. He had no signs of hepatic encephalopathy.

Lab testing for liver disease were performed (Table 1). Anti-nuclear antibody titer, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-liver-kidney-microsomal antibody were negative. Active viral hepatitides A, B, C, and E were excluded. CMV IgG was previously positive prior to infliximab administration, with subsequent IgM testing that was equivocal; testing for EBV IgM was negative with positive nuclear antigen and IgG; and testing for HSV-1 and HSV-2 (quantitative assays) were negative (undetectable viral load). HFE gene testing revealed one mutation of H63D, which was not deemed clinically significant. Additional lab results are reported in Table 1.

### Autoantibodies in chronic hepatitis C virus infection and their association with disease profile [^112qscXM]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2009). Low credibility.

Autoantibodies are commonly detected in chronic hepatitis C (HCV) but their significance remains uncertain. We assessed the prevalence of anti-nuclear (ANA) and anti-smooth muscle (ASM) antibodies within a cohort of 963 treatment-naïve HCV patients. We also assessed for differences between autoantibody-positive and autoantibody-negative patients in demographics, markers of disease activity and response to anti-viral treatment. One hundred and seventy-two patients (17.9%) had at least one autoantibody, of which were 104 (10.8%) ASM, 54 (5.6%) ANA and 14 (1.5%) positive for both. Autoantibody-positive patients were older (43 vs 39 years, P = 0.001) caused by an age-related increase in ANA (but not ASM). There were no differences in gender, alcohol intake, ethnicity or viral genotype. The presence of autoantibodies, and specifically ASM, was associated with an increase in interface hepatitis score amongst men (1.1 vs 0.8, P = 0.005) but no difference in other necroinflammatory measures, liver function tests or immunoglobulins (Ig). There was no difference in initial fibrosis stage or rate of fibrosis progression. Autoantibodies did not affect response to anti-viral treatment. We conclude that autoantibodies are frequent in HCV infection. Anti-nuclear antibodies increase with age, whereas ASM antibodies are associated with interface hepatitis in men. Neither autoantibody carries increased risk of fibrosis progression or failure of therapy.

### Prevalence of non-organ-specific autoantibodies in a rural community from northeastern Brazil: a population-based study [^112NXMJY]. Human Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Non-organ-specific autoantibodies (NOSA) are well-recognized diagnostic markers of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), but can also be observed in patients with viral hepatitis as well as in healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of NOSA in subjects living in a rural community in Brazil and to correlate their occurrence with the presence of liver disease. Seven hundred twenty-five apparently healthy subjects were randomly selected for assessment of antinuclear (ANA), anti-smooth muscle (SMA), antimitochondrial (AMA), anti-liver/kidney microsome type 1, and anti-liver cytosol type 1 antibodies. Subjects with those NOSA were evaluated for the presence of AIH, PBC, and viral hepatitis. Reactivities for all NOSA, SMA, ANA, and AMA were detected, respectively, in 14, 10, 4, and 0.1% of subjects, with a mean titer of 1:40. NOSA-positive subjects were significantly older and more frequently females. No correlation was observed between the occurrence of NOSA and PBC, AIH, or viral hepatitis. The prevalence of NOSA in Brazilians was 14%. They were usually low titer. NOSA were more frequently observed in females and older subjects and their presence was not correlated with the presence of AIH, PBC, or viral hepatitis.

### North American society for pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition position paper on the diagnosis and management of pediatric acute liver failure [^113LkfJ8]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2022). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) and autoantibody-positive pediatric ALF — serology and treatment: Liver serologic markers associated with autoimmune liver disease, including anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and liver-kidney microsomal (LKM) antibody, are positive in 28% of children with ALF, and the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis should generally be considered in any patient outside the neonatal period presenting with ALF; corticosteroids can mitigate liver injury in many patients and, while steroid treatment did not improve survival overall in autoantibody positive children, the sub-group of patients with a known diagnosis of AIH had improved outcomes.

### Hellenic Association for the Study of the Liver (HASL): revised clinical practice guidelines for autoimmune hepatitis [^113o4zeN]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Anti-SLA/LP antibodies carry very high specificity for AIH diagnosis, albeit low sensitivity, but they do not characterize a specific subgroup of patients with AIH (Table 3). Patients with anti-SLA/LP may need permanent immunosuppression, as many of them relapse after treatment withdrawal. A specific characteristic of anti-SLA/LP is its concurrence with autoantibodies against the ribonucleoprotein 52kDa/Sjögren's syndrome A antigen in almost all anti-SLA/LP-positive European and North American patients.

Anti-LKM1 and anti-LC1 often coexist in patients with AIH-2, but they are not specific, as they can be observed in patients with HCV (the anti-LKM3 in chronic hepatitis D). Apart from IFA, anti-LKM1, anti-LKM3 and anti-LC1 antibodies can also be detected by other validated techniques (ELISAs or immunoblotting). In case of diagnostic problems between anti-LKM1/3 and AMA by IFA, complementary specific ELISAs or immunoblot are recommended.

A perinuclear pattern of anti-neutrophil nuclear antibodies (pANNA), also known as "atypical" perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, is detected frequently by IFA almost exclusively in AIH-1 patients. However, very few patients with AIH-1 have isolated pANNA and therefore, it should only be performed in patients who have tested negative for ANA, SMA, and anti-SLA/LP.

Negative results, besides clinical suspicion, justify additional specific investigation and repeated testing, preferably in a reference laboratory, as the titers may vary during the disease course (Fig. 1).

In adults, clinically significant titers for ANA, SMA, anti-LKM1 and anti-LC1 are ≥ 1:40 (≥ 1:20 for ANA or SMA and ≥ 1:10 for anti-LKM1 or anti-LC1 in children). Monitoring of autoantibody titers is not recommended in adults, but might be of clinical significance in children and adolescents.

The routine laboratories should comply with the guidelines in reporting the techniques and cutoffs for positivity. This information should be clearly given to physicians in order to assist them in the interpretation of the results. It is also pivotal that the laboratory report should provide all patterns of renal reactivity of SMA, as SMA of VG or VGT patterns have the highest diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of AIH.

### Low incidence of positive smooth muscle antibody and high incidence of isolated IgM elevation in Chinese patients with autoimmune hepatitis And primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome: a retrospective study [^111W7eyP]. BMC Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

Serum autoantibodies have steadily established themselves as critical biomarkers for the diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. For the North-American and European population, ANA and SMA constitute the standard repertoire for the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis, and AMA is the diagnostic marker of primary biliary cirrhosis. In our study, the majority of patients had positive serum ANA (140/146) and AMA (129/146), whereas only minor patients (14/146) had positive serum SMA. This result showed that, there was a low incidence of positive serum SMA in Chinese patients with overlap syndrome of AIH and PBC, which might indicate that serum SMA may have little diagnostic significance in the overlap syndrome for Chinese patients. This finding agreed with another investigation performed by Zhenxia Liu.

Some studies had shown that the serum immunoglobulins could elevate in most cases of autoimmune liver diseases and types of the elevated immunoglobulins were distinctive in different categories of autoimmune liver diseases. IgG was the predominant immunoglobulin elevated in serum of AIH patients while IgM was elevated in most patients with PBC. However, in our study, isolated IgM elevation was preponderant (37/89), which presented with features of PBC. Previously, a German study showed that patients with overlap syndrome of AIH and PBC presented with typical features of PBC when compared to AIH and PBC patients. The reason, we inferred, might be that serological markers were often featured with one predominant pathological change to the other in overlap syndrome. But how to distinguish the predominant one needed further studies.

### Cutting edge issues in autoimmune hepatitis [^111Trsik]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2012). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is an inflammatory liver disease affecting mainly females and characterised histologically by interface hepatitis, biochemically by elevated transaminase levels and serologically by circulating autoantibodies and increased levels of immunoglobulin G. Autoimmune hepatitis responds to immunosuppressive treatment, which should be instituted as soon as diagnosis is made. Seropositivity for smooth muscle and/or antinuclear antibody defines type 1 autoimmune hepatitis, while positivity for liver kidney microsomal type 1 antibody defines type 2 autoimmune hepatitis. The aetiology of autoimmune hepatitis is unknown, though both genetic and environmental factors are involved in its expression. The major mechanism of liver damage involves immune reactions against host liver antigens that are not adequately controlled by defective regulatory T cells. Current research aiming at potentiating regulatory T cell function in vitro to reconstitute tolerance in vivo has given promising results.

### Commentary: tolvaptan for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)-an update [^111uCGBW]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Investigations for other causes, whilst tolvaptan is withdrawn, may include:

Viral hepatitis: Hepatitis A virus antibody (IgM), Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (Anti-HBs), Hepatitis C virus antibody (with polymerase chain (PCR) if positive), Hepatitis E virus antibody (IgM), Cytomegalovirus (CMV) antibody (IgM), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) antibody (IgM)
Autoimmune conditions: Antinuclear antibody (ANA), Antimitochondrial antibody (AMA), Smooth muscle antibody (SMA)
Iron studies: Ferritin, Transferrin saturation (TSAT)
Immunoglobulins: IgA, IgG, IgM
Imaging: Ultrasound

Elevated liver enzymes typically return to normal after stopping tolvaptan and severe DILI is rare. Observable changes in liver enzymes may be delayed as the half-life for ALT is around 2 days and bilirubin is 17–21 days. If clinically warranted, the frequency of blood tests should be adjusted based on healthcare professional's judgement. In people with ADPKD who develop DILI upon resuming tolvaptan, it should be stopped and re-exposure should not be attempted.

### The prevalence of autoantibodies and autoimmune hepatitis in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [^111BCAVJ]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

Autoantibodies may exist in serum of patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) although their prevalence and clinical significance is uncertain. We aimed at examining the prevalence of autoantibodies and autoimmune hepatitis among patients with NAFLD.

Methods

Prevalence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-smooth muscle antibodies (anti-SMA), and autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) based on the International AIH Group were determined in 225 patients with liver biopsy-proven NAFLD.

Results

Fifty-one patients [23% (95% CI 17.3–28.2%)] had autoantibodies in serum which is significantly higher than the prevalence in the general population. ANA were present in 46 patients (20%), SMA in 6 (3%), and both antibodies in one patient. Positive autoantibodies were associated with higher fibrosis stage (p = 0.03), higher inflammatory grade (p = 0.02), and higher levels of gammaglobulin (p = 0.01). Prior to liver biopsy, 45 of the 51 (88%) patients with positive autoantibodies fulfilled diagnostic criteria for 'probable' or 'definite' AIH. After liver biopsy, however, only four patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria.

Conclusions

Routinely measured autoantibodies are present in one quarter of patients with NAFLD and are associated with more severe histological damage. Liver biopsy is required to rule out AIH in most NAFLD patients with positive autoantibodies.

### Antismooth muscle and antiactin antibodies are indirect markers of histological and biochemical activity of autoimmune hepatitis [^112BrcV5]. Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Reactivity and titers of autoantibodies vary during the course of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and some autoantibodies have been associated with disease activity and adverse outcomes after treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the autoantibody behavior in AIH and its significance as predictors of biochemical and histological remission. A total of 117 patients with AIH (mean age 18.6 [4–69] years) were evaluated and tested for autoantibodies at disease onset and successively (mean 3.2 [2–6] times) after a mean follow-up evaluation of 70 [20–185] months. Antismooth muscle (ASMA), antiliver kidney microsome type 1 (anti-LKM1), antiliver cytosol type 1 (anti-LC1), antimitochondrial, antinuclear (ANA), and antiactin antibodies (AAA) were determined at disease onset and 379 other times during the follow-up evaluation through indirect immunofluorescence in rodent tissues, HEp-2 cells, and human fibroblasts. Anti-SLA/LP were assessed 45 times in the follow-up evaluation of 19 patients using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Upon admission, AIH types 1 and 2 were observed in 95 and 17 patients, respectively. Five subjects had AIH with anti-SLA/LP as the sole markers. Patients initially negative for AAA did not develop these antibodies thereafter. ANA were detected de novo in six and three subjects with AIH types 1 and 2, respectively. After treatment, only ASMA (> 1:80) and AAA (> 1:40) were significantly associated with biochemical (76.9% and 79.8%) and histological features (100% and 100%) of disease activity (P < 0.001).

Conclusion

With the exception of ANA, the autoantibody profile does not markedly vary in the course of AIH. The persistence of high titers of ASMA and/or AAA in patients with AIH is associated with disease activity.

### Autoimmune hepatitis: a classic autoimmune liver disease [^113dxnFy]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2014). Low credibility.

AIH is characterized by chronic inflammation of the liver, interface hepatitis, hypergammaglobulinemia, and production of autoantibodies. Based on the nature of the serum autoantibodies, two types of AIH are recognized: type 1 (AIH-1), positive for ANA and/or anti-smooth muscle antibody, and type 2 (AIH-2), defined by the positivity for anti-liver kidney microsomal type 1 antibody or for anti-liver cytosol type 1 antibody. AIH demonstrates a female preponderance with the female-to-male ratio of 4:1 in AIH-1 and 10:1 in AIH-2. Several genes confer susceptibility to AIH and influence clinical manifestation, response to treatment, and overall prognosis. Most are located within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, which is involved in the presentation of antigenic peptides to T cells and thus in the initiation of adaptive immune responses. The strongest associations are found within the HLA-DRB1 locus. In patients with increased genetic susceptibility to AIH, immune responses to liver autoantigens could be triggered by molecular mimicry. Because of molecular mimicry, different environmental agents, drugs, and viruses might produce AIH. In AIH, T cells are numerically and functionally impaired, permitting the perpetuation of effector immune responses with ensuing persistent liver destruction. AIH is rare but highly treatable inflammatory condition of the liver. Subclinical and asymptomatic disease is common. AIH therefore needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis of all patients with elevated liver enzymes. Clinical response to immunosuppressive therapy is characteristic and supports the diagnosis.

### Guideline review: EASL clinical practice guidelines: drug-induced liver injury (DILI) [^114vfqwf]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Patients with DILI should undergo testing for hepatotropic viruses including hepatitis (A–E), particularly in those with acute hepatocellular injury. For completeness an autoantibody screen (antinuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA)), M2-anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA), liver microsomal antibody, immunoglobulins) should be undertaken. DILI assessment should also include coagulation profiles, as elevated prothrombin time ratio values may suggest impending acute liver failure (ALF) and prompt referral to a liver transplant unit should be considered.

Abdominal ultrasound should be undertaken in all patients suspected of DILI to exclude any biliary, parenchymal or vasculopathy, additional imaging is dependent on the clinical context.

Liver biopsy may be reasonable to consider in DILI, as histology may provide information pertaining to severity of liver injury and provide mechanistic insights by identifying specific patterns of injury. Liver biopsy is also warranted in those patients suspected of DILI when serology raises the possibility of autoimmune hepatitis. Liver biopsy may also be considered in patients whereby suspected DILI progresses, or fails to resolve on withdrawal of the causal agent, since histology may provide prognostic information assisting clinical decision particularly regarding immunosuppression. There are characteristic histological patterns associated with individual check-point inhibitors including presence of ring granulomas and endotheliitis which may aid decision making around immunosuppression. In select cases of DILI, human leucocyte antigen genotyping can be used, whereby genetic determination may aid diagnosis and management, particularly those with features compatible with autoimmune hepatitis.

Given the non-specific nature of traditionally employed liver enzyme measurements there is increasing interest in determining novel serum biomarkers. These markers include glutamate dehydrogenase, keratin 18, glutathione S-transferase, sorbitol dehydrogenase, bile acids, cytochrome P450 and osteopontin. These markers may help to improve the specificity of DILI diagnosis, and aid prognostication. Presently, however, none are routinely employed, but represent exciting future avenues of research.

Rechallenging patients who had initial drug-related liver injury can lead to rapid, progressive liver insult often worse than previous with fulminant hepatic failure. A positive rechallenge is defined as an ALT > 3 ULN and is the strongest proof of drug causality. Some essential, irreplaceable medications may be used to rechallenge patients including; antituberculous and chemotherapy agents, however, this should only be considered with meticulous monitoring arrangements under specialist supervision.

### Autoimmune hepatitis: serum autoantibodies in clinical practice [^114P7va3]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by loss of tolerance towards hepatic autoantigens, leading to an autoimmune attack to the liver. Clinical features of the disease include female preponderance, elevated serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, positive circulating autoantibodies, interface hepatitis at liver histology, and a swift response to corticosteroid treatment. AIH affects all ages and races, and is subdivided into type 1 (AIH-1) and type 2 AIH (AIH-2): AIH-1 is by far more common and affects both children and adults, whereas AIH-2 is mainly a paediatric disease. AIH-1 is characterized by positive anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and/or anti-smooth muscle antibody (SMA), whereas AIH-2 is characterized by positive anti-liver kidney microsomal antibody type 1 (LMK1) and/or anti-liver cytosol type 1 (LC1) antibody. AIH presentation is variable: it can present acutely with symptoms resembling those of viral hepatitis, e.g. malaise, nausea/vomiting, anorexia, joint and abdominal pain, accompanied by jaundice, dark urine, and pale stools; with fulminant hepatic failure and encephalopathy; insidiously, with non–specific symptoms (progressive fatigue, amenorrhea, headache, anorexia, joint and abdominal pain, diarrhoea, weight loss), lasting from 6 months to a few years before diagnosis; with established chronic liver disease and complications of cirrhosis and portal hypertension (hematemesis from oesophageal/gastric varices, bleeding diathesis, splenomegaly), without a previous history of jaundice or liver disease; and at times is diagnosed after an incidental finding of abnormal transaminase levels, without hepatic symptoms or signs. AIH therefore should be excluded in all patients for whom a clear alternative diagnosis is not reached.

### High prevalence of autoantibodies in hepatitis A infection: the impact on laboratory profiles [^116nu4T3]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

In the absence of IgM antibodies against hepatitis A virus (HAV), HAV infections can be regarded as autoimmune hepatitis when they show positive autoantibodies by indirect immunofluorescence and lack other viral markers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence, titres and impact of autoantibodies in Korean patients with HAV infection.

Methods

The study involved a retrospective review of the electronic medical records of 73 patients with HAV at Konkuk University Hospital from August 2005 to September 2008. The presence and pattern of anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody, anti-mitochondrial antibody and anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibody were assessed by indirect immunofluorescence on Hep-2 cells and mouse/kidney sections.

Results

Of the 73 patients with hepatitis A, 65 (89.0%) showed positive indirect immunofluorescence tests. Of note, most of the positive tests (95.5%) showed a cytoplasmic pattern with filamentous staining of cytoplasmic fibres. There was no significant difference between groups in age or sex. In patients positive for autoantibodies, alanine aminotransferase and leucocyte count were significantly higher, while the increase in globulin was not statistically significant. In terms of titres, globulin was significantly higher in patients with ≥ 1:160 titres than in those with ≤ 1:80 titres (mean (SD) 3.4 (0.5) versus 2.8 (0.4) g/dl, respectively; p = 0.000).

Conclusions

The study demonstrated a high prevalence of anticytoplasmic autoantibodies in patients with acute hepatitis A. These data would be useful to aid interpretation of indirect immunofluorescence testing in patients with acute hepatitis, especially in areas with a high prevalence of HAV.

### Acute liver failure guidelines [^1139M4Yt]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Table 5 — etiologies of acute liver failure — details typical presentations, laboratory patterns, and timing cues across major causes. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity often follows ingestion of > 10 g and can show marked transaminase elevation with relatively low bilirubin, with rapid progression to ALF accompanied by hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and renal failure within 72–96 hr. Idiosyncratic drug-induced liver injury is not necessarily dose dependent with highly variable latency, and antimicrobials followed by complementary and alternative medications are common culprits. Viral hepatitis notes that hepatitis A, B, and E virus infections are most common and a viral prodrome often precedes ALF; prognosis is reported as Variable (favorable for HAV, but poor for HBV, and HEV during pregnancy). Pregnancy-related ALF commonly involves HELLP syndrome or acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP), both occurring in the third trimester or immediately postpartum, with a hepatocellular pattern and median AST/ALT > 10× ULN. Autoimmune hepatitis shows a predominantly hepatocellular pattern with marked transaminase elevation and elevated anti-nuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle actin antibody, and immunoglobulin G levels. Wilson disease may have modest transaminase elevation with normal or very low alkaline phosphatase and can present with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and rapid progression to renal failure. Mushroom poisoning presents with severe gastroenteritis at 6–12 hr after ingestion, evolving hepatotoxicity within 24–36 hr, and progressive liver and multiorgan failure within 4–7 d. Budd-Chiari syndrome most commonly affects women in their fourth to fifth decades of life; laboratory findings include transaminase elevation in the 1000s and an AST:ALT ratio that often exceeds 1.

### Antibodies to filamentous actin (F-actin) in type 1 autoimmune hepatitis [^112U8SgV]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2006). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the diagnostic significance of anti-filamentous actin antibodies (A-FAA) assessed with a commercial ELISA in comparison with immunofluorescence reactivity and patterns of anti-smooth muscle antibodies (SMA); and to correlate A-FAA positivity with clinical, immunogenetic, laboratory, and histological features in patients with autoimmune hepatitis type 1 (AIH-1).

Methods

We studied 78 consecutive untreated AIH-1 patients and 160 controls: 22 with autoimmune hepatitis type 2 (AIH-2), 51 with hepatitis C, 17 with coeliac disease (CD), 20 with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and 50 blood donors. SMA was evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) on frozen sections of rat tissues, and A-FAA with a modified commercial ELISA.

Results

SMA was detected by IIF in 61 (78%) of 78 AIH-1 patients, of whom 47 (60%) had the SMA-T/G and 14 (18%) the SMA-V pattern. Of the pathological controls, 32 (20%) had the SMA-V pattern (25 with hepatitis C, 2 with AIH-2, 2 with PBC, 3 with CD). A-FAA were present in 55 AIH-1 patients (70.5%; 46 with SMA-T/G, 7 with SMA-V, and 2 SMA-negative), and in 10 controls (6%), of whom five had hepatitis C, two AIH-2, two PBC and one CD. The association between A-FAA and the SMA-T/G pattern was statistically significant (p < 0.0001). A-FAA levels were higher in SMA-T/G positive than SMA-V positive AIH-1 patients and controls (p < 0.0001). A-FAA positivity was significantly associated with higher gamma-globulin and IgG levels, but did not correlate with other considered parameters.

Conclusion

The modified A-FAA ELISA strictly correlates with the SMA-T/G pattern and is a reliable and operator independent assay for AIH-1. Detection of A-FAA, even if devoid of prognostic relevance, may be useful when interpretative doubts of standard IIF arise.

### APASL clinical practice guidance: the diagnosis and management of patients with primary biliary cholangitis [^115mE2Rc]. Hepatology International (2022). High credibility.

Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) features — epidemiology and diagnosis: The prevalence of PBC with AIH features is approximately 5–15% of all PBC patients, and AMA can also be detected in 5–35% of patients with well-established AIH. According to the "Paris Criteria", to diagnose the PBC with AIH features, the patients must meet at least two of each three criteria of PBC and AIH; for PBC these are serum ALP levels at least two times ULN or serum GGT levels at least five times ULN, the presence of AMA and/or AMA-M2, and a liver biopsy showing florid duct lesions; for AIH these are ALT levels at least five times ULN, serum IgG levels at least two times ULN OR the presence of anti-smooth muscle antibody (ASMA), and a liver biopsy showing moderate/severe interface hepatitis (mandatory). However, ASMA positivity is less frequent and serum IgG levels are seldom above 2 × ULN in the Asia-Pacific region, and a study from China showed that serum IgG levels ≥ 1.3 × ULN had a 60% sensitivity and a 97% specificity for PBC with AIH features compared with "Paris Criteria" (IgG levels ≥ 2 × ULN). Muratori et al. found that simultaneous positivity for AMA and anti-dsDNA had a 98% specificity for diagnosis, and authors from Europe and the US strongly discourage using the AIH scoring system (IAIHG 1999) or the simplified score (IAIHG 2008) for diagnosing PBC with AIH features. Recommendation 20 states: The diagnosis of PBC with AIH features could be made in PBC patients if two of the following criteria are met: (1) moderate/severe interface hepatitis in liver histology (mandatory); (2) serum ALT/AST more than 5 times ULN; and (3) Ig G level more than 1.3 times ULN or the presence of ASMA.

### Serum autoantibodies in silicosis and non-silicosis cement workers [^113eQi9m]. American Journal of Industrial Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To study serum autoantibodies and immunoglobulin levels in cement workers.

Methods

Blood samples for numerous antibodies were collected from 30 silicosis and 42 non-silicosis cement workers. Spirometry of the silicosis workers was also studied.

Results

Serum IgA mean level showed a significant increase in the silicosis group compared to the non-silicosis group. Elevated titers of serum anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) and anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) were detected only in the silicosis group. The duration of exposure showed a significant positive correlation with serum IgA, ASMA and anti-GBM, and a significant negative correlation with serum IgG. Serum anti-GBM showed a significant positive correlation with IgG while the inverse titer (1/titer) of anti-GBM showed highly significant positive correlations with serum IgA and ASMA. The percent predicted FVC was the ventilatory function most closely associated with immunological parameters in silicosis group.

Conclusion

Serum IgA, ASMA, and anti-GBM are the principal immunologic parameters associated with silicosis.

### Screening for autoantibodies in chronic hepatitis C patients has no effect on treatment initiation or outcome [^112dTa3N]. Journal of Viral Hepatitis (2013). Low credibility.

Autoantibodies in hepatitis C virus-infected patients may indicate autoimmune hepatitis or other immune-mediated diseases. This may impact safety and efficacy of interferon-based therapy of chronic hepatitis C. We investigated the association between a positive test result for a variety of autoantibodies and the initiation and efficacy of therapy for chronic hepatitis C. We analysed an observational cohort of 24 306 patients for an association between autoantibodies and treatment outcome. 8241 patients were tested simultaneously for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), liver kidney microsomal antibodies (LKM), smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) and antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA). Matched-pair analysis was performed matching one autoantibody-positive patient to three controls. Control patients had negative tests for all four antibodies. Analyses were performed for patients with a single positive autoantibody test and for patients with multiple positive autoantibody tests. A positive test result for ANA, LKM, SMA or AMA did not affect the physician's decision to initiate therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. In addition, a positive test for one or multiple autoantibodies did not adversely affect sustained virologic response. There was no difference in fibrosis stage or alanine transaminase at baseline or during therapy irrespective of antibody status. Thyroid dysfunction was more frequent in patients with positive LKM antibodies (P = 0.004). Initiation of therapy for chronic hepatitis C and outcome were not affected by the presence of ANA, LKM, SMA or AMA. Routine testing of these autoantibodies seems not warranted. Determination of autoantibodies should be guided by individualized clinical decisions.

### Autoimmune hepatitis [^113BXUJs]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2009). Low credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis is characterized by inflammatory liver histology, circulating nonorgan-specific autoantibodies, and increased levels of immunoglobulin G, in the absence of a known etiology. Two types of juvenile autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) are recognized according to seropositivity for smooth muscle and/or anti-nuclear antibody (AIH type 1) or liver kidney microsomal antibody (AIH type 2). There is a female predominance in both. AIH type 2 presents more acutely, at a younger age and commonly with immunoglobulin A deficiency, whereas duration of symptoms before diagnosis, clinical signs, family history of autoimmunity, presence of associated autoimmune disorders, response to treatment, and long-term prognosis are similar in the 2 groups. Immunosuppressive treatment with steroids and azathioprine, which should be instituted promptly to avoid progression to cirrhosis, induces remission in 80% of cases. Relapses are common, often due to nonadherence. Drugs effective in refractory cases include cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil. Long-term treatment is usually required, with only some 20% of AIH type 1 patients able to discontinue therapy successfully. In childhood, sclerosing cholangitis with strong autoimmune features, including interface hepatitis and serological features identical to AIH type 1, is as prevalent as AIH, but it affects boys and girls equally. Differential diagnosis relies on cholangiographic studies. In autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis liver parenchymal damage responds satisfactorily to immunosuppressive treatment, whereas bile duct disease tends to progress. In this article we review the state of the art of diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment for children with AIH.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^114f5qLA]. Gut (2025). Medium credibility.

Overlapping features

Of patients with AIH, about 10% each have pruritus, raised serum alkaline phosphatase and serum anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA). Also, 7–25% have coincidental biliary injury (some with destructive bile duct lesions) on liver biopsy, characteristic of PBC.

The presence of one such feature would not usually in itself undermine a diagnosis of AIH. Also, patients with PBC, with

marked interface hepatitis, exist without these being true variant syndromes. However, the more features that are

present, the more robust the designation of an AIH-PBC variant syndrome. Features can also evolve. Patients with

AIH who were positive for AMA are more likely than AMA-negative patients to develop bile duct damage on follow-up biopsy.

Conversely, interface hepatitis, (classically associated with, though not specific for, AIH, see table 3), is present in up to 50% of patients with PBC and might be severe in 10%. These patients are more likely to develop progressive fibrosis.

Diagnostic criteria and prevalence

Given these features, diagnosis of AIH-PBC variant syndrome is challenging and cannot reliably be made using the IAIHG scoring systems for AIH. Specific diagnostic criteria have been developed but remain arbitrary as there is no gold standard against which to validate them. For example, the 'Paris' criteria include at least two of three 'typical' criteria for both PBC and for AIH.

For PBC:

Serum ALP > 2× or γ-GGT > 5× upper limit of normal (ULN) values.
Positive antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA).
Liver biopsy showing florid bile duct lesions.

For AIH:

Serum ALT at least 5× ULN.
Serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels at least 2× ULN.
Positive anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA).
Liver biopsy showing moderate or severe interface activity.

These criteria have sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 97%, respectively, in cohorts considered to have a 'clinical' diagnosis of both AIH and PBC.EASL have endorsed them, but have made the requirement for interface hepatitis (ie, extending into the lobule) more explicit. They might not identify patients with milder cholestatic abnormalities. Using the Paris criteria, 9–14% of patients with PBC also had AIH.

A new scoring system to identify patients with PBC/AIH overlap reports a sensitivity of 98.5% and specificity of 92.8%, but this requires further validation.

### A case of paraneoplastic subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus in a patient with metastatic melanoma [^113c3ray]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Fig 1
A case of paraneoplastic subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus in a 70-year-old man. Clinical images of pink and red papules and plaques on the (A) forearm and (B) chest, (B) confluent patches of hypo- and depigmentation on the chest, and (C) confluent patches of hyperpigmentation on the scalp.

Laboratory evaluation, including a complete blood cell count, liver function tests, basic metabolic panel, and urinalysis, was unremarkable. Serologic studies were positive for antinuclear antibody at a titer of 1:640 with a homogeneous and speckled pattern, anti-Ro (SS-A) antibody of 76 (normal value, ≤ 20), and anti–smooth muscle antibody at a titer of 1:160 and negative for anti–double-stranded DNA, anti-La (SS-B) antibody, anti-Sm, and antiribonucleoprotein. A punch biopsy performed on one of the plaques showed vacuolar interface dermatitis with superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and mucin deposition. On the basis of the patient's clinical, pathologic, and laboratory findings, he was diagnosed with SCLE. Fine needle aspiration of the enlarged lymph node demonstrated malignant cells, and subsequent immunohistochemistry was consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma. A subsequent positron emission tomography/computed tomography demonstrated intense fluorodeoxyglucose avidity in the left axillary node, consistent with the biopsy-proven metastatic melanoma, without other areas of abnormal uptake. The patient underwent left axillary dissection, in which 1 of the 19 lymph nodes removed was positive for melanoma via histopathology.

The patient was initially started on treatment with hydroxychloroquine for SCLE, which was discontinued 2 months after his lymphadenectomy due to significant improvement, with complete resolution of the rash by 5 months after surgery.

### Autoimmune hepatitis: serum autoantibodies in clinical practice [^112SDM8k]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2022). Medium credibility.

According to the recommendations issued in 2004 by the Committee for Autoimmune Serology of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group (IAIHG), diluted patient serum is incubated with the tissue substrates, allowing tissue binding of any autoantibody contained in the serum targeting antigens present in the substrates. After washing to remove unbound antibodies, a second, fluorochrome labelled anti-human antibody is added, and, after re-washing, the substrates are examined by ultraviolet microscopy. Characteristic IIF staining patterns are given by positive sera, which should be titrated to extinction. Anti-nuclear reactivities should be further characterized on HEp2 cells, which, thanks to their large nuclei, allow detection of the nuclear IIF patterns, which are of crucial clinical importance in the setting of autoimmune liver diseases (see below).

The conventional starting serum dilution is 1:10. In adults, the positivity cut-off is 1:40, whereas in children and adolescents titres from 1:20 for ANA and SMA and from 1:10 for anti-LKM1 and for anti-LC1 are considered positive, since autoantibodies are rare in healthy subjects of these age groups.

Molecular assays are usually based on purified or recombinant antigens attached to a solid phase, to which diluted patient serum is added: if the corresponding antibody is present in the test serum, it will bind to the antigen-coated solid phase and is detected in a subsequent step by adding anti-human antibodies labelled with a chemiluminescent or fluorescent agent, or with an enzyme- or radio-label.

Of importance, anti-soluble liver antigen antibody (anti-SLA), deemed to be the only AIH-specific reactivity, is undetectable by standard IIF, while it can be detected by solid phase assays, which should be part of the diagnostic work-up of every patient with acute or chronic liver disease.

### A case report of successful treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum in a patient with autoimmune hepatitis, and review of the literature [^115daH3r]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Commentary

Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic self-perpetuating inflammatory disease occurring in all ages and races. Besides its diverse presentation and heterogeneity of the clinical features, AIH is characterized biochemically by elevated transaminases, histologically by interface hepatitis, and serologically by increased levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and autoantibodies, in the absence of viral markers. Based on the autoantibody profile, two types of AIH are recognized: type 1 (AIH-1), positive for ANA and/or anti-smooth muscle antibody (SMA), and occurring at any age, and type 2 (AIH-2), positive for anti-liver-kidney microsomal antibody (anti-LKM) or for anti-liver cytosol type-1 antibody (anti-LC-1), with a peak incidence in children and adolescents. AIH generally responds to immunosuppressive treatment, but if left untreated usually progresses to liver failure requiring transplantation.

### Diagnostic evaluation for myositis and their pitfalls [^114sLT6P]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Myositis is a systemic autoimmune disorder that affects multiple organ systems, including the skeletal muscles, lungs, skin, and joints. The clinical presentation can vary significantly, and physicians must tailor the diagnostic evaluation for each patient, reflecting a personalized approach rather than relying on a standardized routine order set. Each diagnostic test has its own advantages, limitations, and pitfalls, requiring careful interpretation of results to make appropriate clinical decisions. In this article, we discuss the clinical applications of laboratory tests, myositis antibodies, imaging, electromyography, and muscle histopathology with key points to consider when interpreting the results.

### Primary biliary cholangitis: 2018 practice guidance from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^112HAHct]. Hepatology (2019). High credibility.

Diagnosis and scoring systems for PBC/AIH overlap — criteria and observed frequencies: There are two scoring systems that have been used to evaluate patients with PBC for simultaneous evidence of overlapping AIH. When the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group score was applied to PBC cohorts, less than 1% of PBC patients meet definite AIH diagnostic criteria, while 8% to 19% meet probable AIH criteria, and a simplified AIH scoring system identified fewer patients meeting probable AIH criteria than the older scoring system did (4% versus 12%). The most commonly applied system, the so-called Paris criteria, requires the presence of two of the following three diagnostic criteria: alanine aminotransferase activity greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal; IgG at least 2 times the upper limit of normal and/or positive anti-smooth muscle antibody; and liver biopsy with moderate or severe interface hepatitis. These criteria have been met in 1% to 14.2% of PBC patients, with higher rates found in Hispanic PBC patients.

### Association between serum IgG level and clinical course in primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113RzcX4]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Originally, a liver biopsy was taken in all patients at entry into the study, independent of conclusive ERC or MRCP findings. Since in PSC liver biopsies are of only limited clinical value, starting from 2001 a liver biopsy was no longer considered a prerequisite for entry into the study. Since 2001, only in case of inconclusive MRCP and ERC findings or suspected PSC/AIH overlap was a liver biopsy performed. All biopsies were read blindly. Altogether in 65 patients the diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy. As histopathological criteria were considered concentric 'onion skin' periductal fibrosis, bile duct proliferation, chronic periportal inflammatory change, cholangioectasia and ductopenia. According to the current EASL guideline, AIH/PSC overlap syndrome is difficult to diagnose with a sufficiently high certainty since standard diagnostic criteria are lacking. In clinical practice though, the guideline allows for patients with typical features of PSC in cholangiography or histology alongside with robust biochemical, serological and histological features of AIH to be diagnosed with AIH/PSC overlap syndrome. In order to diagnose the AIH component, we applied the Simplified Diagnostic Criteria of the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group. The score includes several parameters such as antinuclear (ANA) and/or smooth muscle antibodies (SMA), serum IgG levels, and liver histology with evidence of hepatitis and the absence of viral hepatitis. A score of ≥ 7 defines AIH. AIH was only diagnosed when a liver biopsy had been available.

### Diffuse gallbladder wall thickening in autoimmune hepatitis: an unusual presentation [^115CczJp]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

A 63-year-old woman presented with jaundice and epigastric pain for 2 weeks. Physical examination revealed marked jaundice, and palpable gallbladder with right upper quadrant tenderness. Liver function test was remarkable for hepatocellular injury pattern. Antinuclear antibody and anti-smooth muscle antibody were positive with high titre and serum IgG was elevated more than upper normal range. Ultrasound and CT scan demonstrated mildly diffuse periportal oedema of liver parenchyma and markedly diffuse gallbladder wall thickening up to 2 cm. Liver histology showed focal interface hepatitis with prominent plasma cell infiltration and cluster formation, moderate lobular spotty necrosis and emperipolesis consistent with autoimmune hepatitis. The patient was treated with steroid and azathioprine. She had complete resolution of symptoms and normal biochemical laboratory results. Diffuse gallbladder thickening was seen in acute hepatitis from definite autoimmune hepatitis.

### Is scleroderma an autoantibody mediated disease? [^117GHuRe]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Research into the pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis and other fibrotic conditions is becoming increasingly broad and sophisticated. In the past year, several provocative studies have presented evidence that autoantibodies may actually cause the vascular damage and fibrosis characteristic of systemic sclerosis. These autoantibodies include antiendothelial cell, antifibrillin-1, anti-matrix metalloproteinases 1 and 3, and antiplatelelet-derived growth factor beta, each having its own unique mechanism. Such reports provide novel avenues to pursue in understanding this enigmatic disease.

Treatment

Arguably more important than precise diagnostic categorisation is careful decision making about the need for immunosuppression. It is often reasonable to treat the predominant component first, and assess response.UDCA alone (in doses for classic PBC) might be sufficient for patients with predominantly biliary changes. However, in patients without improvement in liver biochemistry, a trial of prednisolone for the AIH component of disease should be considered.

One study(but not another)suggested that initial treatment with UDCA plus immunosuppression was associated with higher biochemical response rates and less fibrosis progression. A meta-analysis on this questionis limited by imprecise definitions. However, patients with 'severe' interface hepatitisseem to have a poor response to UDCA alone and might benefit from initial combination treatment. Also, in classic PBC, severe lymphocytic piecemeal necrosis is associated with fibrosis progression and might not improve with UDCA alone. Successful withdrawal of immunosuppression might be more common in PBC/AIH overlap than in classic AIH, although follow-up time in this study was short. Potential adverse effects should be discussed with patients, acknowledging the lack of a firm evidence base. Finally, regular review of the benefits of ongoing immunosuppression is required to avoid unnecessary exposure.

Prognosis

Prognosis in PBC/AIH overlap is worse than in PBC or AIH alone, partly because fibrosis is often more severe at presentation. However, all data come from before the widespread use of second-line therapies in PBC, the impact of which is unclear.

PSC and AIH variant syndromes

Overlapping features

Antinuclear antibodies and anti-smooth muscle antibodies can be seen in up to 80% of patients with otherwise typical PSC.

Prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in PSC/AIH overlap varies (13–89%) but seems to be lower than in classic PSC and higher than in classic AIH.

Radiology and histology

As discussed above, up to a quarter of patients with otherwise typical AIH show bile duct abnormalities on biopsy. Also, 2–10% have MRCP abnormalities consistent with cholangiopathy. This rises to 42% if IBD is also present.

Such radiological changes might develop later in the disease course, while small duct changes (only evident histologically) can exist without radiographic abnormalities. Patients with PSC/AIH variant might have concentric periductal ('onion skin') fibrosis but biliary features are patchy and can be absent despite obvious cholangiopathy on imaging.

Immunohistochemical analysis of antigenic proteins

Assuming that autoantibodies against DIDO1, FOXJ2, and CPSF2 peptides develop in patients with atherosclerotic diseases, these antigenic proteins should be expressed at high levels in atherosclerotic lesions. As such, we also examined the expressions of antigenic proteins in surgically resected carotid atherosclerotic plaques via immunohistochemistry. The DIDO1 and CPSF2 proteins were predominantly expressed in the intima of atherosclerotic plaques, similar to the localization of vimentin and smooth muscle actin, which are markers for smooth muscle cells (Fig. 5). DHPS, reported as an atherosclerosis marker, was also expressed in smooth muscle cells. The expression of FOXJ2 showed a similar pattern as that of CD31- and CD34-positive vascular endothelial cells. CD68 expression in macrophages was not similar to any of the other antigen expressions (Fig. 5).

The antibodies used were anti-DIDO1 (Aviva Systems Biology), anti-FOXJ2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-CPSF2 (GeneTex), and anti-DHPS (Proteintech) antibodies for comparison. The tissue was also stained with antibodies against smooth muscle cell marker, vimentin (VIM) and smooth muscle actin (SMA), vascular endothelial cell marker, CD31 and CD34, and macrophage marker, CD68

### Autoantibodies associated with primary biliary cholangitis are common among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus even in the absence of elevated liver enzymes [^115T4mQ7]. Clinical and Experimental Immunology (2021). Medium credibility.

Lupus hepatitis is a liver dysfunction with a reported frequency of 3–6% in SLE patients [7, 16, 17, 18]. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, distinct from AIH, and is characterized by fluctuations in alanine transaminase (ALT) [19]. It has a subclinical course with a low rate of progression to cirrhosis [20]. Histologically, lupus hepatitis has a variable presentation, but usually inflammation of the lobules is seen with a paucity of lymphocytes [7]. Fatty infiltration and mild portal infiltration may also be found [16].

AIH is a chronic progressive hepatitis with a female preponderance [21]. AIH can be classified into two subtypes; type 1 and type 2 [22, 23, 24]. These subtypes differ in their autoantibody profiles and age of onset. Type 1 patients are typically middle‐aged or older with presence of ANA, smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) and/or anti‐soluble liver antigen/liver pancreas antigen antibodies (anti‐SLA/LP) [25]. Type 2 patients are younger, usually children and teenagers, and characterized by the presence of anti‐liver kidney microsome‐1 antibodies (anti‐LKM‐1) and/or anti‐liver cytosol‐1 antibodies (anti‐LC‐1) [22]. AIH can present acutely with jaundice and rapid progression to cirrhosis. However, more frequently it presents as an indolent disease with slightly elevated liver enzymes [22]. The histological picture ranges from normal to patchy or diffuse necrosis [26, 27, 28].

Patients – Methods

Patients

One hundred and fifty six consecutive patients of the Outpatient Hepatology Clinic with chronic liver disease (CLD) and 240 healthy blood donors of comparable gender and age were investigated for the presence of anti-P antibodies [Table 1].

Table 1
Subgroups of the patients and controls of the study

The mean age of patients with CLD was 50.96 ± 13.10 years. Ninety four of them were males and the remaining 62 were females.

The 240 healthy controls of this study came from the Blood Bank of the University Hospital of Ioannina. They were randomly selected, except for preferring blood donors of older age, so that they would be comparable to the patients of the study. The mean age of the healthy controls was 45.06 ± 7.26 years, 131 were males and 109 were females. The characteristics of all subgroups of the study are shown in Table 1.

To include a patient or control in the study, he should not have been a recipient of blood products within the last three years. Although there was not a specific exclusion criterion for decompensated cirrhotics in our study, we did not include patients who had received blood products. This was done to preclude confounding factors such as HLA antiplatelet antibodies related to transfusion. However, in any case, we used a method that could discriminate true anti-P antibodies from HLA related to transfusion anti-P as described below. In addition, we excluded patients who were receiving drugs related to thrombocytopenia. Platelet count measurements were done with an automatic analyzer and additionally to a blood smear that was extracted without anticoagulant to exclude false thrombocytopenia. All patients underwent routine haematological and biochemical tests and were tested for the viruses of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis D, and HIV. Anti-nuclear and anti-smooth muscle antibodies, as well as cryoglobulins were measured in all CLD patients. In addition, all CLD patients underwent routinely an abdominal ultrasound examination with emphasis on liver and spleen. Splenomegaly was defined by palpation and ultrasound splenic index.

### Evaluation of autoimmune liver disease natural history in patients referred to middle east liver diseases (MELD) center [^113UJxrL]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

The impact of different genetic backgrounds has been shown to contribute to the diverse autoantibody and clinical profiles observed in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) worldwide. Previous studies have demonstrated that variations in genetic factors play a significant role in shaping the presentation and progression of AIH. These genetic differences can influence the production of autoantibodies, such as antinuclear antibodies (ANA), smooth muscle antibodies (SMA), liver-kidney microsomal antibodies type 1 (LKM-1), and others. Additionally, these genetic variations may also affect the severity of liver inflammation and the response to treatment. Our study results also hint potential differences in the autoantibody/clinical profiles of AIH patients in Iran compared to other regions of the world, as well as variations in their responses to treatment. These differences highlight the need for further attention to the genetic background among the Iranian population in future studies involving AIH patients. Understanding the influence of genetic backgrounds is crucial for unraveling the complex nature of AIH and may provide insights into personalized approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and disease management tailored to specific populations.

PBC and PSC

In Shen et al. study, 50.8% of the cases were PBC patients with a mean age of 56 years and a female proportion of 79.7%. With the exclusion of overlap syndrome patients, Webb et al. reported a similar 47.88% PBC fraction among AILD patients. In Webb et al. study, 86.8% of patients were female, with a 6.6:1 female-to-male ratio and a mean age of 63. Lamba et al. reported a mean age of 57.9 years and a female predominance of 77%. In the present study, PBC accounted for 14% of the patients with a mean age of 51.2 years and a female predominance of 83.8%, similar to previous studies. This difference in the prevalence of PBC among studies may be due to small sample sizes and differences in inclusion criteria for in this study all AILD cases were included while some studies excluded overlap syndrome cases. Fifty to 60% of patients suffering from PBC are asymptomatic and identified after screening tests. Overt symptoms develop in most patients within 2 to 4 years while some individuals are asymptomatic for years. In the present study, there are more patients with AIH than PBC which is rare. It is maybe the result of the impaired systematic screening test and medical records. Moreover, ethnic differences may also play a part in different prevalence of PBC and PSC which needs further investigation.

INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA IN CLINICAL TRIALS OF PSC

The choice of inclusion and exclusion criteria in clinical trials in PSC warrants several considerations, including the mechanisms of action of candidate drugs to be tested. A selection of disease-specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical trials in PSC are listed in Table 2. In general, the exclusion of very mild disease (ie, small duct PSC), concomitant AIH, or IgG4-associated cholangitis is normally recommended. Moderately increased IgG and IgG4 levels and positive autoantibodies (eg, ANA and SMA) in PSC are not uncommon, and such individuals should not be excluded if overt overlapping disease is excluded.

TABLE 2
Typical inclusion and exclusion criteria for clinical trials in PSC

Disease stage

The disease stage at which a study drug has the best chance of proving efficacious warrants considerations from several perspectives. As illustrated in Figure 1, there is increasing fibrosis with advanced disease, both peribiliary ("onion-skin fibrosis") and in the liver parenchyma. As such, early disease stages of PSC with only minimal fibrosis may warrant different types of interventions than that of later disease stages and may be the optimal time for disease interventions aiming for reversal and even resolution of PSC. However, studies using inclusion criteria allowing very early and mild disease are likely to fail due to slow disease progression and lack of surrogate biomarkers for progression at such stages. Small-duct PSC represents one end of the PSC disease spectrum, and behaves less progressively and is therefore usually an exclusion criterion in clinical trials in PSC. The definition of "early PSC" (Figure 1) is still unclear but usually includes individuals with only minimal elastography elevations, minor cholangiographic changes, no symptoms, and sometimes a low ALP. Importantly, individuals with such features of early PSC represent a large and increasing proportion of the overall PSC population, and additional inclusion criteria may be considered in future trials to allow for the participation of such individuals. Determining which of these individuals have a concomitant predisposition for progression during follow-up and thus are in need of medical therapy remains unknown. Liver stiffness measurements, serum bile acid profiles, and increased serum fibrosis and fibrogenesis biomarkers (eg, the ELF test and pro-C3) with specific cutoff levels that need to be identified, could represent criteria for including such individuals.

### Case of autoimmune hepatitis with overlap systemic lupus erythematosus [^114Nbicz]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is an autoimmune liver disease characterised by the presence of autoantibodies including antinuclear antibodies, anti-smooth muscle antibody and hypergammaglobulinaemia. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic disease that can affect multiple organs. Coexistence of AIH and SLE as an overlap syndrome occurs in about 1%-2.6% of the AIH cases. Since both conditions share common autoimmune features, their coexistence can pose a diagnostic dilemma which can result in a delay in treatment. We present here a challenging case of a middle-aged woman with AIH in remission who later developed new-onset fatigue, pleural effusion and splenomegaly.

### SARS-CoV-2 and the liver: clinical and immunological features in chronic liver disease [^117QbsiE]. Gut (2023). Medium credibility.

Figure 5
Overview of the autoimmune (-like) hepatitis following COVID-19 vaccination. COVID-19 vaccines can cause liver injury by different mechanism such as molecular mimicry, vaccine adjuvants or direct mRNA effects. This autoimmune (-like) hepatitis (ALH) is frequently associated with the presence of autoantibodies (ANA, SMA, AMA) and virus-specific immune-cells in the liver. ALH generally recovers spontaneously or after immunosuppressive therapy. AMA: anti-mitochondrial antibodies; ANA, anti-nuclear antibodies; SMA, smooth muscle antibodies.

Since the first description by Bril et al, many cases of ALH have been reported after vaccination with mRNA-based, vector-based, protein-based and inactivated SARS-CoV2 vaccines. For example, a recent study by Codoni et al investigated autoantibodies and histological features in liver injury with autoimmune features following COVID-19 vaccination in a cohort of 59 individuals without preexisting liver disease. Similar to the case described by Bril et al, autoantibodies were frequently positive, for example, ANA in 74% and SMA in 64% of the patients. Liver histology revealed a lobular injury in most patients (76%) with lymphocytic infiltration, focal necrosis and acidophilic bodies. They reported a significant improvement of serum transaminases after initiation of steroid treatment with a normalisation reached in the majority of ALH cases within 6 months. The treatment decision was made without a standardised protocol and according to local standards at the respective centre. However, when re-exposed to COVID-19 vaccine 3/15 individuals exhibited a relapse.

Her joint and neurovascular findings are normal. Testing reveals a 1: 40 antinuclear antibody titer and a weakly positive rheumatoid factor titer of 22 IU per mL. What diagnostic tests, if any, should be ordered next. ANA results are reported using a titer, such as 1:

320. Generally, the higher the titer, the more likely the patient is to have a connective tissue disorder. The titer shows how many times the patient's serum was diluted before the antibodies could no longer be detected. Thus, a titer of 1: 640 shows a greater concentration of ANA than 1:

40. Once a patient has a positive ANA titer, it is rarely helpful to repeat the test; ANA levels fluctuate and do not reflect disease activity. ANTI–DOUBLE-STRANDED DNA ANTIBODIES Anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies are a hallmark of SLE. Their sensitivity is 70%, and specificity is 95%. ANTI-SMITH ANTIBODIES Anti-Smith antibodies have the greatest specificity for SLE and are included in the diagnostic criteria for SLE. 13 However, their sensitivity is low. Therefore, a positive test result is essentially diagnostic of SLE, but a negative result does not exclude it. Diagnostic criteria include the presence of ocular signs and symptoms, abnormal salivary gland pathology, and positive autoantibody titers, including ANA. The sensitivity and specificity of a positive ANA result are 48% and 52%, respectively; the LR+ is 0. 99, and the LR– is 1.
01. Scleroderma Scleroderma is a clinical syndrome characterized by tight skin, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary hypertension, and diffuse organ fibrosis. Although this condition is rare, antibody testing can help with the diagnosis. Initial testing should include an ANA titer; if results are positive, further testing should include anticentromere and anti-Scl 70 antibodies, which are present in patients with limited and diffuse scleroderma, respectively.

The presence of anti-Scl 70 antibodies is associated with increased mortality and a greater incidence of interstitial lung disease. 19 The sensitivity and specificity of anti-Scl 70 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay are 43% and 100%, respectively. 20.
