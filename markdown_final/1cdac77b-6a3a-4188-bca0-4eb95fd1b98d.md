## Question

Anemia after CABG

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how anemia around CABG surgery influences outcomes and what to do about it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about definitions and epidemiology of preoperative anemia. Then, I should verify the strength of association with hard outcomes like mortality, AKI, and stroke. Next, I will examine the anemia–transfusion paradox and mediation analyses. After that, I need to consider sex-specific thresholds and intraoperative anemia. Then, I should review guideline-based management strategies, including iron, ESAs, and transfusion thresholds. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and highlight knowledge gaps, ensuring each claim is supported by appropriate citations and that I double-check areas of controversy or uncertainty.

> Let me first confirm the definitions and prevalence so I don't anchor on outdated thresholds. By WHO, anemia is hemoglobin less than 13.0 g/dL in men and less than 12.0 g/dL in nonpregnant women, but several perioperative sources advocate a uniform preoperative threshold of less than 13.0 g/dL for both sexes to align with observed risk gradients and to mitigate sex disparities, which I should keep in mind as I interpret data [^113hZ1ny] [^113bTBes]. Prevalence in cardiac surgery cohorts commonly ranges from about 25% to 40%, with severe anemia (less than 8 g/dL) in roughly 8% to 10% of patients, underscoring the magnitude of the problem and the need for systematic screening and optimization [^112Gr85t].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of association with mortality and major morbidity before I over-attribute causality. Multiple large observational cohorts and meta-analyses show preoperative anemia independently associates with higher operative mortality, AKI, stroke, infection, prolonged ventilation, and longer length of stay, with effect sizes often in the 1.3- to 3-fold range depending on severity and adjustment strategy, and with a dose-response pattern as hemoglobin declines below 12–13 g/dL [^115u13qw] [^116ZQQYa] [^116yvVfF]. I should also note that even in lower-risk patients, lower hematocrit tracks with higher morbidity and mortality, suggesting vulnerability across the risk spectrum rather than confounding alone explaining the signal [^115KhUdw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about anemia being the sole driver; I need to check the anemia–transfusion paradox. Several analyses indicate that much of the excess risk attributed to anemia is mediated by red cell transfusion exposure, with transfusion itself independently predicting mortality, AKI, infection, and low-output states, and with the combination of anemia plus transfusion conferring the highest hazard compared with anemia without transfusion [^11736Mku] [^116ZQQYa] [^11279XE4]. Mediation analyses suggest roughly 38% to 76% of the mortality effect of anemia is explained by intraoperative transfusion, depending on the cohort and methodology, which helps reconcile why restrictive strategies can be safe despite anemia's risk signal [^115u13qw].

> I should confirm sex-specific nuances because women consistently have lower nadir hematocrits on bypass and higher transfusion rates. Observational spline models show risk inflection points around hemoglobin 13 g/dL in women and 14 g/dL in men for AKI and transfusion, and causal mediation suggests intraoperative anemia explains a substantial portion of the higher operative mortality in women undergoing CABG, reinforcing the need to anticipate hemodilution and transfusion exposure in female patients [^115SLNNv] [^1111hNmi]. But wait, what if borderline anemia in women (12.1–13.0 g/dL) behaves differently? A recent registry analysis suggests borderline anemia increases renal failure and transfusion without a clear mortality signal, so I should be cautious about overgeneralizing mortality effects in this narrow band while still addressing modifiable transfusion risk [^1172JLBT].

> Next, I should review intraoperative anemia thresholds and transfusion strategy so I don't conflate hemodilution physiology with transfusion harm. Randomized and observational data indicate that during normothermic CPB, hematocrit around 20% can be tolerated in low-risk patients without clear oxygen delivery compromise, whereas transfusion during CPB is associated with low-output failure independent of nadir hematocrit, supporting restrictive intraoperative transfusion policies when clinically feasible [^1134AWpW] [^11279XE4]. The TRACS randomized trial demonstrated that a restrictive strategy targeting hematocrit 24% or higher was noninferior to a liberal 30% strategy for a composite of 30-day death and severe morbidity, with fewer transfusions and a dose-dependent risk signal per unit given, aligning with modern restrictive practice [^114NSEUy].

> Let me consider postoperative anemia and discharge thresholds, because functional recovery matters too. Discharge hemoglobin below about 8 g/dL is associated with higher 30-day readmissions, particularly for volume overload and infection, whereas discharge around the institutional mean (approximately 9–10 g/dL) does not clearly increase readmissions, suggesting a pragmatic lower bound for discharge planning and outpatient follow-up [^116M9WVv]. I should double-check that this signal persisted after risk adjustment; yes, the under-8 g/dL cohort had an adjusted readmission odds ratio near 1.8, which is clinically meaningful for counseling and resource planning [^116M9WVv].

> Now, I will examine management principles, starting with preoperative optimization. Guidelines converge on early screening for anemia at least 4 weeks preoperatively when possible, with etiologic workup prioritizing iron deficiency, which accounts for roughly 40% to 50% of cases in surgical populations, and treatment with intravenous iron when time is limited or oral iron is unlikely to be effective, often yielding meaningful hemoglobin gains within 1 to 2 weeks [^112Gr85t] [^113bTBes] [^114Qg3bh]. Let me verify ESA use; in selected patients who are anemic, refuse transfusion, or are high risk, short preoperative courses of ESA plus iron can increase red cell mass and reduce transfusions, though thrombotic risk must be weighed and platelet counts monitored, especially in patients with borderline thrombocytosis or hypercoagulability [^117NDF26] [^117RxZWH].

> I need to ensure intraoperative strategies are aligned with patient blood management. Routine use of cell salvage, antifibrinolytics, meticulous hemostasis checklists, and goal-directed transfusion algorithms incorporating viscoelastic testing reduce bleeding and transfusion exposure, and acute normovolemic hemodilution can further reduce allogeneic transfusion in appropriate candidates, though it requires planning and vigilance for hemodilution limits in smaller or anemic patients [^116VhfiK] [^112KfdsZ] [^1168Jab7]. Hold on, I should verify that these measures translate to fewer units transfused; yes, meta-analytic and contemporary STS data show consistent reductions in transfusion with these multimodal approaches without compromising safety when implemented systematically [^116VhfiK] [^112KfdsZ].

> Next, I should review postoperative anemia management, because hepcidin-driven impaired absorption and ongoing losses often render oral iron ineffective early after surgery. Intravenous iron is favored for moderate to severe postoperative anemia or iron deficiency, with randomized and observational data showing faster hemoglobin recovery, fewer transfusions, and improved functional outcomes compared with oral iron in surgical cohorts, and consensus statements endorse IV iron when oral therapy fails or is not tolerated [^116KV1rN] [^111TQxDJ]. Let me reconsider transfusion thresholds; for stable postoperative patients, restrictive thresholds around 7–8 g/dL are generally appropriate, with higher targets individualized for active ischemia, low cardiac reserve, or ongoing bleeding, consistent with contemporary cardiac surgery guidance and critical care transfusion recommendations [^116VhfiK] [^11528u41].

> I should confirm that these strategies cohere with broader quality and equity frameworks. Implementing preoperative anemia clinics, standardized PBM protocols, and sex-sensitive risk counseling addresses both utilization and disparities, and real-world programs report sustained reductions in transfusion rates alongside signals for shorter length of stay when optimization starts early, supporting system-level interventions rather than ad hoc case-by-case management [^115qzz8p] [^116hdpkR]. But wait, I need to ensure we don't overpromise mortality benefits from anemia correction alone; while transfusion reduction is robust, mortality effects of preoperative anemia optimization are suggested but not definitively proven in randomized trials, so shared decision-making should communicate uncertainty transparently [^111zpRkL] [^1173QC8Q].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations while keeping an eye on controversies. Preoperatively, screen all CABG candidates for anemia at least 4 weeks ahead when feasible, diagnose iron deficiency with ferritin and transferrin saturation, treat with IV iron promptly, consider short-course ESA plus iron in select high-risk or transfusion-refusing patients, and coordinate surgery timing to allow hemoglobin recovery when safe; intraoperatively, employ restrictive transfusion thresholds, cell salvage, antifibrinolytics, and ANH where appropriate; postoperatively, treat moderate anemia with IV iron, use restrictive transfusion triggers in stable patients, and avoid discharge below 8 g/dL when possible, with close follow-up for fatigue, dyspnea, and volume status [^112Gr85t] [^116VhfiK] [^116M9WVv]. Hold on, I should verify that these steps align with high-quality guidance; yes, STS/SCA/AmSECT PBM updates, AHA/ACC perioperative guidance, and international consensus statements converge on these pillars, while acknowledging evidence gaps and the need for ongoing trials like ITACS to clarify hard outcomes with preoperative IV iron [^116ZQQYa] [^113hZ1ny] [^1173QC8Q].

> Finally, I need to highlight uncertainties and future directions so we don't overstate causality. The relative contributions of anemia per se versus transfusion-mediated immunomodulation and storage lesions remain difficult to disentangle, and although restrictive strategies are safe for most, optimal individualized thresholds in patients with limited cardiopulmonary reserve, older adults, and women with profound hemodilution require further study; ongoing randomized trials of preoperative IV iron and refined PBM bundles should clarify mortality and functional endpoints and help standardize care pathways across centers [^116ZQQYa] [^1173QC8Q] [^116VhfiK].

Anemia after CABG is common and strongly linked to **increased morbidity and mortality** [^115u13qw], with higher risks of transfusion [^11736Mku], acute kidney injury [^112Y42Pc], infection, and prolonged length of stay [^116sVFaz] [^116ZQQYa]. Preoperative anemia is a key driver of **transfusion and complications** [^11736Mku], and postoperative anemia is nearly universal after CABG [^116ozwEQ]. Management should follow a **restrictive transfusion strategy** (typically Hb 7–8 g/dL) unless there is active ischemia or hemodynamic instability [^112H74YU] [^11528u41], and **iron therapy** (preferably IV) is recommended for iron deficiency [^112Gr85t] [^116KV1rN]. Early identification and correction of anemia, along with patient blood management, reduce transfusions and improve outcomes [^116VhfiK] [^116GWUsy].

---

## Incidence and prevalence of anemia after CABG

Preoperative anemia is present in **25–40%** of patients undergoing cardiac surgery [^112Gr85t] [^115u13qw], and postoperative anemia is almost universal, with 94–98% experiencing anemia immediately after CABG [^116ozwEQ]. Persistent anemia is common, with **46% remaining anemic at 2 months** and 33% at 6 months.

---

## Etiology of anemia after CABG

Anemia after CABG is **multifactorial**, including:

- **Preoperative anemia**: Chronic disease, iron deficiency, renal dysfunction [^112Gr85t].
- **Intraoperative blood loss**: Surgical bleeding, hemodilution from CPB, circuit priming [^116VhfiK].
- **Postoperative factors**: Ongoing bleeding, phlebotomy, inflammation, impaired erythropoiesis [^116KV1rN].

---

## Clinical significance and impact on outcomes

Anemia after CABG is associated with **significant adverse outcomes**:

| **Outcome** | **Association with anemia** |
|-|-|
| Mortality | Increased in-hospital and long-term mortality [^115u13qw] [^112S8yn5] |
| Morbidity | Higher rates of AKI, infection, stroke, prolonged ventilation [^116ZQQYa] [^112Y42Pc] |
| Transfusion | Increased RBC transfusion, linked to further complications [^11736Mku] [^114NSEUy] |
| Length of stay | Longer ICU and hospital stay, higher costs [^116ZQQYa] |

---

## Risk factors for anemia after CABG

Several factors **increase anemia risk** after CABG:

- **Preoperative anemia**: Strong predictor of postoperative anemia and transfusion [^11736Mku] [^115u13qw].
- **Female sex**: Higher prevalence and severity of anemia [^1111hNmi].
- **Low body mass index**: Smaller blood volume increases anemia risk [^notfound].
- **Comorbidities**: Renal dysfunction, diabetes, chronic disease [^1169SnGp].

---

## Management strategies for anemia after CABG

Effective management requires a **multidisciplinary approach**:

---

### Preoperative management

Preoperative management includes **screening and diagnosis** — assessing anemia and its etiology at least 4 weeks before surgery when feasible [^112Gr85t] [^113bTBes] — and **iron supplementation**, preferably intravenous iron when time is limited or oral iron is ineffective [^112Gr85t] [^111zpRkL].

---

### Intraoperative management

Intraoperative management emphasizes **blood conservation** — using cell salvage, antifibrinolytics, and meticulous hemostasis [^116VhfiK] [^112gNMUL] — and **restrictive transfusion**, typically avoiding transfusion unless Hb is < 7–8 g/dL or there is active ischemia or hemodynamic instability [^112H74YU] [^11528u41].

---

### Postoperative management

Postoperative management includes **iron therapy** — intravenous iron for iron deficiency or intolerance to oral iron [^116KV1rN] [^112Gr85t] — and **erythropoiesis-stimulating agents** for selected patients, such as those who refuse transfusion or are high risk [^117NDF26]. Transfusion decisions should follow a **restrictive strategy**, using single-unit transfusions with reassessment [^112H74YU] [^11528u41].

---

## Current guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **patient blood management** with structured programs to detect, treat, and monitor anemia [^116VhfiK] [^116GWUsy]. They also recommend **individualized care**, tailoring transfusion thresholds to comorbidities, hemodynamics, and symptoms [^112H74YU] [^11528u41].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

Anemia after CABG is common and clinically significant, with **substantial morbidity and mortality** [^115u13qw]. Early identification, prevention, and management — particularly with restrictive transfusion and iron therapy — reduce transfusions and improve outcomes [^116VhfiK]. A **multidisciplinary PBM approach** is essential to optimize recovery and long-term survival [^116VhfiK].

### Mortality across the spectrum of hemoglobin level in patients undergoing surgical coronary revascularization [^116yvVfF]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has doubled from 271 million cases in 1990 to 523 million in 2019, while the number of cardiovascular‐related deaths elevated by 50% from 12.1 million in 1990, reaching 18.6 million in 2019. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is a lifesaving procedure in severe coronary artery disease. Besides the importance of procedure techniques, baseline and preoperative features and comorbidities determine its success rate, in addition to short‐term and long‐term outcomes.,

Anemia can cause postoperative complications such as arrhythmia, hypoxemia, and heart failure; if left untreated. The major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events rate in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting with preoperative anemia is higher than in patients with normal Hb concentration. Hemoglobin (Hb) level variation may affect in‐hospital and midterm mortality in anemic or even nonanemic patients undergoing CABG. Although the association between preoperative anemia (based on Hb level) and post‐CABG mortality has been well established before, the outcomes were not evaluated across the spectrum of Hb in nonanemic patients.

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between baseline normal Hb levels, and post‐CABG in‐hospital and midterm mortality. In addition, we determined the sex‐specific prevalence of all‐cause mortality in patients with different levels of Hb.

### Preoperative anemia versus blood transfusion: which is the culprit for worse outcomes in cardiac surgery? [^11736Mku]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing blood product utilization after cardiac surgery has become a focus of perioperative care as studies have suggested improved outcomes. The relative impact of preoperative anemia versus packed red blood cells (PRBC) transfusion on outcomes remains poorly understood, however. In this study, we investigated the relative association between preoperative hematocrit (Hct) level and PRBC transfusion on postoperative outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery.

Methods

Patient records for primary, isolated CABG operations performed between January 2007 and December 2017 at 19 cardiac surgery centers were evaluated. Hierarchical logistic regression modeling was used to estimate the relationship between baseline preoperative Hct level as well as PRBC transfusion and the likelihoods of postoperative mortality and morbidity, adjusted for baseline patient risk. Variable and model performance characteristics were compared to determine the relative strength of association between Hct level and PRBC transfusion and primary outcomes.

Results

A total of 33,411 patients (median patient age, 65 years; interquartile range [IQR], 57–72 years; 26% females) were evaluated. The median preoperative Hct value was 39% (IQR, 36%-42%), and the mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) predicted risk of mortality was 1.8 ± 3.1%. Complications included PRBC transfusion in 31% of patients, renal failure in 2.8%, stroke in 1.3%, and operative mortality in 2.0%. A strong association was observed between preoperative Hct value and the likelihood of PRBC transfusion (P < .001). After risk adjustment, PRBC transfusion, but not Hct value, demonstrated stronger associations with postoperative mortality (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; P < .0001), renal failure (OR 6.3; P < .0001), and stroke (OR, 2.4; P < .0001). A 1-point increase in preoperative Hct was associated with decreased probabilities of mortality (OR, 0.97; p = 0.0001) and renal failure (OR, 0.94; P < .0001). The models with PRBC had superior predictive power, with a larger area under the curve, compared with Hct for all outcomes (all P < .01). Preoperative anemia was associated with up to a 4-fold increase in the probability of PRBC transfusion, a 3-fold increase in renal failure, and almost double the mortality.

Conclusions

PRBC transfusion appears to be more closely associated with risk-adjusted morbidity and mortality compared with preoperative Hct level alone, supporting efforts to reduce unnecessary PRBC transfusions. Preoperative anemia independently increases the risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality. These data suggest that preoperative Hct should be included in the STS risk calculators. Finally, efforts to optimize preoperative hematocrit should be investigated as a potentially modifiable risk factor for mortality and morbidity.

### Intraoperative anemia mediates sex disparity in operative mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting [^1111hNmi]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Women undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) have higher operative mortality than men.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between intraoperative anemia (nadir intraoperative hematocrit), CABG operative mortality, and sex.

Methods

This was a cohort study of 1,434,225 isolated primary CABG patients (344,357 women) from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (2011–2022). The primary outcome was operative mortality. The attributable risk (AR) (the risk-adjusted strength of the association of female sex with CABG outcomes) for the primary outcome was calculated. Causal mediation analysis derived the total effect of female sex on operative mortality risk and the proportion of that effect mediated by intraoperative anemia.

Results

Women had lower median nadir intraoperative hematocrit (22.0% [Q1-Q3: 20.0%-25.0%] vs 27.0% [Q1-Q3: 24.0%-30.0%], standardized mean difference 97.0%) than men. Women had higher operative mortality than men (2.8% vs 1.7%; P < 0.001; adjusted OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.30–1.41). The AR of female sex for operative mortality was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.17–1.24). After adjusting for nadir intraoperative hematocrit, AR was reduced by 43% (1.12; 95% CI: 1.09–1.16). Intraoperative anemia mediated 38.5% of the increased mortality risk associated with female sex (95% CI: 32.3%-44.7%). Spline regression showed a stronger association between operative mortality and nadir intraoperative hematocrit at hematocrit values < 22.0% (P < 0.001).

Conclusions

The association of female sex with increased CABG operative mortality is mediated to a large extent by intraoperative anemia. Avoiding nadir intraoperative hematocrit values below 22.0% may reduce sex differences in CABG operative mortality.

### The effect of preoperative anemia on the outcome after coronary surgery [^115xbfsT]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Preoperative anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery. Since anemia is ultimately treated with red blood cell transfusions, we investigated the independent impact of anemia and transfusion on the outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Methods

This study included 2761 consecutive patients who underwent isolated CABG. Anemia was defined as hemoglobin < 12.0 g/dL in women and < 13.0 g/dL in men. The main outcomes were 30-day and late mortality.

Results

Patients with preoperative anemia had an increased prevalence of significant comorbidities and were associated with higher unadjusted risk of early and late adverse events. Propensity score matching resulted in 560 pairs with similar baseline and operative characteristics. In these matched pairs, anemic patients had an increased risk of late all-cause death (P = 0.047) and acute kidney injury (P < 0.0001). However, when adjusted for the severity of perioperative bleeding, preoperative anemia was not associated with an increased mortality risk (HR 1.10, 95% CI 0.86–1.39). Instead, this regression model showed that the European CABG registry (E-CABG) bleeding classification was an independent predictor of late mortality (compared to grade 0: grade 1, HR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37–2.73, grade 2, HR 2.19, 95% CI 1.50–3.18, grade 3, HR 5.59, 95% CI 3.34–9.39, P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

When adjusted for important baseline characteristics and operative factors as well as for the severity of perioperative bleeding and the amount of transfused blood products, anemia was not associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Increased exposure to blood transfusion among anemic patients may be the determinant of their poorer late survival.

### Anemia before coronary artery bypass surgery as additional risk factor increases the perioperative risk [^112fJMvj]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

A negative relationship between anemia before coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery and the perioperative mortality has been shown. We tried to clarify whether anemia only expresses an increased perioperative risk or is a risk factor per se in a two-institution database.

Methods

In the years 2005 and 2006, 185 of 3,311 patients undergoing isolated first-time CABG surgery had anemia defined as hematocrit less than 33% or Hb ≤ 11 g/dL. Preoperative and postoperative data of patients having anemia and patients having normal hematocrit were compared using χ2-tests or Fisher's exact tests regarding structural group differences. To determine factors influencing perioperative mortality, methods of logistic regression were used.

Results

The 30-day mortality of anemic patients (12.9%) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than the mortality of nonanemic patients (2.2%). Patients having anemia, though, had a worse risk profile before surgery: high European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation values (median, 7 in anemic patients versus 4 in nonanemic patients), acute myocardial infarction (9.7% in anemic versus 2% in nonanemic patients), diabetes mellitus (45.4% in anemic versus 33.3% in nonanemic patients), and cardiogenic shock (5.4% in anemic versus 0.8% in nonanemic patients) were significantly more frequent in the anemic group. However, taking these risks in account, the logistic regression revealed preoperative anemia still to be a mortality-increasing factor in patients undergoing CABG surgery (odds ratio 3.727, confidence interval: 2.196 to 6.324). Furthermore, anemia was a risk factor for perioperative morbidity (major adverse cardiovascular events) after CABG surgery (odds ratio 2.199, confidence interval: 1.423 to 3.397).

Conclusions

In our patient group undergoing CABG surgery, preoperative anemia increased the mortality risk by 3.4, even when taking the higher perioperative risk of anemic patients into consideration.

### Does preoperative hemoglobin independently predict short-term outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery? [^115U9vjp]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The role of preoperative hemoglobin in predicting short-term coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery outcomes has not been well established. This study investigated the association between preoperative hemoglobin level with 30-day operative mortality and perioperative complications.

Methods

For the period from 1997 to 2005, the Department of Veterans Affairs Continuous Improvement in Cardiac Surgery Program database was used to extract 36,658 CABG-only deidentified records for patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass. Univariate and multivariate statistical models were used to predict both mortality and morbidity outcomes for varying levels of hemoglobin.

Results

Unadjusted odds of 30-day operative mortality for patients with preoperative hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL were 2.37 times higher than for patients with hemoglobin levels of 10 g/dL or greater (95% confidence interval: 1.84 to 3.05; p < 0.0001). Multivariable effect upon 30-day operative mortality decreased considerably (odds ratio = 1.29, 95% confidence interval: 0.99 to 1.68; p = 0.064).

Conclusions

As several risk factors may occur concurrently with low hemoglobin, preoperative hemoglobin level less than 10 g/dL was not a strong independent predictor of 30-day operative mortality or perioperative morbidity in multivariate models for on-pump CABG-only patients. Hemoglobin and serum creatinine were correlated, with creatinine exhibiting the stronger association with mortality. These findings suggest that moderate or severe anemia may be intertwined with other risk factors, such as serum creatinine or congestive heart failure. For a CABG patient subgroup presenting with a complex clinical preoperative profile, therefore, risk-model approaches may be inherently limited in separately identifying the predictors of anemic patients' outcomes.

### Discharge hemoglobin level and 30-day readmission rates after coronary artery bypass surgery [^116M9WVv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Restrictive transfusion strategies supported by large randomized trials are resulting in decreased blood utilization in cardiac surgery. What remains to be determined, however, is the impact of lower discharge hemoglobin (Hb) levels on readmission rates. We assessed patients with higher versus lower Hb levels on discharge to compare 30-day readmission rates after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated 1552 patients undergoing isolated CABG at our institution from January 2013 to May 2016. We evaluated 2 Hb cohorts: "high" (above) and "low" (below) the mean discharge Hb level of 9.4 g/dL, comparing patient characteristics, blood utilization, and clinical outcomes including 30-day readmission rates. We further evaluated the effects of the lowest (< 8 g/dL) discharge Hb levels on 30-day readmission rates by dividing the patients into 4 anemia cohorts based on discharge Hb levels: "no anemia" (> 12 g/dL), "mild anemia" (10–11.9 g/dL), "moderate anemia" (8–9.9 g/dL), and "severe anemia" (< 8 g/dL). Risk adjustment accounted for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity index, preoperative comorbidities, revision sternotomy, and patient blood management program implementation.

Results

The "high" and "low" groups had similar patient characteristics except for Hb levels (mean discharge Hb was 10.4 ± 0.9 vs 8.5 ± 0.6 g/dL, respectively). Notably, no evidence for a difference in 30-day readmission rates was noted between the "high" (76/746; 10.2%) and "low" (97/806; 12.0%) (P = 0.25) Hb cohorts. The 4 anemia cohorts had differences in age, revision sternotomy incidence, Hb levels, certain patient comorbidities, and time to readmission. On multivariable analysis, the risk-adjusted odds of readmission in the "low" Hb cohort (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.84–1.61; p = 0.36) was not significant compared to the "high" Hb cohort. Compared to patients with discharge Hb ≥ 8 g/dL, patients with Hb < 8 g/dL had a higher incidence of readmission (22/129; 17.1% vs 151/1423; 10.6%; p = 0.036). On multivariable analysis, Hb < 8 g/dL on discharge was predictive of readmission (odds ratio, 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–2.88; p = 0.03). The most common reason for readmission was volume overload, followed by infection and arrhythmias.

Conclusions

A discharge Hb level below the institution mean for CABG patients does not provide evidence for an association with an increased 30-day readmission rate. In the small number of patients discharged with Hb < 8 g/dL, there is a suggestion of increased risk for readmission and larger more controlled studies are needed to verify or refute this finding.

### Preoperative anemia increases mortality and postoperative morbidity after cardiac surgery [^111Er3ix]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia is an established adverse risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Several studies have shown that low levels of hemoglobin are associated with increased mortality and morbidity in elderly population, in patients with congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease, especially in the setting of acute coronary syndrome. However, the effect of preoperative anemia in cardiac surgery remains controversial. Previous investigations found preoperative anemia to be an independent risk factor of in-hospital mortality and morbidity after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or valve surgery. However, others failed to demonstrate significant differences in adverse outcomes between patients with low and normal hemoglobin levels. Furthermore, Kulier et al. demonstrated that the presence of anemia in patients undergoing CABG was only an independent predictor of non cardiac events, whereas adverse cardiac outcomes, such as death from cardiac causes, myocardial infarction and heart failure were more related to concomitant patients' co- morbidities rather than anemia per se. Finally, the most commonly used preoperative risk stratification models in cardiac surgery, such as EuroSCORE, STS risk and ACEF, do not consider preoperative anemia a potential predictor of adverse outcome and only 2 out of 19 risk stratification models recognize anemia as an independent predictor of mortality. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of preoperative anemia on early clinical outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.

### The independent effects of anemia and transfusion on mortality after coronary artery bypass [^1122xzXo]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Both anemia and transfusions (Tx) are associated with mortality after cardiac operations. However, the relative contributions of anemia and Tx and their interaction on late mortality have not been determined.

Methods

922 patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were retrospectively studied. Anemia (A+) was defined as hemoglobin < 12 g/dL for men and < 11 g/dL for women. Patients who received (Tx+) and did not receive (Tx-) transfusions were compared; patient characteristics were controlled for by the use of Cox analysis and then by matching Tx+ to Tx- patients based on identical hemoglobin levels at admission and by propensity matching.

Results

5.3% of Tx- patients died, compared with 11% of Tx+ patients (p = 0.001). The interaction of anemia and Tx was associated with a greater hazard of dying. In particular, A+Tx+ (anemic, received transfusion) patients had a threefold hazard of death (2.918, 95% confidence interval = 1.512–5.633, p = 0.001) compared with A-Tx- (nonanemic, no transfusion) patients. A+Tx+ patients had twice the hazard of dying as did A+Tx- (anemic, no transfusion) (hazard ratio = 2.087, 95% confidence interval = 1.004–4.336, p = 0.049). In populations matched by preoperative hemoglobin levels or by propensity scores, similar results were seen: a significant interaction between anemia and transfusion of red blood cells. A+Tx+ patients fared significantly worse than did the other three groups. Although there was no difference in mortality between A- patients who did or did not receive transfusions, A+T+ patients had triple the risk as A+T- patients, whereas A+Tx- patients had a similar risk of late mortality as A-Tx- patients.

Conclusions

The anemia-transfusion interaction was associated with an increased hazard of late mortality.

### Hematologic parameters, atherosclerotic progression, and prognosis in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (from the post CABG trial) [^1154CM7w]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Although inflammatory markers and anemia have both been associated with prognosis in patients with cardiovascular disease, their relation with atherosclerotic progression in patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is unknown. A total of 1,273 patients enrolled in the Post CABG Trial who had undergone CABG 1 to 11 years before entry were studied. Subjects were randomly assigned to lovastatin in low or high doses and low-dose warfarin or placebo in a factorial design. Subjects underwent coronary angiography at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 4.3 years. White blood cells (WBCs), hemoglobin, and platelets were measured at baseline in all subjects. Graft progression was defined as a decrease ≥ 0.6 mm in lumen diameter at the site of greatest change at follow-up. During follow-up, 195 subjects sustained a clinical event and 857 grafts developed significant worsening. Risk of clinical events tended to be greater with higher WBC counts, with hazard ratios for ascending quartiles of 1.4 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9 to 2.2), 1.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 2.6), and 1.6 (95% CI 1.0 to 2.7). WBC count also tended to be associated with significant atherosclerotic progression, particularly in subjects assigned to placebo rather than warfarin (p interaction = 0.04). There was no association of hemoglobin or platelet count with risk of clinical events or graft progression, but few trial subjects were anemic. In conclusion, WBC count is associated with a graded increase in cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery bypass grafts.

### Mean platelet volume may predict early clinical outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting [^116ELHHN]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the definitive surgical treatment of the coronary artery disease and can be performed with a low incidence of morbidity and mortality. European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) is widely accepted and used for routine application of risk stratification in adult cardiac surgery. However, there is always a tendency in search of more and more reliable and additional predictors.

Mean platelet volume (MPV) is a marker of platelet size and activation. Increased MPV reflects active and large platelets. MPV level is probably the most extensively used platelet activation marker. Activated platelets play a role in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease. Increased MPV level, an indicator of larger and more reactive platelets, has been reported to be associated with some cardiovascular diseases. Mean platelet volume has also been shown to be associated with late saphenous vein graft disease after CABG. Little is known, however, about the association of the MPV levels with the outcome of CABG.

Decreased hematocrit or hemoglobin level is a clinically important condition and it is not an uncommon finding in patients undergoing CABG. Many studies have established the association of anemia with increased perioperative morbidity and mortality. Patients undergoing CABG are the most sensitive to low levels of hematocrit because of their limited capacity of coronary level.

We hypothesized that an elevated MPV level would be associated with an increased incidence of adverse events after CABG surgery. In addition, we aimed to determine the predictive value of the preoperative MPV and hematocrit levels for the incidence of post-CABG adverse events.

### Impact of preoperative anemia on outcome in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery [^115XnbpP]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The risk of preoperative anemia in patients undergoing heart surgery has not been described precisely. Specifically, the impact of low hemoglobin per se or combined with other risk factors on postoperative outcome is unknown. Thus, we determined the effects of low preoperative hemoglobin and comorbidities on postoperative adverse outcomes in patients with coronary artery bypass graft in a large comprehensive multicenter study.

Methods and Results

The Multicenter Study of Perioperative Ischemia investigated 5065 patients with coronary artery bypass graft at 70 institutions worldwide, collecting approximately 7500 data points per patient. In 4804 patients who received no preoperative transfusions, we determined the association between lowest preoperative hemoglobin levels and in-hospital cardiac and noncardiac morbidity and mortality and the impact of concomitant risk factors, assessed by EuroSCORE, on this effect. In patients with EuroSCORE < 4 (n = 2054), only noncardiac outcomes were increased, whereas patients with EuroSCORE ≥ 4 (n = 2750) showed an increased incidence of all postoperative events, starting at hemoglobin < 11 g/dL. Low preoperative hemoglobin was an independent predictor for noncardiac (renal > cerebral; P < 0.001) outcomes, whereas the increase in cardiac events was due to other factors associated with preoperative anemia.

Conclusions

Anemic patients undergoing cardiac surgery have an increased risk of postoperative adverse events. Importantly, the extent of preexisting comorbidities substantially affects perioperative anemia tolerance. Therefore, preoperative risk assessment and subsequent therapeutic strategies, such as blood transfusion, should take into account both the individual level of preoperative hemoglobin and the extent of concomitant risk factors.

### Associations between preoperative anemia and outcomes after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting [^112jm8E5]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

It is still unclear whether patients with preoperative anemia have worse outcomes after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) than patients without preoperative anemia. The aim of this study was to assess differences in outcomes between patients with and without preoperative anemia who underwent off-pump CABG.

Methods

A total of 1,123 patients who underwent isolated off-pump CABG between September 2004 and December 2010 were enrolled. Perioperative outcomes were compared between 254 patients with preoperative anemia (hemoglobin level: males, < 12 g/dL; females, < 11 g/dL) and 869 patients without preoperative anemia.

Results

Patients with preoperative anemia were significantly older and more likely to be female than patients without preoperative anemia. Patients with preoperative anemia had higher rates of diabetes mellitus, acute coronary syndrome, and history of congestive heart failure, and had lower ejection fraction and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Patients with preoperative anemia had a higher operative death rate than patients without preoperative anemia, but this difference was not statistically significant (1.6% versus 0.3%; p = 0.0501). Univariate analysis showed that postoperative low cardiac output syndrome, hemodialysis requirement, and the composite adverse outcome were significantly higher in patients with preoperative anemia than in patients without preoperative anemia. However, multivariate analysis showed that preoperative anemia was not an independent predictor of operative death, low cardiac output, hemodialysis requirement, or the composite adverse outcome.

Conclusions

In patients undergoing isolated off-pump CABG, preoperative anemia was not an independent predictor of postoperative adverse events.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^115CqYGV]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Overall, there is strong evidence of correlations between anemia and a range of clinical outcomes. However, the panel acknowledged that anemia is not a confirmed cause of these outcomes; it is possible that anemia is a marker of other underlying morbidities that impair outcomes.

The importance of educating patients preoperatively about anemia and its correlation with postsurgical outcomes was recognized by the panel. Improved education is associated with increased adherence to treatment for anemia and may encourage dietary improvements, potentially leading to higher Hb levels at the time of surgery.–

The results of clinical studies investigating outcomes associated with preoperative anemia in specific types of surgery are presented in the Supplemental Digital Content (Parts 1, Supplemental Digital Content 3, and 4, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

Perioperative and postoperative anemia: Blood loss is an important cause of perioperative anemia, and surgical bleeding increases the risks of morbidity and mortality because of the need for RBC transfusion and the occurrence of hemorrhagic shock or ischemia.–In addition, if perioperative anemia remains undiagnosed and untreated, the patient may be placed at risk of negative outcomes including those described below for postoperative anemia.

Postoperative anemia has been associated with worsened clinical outcomes. A recent study of patients with colorectal cancer reported that postoperative anemia was associated with increased RBC transfusion, longer length of hospital stay, impaired quality of life scores, and lower overall survival at 5 years. In a retrospective analysis of 300 surgical patients who had declined RBC transfusions, the odds of death increased by a factor of 2.5 for each 1 g/dL decrease in postoperative Hb below 8 g/dL. A study of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients showed that decreased postoperative Hb levels were associated with increased all-cause mortality. Postoperative anemia was also associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events. In orthopedic surgery, hospital stay has been shown to be prolonged when the severity of postoperative anemia is increased. As with preoperative anemia, the panel acknowledged that postoperative anemia is not a confirmed cause of worsened clinical outcomes and that it could instead be a marker of other underlying morbidities.

Screening and Diagnosis

Consensus Statements: Screening

The prevalence of preoperative anemia and its association with worse clinical outcomes justify screening all patients for anemia before surgery, except those undergoing minor procedures.
Screening for preoperative anemia should not be restricted to patients undergoing elective surgery.
It is never too late to start anemia evaluation in patients undergoing elective or urgent surgery.

### Association between pre-operative borderline anaemia in women and outcome after coronary artery bypass grafting: data from the Netherlands heart registration [^1172JLBT]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Haemoglobin concentration thresholds differ between men and women, with borderline anaemia (haemoglobin ≥ 12.1 and < 13.1 g dl-1) considered normal in women. However, this haemoglobin range may increase the risk of postoperative adverse outcomes after cardiac surgery.

Objectives

To determine if pre-operative borderline anaemia in women is associated with increased postoperative mortality and morbidity following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Design

A retrospective observational cohort study.

Setting

Data from The Netherlands Heart Registration, a national cardiac surgery registry, were used to analyse patients undergoing CABG from January 2013 to December 2020.

Patients

A cohort of 7802 women undergoing CABG was analysed, of whom 25% (n = 1963) had pre-operative borderline anaemia. Inclusion criteria were adult women undergoing isolated CABG; exclusion criteria included patients with severe anaemia or non-CABG procedures.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was 120-day mortality. Secondary outcomes included postoperative renal failure and need for packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion.

Results

Borderline anaemia in women was not significantly associated with 120-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.2; 95% CI 0.8 to 1.9; P = 0.366). However, it was associated with an increased risk of renal failure (AOR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 4.2; P = 0.031) and PRBC transfusion (AOR 2.1; 95% CI 1.8 to 2.3; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Borderline anaemia, present in one-fourth of women undergoing CABG, does not increase mortality risk but is associated with higher postoperative morbidity, specifically renal failure and transfusion requirements.

Trial Registration

Not applicable.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^116ZQQYa]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Preoperative anemia and transfusion — associations with outcomes in coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are detailed, noting There is a distinct correlation between preoperative anemia and worse clinical outcomes in most studies. Usually, the greater the anemia, the more severe the complications. In a prospective observational study of more than 200 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, preoperative hematocrit remained an independent predictor for major morbidity (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; p = 0.01), while transfusion was also a strong predictor (OR, 4.86; P < .0001). In comparisons of patients undergoing CABG surgery who did or did not receive a transfusion, there was greater mortality in the patients who received a transfusion (11% vs 3%; p = 0.001). Patients with anemia who received a transfusion had a hazard rate for mortality 3 times higher than nonanemic patients who did not receive transfusion (hazard ratio [HR], 2.918; 95% confidence interval, 1.512–5.633; p = 0.001), and twice that of anemic patients who did not receive a transfusion (HR, 2.087; 95% CI, 1.004–4.336; p = 0.049). Beyond mortality, preoperative anemia has also been associated with increased transfusion rates and longer intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital lengths of stay and an increase in acute kidney injury, though 1 retrospective study found only normocytic or macrocytic anemia was associated with increased adverse events.

### Analysis of anemia, transfusions, and CABG outcomes in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons national database [^115u13qw]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

This study characterized the association of preoperative anemia and intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion on outcomes of elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Methods

Data from 53,856 patients who underwent CABG included in The Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Database in 2019 were used. The primary outcome was operative mortality. Secondary outcomes were postoperative complications. The association of anemia with outcomes was analyzed with multivariable regression models. The influence of intraoperative RBC transfusion on the effect of preoperative anemia on outcomes was studied using mediation analysis.

Results

Anemia was present in 25% of patients. Anemic patients had a higher STS Predicted Risk of Operative Mortality (1.2% vs 0.7%; P < .001). Anemia was associated with operative mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 99.5% CI, 1.00–1.61; p = 0.047), postoperative RBC transfusion (OR, 2.28; 99.5% CI, 2.12–2.44; P < .001), dialysis (OR, 1.58; 99.5% CI, 1.19–2.11; P < .001), and prolonged intensive care unit and hospital length of stay. Intraoperative RBC transfusion largely mediated the effects of anemia on mortality (76%), intensive care unit stay (99%), and hospital stay, but it only partially mediated the association with dialysis (34.9%).

Conclusions

Preoperative anemia is common in patients who undergo CABG and is associated with increased postoperative risks of mortality, complications, and RBC transfusion. However, most of the effect of anemia on mortality is mediated through intraoperative RBC transfusion.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^111TQxDJ]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

What are the unmet medical needs of postoperative anaemia?

The concerns surrounding postoperative anaemia relate to its potential impact on recovery, rehabilitation, hospital re‐admission or re‐operation, and patient well‐being. Reducing allogeneic blood transfusion improves long‐term outcome and survival 27. However, restrictive transfusion protocols have led to patients being discharged with lower haemoglobin levels than before. With the current paucity of data, it remains unclear whether a lower discharge haemoglobin level may allow optimal functional recovery and quality of life 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. There has been limited research on the consequences of postoperative anaemia in the recovery phase from surgery, with only a small number of studies after cardiac and hip and knee surgery, which demonstrated the association between postoperative anaemia and adverse outcomes such as prolonged recovery, increased mortality and likelihood of re‐admission 31, 32, 33. Postoperative anaemia may also potentially be associated with early postoperative myocardial infarction 34. Correction of postoperative anaemia, as suggested in this consensus statement, is intended to prevent such side‐effects, but studies are urgently needed to prove this.

### Perioperative Quality Initiative and enhanced recovery after surgery-cardiac society consensus statement on the management of preoperative anemia and iron deficiency in adult cardiac surgery patients [^116sVFaz]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Preoperative anemia is common in patients presenting for cardiac surgery, with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 4, and has been associated with worse outcomes including increased risk of blood transfusion, kidney injury, stroke, infection, and death. Iron deficiency, a major cause of anemia, has also been shown to have an association with worse outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, even in the absence of anemia. Although recent guidelines have supported diagnosing and treating anemia and iron deficiency before elective surgery, details on when and how to screen and treat remain unclear. The Eighth Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI 8) consensus conference, in conjunction with the Enhanced Recovery after Surgery-Cardiac Surgery Society, brought together an international, multidisciplinary team of experts to review and evaluate the literature on screening, diagnosing, and managing preoperative anemia and iron deficiency in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and to provide evidence-based recommendations in accordance with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria for evaluating biomedical literature.

### Impact of major bleeding and blood transfusions after cardiac surgery: analysis from the acute catheterization and urgent intervention triage strategY (ACUITY) trial [^113qoo5f]. American Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Prior retrospective studies have identified a relationship between bleeding after cardiac surgery and subsequent mortality. Whether this is attributable to bleeding, anemia, or transfusions is undetermined.

Methods

ACUITY was an international prospective trial of patients with acute coronary syndromes. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) before hospital discharge was performed in 1,491 patients. Major bleeding was adjudicated as CABG- or non-CABG related. The relationship between CABG-related bleeding and 1-year mortality was determined using a time-updated covariate-adjusted Cox model.

Results

Coronary artery bypass grafting-related major bleeding after surgery occurred in 789 patients (52.9%); allogeneic blood product transfusions were administered in 612 patients (41.0%), including red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in 570 (38.2%, range 1–53 U), platelet transfusions in 180 (12.1%), and fresh-frozen plasma in 195 (13.1%). One-year mortality occurred in 95 patients (6.4%). Red blood cell transfusion (but not transfusion of platelets or fresh-frozen plasma, CABG-related major bleeding per se, or nadir hemoglobin) was an independent predictor of 1-year mortality, but only after transfusion of ≥ 4 U (adjusted hazard ratio for death after transfusion of 1–3, 4–6, and ≥ 7 RBC units = 0.74, 2.01, and 5.22, respectively). Of the 95 deaths after CABG, 23 (24.2%) were attributable to CABG-related RBC transfusions.

Conclusions

In patients with acute coronary syndromes, RBC transfusion of ≥ 4 U after CABG is strongly associated with subsequent mortality. Future strategies should focus on reducing major hemorrhagic complications and RBC transfusions after CABG.

### Intraoperative red blood cell transfusion during coronary artery bypass graft surgery increases the risk of postoperative low-output heart failure [^11279XE4]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Hemodilutional anemia during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is associated with increased mortality during coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The impact of intraoperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion to treat anemia during surgery is less understood. We examined the relationship between anemia during CPB, RBC transfusion, and risk of low-output heart failure (LOF).

Methods and Results

Data were collected on 8004 isolated CABG patients in northern New England between 1996 and 2004. Patients were excluded if they experienced postoperative bleeding or received ≥ 3 units of transfused RBCs. LOF was defined as need for intraoperative or postoperative intra-aortic balloon pump, return to CPB, or ≥ 2 inotropes at 48 hours. Having a lower nadir HCT was also associated with an increased risk of developing LOF (adjusted odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.82 to 0.92; P = 0.016), and that risk was further increased when patients received RBC transfusion. When adjusted for nadir hematocrit, exposure to RBC transfusion was a significant, independent predictor of LOF (adjusted odds ratio, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.61; P = 0.047).

Conclusions

In this study, we observed that exposure to both hemodilutional anemia and RBC transfusion during surgery are associated with increased risk of LOF, defined as placement of an intraoperative or postoperative intra-aortic balloon pump, return to CPB after initial separation, or treatment with ≥ 2 inotropes at 48 hours postoperatively, after CABG. The risk of LOF is greater among patients exposed to intraoperative RBCs versus anemia alone.

### Prognostic implication of anemia on in-hospital outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention [^115WQjjF]. Circulation (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although prior studies have shown a relationship between anemia and in-hospital mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting and acute myocardial infarction (MI), the prognostic implication of anemia in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between anemia and outcomes of PCI.

Methods and Results

Clinical and outcome data on 48,851 consecutive PCIs were prospectively collected. Patients were classified as anemic using the World Health Organization definition (< 12.0 g/dL in women and < 13.0 g/dL in men). A total of 6471 men (21.7%) and 4659 women (30.4%) were anemic. Anemic men and women were older and had a higher percentage of comorbidities compared with their nonanemic cohorts (P < 0.0001 for all comparisons). When compared with nonanemic patients, anemic patients had higher in-hospital mortality (3.0% versus 0.8% in men; 2.4% versus 1.5% in women; P ≤ 0.0001) and postprocedural MI (2.0% versus 1.6% in men; 2.4% versus 1.6% in women; P ≤ 0.02) and a higher combined major cardiovascular events end point, including death, MI, and cerebrovascular event (5.0% versus 2.6% in men; 5.1% versus 3.5% in women; P < 0.0001). After adjustment for comorbidities, anemia was associated with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 2.29; 95% CI, 1.79 to 2.92; P < 0.0001) and MI (OR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.72; P = 0.02) and major cardiovascular events (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.34). Significant gender interactions were observed for death in men and for MI in women.

Conclusions

Preprocedural anemia is associated with increased adverse in-hospital outcomes after PCI. Whether optimization of hemoglobin before PCI is of clinical benefit will need to be determined in a randomized clinical trial.

### Preoperative anemia in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting predicts acute kidney injury [^112Y42Pc]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

Recent authoritative studies suggested that low preoperative hemoglobin concentration may affect cardiac surgery outcomes. This study aimed, primarily, to investigate whether preoperative anemia is an independent determinant of adverse events after coronary artery bypass grafting and, secondarily, to evaluate the potential dose responsiveness between anemia severity and primary end points.

Methods

This single-center prospective study investigated 1214 consecutive patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting between January 2004 and June 2007, collecting 100 variables per patient. In 1047 patients (median age 64 years, 18.8% female, 38.9% diabetic, 31.9% urgent/emergency, 15.3% with low preoperative left ventricular ejection fraction) who underwent on-pump procedures and received no preoperative transfusion, the prevalence of preoperative anemia (according to World Health Organization definition) and its unadjusted and adjusted relationships with in-hospital death, cardiac morbidity, and acute kidney injury (AKI-RIFLE [Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage kidney disease] criteria) were obtained.

Results

The prevalence of preoperative anemia was 28%. In-hospital death averaged 3.9%, cardiac morbidity 7.3%, and acute kidney injury 4%. Unadjusted odds ratios (Ors) for in-hospital death, cardiac morbidity, and acute kidney injury were 3.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.0–7.3), 1.7 (95% CI 1.1–2.8), and 4.0 (95% CI 2.1–7.6), respectively. Adjusting for anemia in confounders proved an independent predictor of acute kidney injury (OR 2.06; 95% CI 1.14–3.70), whereas the cardiac morbidity and in-hospital mortality were independently predicted by kidney function. No dose-response relationship emerged between anemia severity and acute kidney injury.

Conclusions

Preoperative anemia is independently associated with acute kidney injury after coronary artery bypass grafting. Further studies are warranted to determine whether preoperative low hemoglobin concentration is a marker of severity of illness or a modifiable risk factor.

### Mortality across the spectrum of hemoglobin level in patients undergoing surgical coronary revascularization [^115WwXuw]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4.1 Limitations

We did our best to include and adjust all important confounding parameters. However, more data are needed to evaluate etiologic pathways in addition to other possible confounders which were not included. In assessing blood loss in the operation room, the number of transfused packed cells is among the important variables. The association between transfusion and post‐CABG mortality has been established before, and its effect is independent of the presence of preoperative anemia and Hb levels. To decrease the effect of this confounder, we enrolled only nonanemic patients in our study. Although not able to omit this factor and as reported before that most anemic patients who underwent CABG needed blood transfusion during surgery, our inclusion criteria could overcome this issue to some extent.

Mid‐ and long‐term outcomes are associated with much more parameters and cannot be justified merely with preoperative baseline characteristics. Unfortunately, we could not capture changes in risk factor profile after CABG; hence postdischarge results should be assessed with caution. Finally, the single‐center nature of our study is another limitation that should be taken into consideration. This warrants further similar studies in other settings to confirm the findings of the present study.

### Preoperative anemia does not increase the risks of early surgical revascularization after myocardial infarction [^117Wtvue]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Recent clinical studies suggest preoperative anemia may increase mortality and morbidity after cardiac surgery. Anemic patients are potentially even more vulnerable in the setting of a recent myocardial infarction (MI). The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of preoperative anemia on short-term outcomes after coronary bypass surgery in patients with a recent MI.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 655 patients who underwent an isolated coronary bypass procedure within 21 days of MI, 432 of whom were anemic preoperatively, defined as a hemoglobin less than 13 g/dL for men and less than 12 g/dL for women. The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and major adverse events (MAE), which included MI, stroke, and renal failure requiring dialysis.

Results

Before risk adjustment, in-hospital mortality and the incidence of MAE were significantly higher in patients with anemia versus no anemia (mortality, 5.1% versus 1.4%, p = 0.02; MAE, 8.6% versus 3.1%, p = 0.009). After risk adjustment, the association between preoperative anemia and mortality or MAE became insignificant (mortality odds ratio 2.34, 95% confidence interval: 0.56 to 9.87, p = 0.25; MAE odds ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval: 0.46 to 2.79, p = 0.78). Preoperative hemoglobin, treated as a continuous variable, yielded similar results.

Conclusions

Preoperative anemia does not directly increase risks of surgical revascularization performed within 21 days of MI.

Results

Identification and characteristics of eligible studies

The search yielded 923 citations (206 from PubMed, 610 from Embase and 107 from CENTRAL). We excluded 233 duplicates and a further 657 citations after title and abstract screening and assessed 33 full texts. Finally, 6 RCTs and 5 observational studies were included in this meta-analysis (Fig. 1). The characteristics of the included studies are described in Table 1. There were 2286 patients included in this study. The sample size of the included studies ranged from 40 to 771 patients. Four RCTs compared IV iron (combined with other agents in three studies) with placebo, 2 RCTs compared IV iron with oral iron, and 5 observational studies compared IV iron with no treatment. Additionally, although all studies investigated the effect of IV iron, the drug was administered at different dosages and time intervals. The dosage of IV iron ranged from 200 to 1000 mg per patient, and the time interval of IV iron administration ranged from one day before surgery to 10 weeks before surgery. Four RCTs and two observational studies noted elaborate transfusion triggers in their studies, with hemoglobin levels ranging from 7 to 8 g/L.

### Different antithrombotic strategies after coronary artery bypass grafting to prevent adverse events: a retrospective analysis [^1144UHad]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Antiplatelet therapy is a major strategy to prevent post-CABG failure and adverse events. While aspirin therapy after CABG has been proven to be a safe approach to improve vein graft patency and reduce adverse events, there have been no dedicated large-scale studies in the CABG population to support postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy. Continuation of DAPT before the surgery increases the risk of excessive perioperative bleeding, transfusions, and re-exploration for bleeding, which suggests the likelihood of a high risk of bleeding in postoperative DAPT patients. In a meta-analysis of 20,315 patients, DAPT (as compared to single antiplatelet therapy) was associated with reduced cardiovascular mortality in observational studies, but not in randomized trials or in patients with stable ischemic heart disease. Additionally, DAPT was correlated with an increased risk for major bleeding in that study. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline Focused Update on Duration of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease issued recommendations to utilize DAPT over SAPT in patients following CABG in 2016. Another meta-analysis showed increased vein graft patency with DAPT, but increased postoperative bleeding was also noted. Current guidelines recommend postoperative DAPT based upon the stability of coronary artery disease prior to CABG. In 2017, F. Biancari et al. proposed a Will-Bleed score to evaluate the risk of severe bleeding after CABG. Seven parameters with different weights were included in this model: preoperative anemia, female gender, eGFR, potent antiplatelet drugs discontinued less than five days, critical preoperative state, ACS, and use of LMWH/fondaparinux/unfractionated heparin. This risk score simplified the evaluating process and showed optimistic ability for prediction.

### Impact of red blood cell transfusion on in-hospital mortality of isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery: a retrospective observational study of French nationwide 3-year cohort [^116pNQ4n]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess the relationship between red blood cell (RBC) transfusion exposure and in-hospital mortality after isolated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Background

RBC transfusion was commonly used to treat anemia in isolated CABG surgery, but transfusion was found an independent risk factor of postoperative mortality; recent guidelines on patient blood management strategy issued in the last decade may have changed transfusion incidence and related mortality.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted from the National database on patients' hospital discharge reports. Consecutive adult patients who underwent isolated CABG surgery in France from January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, were included. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality rate. RBC transfusion during the hospital stay was identified by specific codes and ordered as categorical variables (no, moderate, or massive transfusion).

Results

A total of 37,498 participants were studied [mean (SD) age, 66.5 (9.6) years, 31,587 (84.2%) were men]. In-hospital mortality rate was 1.45% (n = 541) and RBC transfusion rate was 9.4% (n = 3521). In-hospital deaths were more frequent among transfused patients [1.06% (361) if no transfusion up to 10.2% (n = 113) if massive transfusion]. After adjustment for confounding variables, RBC transfusion remained a significant independent factor of in-hospital mortality: odds ratio = 1.66 (95% confidence interval: 1.27–2.19, P < 0.001) for moderate transfusion, 6.40 (95% confidence interval: 5.07–8.09, P < 0.001) if massive.

Conclusions and Relevance

Despite a modest patients' exposure to transfusion, this study suggests that RBC administration is an independent factor of in-hospital mortality in isolated CABG surgery.

### The association between preoperative anemia, blood transfusion need, and postoperative complications in adult cardiac surgery, a single center contemporary experience [^116F3XcX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), anemia is defined as a hemoglobin (Hb) level of less than 13.0 g/dl in adult males or less than 12.0 g/dl in nonpregnant adult females. Preoperative anemia may be associated with the worst postoperative outcomes in cardiac surgery, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 16 to 54%. A multicenter study performed by Sallam et al. demonstrated that patients with preoperative anemia are more susceptible to developing sternal wound infections than nonanemic patients. Another study showed that the one-year mortality rate is significantly higher in patients with preoperative anemia, but there were no significant differences in one-month mortality rates. Nevertheless, other studies suggested that preoperative anemia is not an independent risk factor after multivariate-adjusted analysis but rather a marker of underlying comorbidities, including age, acute coronary syndrome, diabetes, renal insufficiency, and extensive coronary disease, which are associated with poor postoperative outcome.

Furthermore, preoperative anemia is an independent predictor for increased transfusion requirements during cardiac surgery. A study performed by Nguyen et al. showed that the transfusion rate in cardiac surgery among anemic patients was 53% versus 10% in the nonanemic group. Transfusion of blood and blood products is associated with the risk of posttransfusion complications, and therefore, anemic patients are at higher risk of developing postoperative complications. The most common postoperative complications found were mortality, organ dysfunction, serious infections, renal failure, cardiac complications, neurologic complications, overall morbidity, and prolonged ventilator support. Al-harbi et al. found a significant increase in the risk of infection after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) in patients who received blood transfusions, and pneumonia was the most reported infection after CABG. In addition, patients who received a blood transfusion had longer preoperative and postoperative hospitalization times than those who did not receive any blood transfusions. A longer hospitalization duration predisposed the patients to a higher risk of developing nosocomial infections. Other studies, however, have found no association between blood transfusion and the incidence of infection, acute kidney injury (AKI), or long-term mortality (30 days to 5 years).

### Transfusion thresholds for acute coronary syndromes-insights from the TRICS-III randomized controlled trial, systematic review, and meta-analysis [^112ZqmiW]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2023). Medium credibility.

Both anemia and red blood cell transfusion are associated with morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized for acute coronary syndromes (ACSs); these exposures are tightly linked, and their attributable risks are difficult to isolate. To reduce unnecessary blood exposure, transfusion should only be administered if/when its net benefits outweigh the risks associated with anemia. Hemoglobin thresholds are currently used for evaluating the severity of anemia and for guiding transfusion therapy; however, there is controversy surrounding the optimal hemoglobin threshold for transfusion in this patient population. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing hemoglobin‐guided restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies are difficult to interpret, and there is a paucity of available data on long‐term outcomes. We therefore performed a subset analysis of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in the TRICS‐III (Transfusion Thresholds in Cardiac Surgery) RCT to add evidence addressing this important clinical question and further interpret the results using a systematic‐review, meta‐analysis, and trial‐sequential analysis.

The previously describedmultinational TRICS‐III trial (NCT02042898) randomly assigned patients with a moderate‐to‐high risk of death undergoing cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass to a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfuse at a hemoglobin level < 7.5 g/dL) or liberal strategy (operating room and intensive care unit: transfuse at a hemoglobin level < 9.5 g/dL; ward: < 8.5 g/dL). Appropriate ethical board review and approval were obtained from each participating site, and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Patients with AMI were those with a recent myocardial infarction (MI) (< 90 days of surgery) undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery and ≥ 1 of the following enrichment criteria: unstable angina, critical preoperative state, use of preoperative intra‐aortic balloon pump, and/or undergoing emergency surgery. The primary outcome was a per‐protocol analysis of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) defined as all‐cause death, MI, and revascularization at 6 months.

### Modifiable risk factors remain significant causes of medium term mortality after first time coronary artery bypass grafting [^115XME8k]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Caputo et al reported the medium term survival of 1,479 patients who had undergone off-pump coronary arterial revascularisation. They reported a 2 year mortality of 4.7% in patients who received a complete revascularisation. Of note they found a 10.8% 2 year mortality in patients who received an incomplete revascularisation. Our 2 year survival is therefore comparable to this cohort of patients operated on with off pump surgery with complete revascularization.

The Multicenter Study of Perioperative Ischemia Research Group found in an analysis of 2,048 patients from 24 centres that the 5 year survival was adversely impacted by age, diabetes, congestive heart failure and anaemia, in agreement with our own results.

Gao et al analysed 56,543 patients who underwent CABG at one of 43 veterans hospitals for risk factors for long term survival. They found that diabetes had an increasing impact on survival, eventually doubling mortality at 9 years post-operatively. They also found that COPD, age and urgent surgery persisted as a risk factor in the years post surgery in agreement with our results. Their 5 year survival was 81% in their cohort of patients with the same mean age as our own.

### Perioperative anemia management as part of PBM in cardiac surgery – A narrative updated review [^1123LVdG]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Anemia is common in patients with cardiac disease. Iron deficiency is the cause of anemia in about 80% of all cases. Preoperative anemia is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The risk of receiving red blood cell transfusions, which are potentially associated with severe side effects, is very high in these patients. Patient Blood Management (PBM) is a multidisciplinary approach to manage anemia, minimize unnecessary blood loss, and optimize transfusion therapy. PBM comprises 3 pillars: (1) detection and treatment of preoperative anemia, (2) reduction of perioperative blood loss, and (3) optimization of allogeneic blood therapy. The World Health Organization has urged all Member States to implement PBM. This narrative review focuses on pre-, intra-, and postoperative strategies to detect, prevent, and treat anemia as part of PBM in cardiac surgery.

### Preoperative anemia increases mortality and postoperative morbidity after cardiac surgery [^116EpebU]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, preoperative anemia, defined as hemoglobin level < 13 g/dl for men and < 12 g/dl for women, is an independent risk factor for mortality, postoperative renal dysfunction, stroke and prolonged hospital stay.

### Patient blood management in Europe [^114jCQwq]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Prospective and retrospective cohort studies have consistently shown that patients with preoperative anaemia have poorer postoperative outcomes than non-anaemic patients. Early data suggested that severe preoperative anaemia (Hb < 8 g dL −1) independently predicted postoperative mortality in patients undergoing various unspecified types of surgery. A recent retrospective cohort study demonstrated a higher postoperative 30 day morbidity and mortality in patients who underwent major non-cardiac surgery with preoperative anaemia than in those without anaemia. In elderly patients with hip fracture, anaemia (Hb < 12 g dL −1 for females and < 13 g dL −1 for males) was significantly associated with 2- to 5- and 3-fold increases in the multivariate-adjusted risk of 6 and 12 month mortality, respectively. Patients with Hb < 10 g dL −1 were at a 5-fold increased risk of death. Subsequent studies have confirmed the association between preoperative anaemia and postoperative mortality in this population, and in patients undergoing other types of surgery. In addition to mortality, preoperative anaemia is also significantly and independently associated with increased morbidity, including the elevated risk of infectious complications and a prolongation of postoperative hospital stay. – Some studies have linked perioperative anaemia to impaired postoperative functional recovery after surgery for hip fracture, although it was not an independent factor in a prospective multivariate analysis. In addition, anaemia is a risk factor for both early and late mortality in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Transfusion may be regarded as the default therapy for anaemia, as it is considered as safe and is rapidly effective. However, accumulating, there is increasing evidence that the correction of preoperative anaemia using transfusion is associated with risks that may contribute to morbidity and mortality in surgical patients. Consequently, there is increasing recognition of new approaches to the management of anaemia, collectively referred to as patient blood management (PBM). This article, based on discussions held by a panel of expert anaesthetists, surgeons, and nurses, explores the risks associated with the use of red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in the management of perioperative anaemia, primarily in orthopaedic surgery, and the role of PBM in improving the quality of care in this setting. It also highlights examples of successful PBM programmes, overviews current practice patterns in Europe, and offers recommendations for supporting the wider implementation of PBM.

### Thrombocytopenia and anemia after cardiac surgery [^113Kg1Rw]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Case Presentation

An 83‐year‐old Caucasian female with hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes presented to the hospital with acute chest pain, nausea, and diaphoresis; she had a previous history of coronary angioplasty (9 years prior). Acute non‐ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) was diagnosed based upon non‐specific T wave abnormalities and high‐sensitivity troponin‐I rise (peak, 780 ng/mL; reference range [RR], < 40). She received enteric‐coated aspirin (160 mg first dose; subsequently, 81 mg daily) and 2.5 mg of fondaparinux daily by subcutaneous injection. Heart catheterization, performed with 3000 units (U) of unfractionated heparin [UFH], revealed triple‐vessel coronary artery disease (including 80% stenosis in the left anterior descending artery), with left ventricle function preserved; coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery was scheduled.

CABG surgery is common in the United States (400 000 procedures per year). While percutaneous coronary intervention may be used to treat NSTEMI, CABG is often performed for triple‐vessel coronary disease with stenosi(e)s greater than 70%. Patlolla and coworkers reported better long‐term survival in patients undergoing CABG surgery within 7 days following NSTEMI versus CABG surgery performed later. This patient was judged to be a relatively good candidate for CABG. This patient was treated in a Canadian hospital, and thus the antithrombin‐dependent pentasaccharide anticoagulant, fondaparinux — which is approved in Canada for coronary artery thrombosis prophylaxis in STEMI patients based upon efficacy and safety (versus enoxaparin) in this clinical setting — was administered (note: fondaparinux is not approved for coronary thrombosis prophylaxis by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration).

### Hemoglobin optimization for coronary bypass: a 10-year Canadian multicenter experience [^116hdpkR]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We report our 10-year experience of a multicenter hemoglobin optimization program with the aim to reduce red blood cell transfusion in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Methods

From 2006 to 2016, patients undergoing CABG at 10 centers in Ontario were referred to the Ontario Transfusion Coordinators (ONTraC) program. Of these, we present data on the first 60 consecutive patients per center, per year (n = 6,145).

Results

Overall, 45.7% patients were assessed < 14 days preoperatively, 16.4% were assessed ≥ 14 days preoperatively, and 37.9% were not assessed by ONTraC preoperatively. Transfusion rates fell from 40.1% in 2006 to 26.2% in 2016 (p < 0.01). Patients undergoing assessment were more likely to be older (p < 0.01), female (p < 0.01), and anemic (p < 0.01) versus nonassessed patients. Those patients assessed were more likely to be treated with iron (p < 0.01) and erythropoietin (p < 0.01) preoperatively versus nonassessed patients. Transfusion rates were 26%, 28%, and 28% for patients undergoing assessment ≥ 14 days prior to operation, < 14 days prior to operation, or not at all. After baseline covariate adjustment, patients assessed ≥ 14 days preoperatively had shorter length of stay (effect -0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.41 to -0.25; p < 0.01) and a trend towards lower risk of red blood cell transfusion (odds ratio [OR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.00; p = 0.06). Blood transfusion was independently associated with an increased risk of death (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.60; p < 0.01), infection (OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.30; p < 0.01), and longer hospital length of stay (effect 1.49, 95% CI 1.35 to 1.62; p < 0.01).

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that preoperative hemoglobin optimization may be effective in reducing red blood cell transfusion after CABG, particularly for patients assessed ≥ 14 days preoperatively.

### Unexpected impact of preoperative anemia in low-risk isolated coronary artery bypass grafting or single-valve surgical patients: Do not overlook these patients in anemia management! [^115KhUdw]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Preoperative anemia is prevalent in cardiac surgery and independently associated with increased risk for short-term and long-term mortality. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of preoperative hematocrit (Hct) on outcomes in cardiac surgical patients and whether the effect is comparable across levels of Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS PROM).

Methods

The study consisted of adult, isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) or single-valve surgical patients in a statewide registry from 2011 to 2022 (N = 29,828). Regressions were used to assess effect of preoperative Hct on STS-defined major morbidity/mortality including the interaction of Hct and STS PROM as continuous variables.

Results

Median age was 66 years (58–73 years), STS PROM was 1.02% (0.58%-1.99%), and preoperative Hct was 39.5% (35.8%-42.8%). The sample consisted of 78% isolated CABG (n = 23,261), 10% isolated mitral valve repair/replacement (n = 3119), 12% isolated aortic valve replacement (n = 3448), and 29% were female (n = 8646). Multivariable analyses found that greater Hct was associated with reduced risk of STS-defined morbidity/mortality (odds ratio, 0.96; P < .001). These effects for Hct persisted even after adjustment for intraoperative blood transfusion. The interaction of Hct and STS PROM was significant for morbidity/mortality (odds ratio, 1.01; P < .001). There was a stronger association between Hct levels and morbidity/mortality risk in the patients with the lowest STS risk compared with patients with the greatest STS risk.

Conclusions

Patients with lower risk had a greater association between preoperative Hct and major morbidity and mortality compared with patients with greater risk. Preoperative anemia management is essential across all risk groups for improved outcomes.

### The impact of an hematocrit of 20% during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass for elective low risk coronary artery bypass graft surgery on oxygen delivery and clinical outcome – a randomized controlled study [^1134AWpW]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) induces hemodilutional anemia, which frequently requires the transfusion of blood products. The objective of this study was to evaluate oxygen delivery and consumption and clinical outcome in low risk patients who were allocated to an hematocrit (Hct) of 20% versus 25% during normothermic CPB for elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Methods

This study was a prospective, randomized and controlled trial. Patients were subjected to normothermic CPB (35 to 36 degrees C) and were observed until discharge from the intensive care unit (ICU). Outcome measures were calculated whole body oxygen delivery, oxygen consumption and clinical outcome. A nonparametric multivariate analysis of variance for repeated measurements and small sample sizes was performed.

Results

In a total of 54 patients (25% Hct, n = 28; 20% Hct, n = 26), calculated oxygen delivery (p = 0.11), oxygen consumption (p = 0.06) and blood lactate (p = 0.60) were not significantly different between groups. Clinical outcomes were not different between groups.

Conclusion

These data indicate that an Hct of 20% during normothermic CPB maintained calculated whole body oxygen delivery above a critical level after elective CABG surgery in low risk patients. The question of whether a transfusion trigger in excess of 20% Hct during normothermic CPB is still supported requires a larger prospective and randomized trial.

### Preoperative anemia increases mortality and postoperative morbidity after cardiac surgery [^1148x2t4]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

Our study demonstrates that preoperative anemia defined by the World Health Organization as hemoglobin level < 13 g/dl for men and < 12 gr/dl for women, is a risk factor for mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Low levels of hemoglobin were associated with tripling in the risk of death and postoperative renal dysfunction. Furthermore, patients with preoperative anemia had a 30% increased risk of prolonged hospital stay > 7 days. We did not observe any significant relationship between anemia and the risk of myocardial infarction. Finally, as shown in Figure 3, the estimated probability of death increased with decreasing levels of preoperative hemoglobin.

Anemia is an established risk factor for cardiovascular disease in the general population. The authors of the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study analyzed 14,410 low risk subjects in the general population between the ages of 45 and 64 years and suggested that anemia was associated with increased risk in the total rate of myocardial infarction, coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass surgery or heart disease death. Moreover, several studies have shown that low levels of hemoglobin were independent predictors of mortality and morbidity in patients with heart failure and coronary artery disease. In a cohort of 12,065 patients with new-onset heart failure, Ezekowitz showed a 34% increased risk in mortality associated with anemia. Furthermore, Sabatine et al. in a review of 39,922 patients from 16 randomized trials, demonstrated that patients with ST- elevation MI had a progressive increase in cardiovascular mortality and heart failure as the baseline hemoglobin dropped below 14 g/dl, whereas subjects with non ST-elevation MI had an increased odds of cardiovascular death, MI, and recurrent ischemia as the baseline hemoglobin fell below 11 g/dl.

### Preoperative anemia and postoperative outcomes in cardiac surgery: a mediation analysis evaluating intraoperative transfusion exposures [^111EJAWS]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative anemia is associated with adverse outcomes in cardiac surgery, yet it remains unclear what proportion of this association is mediated through red blood cell (RBC) transfusions.

Methods

This is a historical observational cohort study of adults undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting or valve surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass at an academic medical center between May 1, 2008, and May 1, 2018. A mediation analysis framework was used to evaluate the associations between preoperative anemia and postoperative outcomes, including a primary outcome of acute kidney injury (AKI). Intraoperative RBC transfusions were evaluated as mediators of preoperative anemia and outcome relationships. The estimated total effect, average direct effect of preoperative anemia, and percent of the total effect mediated through transfusions are presented with 95% confidence intervals and P -values.

Results

A total of 4117 patients were included, including 1234 (30%) with preoperative anemia. Overall, 437 of 4117 (11%) patients went on to develop AKI, with a greater proportion of patients having preoperative anemia (219 of 1234 [18%] vs 218 of 2883 [8%]). In multivariable analyses, the presence of preoperative anemia was associated with increased postoperative AKI (6.4% [4.2%-8.7%] absolute difference in percent with AKI, P < .001), with incremental decreases in preoperative hemoglobin concentrations displaying greater AKI risk (eg, 11.9% [6.9%-17.5%] absolute increase in probability of AKI for preoperative hemoglobin of 9 g/dL compared to a reference of 14 g/dL, P < .001). The association between preoperative anemia and postoperative AKI was primarily due to direct effects of preoperative anemia (5.9% [3.6%-8.3%] absolute difference, P < .001) rather than mediated through intraoperative RBC transfusions (7.5% [-4.3% to 21.1%] of the total effect mediated by transfusions, P = 0.220). Preoperative anemia was also associated with longer hospital durations (1.07 [1.05–1.10] ratio of geometric mean length of stay, P < .001). Of this total effect, 38% (22%, 62%; P < .001) was estimated to be mediated through subsequent intraoperative RBC transfusion. Preoperative anemia was not associated with reoperation or vascular complications.

Conclusions

Preoperative anemia was associated with higher odds of AKI and longer hospitalizations in cardiac surgery. The attributable effects of anemia and transfusion on postoperative complications are likely to differ across outcomes. Future studies are necessary to further evaluate mechanisms of anemia-associated postoperative organ injury and treatment strategies.

### Blood transfusions in cardiac surgery: indications, risks, and conservation strategies [^112QE61q]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Although red blood cell (RBC) transfusions are frequently used in cardiac operations, an increasing amount of data has demonstrated deleterious consequences. Consequently, the appropriate use of this limited resource is unclear. In this review, we discuss the relationship between anemia and the outcomes of cardiac surgical procedures, the risks associated with RBC transfusion, and the impact of blood transfusions on mortality and morbidity after cardiac operations. The review concludes with a discussion of randomized trials comparing restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies and a consideration of blood conservation techniques.

### Influence of chronic kidney disease on early clinical outcomes after off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting [^1169SnGp]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Preoperative CKD and worse renal function is associated with increased hospital stay and costs. Creatinine clearance rates decreasing from 80 mL/min to 60 mL/min, 40 mL/min, and 20 mL/min result in total hospital expenses increasing by 10, 20, and 30%, respectively; the incidence and mortality related to dialysis also increases. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen perioperative management and develop comprehensive strategies for high-risk patients, to improve prognosis and reduce complications and mortality. We suggest: 1. Preoperative assessment of high-risk patients with CKD is conducive to rational allocation of medical resources and targeted prevention and management. More severe preoperative CKD is associated with higher surgical mortality. A retrospective analysis of 483,914 patients undergoing CABG alone showed that the operative mortality rate was 1.3% in patients with normal renal function and increased to 9.3% in those with severe renal insufficiency (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2) not on dialysis. Conversely, for every 10 mL/min/1.73 m 2 increase in eGFR, the risk of death decreases by 20%. The use of the CKD-EPI equation to calculate eGFR for grouping patients according to CKD severity is also a good predictor of postoperative complications and mortality. Charytan et al. suggested that factors such as repeat cardiac surgery, stroke, cardiogenic shock, emergency surgery, and composite valve surgery should be included in the preoperative risk assessment to identify high-risk patients for surgery; however, the specificity and sensitivity of these factors require verification. 2. Active control of complications, such as controlling hypertension, correcting anemia, and rational treatment of peripheral artery disease is important. Patients with CKD have a high incidence of hypertension, which may lead to or result from CKD. Hypertension aggravates CKD, which then increases the difficulty of controlling hypertension. Anemia is also a common manifestation with renal insufficiency, and renal dysfunction leads to decreased erythropoietin secretion and anemia. Both anemia and CKD can predict myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary heart disease; the severity of the anemia is associated with the degree of myocardial ischemia. 3. New targeted drug therapies such as small-dose human atrial natriuretic peptide injections perioperatively during on-pump CABG can improve perioperative cardiac and renal function and reduce the incidence of cardiac events and new dialysis requirement. However, the role of human atrial natriuretic peptide injections in off-pump CABG must be verified.

### Rationale and design of the intravenous iron for treatment of anemia before cardiac surgery trial [^1173QC8Q]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Background Approximately 20% to 30% of patients awaiting cardiac surgery are anemic. Anemia increases the likelihood of requiring a red cell transfusion and is associated with increased complications, intensive care, and hospital stay following surgery. Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of anemia and preoperative intravenous (IV) iron therapy thus may improve anemia and therefore patient outcome following cardiac surgery. We have initiated the intravenous iron for treatment of anemia before cardiac surgery (ITACS) Trial to test the hypothesis that in patients with anemia awaiting elective cardiac surgery, IV iron will reduce complications, and facilitate recovery after surgery. Methods ITACS is a 1,000 patient, international randomized trial in patients with anemia undergoing elective cardiac surgery. The patients, health care providers, data collectors, and statistician are blinded to whether patients receive IV iron 1,000 mg, or placebo, at 1–26 weeks before their planned date of surgery. The primary endpoint is the number of days alive and at home up to 90 days after surgery. Results To date, ITACS has enrolled 615 patients in 30 hospitals in 9 countries. Patient mean (SD) age is 66 (12) years, 63% are male, with a mean (SD) hemoglobin at baseline of 118 (12) g/L; 40% have evidence (ferritin < 100 ng/mL and/or transferrin saturation < 25%) suggestive of iron deficiency. Most (59%) patients have undergone coronary artery surgery with or without valve surgery. Conclusions The ITACS Trial will be the largest study yet conducted to ascertain the benefits and risks of IV iron administration in anemic patients awaiting cardiac surgery.

### Postoperative outcomes following cardiac surgery in non-anaemic iron-replete and iron-deficient patients-an exploratory study [^115vNt2a]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Iron deficiency anaemia is strongly associated with poor outcomes after cardiac surgery. However, pre-operative non-anaemic iron deficiency (a probable anaemia precursor) has not been comprehensively examined in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, despite biological plausibility and evidence from other patient populations of negative effect on outcome. This exploratory retrospective cohort study aimed to compare an iron-deficient group of patients undergoing cardiac surgery with an iron-replete group. Consecutive non-anaemic patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting or single valve replacement in our institution between January 2013 and December 2015 were considered for inclusion. Data from a total of 277 patients were analysed, and were categorised by iron status and blood haemoglobin concentration into iron-deficient (n = 109) and iron-replete (n = 168) groups. Compared with the iron-replete group, patients in the iron-deficient group were more likely to be female (43% vs. 12%, iron-replete, respectively); older, mean (SD) age 64.4 (9.7) vs. 63.2 (10.3) years; and to have a higher pre-operative EuroSCORE (median IQR [range]) 3 (2–5 [0–10]) vs. 3 (2–4 [0–9]), with a lower preoperative haemoglobin of 141.6 (11.6) vs. 148.3 (11.7) g.l -1. Univariate analysis suggested that iron-deficient patients had a longer hospital length of stay (7 (6–9 [2–40]) vs. 7 (5–8 [4–23]) days; p = 0.013) and fewer days alive and out of hospital at postoperative day 90 (83 (80–84 [0–87]) vs. 83 (81–85 [34–86]), p = 0.009). There was no evidence of an association between iron deficiency and either lower nadir haemoglobin or higher requirement for blood products during inpatient stay. After adjusting the model for pre-operative age, sex, renal function, EuroSCORE and haemoglobin, the mean increase in hospital length of stay in the iron-deficient group relative to the iron-replete group was 0.86 days (bootstrapped 95%CI -0.37 to 2.22, p = 0.098). This exploratory study suggests there is weak evidence of an association between non-anaemic iron deficiency and outcome after cardiac surgery after controlling for potentially confounding variables.

Preoperative management — risk assessment for anemia in cardiac surgery states: Assessment of anemia and determination of its etiology is appropriate in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and it is reasonable to treat with intravenous iron preparations if time permits (Class IIa, Level B-R). Anemia burden is substantial, with the prevalence of anemia in the 30% to 40% range and severe anemia by World Health Organization classification of hemoglobin of less than 8 g/dL in the 8% to 10% range. Iron deficiency is the most prevalent cause of anemia in the cardiac surgical population, occurring in up to 50% of anemic patients; iron‑deficiency anemia is usually microcytic, whereas normocytic or macrocytic anemia stem from a variety of causes. Routine iron studies are of importance in the determination of the type of anemia present and should be done routinely in the careful preoperative assessment of patients so that treatment can be instituted if warranted, and differentiation must be made between anemias caused by iron deficiency as opposed to other causes of anemia.

### On-pump versus off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery in patients with preoperative anemia [^111mnG3J]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

The study objective was to evaluate the effects on early outcome and midterm survival of performing coronary artery bypass grafting with the off-pump technique in comparison with cardiopulmonary bypass (on-pump) in patients with preoperative anemia.

Methods

Consecutive adult anemic patients (preoperative hemoglobin < 13.0 g/dL in men and < 12.0 g/dL in women) resident in Puglia region who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting between January 2011 and November 2013 were considered. Vital status was ascertained from the date of surgery to December 31, 2013. Odds ratio and hazard ratio (HR) were estimated. Propensity score methods were used to control for confounders.

Results

Of 939 anemic patients (234 female, aged 71 ± 9 years), 361 underwent operation with the off-pump technique and 578 underwent operation with the on-pump technique. Patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass had a shorter intensive care unit length of stay, lower blood transfusion rate, and postoperative reduction in creatinine clearance. During a median follow-up of 18 months, 126 patients died: 46 in hospital (35 on-pump) and 80 after discharge (33 on-pump). In comparison with the off-pump technique, the on-pump technique had greater hospital mortality (odds ratio, 2.57; p = 0.028) and 30-day incidence of fatal events (HR, 2.67; p = 0.026). After a period without risk differences between groups (1–6 months; HR, 0.79; p = 0.618), a lower mortality in those undergoing the on-pump technique was detected (after 6 months HR, 0.35; p = 0.014). All results were confirmed in the 157 pairs of patients matched for propensity score, anemia grade, and surgery center.

Conclusions

In patients with low levels of preoperative hemoglobin, off-pump coronary artery bypass was associated with lower early morbidity and mortality but a greater risk of mortality during follow-up compared with on-pump coronary artery bypass.

### Arterial and venous thrombosis complicating coronary artery bypass grafting after use of epoetin alfa-epbx [^117RxZWH]. JTCVS Techniques (2020). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary artery and aortic arch thrombosis after the use of epoetin alfa-epbx.

Central Message

We would like to add to the evidence that the use of erythropoietin-stimulating agents for preoperative anemia in patients undergoing cardiac surgery may carry a substantial risk of thrombotic events.

See Commentaries on pages 156 and 158.

Epoetin alfa-epbx is one of the erythropoietin-stimulating agents (ESAs) produced using recombinant DNA technology that are used to treat anemia. In a perioperative setting, ESAs are administered to reduce allogeneic transfusion risk and increase red blood cell mass for surgical patients, including those unwilling or unable to receive transfusions.ESAs are recommended as a IIa recommendation in preoperative anemia-management guidelines for patients unwilling to receive transfusions. Clinical trials evaluating the cardiovascular benefits of epoetin-alfa with anemia and/or end-stage renal disease have reported variable thrombotic events, including in patients refusing transfusions where the benefits of treating anemia may outweigh potential thrombotic risks. A proposed mechanism for increased thrombotic events is an increase in platelet activation and thrombocytosis. We report a patient treated with epoetin alfa-epbx before coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) who was at a low risk for perioperative thrombotic events but experienced both pulmonary and major arterial thrombotic complications postoperatively. Written informed consent was obtained.

### Sex-specific associations between preoperative anemia and postoperative clinical outcomes in patients undergoing cardiac surgery [^115SLNNv]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Preoperative anemia is common in cardiac surgery, yet there were limited data describing the role of sex in the associations between anemia and clinical outcomes. Understanding these relationships may guide preoperative optimization efforts.

Methods

This is an observational cohort study of adults undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting or single- or double-valve surgery from 2008 to 2018 at a large tertiary medical center. Multivariable regression assessed the associations between preoperative hemoglobin concentrations and a primary outcome of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and secondary outcomes of perioperative red blood cell (RBC) transfusion, reoperation, vascular complications (ie, stroke, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction), and hospital length of stay (LOS). Each outcome was a single regression model, using interaction terms to assess sex-specific associations between hemoglobin and outcome.

Results

A total of 4117 patients were included (57% men). Linear splines with sex-specific knots (13 g/dL in women and 14 g/dL in men) provided the best overall fit for preoperative hemoglobin and outcome relationships. In women, each 1 g/dL decrease in hemoglobin < 13 g/dL was associated with increased odds of AKI (odds ratio = 1.49; 95% confidence interval, [1.23–1.81]; P < .001), and there was no significant association between hemoglobin per 1 g/dL > 13 g/dL and AKI (0.90 [0.56–1.45]; p = 0.67). The association between hemoglobin and AKI in men did not meet statistical significance (1.10 [0.99–1.22]; p = 0.076, per 1 g/dL decrease < 14 g/dL; 1.00 [0.79–1.26]; p = 0.98 for hemoglobin per 1 g/dL > 14 g/dL). In women, lower preoperative hemoglobin (per 1 g/dL decrease < 13 g/dL) was associated with increased odds of RBC transfusion (2.90 [2.33–3.60]; P < .001), reoperation (1.27 [1.11–1.45]; P < .001) and a longer hospital LOS (multiplicative increase in geometric mean 1.05 [1.03–1.07]; P < .001). In men, preoperative hemoglobin (per 1 g/dL decrease < 14 g/dL) was associated with increased odds of perioperative RBCs (2.56 [2.27–2.88]; P < .001) and longer hospital LOS (multiplicative increase in geometric mean 1.02 [1.01–1.04] days; P < .001) but not reoperation (0.94 [0.85–1.04]; p = 0.256). Preoperative hemoglobin per 1 g/dL > 13 g/dL in women and 14 g/dL in men were associated with lower odds of RBCs transfusion (0.57 [0.47–0.69]; P < .001 and 0.74 [0.60–0.91]; p = 0.005, respectively).

Conclusions

Preoperative anemia was associated with inferior clinical outcomes after cardiac surgery. The associations between hemoglobin and outcomes were distinct for women and men, with different spline knot points identified (13 and 14 g/dL, respectively). Clinicians should consider data-driven approaches to determine preoperative hemoglobin values associated with increasing risk for adverse perioperative outcomes across sexes.

### Mortality across the spectrum of hemoglobin level in patients undergoing surgical coronary revascularization [^117AGZvp]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The findings of the present study suggest that higher preoperative Hb levels have a clear tendency toward higher mortality in both men and women. In addition, patients with lower limits of normal Hb levels were at greater risk compared with mid‐normal values. Although anemia was thoroughly discussed in the literature as an important risk factor for in‐hospital mortality after CABG, the difference in normal Hb levels was not evaluated before.

Our study found that there is a higher mortality in females, compared with males. This is in line with other studies assessing CABG mortality. This can be justified by the higher rate of comorbidities, delay in diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases, and older age in women undergoing CABG. However, as mentioned by Schmidt et al, this difference between men and women could be attributed to their characteristics and comorbidities which are mainly different. Therefore, preoperative patients' profile is significantly different between sexes, which can affect the outcomes of CABG. In 2021, Ripoll et al. concluded that associations between Hb levels and outcomes were distinct for females and males, with different spline knot points (13 and 14 g/dL, respectively). As reported, in females, each 1 g/dL decrease in Hb below 13 was associated with increased odds of acute kidney injury (AKI). Mechanistically, there is an increased risk of insufficient delivery of tissue oxygenation through lower Hb levels preoperatively which can independently be correlated with mortality, cerebral accident, and AKI, as mentioned. Moreover, patients with lower Hb levels might have limited ability to compensate through an increase in heart rate and stroke volume.

Table 3 summarizes the mortality rates and adjusted HRs in men and women, while Figure 5 demonstrates the estimated long‐term survival stratified by sex. Women with HFrEF had higher standardized long‐term mortality rates than men. While the adjusted HRs for long‐term mortality were similar between the sexes in the HFpEF subgroup, women with HFrEF had a slightly lower risk of death compared with men.

Figure 5

Sex modified the correlation between long‐term mortality and age, recent MI, COPD/asthma, and anemia (Table 5). There was no sex‐based difference in long‐term mortality in patients younger than 75 years. Although age older than 75 years was associated with a higher risk of death in both sexes, this risk was higher in men compared with women. In addition, COPD/asthma were associated with a higher mortality risk in men, while recent MI and anemia were associated with higher mortality risk in women.

As a post hoc analysis to investigate factors that contributed to poorer outcomes in women, we examined the sex differences in HF onset and severity before and following CABG (Table 7). We found that women had higher rates of HF admissions before CABG and experienced significantly longer intervals from onset of HF symptoms until CABG compared with men. In the year following CABG, women had significantly higher rates of MI, repeat revascularization, stroke, new‐onset dialysis, HF admission, and admission to long‐term care facilities compared with men.

### Preoperative anemia increases mortality and postoperative morbidity after cardiac surgery [^111EuKvT]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Anemia is the most common hematological problem in the preoperative patient and according to the definition used, its incidence ranges from 22% to 30% and over 40% in octogenarians. In our sample, one quarter of patients undergoing surgery were anemic. A number of studies have shown a significant association between anemia and adverse outcomes after surgery. Wu et al. analyzed the effect of preoperative hematocrit levels in over 310,000 elderly veterans undergoing non-cardiac surgery and found that even mild anemia was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality and morbidity. In addition, they showed a linear rise in death and cardiac events when the hematocrit level was less than 39%. Similar results are reported in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. In a large multicenter cohort study on 3,500 patients, Karkuti et al. found that preoperative anemia was independently associated with doubling in the composite risk of in-hospital death, stroke, or acute kidney injury; the same odds were even obtained after adjusting for confounders by propensity score matching. Using the same statistical technique, Ranucci et al. demonstrated that patients with any degree of anemia had a significantly higher rate of stroke, major morbidity and higher operative mortality rate. Zindrou et al. observed that individuals with a preoperative hemoglobin concentration of 10 g/dl or less had a 3-fold increase in the odds of in-hospital mortality after CABG than those with a higher hemoglobin concentration. Finally, in the setting of cardiac valve surgery, Clandellas et al. found that patients with preoperative hemoglobin < 12 mg/dl had a 3-fold increased risk of death and 5-fold in the odds of developing major postoperative complications such as, heart failure, myocardial infarction, reoperation for bleeding, neurological complication and acute renal failure. Nevertheless, other studies failed to show a negative impact of preoperative anemia on adverse postoperative outcomes. Bell et al. and Carrascal et al. demonstrated that low preoperative hemoglobin level was not an independent risk factor for early mortality after CABG and that it was only mildly significant for morbidity even in octogenarian patients. In addition, Kulier et al. demonstrated that the presence of low hemoglobin levels did not predict postoperative cardiac outcomes, such as myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure or death from cardiac causes, but only renal and cerebral adverse complications. The different results reached by these authors might be partially explained by the threshold chosen for the definition of preoperative anemia. These studies used cutoff points for preoperative hemoglobin that ranged from 10 to 12.5 g/dl and, most of them focused only on single isolated procedures. On the contrary, the strength of our investigation was to define anemia according to the World Health Organization and evaluate prospectively collected data from a large number of consecutive patients undergoing different cardiac surgery operations.

Study limitation

This study is based on the retrospective analysis of our large institutional observational prospectively collected database, and we are unable to account for the influence of any residual unmeasured factors that could affect the adverse outcomes. Furthermore, we did not take into account specific details on the intraoperative and postoperative management of these patients and in particular information regarding the minimum Ht level during cardiopulmonary bypass, postoperative blood loss and blood transfusions.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^117DDUTY]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Perioperative anemia has been associated with increased risk of red blood cell transfusion and increased morbidity and mortality after surgery. The optimal approach to the diagnosis and management of perioperative anemia is not fully established.

Objective

To develop consensus recommendations for anemia management in surgical patients.

Methods

An international expert panel reviewed the current evidence and developed recommendations using modified RAND Delphi methodology.

Results

The panel recommends that all patients except those undergoing minor procedures be screened for anemia before surgery. Appropriate therapy for anemia should be guided by an accurate diagnosis of the etiology. The need to proceed with surgery in some patients with anemia is expected to persist. However, early identification and effective treatment of anemia has the potential to reduce the risks associated with surgery and improve clinical outcomes. As with preoperative anemia, postoperative anemia should be treated in the perioperative period.

Conclusions

Early identification and effective treatment of anemia has the potential to improve clinical outcomes in surgical patients.

### Prevalence of risk factors, and not gender per se, determines short-and long-term survival after coronary artery bypass surgery [^111eXa1r]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

Much attention has been directed towards female gender as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery; however, the effects of surgery are known to persist for 6 months or more. Studies that have compared postoperative survival in women and men beyond hospital discharge report disparate results with regard to the independent effect of gender per se on ultimate survival.

Design

This investigation was a prospective, observational study.

Setting

The study was a multicenter investigation involving 24 US medical centers.

Participants

There were 2,048 patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft surgery enrolled between September 1991 and September 1993 and after discharge.

Interventions

There were no interventions with this prospective observational study.

Measurements and Main Results

Preoperative demographic variables, medical history, and angiographic data were collected for each patient at the time of enrollment. Patients' vital status through the National Death Index up to August 31, 1998, were added to assess postoperative long-term survival. For survivorship analysis, the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used with Cox regression model. Survivorship analyses were performed separately and in combination on mortality within 30 days and 6 months of coronary artery bypass graft surgery and during the entire postoperative follow-up period. Among women, preoperative disease status, as expected, was more severe than that in men. Women were older (p = 0.0001) and had more comorbidity, such as congestive heart failure (p = 0.0019), diabetes (p = 0.0001), anemia, and hypertension (p = 0.0001). After surgery, unadjusted survival of 6 months and 5 years in women was worse than that in men. However, there were no gender-related differences in short- or long-term survival after adjusting for covariates in the multivariate model. Preoperative conditions, such as congestive heart failure, anemia, diabetes, and advanced age, are indicative of greater risk in both women and men for lower survival after coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Conclusions

Disease prevalence in women, and not gender per se, affects mid- and long-term survival after cardiac surgery. Attention, therefore, should be focused on efforts to reduce or modify such disease prevalence earlier in women, which may in turn allow longer survival after surgical intervention. Differences in postoperative survival between women and men were related to the gender differences in the distribution of preoperative risk factors.

### Anemia and acute coronary syndrome: time for intervention studies [^116SDm9H]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

How then should a clinician approach an ACS patient with concomitant anemia? As recommended by current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, measures should be taken to minimize risks for bleeding. This may be accomplished by integrating formal bleeding risk algorithms within usual care pathways to identify patients who will derive the greatest benefit from bleeding avoidance strategies, such as transradial access and use of vascular closure devices. Dosing of antithrombotic therapy by weight and renal function should be emphasized to further minimize bleeding risks. With respect to treatment, a restrictive transfusion threshold of 8 g/dL appears reasonable given the potential for harm with administration of blood products coupled with the lack of any clear benefit in randomized studies using a more liberal threshold.

Our understanding of red blood cells, both in normal human physiology and in disease states, has advanced substantially since the seminal observations of van Leeuwenhoek. While we currently appreciate the prognostic importance of anemia on both short‐ and long‐term outcomes following ACS, clear mechanistic insights and therapeutic interventions to guide and mitigate such risk remain lacking. The need for studies to inform clinical decisions within this space is highlighted by studies such as the one by Mamas et al, reinforcing the high prevalence of and substantial risk associated with anemia in the setting of ACS.

### Incidence, predictors, and outcomes of early acute myocardial infarction following coronary artery bypass grafting [^1135J7Nv]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Large-scale data on early postdischarge acute myocardial infarction (AMI) after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are lacking. We queried the National Readmission Database (2015 to 2016) to identify patients who underwent CABG between January 1 and June 31 (i.e., had 6 months of follow-up). The study's end points were the incidence, predictors, and outcomes of early post-CABG AMI. Of the 203,760 included patients, 3,829 (1.8%) were readmitted for AMI. Compared with patients without readmissions for AMI, those with AMI were younger (65 ± 11 vs 66 ± 10 years), had more females (35.5% vs 25.1%), and higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, obstructive lung disease, anemia, vascular disease, renal insufficiency, and liver cirrhosis, but less atrial fibrillation (p < 0.001). They also had a distinctive profile of their index CABG surgery. The strongest predictors of post-CABG AMI readmission were female gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36 to 1.57), heart failure (OR 1.37, 95% CI = 1.27 to 1.50), dialysis (OR 1.5%, 95% CI = 1.25 to 1.78), cirrhosis (OR 1.61, 95% CI = 1.14 to 2.27), nonelective CABG (OR 1.70, 95% CI = 1.57 to 1.84), perioperative mechanical circulatory support (OR 1.37, 95% CI = 1.23 to 1.51), low-volume centers (OR 1.36, 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.56), and nonhome discharge after CABG (OR 1.47, 95% CI = 1.35 to 1.59). In the patients who were readmitted for AMI, 86.3% had non-ST-elevation AMI and 13.7% had ST-elevation AMI. Coronary angiography was performed in 2,096 patients (54.7%). Of those, 63.5% received percutaneous coronary intervention, and 1.7% had redo-CABG. Readmissions for AMI were associated with significant in-hospital mortality (5.7%), acute kidney injury (22.1%), and new dialysis (2.1%). Median length-of-stay was 3 days (25th/75th percentile 2,6), and the mean hospital cost was $22,207 ± 29,071.

### Intra-operative red blood cell transfusion and mortality after cardiac surgery [^113VXDr3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This historical cohort study in patients undergoing coronary surgery showed that intraoperative RBC transfusion was associated with a more than three-fold increased risk for mortality. The association between intraoperative transfusion and mortality remained present in a subgroup of patients with high probability of RBC transfusion after adjustment for multiple risk factors.

Anemia predisposes to myocardial ischemia in patients with coronary disease, especially during cardiac surgery when ongoing blood loss and hemodilution lower the oxygen carrying capacity of blood. Intraoperative RBC transfusion is a common but potential harmful treatment of anemia, which emphasizes the paradox that both anemia and transfusion are associated with adverse outcome in cardiac surgery patients. This raises the question to what extend anemia should be accepted during coronary surgery and when RBC transfusion becomes ineluctable. The recent TRICS III study has provided further insight in RBC transfusion thresholds in cardiac surgery patients. In a multicenter trial patients undergoing on-pump cardiac surgery were randomized to a restrictive (< 7.5 g/dL) or liberal (< 9.5 g/dL) RBC transfusion strategy, in the operating room and intensive care unit. After 6 months follow up a perioperative restrictive transfusion strategy was non-inferior to a liberal strategy in terms of a composite endpoint including death, myocardial infarction, stroke or new onset renal failure. In our cohort, the median Hb concentration at the end of surgery in patients with RBC transfusion was 5.6 mmol/l (9.0 g/dL) and substantially higher than the restrictive transfusion threshold in TRICS III. These results suggest that increased mortality rates in our study population are more likely to be associated with RBC transfusion than intraoperative anemia. In addition, when considering the general rule of thumb that a single unit of red cells results in an Hb increment of 1 g/dL, transfusion of a single RBC unit could have been withheld in 348 patients.

### Preoperative anemia increases mortality and postoperative morbidity after cardiac surgery [^116tsTyK]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Results

In the study population of 7,738 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, a total of 1,856 (24%) patients had preoperative anemia (Figure 2), of which 517 (27.9%) were female. The mean (± standard deviation, SD) hemoglobin concentration was 11.5 (SD, 1.1) g/dl versus 14.3 (SD, 1.1) g/dl, in the anemic and control patients group, respectively. Baseline characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1. Patients in the anemia group were older and more often female; they were more likely to have a greater prevalence of hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, extracardiac arteriophaty, and previous cardiac operations. Patients with anemia were also more likely to have a lower ejection fraction and greater prevalence of New York Heart Association functional class. Finally, the prevalence of patients undergoing other than isolated CABG and aortic surgery were higher in the anemic patients than in the control group. The overall rate of mortality was 2.1%. Results from univariate and multivariable logistic analysis are reported in Tables 2 and 3. Preoperative anemia was associated with a three-fold increased in the risk of death (4.6% vs 1.5%, p < 0.0001) and postoperative renal dysfunction (18.5% vs 6.5%, p < 0.0001). There was also a significant difference between the anemic and non-anemic group in the risk of postoperative stroke (1.9% vs 1.1%, p = 0.008), atrial fibrillation (36.7% vs 33%, p = 0.003) and length of hospital stay > 7 days (54% vs 36.7%, p < 0.0001. There was no significant difference in postoperative myocardial infarction (1.9% vs 2%, p = 0.93) between the two groups. After adjusting for confounding variables listed in Table 1, as well as propensity score, preoperative anemia was an independent predictor of mortality, postoperative renal dysfunction and length of hospital stay > 7 days. Finally, when modeled as univariate continuous variable, a curvilinear relationship was seen between the estimated probability of death and preoperative hemoglobin either in the female or in the male population (Figure 3).

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^113C8ws9]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Should we treat iron deficiency without anaemia?

A normal haemoglobin level does not exclude iron deficiency. In fact, the WHO recognises that 'mild' anaemia (haemoglobin 110–119/129 g.l −1) is a misnomer, as iron deficiency is already advanced by the time anaemia is detected, and has consequences even when anaemia is not clinically apparent 18.

Non‐anaemic patients with reduced or absent iron stores may have symptoms such as fatigue or reduced exercise tolerance, as iron is required for optimal mitochondrial function, and is essential for respiration and energy production 40, 74. Current guidelines do not recommend routine iron screening in the absence of anaemia. However, the benefits of oral or i.v. iron replacement for non‐anaemic iron deficiency‐associated fatigue have been demonstrated in menstruating women, runners and blood donors 75, 76, 77, 78.

In congestive heart failure, a frequent comorbidity among surgical patients, non‐anaemic iron deficiency was independently associated with compromised physical performance and quality of life, and an increase in all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality; treatment of non‐anaemic iron deficiency with i.v. iron may improve functional status within four weeks, and reduces hospitalisations for cardiovascular reasons and mortality 79, 80. In addition, improvements are maintained after 24 and 52 weeks 79, 80, 81.

In observational studies of patients undergoing abdominal or cardiac surgery, pre‐operative non‐anaemic iron deficiency was associated with poor outcomes, including: increased rates of postoperative infection; transfusion; fatigue; and prolonged hospital stay 82, 83, 84. Although it is presently unknown whether pre‐operative correction of non‐anaemic iron deficiency may offset the excess of risk of postoperative complications, some guidelines recommend peri‐operative iron supplementation for patients with non‐anaemic iron deficiency 14, 85.

Secondary thrombocytosis can also be seen after major surgery, as platelets behave as an acute phase reactant. Iron deficiency has also been shown to induce secondary thrombocytosis in several clinical settings. Correction of iron deficiency usually lowers platelet count and platelet activation in patients with chronic kidney disease, cancer or inflammatory bowel disease‐associated secondary thrombocytosis, and may contribute to reduced risk of thrombo embolic events 86, 87, 88, 89.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). High credibility.

Perioperative anemia synopsis — Even mild preoperative anemia is an independent risk factor for postoperative morbidity and mortality. The World Health Organization defines anemia as a hemoglobin concentration < 13 g/dL in men and < 12 g/dL in women. Up to 64% of surgical patients have anemia, more than half of which is moderate to severe. Iron deficiency is responsible in 40% to 50% of cases, and ferritin concentration < 100 ng/mL, transferrin saturation < 20%, and/or microcytic hypochromic red cells (mean corpuscular volume < 80 fL, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration < 27 g/dL) are indicative of iron deficiency. Most anemias are correctable within 2 to 4 weeks, and anemia management programs decrease the rate of transfusions, complications, and mortality.

Anaesthetic, surgical technique and postoperative management

Anaesthetic and surgical techniques were standardized for all patients and were reported previously. In brief, all operations requiring cardiopulmonary bypass were conducted using a membrane oxygenator, primed with 1000 mL of Hartmanns crystalloid, 500 mL Gelofusine, 0.5 g/kg mannitol, 7 mL of 10% calcium gluconate, and 6000 IU heparin. α-Stat pH management was used, and the systemic temperature was kept between 34°C and 36°C. Myocardial protection was achieved with intermittent hyperkalaemic warm blood cardioplegia for CABG and hyperkalaemic cold blood cardioplegia for all other operations. For off-pump CABG, the Bristol technique was used to expose the coronaries and provide stabilization to undertake anastomosis. At the end of surgery, patients were transferred to the intensive care unit and managed according to the unit protocol.

Statistical analysis

Continuous data were expressed as mean ± standard deviation, and categorical data as percentages. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test was used to check for normality of data in the two groups before further analysis. Differences between anemia and control group were compared using χ 2 test for categorical variables, and the Student t test or the Wilcoxon rank sum test, as appropriate, for continuous variables. To reduce the effect of selection bias and potential confounding in this observational study, a propensity score was undertaken. The propensity for anemia was determined without regard of outcomes by the use of a nonparsimonious multiple logistic-regression analysis. All the variables listed in Table 1 were included in the analysis. Logistic regression was performed to assess the effect associated with anemia on each end point after adjusting for potentially confounding variables listed in Table 1 and the propensity score. Results are reported as percentages and odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). All reported P values are two-sided, and P values of less than.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance. All statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 15.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill).

### Perioperative blood transfusion and blood conservation in cardiac surgery: the Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists clinical practice guideline [^112gNMUL]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

A minority of patients having cardiac procedures (15% to 20%) consume more than 80% of the blood products transfused at operation. Blood must be viewed as a scarce resource that carries risks and benefits. A careful review of available evidence can provide guidelines to allocate this valuable resource and improve patient outcomes.

Methods

We reviewed all available published evidence related to blood conservation during cardiac operations, including randomized controlled trials, published observational information, and case reports. Conventional methods identified the level of evidence available for each of the blood conservation interventions. After considering the level of evidence, recommendations were made regarding each intervention using the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology classification scheme.

Results

Review of published reports identified a high-risk profile associated with increased postoperative blood transfusion. Six variables stand out as important indicators of risk: (1) advanced age, (2) low preoperative red blood cell volume (preoperative anemia or small body size), (3) preoperative antiplatelet or antithrombotic drugs, (4) reoperative or complex procedures, (5) emergency operations, and (6) noncardiac patient comorbidities. Careful review revealed preoperative and perioperative interventions that are likely to reduce bleeding and postoperative blood transfusion. Preoperative interventions that are likely to reduce blood transfusion include identification of high-risk patients who should receive all available preoperative and perioperative blood conservation interventions and limitation of antithrombotic drugs. Perioperative blood conservation interventions include use of antifibrinolytic drugs, selective use of off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery, routine use of a cell-saving device, and implementation of appropriate transfusion indications. An important intervention is application of a multimodality blood conservation program that is institution based, accepted by all health care providers, and that involves well thought out transfusion algorithms to guide transfusion decisions.

Conclusions

Based on available evidence, institution-specific protocols should screen for high-risk patients, as blood conservation interventions are likely to be most productive for this high-risk subset. Available evidence-based blood conservation techniques include (1) drugs that increase preoperative blood volume (eg, erythropoietin) or decrease postoperative bleeding (eg, antifibrinolytics), (2) devices that conserve blood (eg, intraoperative blood salvage and blood sparing interventions), (3) interventions that protect the patient's own blood from the stress of operation (eg, autologous predonation and normovolemic hemodilution), (4) consensus, institution-specific blood transfusion algorithms supplemented with point-of-care testing, and most importantly, (5) a multimodality approach to blood conservation combining all of the above.

### Preoperative anemia-screening clinics [^115qzz8p]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2019). Medium credibility.

Preoperative anemia is associated with increased postoperative morbidity and mortality and with increased risk of perioperative transfusion. It is an important and modifiable risk factor for surgical patients. For high-blood-loss surgery, preoperative anemia is defined as hemoglobin < 13 g/dL for both male and female patients. Preoperative anemia is common, ranging from 25% to 40% in large observational studies. The most common treatable cause of preoperative anemia is iron-deficiency anemia; the initial laboratory tests should focus on making this diagnosis. Management of iron-deficiency anemia includes iron supplementation with IV iron therapy when oral iron is ineffective or not tolerated, there is severe anemia, and there is insufficient time to surgery (< 4 weeks). In other situations, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents may be considered, particularly for those patients with multiple alloantibodies or religious objections to transfusion. To facilitate the diagnosis and management of preoperative anemia, establishment of preoperative anemia-screening clinics is essential. The goals of management of preoperative anemia are to treat anemia, reduce the need for transfusion, and improve patient outcomes.

### Prognostic interplay of chronic kidney disease, anemia, and diabetes in coronary bypass surgery [^112S8yn5]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease and anemia often coexist and may accompany diabetes; all 3 conditions are associated with worse cardiovascular outcomes. This study investigated the prognostic implications of anemia and chronic kidney disease for mortality among patients undergoing coronary artery-bypass grafting surgery and examined whether outcomes are related to the presence of diabetes.

Methods

This retrospective study included 1180 patients undergoing coronary artery-bypass grafting. Long-term mortality (mean follow-up, 8.6 ± 4.2 years) was examined in relation to preoperative anemia, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes. Prognostic interplay of the 3 risk factors was evaluated.

Results

Chronic kidney disease, anemia, and diabetes (20%, 25%, and 43% of patients, respectively), were independent risk predictors for mortality. Compared with patients with neither chronic kidney disease nor anemia, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for mortality were 1.87 (95% confidence interval, 1.35 to 2.59) in chronic kidney disease only, 1.75 (95% CI, 1.30 to 2.35) in anemia only, and 2.69 (95% CI, 1.91 to 3.78) in patients with both conditions. The pattern of association of chronic kidney disease and anemia with mortality was similar in patients with and without diabetes. However, mortality risk was higher in patients with diabetes in each risk category-neither chronic kidney disease nor anemia: HR, 1.69 (95% CI, 1.20 to 2.39) vs HR, 1 (reference); chronic kidney disease only: HR, 2.68 (95% CI, 1.59 to 4.52) vs HR, 2.10 (95% CI, 1.38 to 3.20); anemia only: HR, 2.73 (95% CI, 1.83 to 4.07) vs HR, 1.94 (95% CI, 1.23 to 3.08); and both chronic kidney disease and anemia: HR, 4.44 (95% CI, 2.88 to 6.85) vs HR, 2.72 (95% CI, 1.58 to 4.69).

Conclusions

In patients undergoing coronary artery-bypass grafting, anemia and chronic kidney disease have significant prognostic implications for long-term mortality. Their effect on mortality was cumulatively associated with adverse impacts of diabetes.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^112jDw99]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Patient blood management — preoperative interventions include that preoperative identification of high-risk patients should be performed, and all available preoperative and perioperative measures of blood conservation should be undertaken in this group as they account for the majority of blood products transfused (Class I, Level A). Assessment of anemia and determination of its etiology is appropriate in all patients undergoing cardiac surgery, and it is reasonable to treat with intravenous iron preparations if time permits. In patients undergoing cardiac operations, it is reasonable to implement standardized transfusion protocols in order to reduce transfusion burden. In patients who have (i) preoperative anemia, (ii) refuse blood transfusion, (iii) or are deemed high-risk for postoperative anemia, it is reasonable to administer preoperative erythropoietin-stimulating agents and iron supplementation several days before cardiac operations to increase red cell mass. Minimization of phlebotomy by reduced volume and frequency of blood sampling is a reasonable means of blood conservation. Preoperative treatment of asymptomatic anemia and thrombocytopenia with transfusion is of uncertain benefit (Class III: No Benefit, Level B-NR).

### Preoperative anemia and transfusion in cardiac surgery: a single-centre retrospective study [^113ZRH2t]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Patient clinical characteristics, surgical characteristics and outcomes were gathered via review of physical charts scanned and uploaded onto electronic databases maintained by Alberta Health Services. Patient demographics, comorbidities, lab values and imaging parameters were based on the latest available information before PAC visits. The patient and surgical characteristics chosen in this study were based on commonly seen comorbidities in cardiac surgery patients as well as established anemia- and transfusion- associated risk factors. Complex surgical procedures were defined as any combined surgery such as concomitant coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and valve, double valve, or aortic surgeries.

Following the WHO definition, anemia was defined as having a hemoglobin (Hb) concentration of less than 120 g/L in non-pregnant adult females and less than 130 g/L in adult males (Table 1). Further sub-classifications using the WHO criteria were done for mild anemia (Hb concentration between 110 and 120 g/L in females and 110 and 130 g/L in males), moderate anemia (Hb concentration between 80 and 110 g/L in both sexes), and severe anemia (Hb concentration less than 80 g/L in both sexes). Hb values are used as transfusion triggers at our centre; there is no universal Hb threshold for transfusion. Patient conditions and comorbidities are taken into consideration, which accounts for a higher Hb threshold in sicker patients. The general consensus is that otherwise healthy patients with Hb > 100 g/L rarely require perioperative RBC transfusion, and those with Hb < 80 g/L frequently require RBC transfusion. For this study, transfusion on surgery day was defined as any packed RBC (pRBC) transfused in the operating rooms or within 24 h of arrival at the cardiovascular ICU (CVICU).

Table 1
Prevalence of anemia among our elective cardiac surgery patients

Information on patient referral and preoperative treatment for anemia at the local blood conservation clinic was obtained by cross-referencing our patient list with the blood conservation clinic's patient database. Referral criteria for surgical patients are: having a Hb concentration of 70–130 g/L and a ferritin concentration of less than 100 ng/mL. Upon referral, patients are triaged based on their blood work results and the available amount of time prior to their scheduled surgeries. Patients are contacted within a week and treatments are initiated within 1–2 weeks of their referrals. For treatment, patients are given intravenous iron sucrose, 200 mg infused over a minimum of 15 min × 2 doses, 1 week apart. Unstable cardiac patients are contraindicated for treatment.

### Restrictive and liberal red cell transfusion strategies in adult patients: reconciling clinical data with best practice [^116E1Aad]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

Future direction

At an academic level, a multidisciplinary think-tank from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute convened and agreed to the need for three adult trials evaluating RBC transfusion trigger strategies to improve overall outcome and to validate the following hypotheses: first, higher Hb levels resulting from a liberal transfusion strategy during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery will lead to lower incidence of 30-day all-cause mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, infection, and other complications as compared with a restrictive transfusion threshold; second, in patients with acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery disease undergoing cardiac catheterization, a liberal transfusion strategy will be associated with a lower incidence of composite outcome of all-cause mortality at 30 days, recurrent myocardial infarction, emergent percutaneous intervention (angioplasty or stent insertion), or coronary artery bypass graft surgery within 30 days of enrollment when compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy; and third, in hemodynamically stable patients in the ICU with a history of ischemic heart disease, multiple organ dysfunction scores will be improved by maintaining Hb > 10 g/dl. That the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute would propose such studies suggests that the ideal Hb transfusion trigger has yet to be determined for some common clinical conditions, and Hb levels > 8 g/dl in some stable patients may be warranted.

At the level of the practicing physician, what are clinicians to do? Fundamentally, physicians should intelligently apply their skill set to their patients' needs, incorporating all physiological data at their disposal, and incorporate – as applicable – the scientific support from Practice Guidelines. Recent survey data demonstrating the lack of a substantial reduction in ICU RBC transfusion in one state has been interpreted to suggest that restrictive RBC transfusion thresholds may not have 'fully translated into practice in different hospital settings'. Perhaps in assessing this lack of conformity the authors of such uncontrolled, hospital-derived datasets should in part acknowledge that experienced clinical decision-making may have presided over the selection for or against transfusion. After all, the primary methodology for evaluating the restrictive transfusion hypothesis in the TRICC and FOCUS trials has been itself criticized for lack of inclusion of a usual practice arm in the dichotomized trial protocols, thus encouraging practice misalignments and hence more limited data interpretability. As an optimal use of a practice guideline, trial data supportive of a restrictive transfusion strategy provide clinicians with a helpful metaphorical arm rest, to pause and carefully consider whether a transfusion is likely to be helpful, which in many cases it will not.

### The impact of an hematocrit of 20% during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass for elective low risk coronary artery bypass graft surgery on oxygen delivery and clinical outcome – a randomized controlled study [^114Fzjk2]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Our results from a small and low risk group of CABG patients suggest that hemodilution to an Hct of 20% during normothermic CPB did not induce a 'critical' imbalance between oxygen delivery and consumption that would have resulted in a worse clinical outcome. Although these results require confirmation by larger studies, patients without severe comorbidities who are at a high risk of receiving allogeneic blood products may safely tolerate an Hct of 20% during normothermic CPB. If further investigations determine an Hct of 20% during normothermic CPB to be safe, a reduction in exposure to allogeneic blood products seems to be possible.

### Transfusion triggers for guiding RBC transfusion for cardiovascular surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis* [^112b9LFA]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Restrictive red cell transfusion is recommended to minimize risk associated with exposure to allogeneic blood. However, perioperative anemia is an independent risk factor for adverse outcomes after cardiovascular surgery. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine whether perioperative restrictive transfusion thresholds are associated with inferior clinical outcomes in randomized trials of cardiovascular surgery patients.

Data Sources

The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, and EMBASE from inception to October 2013; reference lists of published guidelines, reviews, and associated articles, as well as conference proceedings. No language restrictions were applied.

Study Selection

We included controlled trials in which adult patients undergoing cardiac or vascular surgery were randomized to different transfusion thresholds, described as a hemoglobin or hematocrit level below which RBCs were transfused.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently extracted data from included trials. We pooled risk ratios of dichotomous outcomes and mean differences of continuous outcomes across trials using random-effects models.

Data Synthesis

Seven studies (enrolling 1,262 participants) met inclusion criteria with restrictive and liberal transfusion thresholds most commonly differing by a hemoglobin of 1 g/dL or hematocrit of 6–7%, resulting in decreased transfusions by 0.71 units of RBCs (95% CI, 0.31–1.09, p = 0.0002) without an associated change in adverse events: mortality (risk ratio, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.65–1.95; p = 0.60), myocardial infarction (risk ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.30–2.99; p = 0.92), stroke (risk ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.57–2.32; p = 0.70), acute renal failure (risk ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.64–1.49; p = 0.91), infections (risk ratio, 1.23; 95% CI, 0.85–1.78; p = 0.27), or length of stay. There was no between-trial heterogeneity for any pooled analysis. Including four pediatric trials (456 participants) and 10 trials utilizing only intraoperative acute normovolemic hemodilution (872 participants) did not substantially change the results except that unlike the transfusion threshold trials, the hemodilution trials did not reduce the proportion of patients transfused (interaction p = 0.01).

Conclusions

Further randomized controlled trials are necessary to determine the optimal transfusion strategy for patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery.

Preoperative treatment of anemia — pharmacologic agents recommends for selected patients that In patients who have (i) preoperative anemia, (ii) refuse blood transfusion, (iii) or are deemed high-risk for postoperative anemia, it is reasonable to administer preoperative erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESA) and iron supplementation several days prior to cardiac operations to increase red cell mass (Class IIa, Level B-R). The document also notes practical barriers, including the oftentimes lack of a safe waiting period for treatment.

### Transfusion requirements after cardiac surgery: the TRACS randomized controlled trial [^114NSEUy]. JAMA (2010). Excellent credibility.

Context

Perioperative red blood cell transfusion is commonly used to address anemia, an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality after cardiac operations; however, evidence regarding optimal blood transfusion practice in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is lacking.

Objective

To define whether a restrictive perioperative red blood cell transfusion strategy is as safe as a liberal strategy in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery.

Design, Setting, and Patients

The Transfusion Requirements After Cardiac Surgery (TRACS) study, a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical noninferiority trial conducted between February 2009 and February 2010 in an intensive care unit at a university hospital cardiac surgery referral center in Brazil. Consecutive adult patients (n = 502) who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were eligible; analysis was by intention-to-treat.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to a liberal strategy of blood transfusion (to maintain a hematocrit ≥ 30%) or to a restrictive strategy (hematocrit ≥ 24%).

Main Outcome Measure

Composite end point of 30-day all-cause mortality and severe morbidity (cardiogenic shock, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or acute renal injury requiring dialysis or hemofiltration) occurring during the hospital stay. The noninferiority margin was predefined at -8% (ie, 8% minimal clinically important increase in occurrence of the composite end point).

Results

Hemoglobin concentrations were maintained at a mean of 10.5 g/dL (95% confidence interval, 10.4–10.6) in the liberal-strategy group and 9.1 g/dL (95% CI, 9.0–9.2) in the restrictive-strategy group (P < .001). A total of 198 of 253 patients (78%) in the liberal-strategy group and 118 of 249 (47%) in the restrictive-strategy group received a blood transfusion (P < .001). Occurrence of the primary end point was similar between groups (10% liberal vs 11% restrictive; between-group difference, 1% [95% CI, -6% to 4%]; p = 0.85). Independent of transfusion strategy, the number of transfused red blood cell units was an independent risk factor for clinical complications or death at 30 days (hazard ratio for each additional unit transfused, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.1–1.4]; p = 0.002).

Conclusion

Among patients undergoing cardiac surgery, the use of a restrictive perioperative transfusion strategy compared with a more liberal strategy resulted in noninferior rates of the combined outcome of 30-day all-cause mortality and severe morbidity.

### The impact of an hematocrit of 20% during normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass for elective low risk coronary artery bypass graft surgery on oxygen delivery and clinical outcome – a randomized controlled study [^116ogGhV]. Critical Care (2006). Low credibility.

Key messages

- 	An Hct of 20% versus 25% during normothermic CPB for CABG surgery did not impair oxygen delivery.

- 	No significant difference in oxygen consumption between the study groups was detected, indicating that a critical 'oxygen balance' was not induced by lowering the hematocrit to 20% during normothermic CPB.

- 	The clinical outcome of the patients was not significantly different between the groups, although the study was not sufficiently powered for this outcome.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^114Qu2xH]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Massive transfusion in cardiac surgery — risk factors and product ratios — includes common risks across valve surgery, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and their combination such as female sex, older age, renal dysfunction, lower body mass index, lower preoperative hemoglobin, and longer cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) times, with valve-specific risks including active endocarditis, nonatrial fibrillation, smaller left atrium diameter, abnormal international normalized ratio, and repeat operations. Regarding product ratios, trauma literature shows a well-recognized benefit from a 1:1 ratio of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) to red blood cells (RBCs), while evidence in cardiac operations is less established; current data provide modest support for adherence to a 1:1 ratio of FFP/RBC after operations, but this recommendation must be tempered with caution.

### Preoperative anemia and transfusion in cardiac surgery: a single-centre retrospective study [^115uziTm]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Preoperative anemia, defined using the WHO criteria, was present in 15% of our elective cardiac surgery patients with the majority of them classified as being mild or moderately anemic. Transfusion rate during surgery day was significantly higher at 53% in preoperative anemic patients compared to 10% in non-anemic patients. Hb concentration, eGFR, BSA, and total bypass time were found to be predictive of transfusion on surgery day among our elective cardiac surgery patients. Our patients had a median of 7 days between initial visit and surgery day. Referral to the blood management program and initiation of treatment were seldom done for anemic patients. A shift in the preoperative intervention pathway is needed at our centre to adequately correct anemia in anemic patients prior to surgery; however, this requires careful weighing of the risks of anemia and transfusion versus the risk of delaying surgery.

### Moderate exposure to allogeneic blood products is not associated with reduced long-term survival after surgery for coronary artery disease [^117NiaT3]. Anesthesiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that blood transfusion has an adverse effect on long-term health, mainly through immune modulation and tumor promotion. To further assess this concern, the authors have performed a prospective observational study with the hypothesis that after taking perioperative risk factors relevant to long-term survival into account, patients undergoing coronary artery surgery who receive a perioperative allogeneic blood transfusion have worse long-term survival than those who do not.

Methods

The health outcomes of 1,841 consecutive subjects who had isolated nonemergency first-time coronary artery surgery and who survived more than 60 days after surgery were determined by record linkage. The association between length of survival, blood products transfused, and risk factors for long-term survival at entry to the study were determined by Cox proportional hazards regression.

Results

A total of 1,062 subjects were transfused. Of these, 266 subjects died during a mean follow-up of 8.1 yr. Of subjects who were transfused, 27% had a new malignant condition recorded on the death certificate, compared with 43% who were not transfused. Older age, cerebrovascular disease, use of a mammary graft, chronic pulmonary disease, renal dysfunction, reduced left ventricular function, and preoperative anemia were predictive of reduced long-term survival. There was no association between transfusion of blood products and long-term survival.

Conclusions

Patients who have undergone coronary artery surgery and who have received moderate amounts of blood as part of responsible and conservative management should be reassured that they are unlikely to experience a reduction in long-term survival.

### Recommendations from the international consensus conference on anemia management in surgical patients (ICCAMS) [^113bTBes]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Supporting Evidence: Screening

The most commonly used criteria for defining anemia are the WHO definitions (Hb < 12.0 g/dL for women or < 13.0 g/dL for men). However, it has been suggested that these should be updated. A range of Hb cutoff levels for anemia has been used in studies. In an observational study of > 4000 adults undergoing elective cardiac surgery, a preoperative Hb concentration < 13.0 g/dL was reported as the optimal threshold in women. Similarly, in a review by Muñoz et al, a Hb level < 13.0 g/dL for both men and women was advocated for preoperative anemia, whereas the WHO criteria were considered acceptable for postoperative anemia. This approach was echoed in international consensus guidelines on the management of surgery-related anemia. Adoption of the 13.0 g/dL threshold in both sexes has also been suggested in recent reviews of perioperative anemia and PBM. Therefore, the panel supports defining anemia by a Hb level < 13.0 g/dL in both men and women. To allow time for a response to therapy, at least 4 weeks before surgery has been suggested as the optimal time frame for evaluation. However, treatment as little as 1 day before surgery [intravenous (IV) iron, subcutaneous erythropoietin alpha, vitamin B 12, and oral folic acid) has been shown to be effective in reducing transfusion of allogeneic blood products in cardiac surgery patients with preoperative anemia.

Opinions of the Panel: Screening

The panel agreed that the optimal time before surgery to screen for anemia is at least 4 weeks. However, shorter time frames such as in the case of urgent or emergent surgery should not preclude evaluation. The results of tests performed shortly before surgery may enable treatments with a rapid onset of action (eg, IV iron) to be administered preoperatively, and they may also help define the need for anemia treatment postoperatively.

Minor procedures such as cataract surgery or other surgeries where testing requirements are waived because of no blood loss can be undertaken in patients with anemia, therefore there is no requirement for this population to be screened. However, because of the high frequency of anemia in the general population, patients undergoing all other types of surgery should be screened preoperatively. Screening may be beneficial by providing an opportunity to treat previously undiagnosed anemia, regardless of the setting. The importance of screening is heightened in those undergoing major surgery with at least moderate risk of clinically significant blood loss, those with risk factors for anemia or poor tolerance of anemia, and those unable to receive blood products.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^116KV1rN]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

How should patients be treated postoperatively?

Pharmacological optimisation of postoperative haemoglobin and erythropoiesis should allow correction of iron deficiency and rapid recovery from postoperative anaemia, which may lead to improved postoperative outcomes and improved quality of life. It may also result in a reduction of patient exposure to red cell transfusion and its related risk and complications, thus contributing further to improving surgical outcome and patient safety.

Iron therapy: oral vs. i.v. iron?

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK (NICE) recommends offering oral iron after surgery to patients with iron deficiency anaemia 12. However, in the postoperative period, oral iron is often not tolerated or absorbed and has several limitations including frequent gastro‐intestinal side‐effects and, as a consequence, poor treatment adherence. Additionally, the inflammatory response induced by surgery stimulates hepcidin synthesis and release, which in turn inhibits intestinal iron absorption, making oral iron therapy largely ineffective 10, 13, 50. Various randomised placebo‐controlled trials (RCT) in orthopaedic and cardiac surgery patients have demonstrated that oral iron therapy was not better than placebo in correcting postoperative anaemia and reducing transfusion requirements 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57.

On the other hand, NICE recommends considering i.v. iron after surgery for patients who have iron deficiency anaemia and cannot tolerate or absorb oral iron, or are unable to adhere to oral iron treatment, as well as for those who are diagnosed with functional iron deficiency 12. Thus, patients presenting with postoperative iron deficiency and/or moderate‐to‐severe postoperative anaemia (haemoglobin < 100 g.l −1) may benefit from i.v. iron supplementation, which has proven to be more effective than oral iron in a number of surgical settings (Supporting Information online, Appendix S1) 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63. Most recent RCTs have shown improved outcomes following high‐dose postoperative i.v. iron (e.g. 1000 mg) as demonstrated by increased haemoglobin and/or reduction in transfusion requirements, and no i.v. iron‐related serious adverse events were reported (Supporting Information, Appendix S1) 39, 42, 44, 45. Importantly, in orthopaedic surgical patients with postoperative haemoglobin < 100 g.l −1 and/or uncorrected pre‐operative iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 μg.l −1), a greater rise in haemoglobin and better scores for 'usual activities' were observed with high‐dose i.v. iron compared with oral iron 42.

### Acute normovolemic hemodilution in adult cardiac surgery [^1168Jab7]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

Acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) is a well-known blood conservation technique, yet its adoption in the US remains low (< 20%), and cardiac surgery remains the largest consumer of blood components. Increasing vulnerabilities in the US blood supply underscore the need to reassess ANH effectiveness in blood conservation.

Objective

To evaluate ANH use in perioperative transfusion and blood component use in patients undergoing surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective propensity-score matched cohort study using data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (version 4.20.2). The study included adult patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and/or valve surgery with CPB (July 2020 to September 2023).

Exposure

The primary exposure was ANH, defined as any recorded use/volume in the STS database.

Main Outcome and Measures

The primary outcome was intraoperative or postoperative transfusion of any blood component. The volume-dependent ANH effect estimate was also assessed using a cutoff value of 650 mL. Secondary outcomes included the total number of transfused red blood cells (RBC) and non-RBC components (platelets, plasma, and cryoprecipitate); bleeding reexplorations; length of stay in the intensive care unit; and estimates for blood acquisition and activity-based costs.

Results

Among 16 795 patients (mean [SD] age, 65.3 [10.5] years; 12 114 male [72.1%]), ANH was reported in 2463 cases (14.7%). Patients receiving ANH had a significantly lower preoperative anemia rate and higher baseline hematocrit (mean difference: 2.5%; 95% CI, 2.3–2.7; P < .001). After propensity score matching (n = 2282 pairs), transfusion rates were significantly lower in the ANH group (31.2% vs 36.4%; P < .001). ANH was associated with 27% lower odds of any transfusion (odds ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60–0.89). High-volume ANH (≥ 650 mL) further reduced the odds of transfusion by 47% to 64% for both RBC and non-RBC components. The cumulative number of transfused erythrocyte and platelet units was 167 and 295 units lower, respectively, in the ANH group compared with the control group, with lower estimates for both acquisition and activity-based costs.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, a volume-dependent association was found between ANH and reduced RBC and non-RBC transfusion rates in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Despite being safe and cost-effective, ANH remains underused as a blood conservation strategy.

The odds of mortality associated with the presence of anemia following adjustment for baseline covariates are shown in Table 3. We observed that there was a ~1.3‐fold increase in odds of 30‐day mortality (OR 1.281, 95% CI 1.217‐1.350, P < 0.001) and 1‐year (OR 1.311, 95% CI 1.274‐1.348, P < 0.001) mortality, respectively, with anemia after adjustment for potential confounders. Similar significant increases in mortality with anemia were observed for men (30‐day mortality OR 1.298, 95% CI 1.217‐1.384, P < 0.001; 1‐year mortality OR 1.354, 95% CI 1.299‐1.411, P < 0.001) and women (30‐day mortality OR 1.255, 95% CI 1.146‐1.374, P < 0.001; 1‐year mortality OR 1.252, 95% CI 1.198‐1.309, P < 0.001) as well as diagnosis of NSTEMI (30‐day mortality OR 1.291, 95% CI 1.213‐1.374, P < 0.001; 1‐year mortality OR 1.326, 95% CI 1.281‐1.374, P < 0.001) and STEMI (30‐day mortality OR 1.269, 95% CI 1.163‐1.384, P < 0.001; 1‐year mortality OR 1.284, 95% CI 1.284‐1.352, P < 0.001). In order to eliminate the potential confounding influence of major bleeding complications on the relationship between anemia and mortality, we repeated the analysis following exclusion of patients with major bleeding complications, and similar results were recorded (30‐day mortality OR 1.279, 95% CI 1.213‐1.348, P < 0.001; 1‐year mortality OR 1.309, 95% CI 1.271‐1.347, P < 0.001). Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis was undertaken in patients in whom Hb values were recorded at baseline (257 999 patients), and similar independent factors associated with anemia (Table S3) and mortality outcomes associated with anemia (Table S4) were observed.

### Predictors of packed red cell transfusion after isolated primary coronary artery bypass grafting – the experience of a single cardiac center: a prospective observational study [^115FcURS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

The use of allogeneic blood transfusion after coronary artery surgery is still high despite published transfusion guidelines and costly blood conservation strategies. Readily available patient variables can predict patients at risk for transfusion. The classification of coronary artery bypass graft patients on the basis of attributes known preoperatively and by conduits used yields subsets of patients with distinctly different transfusion requirements and in-hospital outcomes.

Prediction models based on preoperative variables may facilitate blood component management and improve the efficiency of ordering blood before operations for patients undergoing CABG surgeries in order to assist blood banks in improving responsiveness to clinical needs.

Two patterns are usually prevailing for preoperative blood component stocking and preparation in cardiac surgical patients. One practice is the cross-matching of a large number (4 or more) of PRBC units that are usually – at least in part – not utilized, leading to wasting blood bank efforts and resources, including time, space, and reagents. The other is cross-matching a limited number of units (usually 2 units of PRBCs) and typing an extra 2 units to be cross-matched at need. This may lead to a blood bank emergency when a patient is in urgent need for blood component transfusion, putting a considerable stress and time load on the blood bank team. A model to predict patients at risk of requiring more than the standard number of blood components would alleviate plenty of blood bank stress, save time and resources, and allow better utilization of available space and blood resources.

Blood conservation has become one of the most important issues in cardiac surgery. Some of blood conservation strategies are cost-efficient and simple to utilize and can be employed in nearly all cardiac surgical patients without adding further risk to the patient or effort to the operating room team, including non-hemic prime of cardiopulmonary bypass machine, salvage of blood from surgical field using cardiotomy suction, hemodilution during CPB, retransfusion of all contents of oxygenator at the end of CPB, and use of ultrafiltration and modified ultrafiltration during and after CPB. Use of other modalities, such as antifibrinolytic therapy, preoperative autologous blood donation, use of cell saving devices, and auto transfusion of shed mediastinal chest tube drainage is still limited owing to doubts about their effectiveness and inappropriateness for use in many patients. In addition, the routine use of such expensive and sophisticated techniques in all cardiac surgical patients causes higher cost exceeding the benefit obtained. So, these strategies should be utilized more critically.

### The effects of differing anticoagulant regimes on blood quality after cell salvage in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG): a pilot study [^113qZJ43]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cell salvage reduces allogenic blood transfusion requirements in surgery. We present a pilot study exploring the impact of anticoagulant choice, citrate or heparin, on the quality of cell salvaged blood in adults undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

Materials and Methods

Elective on pump CABG patients were randomly allocated to citrate or heparin anticoagulation. We measured red blood cell characteristics and inflammation in both the blood collection reservoir and the washed red blood cell concentrate. Postoperatively, the level of biomarkers and the coagulation profile in the peripheral blood as well as the transfusion requirements of allogenic blood products were studied.

Results

Thirty eight patients were included, 19 in the citrate group and 19 in the heparin group. Baseline characteristics were similar. In the washed red blood cell concentrate, Mean Hb (g/dl) and Ht (%) were lower in the citrate group [Hb: 18.1 g/dL (SD 1.3) vs. 21.1 (1.6), p < 0.001; Ht: 59.9% (54.7–60.9) vs. 63.7% (62.3–64.8); p < 0.001]; Mean corpuscular volume (MCV, μm 3) was higher [99.1fL (9.4) vs. 88 (4.2), p < 0.001] and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC, g/dl) lower in the citrate group [31.9 g/dl (29.6–32.4) vs. 33.6 (33.1–34.0) p < 0.001]. Thrombocyte count (1000/μl) was higher in the citrate group [31.0 (26.0–77.0) vs. 13.0 (10.0–39.0); p = 0.006]. There were no differences in the requirement for allogenic blood products' transfusion (intraoperatively and postoperatively) or in the coagulation parameters after washed red blood cell concentrate infusion. Higher IL-10 was found in the citrate group in the blood collection reservoir, higher neutrophil-derived myeloperoxidase (MPO) in the heparin group after washed red blood cell concentrate infusion.

Conclusion

Though red blood cells in washed red blood cell concentrate were more swollen and diluted in the citrate group with more residual thrombocytes, published quality guidelines were met in both groups. Our pilot study suggests that differences in inflammatory markers in the blood collection reservoir and after infusion of washed red blood cell concentrate indicate a possible pro-inflammatory effect of heparin compared to citrate. A larger study is warranted to confirm these results and their possible clinical consequences. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02674906. Registered 5 February 2016.

### Perioperative care in cardiac surgery: a joint consensus statement by the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) cardiac society, ERAS international society, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) [^116VhfiK]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2024). High credibility.

Patient blood management program in cardiac surgery — components and transfusion thresholds: Summary Statement: Blood product use and associated outcomes are optimized through the implementation of a comprehensive patient blood management program. Quality of Evidence: Moderate. Components of a PBM program are highlighted in Table 4, organized based on 3 major pillars: (1) preoperative anemia and iron deficiency screening and optimization, (2) minimization of iatrogenic blood loss or hemodilution, and (3) permissive intraoperative and postoperative anemia. A patient blood management program, led by a multidisciplinary team of health care providers, should be part of a comprehensive strategy to avoid unnecessary transfusion, and anemia and iron deficiency assessment and treatment with B12, folate, and intravenous iron preparations, as indicated, is reasonable to reduce blood transfusion; preoperative administration of intravenous iron and/or erythropoietin-stimulating agents is reasonable to increase red cell mass for anemic patients. Intraoperatively, laboratory measurement of antiplatelet drug effect for patients on preoperative dual antiplatelet therapy is reasonable to guide timing of surgery, routine use of intraoperative red blood cell salvage using centrifugation is indicated for blood conservation, and use of a standardized hemostasis checklist during cardiac surgery, before closing, can reduce bleeding and blood transfusion. For transfusion practices, a standardized, restrictive perioperative red blood cell transfusion protocol is favored in preference to a liberal strategy to reduce transfusion, goal-directed transfusion algorithms that incorporate point-of-care testing, such as with viscoelastic devices, are shown to reduce bleeding and transfusion, and red blood cell transfusion is unlikely to benefit nonbleeding patients with a hemoglobin concentration > 7.5 g/dL.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^112H74YU]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Red blood cell transfusion: transfusion thresholds for whom and when?

Allogeneic red cell transfusion is associated with a significant increase in peri‐operative morbidity and mortality 2, 98, 99, 100. In addition, there is a worldwide shortage of blood, with substantial associated costs to the manufacturer and health systems 101. Moreover, red cell transfusion risks infectious, immunological, haemolytic, non‐haemolytic adverse reactions, cardiac and pulmonary complications 2, 98. Despite successful implementation of PBM programmes, red cell transfusion is still widely used as a default treatment for the majority of patients with acute postoperative anaemia 102.

Historically, the standard for red cell transfusion was a liberal transfusion threshold, namely haemoglobin level < 100 g.l −1 (or haematocrit < 30%). This arbitrary transfusion threshold has been gradually lowered towards haemoglobin 70–80 g.l −1, according to data derived from a number of RCTs evaluating the effect on patient outcomes of restrictive vs. more liberal red cell transfusion strategies in a variety of clinical settings. When subjected to pooled analysis in several systematic reviews and meta‐analyses (Supporting Information online, Appendix S2) 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, data from these RCTs show that, in terms of morbidity and mortality, a restrictive red cell transfusion strategy is equivalent to or more beneficial than a liberal strategy 101, 109.

In addition, evidence‐based guidelines have translated the results of RCTs and meta‐analyses into clinical practice 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49. One of the most recently published guidelines on red cell transfusion thresholds recommends a restrictive red cell transfusion threshold (haemoglobin < 70 g.l −1) for hospitalised adult patients who are haemodynamically stable, including critically ill patients 49. However, a transfusion threshold of at least 80 g.l −1 is suggested for patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery, cardiac or oncological surgery, and those with pre‐existing cardiovascular disease 12, 49, 110, 111. Nevertheless, transfusion of red cells for higher haemoglobin levels should be evaluated case by case, considering acute ongoing blood loss, comorbidities and signs of organ ischaemia or symptoms indicative of hypoxia. In any case, published guidelines agree that red cell transfusion is not beneficial when haemoglobin is > 100 g.l −1 7, 10, 11, 12, 47, 48, 49, 112. Confounding factors on haemoglobin levels have to be considered, as discussed above.

### The impact of iron store on red blood cell transfusion: a multicentre prospective cohort study in cardiac surgery [^113mwkb7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this multicentre cohort study that investigates both elective and urgent surgeries, we observed that patients with ID had a higher rate of RBC transfusion during surgery, and a higher rate of any blood product transfusion during hospital stay, as compared with iron-replete patients. However, ID was not independently associated with RBC transfusion during the whole hospital stay.

These results need to be interpreted carefully. First, most of RBC transfusions were performed during surgery and were significantly higher in the ID group (22% vs 13%). Moreover, anaemia was a strong driver of RBC transfusion (adjusted OR = 4.16), with IDA being the main cause of anaemia in our population (n = 43, 55% of anaemic patients). This is of importance since ID is a modifiable factor, easily attainable as part of a patient blood management (PBM). Ultimately, we observed very low transfusion rates compared to previous literature. The study might be underpowered and suffers from an insufficient number of patients, as we expected higher RBC transfusion rates. We believe that a focused pre-operative screening of at risk of transfusion-ID patients might lead to targeted iron supplementation prior to cardiac surgery and reduction of anaemia, transfusion, and their associated morbidity.

Anaemia already showed its association with transfusion. There is sufficient evidence to recommend a shared haemoglobin cutoff (< 13 g dL −1) for both sexes to define anaemia prior to surgeries with a high risk of blood loss and to alleviate the potential disadvantage of women compared with men with regard to impact and optimisation of preoperative anaemia. Although ID has shown its association with poor outcomes in multiple diseases, we found that ID alone, without clinical anaemia, may not be strongly associated with in-hospital transfusion requirements in the cardiac surgery setting. Early stage ID, before the anaemic stage, could be insufficient to affect perioperative transfusion. On the other hand, the long-term impact of lower haemoglobin levels at discharge have not been investigated in cardiac surgery, and poor outcomes associated with early stage ID could be delayed.

We also confirmed that RBC transfusion during surgery depends on sex and body mass index, reflecting the impact of haemodilution during CPB. Other worse conditions represented by altered LVEF, severe SAPS 2 scores, reoperations and combined surgeries, were expected and confirmed risk factors for RBC transfusions. Surprisingly, continuation of antiplatelet therapy (mostly acetylsalicylic acid alone and rare cases of dual antiplatelet therapy) was not associated with RBC transfusion.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^112KfdsZ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Cardiac surgery — acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) efficacy and practice are summarized as follows: A 2017 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that patients who underwent ANH had an estimated 388 mL total blood loss vs 450 mL in controls with a mean difference of −0.64 and a lower transfusion risk (26% reduced risk; absolute risk reduction 14%; RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.62–0.87), and ANH was associated with 0.79 fewer units of red blood cells (RBCs) used, based on 2439 patients from 29 RCTs. Although there are no published standardized protocols, ANH typically involves the removal of 1 to 3 units of the patient's blood before heparinization, yet an observational study showed it was performed in only 17% of patients before surgery. Care must be taken in patients who are preoperatively anemic, smaller patients with lower overall blood volumes, and unstable patients; it is also important to avoid profound anemia while on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), and blood that has been removed can be reinfused at any time, including while on bypass; the benefits of ANH are directly linked to the amount of whole blood withdrawn.

Central Message

An important case report is presented of a Jehovah's Witness CABG patient with submassive thrombosis after treatment with high-dose EPO and parenteral iron.

See Article page.

Murillo-Berlioz and colleaguespresent a case report of thrombosis after coronary artery bypass graft surgery in a patient who was a practicing Jehovah's Witness (JW). Their patient, who was without known preoperative thrombosis risk, was treated preoperatively with parenteral iron, folate, vitamin B12, and 8 daily subcutaneous doses of epoetin (EPO) Alfa-epbx 300 units/kg. The patient suffered submassive venous plus arterial thromboses on postoperative day 10, having doubled her platelet count to 424,000 on admission for thrombectomy. Hypercoagulable workup was negative. EPO is known to increase platelet as well as red cell production.

EPO is a hypoxia-induced hormone produced in the kidney that stimulates hematopoiesis in the bone marrow. As a therapeutic agent, recombinant EPO is used in treating various types of anemia, including anemia of end-stage renal disease and cancer-related anemia on chemotherapy. EPO use in heart surgery was never approved by the Food and Drug Administration based on a negative randomized controlled trial of low-dose EPO in 1997. There has not been another cardiac surgical randomized controlled trial since that time. However, there have been numerous reports and case series using high-dose EPO in patients who are JW and others in whom red cell transfusion is not an option — as part of a multidisciplinary blood-conservation regimen focused on enhancing red cell mass and on reducing blood loss.

In a 144-patient retrospective case comparison study of cardiac surgical patients who were JW, Tanaka and colleaguesdid not report increased thrombosis with the use of EPO. They presented evidence that enhancing red cell mass with preoperative erythropoietin and iron therapy to a target hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL is associated with a reduction in major adverse events in patients refusing blood transfusion.

### STS / SCA / AmSECT / SABM update to the clinical practice guidelines on patient blood management [^114Qg3bh]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Patient blood management — cardiac surgery preoperative anemia therapy emphasizes that treatment of an anemic patient before surgery is appropriate and "should be considered as part of any patient's careful workup and preparation for cardiac surgery, if time permits". Evidence supports erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) with intravenous iron: a randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed "significant improvements in units of transfusion (1.0 ± 1.1 units vs 3.3 ± 2.2 units…; p = 0.001)", and a prospective observational study reported reduced transfusion rates "67% vs 93%…; P < .001" with lower "30-day mortality (multivariable OR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.28–0.97; p = 0.047)". Intravenous iron options are "very effective even for 1 to 2 weeks", and optimization "as long as 4 to 5 weeks preoperatively" may reduce adverse outcomes. ESA-alone strategies also show benefit: in "a prospective RCT of 600 anemic patients", a "single dose of 80,000 units of epoetin-a" "2 days preoperatively" increased hemoglobin and reduced transfusion and major adverse surgical events, with early events favoring ESA at 3 days "after surgery (10.2% vs 0.8%; P < .001)" and persisting "after surgery (10.2% vs 8.7%; P < .005)", though with "no significant difference in mortality and major adverse events at 45 days". Another randomized trial of "320 patients… off-pump" found fewer transfusions with ESA "37.1% vs 16.1%; RR, 0.425; p = 0.007", using "multiple subcutaneous doses starting on preoperative day 2 and continuing to postoperative day 2". Practical considerations note that decreased perioperative endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) production "favors a short preoperative course of ESA (a few days before the operation)" in selected patients, while iron-only data are limited, and "a small RCT of only 50 patients did not" show benefit.

### Erythropoiesis stimulating agents and reno-protection: a meta-analysis [^116RXNQt]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical interventions to see if there is a relationship between ESAs and renal outcomes included short-term prophylactic ESA treatment where there was a high likelihood of acute kidney injury (AKI), e.g. patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. In another modality, ESA treatment at the time of surgery might mitigate the ischemic damage and delayed graft function (DGF) that occurs during the perioperative period following kidney transplant. DGF increases the risk of acute rejection, impaired graft function, and reduces long term patient and graft survival. In a third modality, treatment of CKD patients to correct anemia associated with renal failure presumes that ESA treatment might delay or prevent renal disease progression through direct anti-apoptotic effects on renal cells or indirect effects of anemia correction, eg improved oxygen delivery.

Most of the trials examining the effect of ESAs on renal patients were small, outcomes were not robust or they varied across studies. Therefore, results from individual trials were inconclusive, but meta-analyses of results from those clinical trials may allow more definitive conclusions. We reasoned further that meta-analysis of multiple modalities would add additional value. The three modalities above were selected for meta-analysis because they examined direct and/or indirect effects of ESAs on renal disease progression or renal function. We report here that meta-analyses show no significant beneficial effects in any of the modalities, suggesting that ESAs have little reno-protective benefits, at least with the patient populations examined and clinical designs employed.

### A clinical trial assessing the efficacy of intravenous iron… [^116ozwEQ]. ClinicalTrials (2020). Medium credibility.

A Clinical Trial Assessing the Efficacy of Intravenous Iron for the Treatment of Anemia Following Cardiac Surgery ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview BACKGROUND Anemia and iron deficiency are highly prevalent in cardiac surgery patients. Both conditions may adversely affect postoperative rehabilitation. At hospital discharge, anemia is almost invariably present due to perioperative blood loss and frequent blood sampling. Two previous analyses demonstrated a prevalence of anemia early after coronary artery bypass grafting of 94% and 98%, respectively. Almost half of CABG patients had persistent anemia two months after surgery. Postoperative anemia may result in debilitating symptoms, like dyspnoea, fatigue and poor exercise tolerance, and is associated with an increased likelihood of cardiovascular events and death after cardiac surgery. Mild to moderate anemia is commonly corrected with oral iron supplements.

Oral iron is however poorly absorbed in patients with chronic diseases, and about 40% of patients suffer from debilitating gastrointestinal side-effects. As iron stores are frequently reduced or depleted after cardiac surgery, treatment with oral iron supplements may take several months. In patients with chronic heart failure, iron deficiency is associated with reduced exercise capacity, quality of life and survival even in the absence of anemia. Several large randomised trials demonstrated that treatment with intravenous iron improved clinical symptoms, exercise capacity and quality of life of CHF patients. RATIONALE It is desirable to replenish body iron stores rapidly after cardiac surgery with the aim to effectively correct anemia, optimize exercise tolerance and improve patient wellbeing. Modern intravenous iron formulations permit fast replenishment of body iron stores and have emerged as potential alternatives to oral iron.

These formulations are well-tolerated and have become an established therapeutic option in anemic patients with reduced intestinal iron absorption. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of intravenous iron for the treatment of anemia following major non-cardiac surgery.

### Red blood cell transfusion in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) [^113iSNKa]. ClinicalTrials (2011). Low credibility.

Study Overview Patients with a low blood count with stable or unstable coronary artery disease consistently show worse clinical outcomes. It is unclear whether this association is confounded since anemic patients tend to be also sicker i.e. have lower ejection fractions or more comorbidities and this would be the reason for the worse outcomes rather than anemia. Adverse clinical outcomes are reduced when critically ill patients are only transfused if their hematocrit drops below 21%: Hematocrit is a measure of the severity of anemia. A HCT is considered normal if it ranges between 38 and 48% of total blood volume. In critically ill patients anemia is very common; about 95% of patients admitted to the intensive care unit have hemoglobin levels below normal by intensive care unit day 3. {.

Storage of RBC before transfusion lowers the function of the RBCs: In a retrospective study in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting a recent study found that RBC transfusions were associated with an increased risk of mortality and short term and long term postoperative complications when patients were transfused with stored RBCs. This phenomenon is called the storage lesion. There is a rapid depletion of 2, 3 diglycerophosphate with storage. {Bunn, 1968 #8849} This has a profound impact on hemoglobin affinity reducing oxygen release from hemoglobin by as much as 25% at similar change in oxygen saturation. Infusion of stored RBCs causes hemolysis which in turn reduces nitric oxide bioavailability: Significant hemolysis occurs both during storage and in particular during transfusion.

{Sowemimo-Coker, 2002 #8851} Free hemoglobin outside of RBCs scavenges nitric oxide. Reiter, 2002 #6096} RBCs also contain arginase which released into the circulation will further enhance nitric oxide depletion by reducing its precursor arginine. {Kato, 2005 #7955}. The investigators will systematically examine the effects of RBC transfusion on systemic oxygen delivery, whole body oxygen consumption, nitric oxide bioavailability, endothelial function, cardiac performance, microcirculatory function, and platelet aggregation in patients with active coronary artery disease, presenting to the BIDMC with anemia, defined as hematocrit of < 30%.

### Active preoperative anemia management in patients undergoing cardiac surgery (APART) [^113ib2ae]. ClinicalTrials (2014). Low credibility.

Study Overview Anemia which is a decreased blood count or lower than normal hemoglobin, is a major health problem for patients having heart surgery. Hemoglobin is the part of our blood that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. Anemia that is present before surgery, called preoperative anemia, is a risk factor for an increased chance of morbidity and/or mortality after heart surgery. It is also an important indicator of blood transfusion necessity. Recent clinical research investigations done to study preoperative anemia suggest a blood transfusion can damage the immune system which can lead to infection, organ dysfunction, prolonged hospital stays, as well as increased supplies, resources and cost in surgical patients. Comprehensive anemia management can reduce or eliminate the need for blood transfusions and provide better outcomes after surgery.

Therefore, controlling anemia before surgery is extremely important, and could be a lifesaving measure.

### Anemia and hematinic deficiencies in patients with chronic heart failure… [^115iFLBC]. JAMA Network (2016). Excellent credibility.

Overall, 1237 patients had anemia, which was mild in 643, moderate in 354, and marked in 240. The prevalence of anemia was higher in patients with LVSD or with either definition of HFnEF than in those who lacked echocardiographic and biomarker criteria for HF. The prevalence of anemia increased slightly with higher, rather than lower, serum vitamin B12 and folate concentrations. Patients with HF had a slightly higher prevalence of macrocytosis regardless of hemoglobin category. There was also a strong association between the prevalence of anemia and estimated glomerular filtration rate, hsCRP, and NT-proBNP.

In a multivariable model restricted to hematinic variables and key clinical characteristics, the following were associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality: lower hemoglobin and serum iron concentrations, the highest quintile of ferritin, and higher serum vitamin B12 concentrations. If the model was extended to include comorbidities, such as findings on physical examination, other biochemical testing, and therapy, the independent association between serum iron and all-cause mortality was lost, but hemoglobin and vitamin B12 concentrations remained weakly associated with outcome. The causes of anemia in patients with HF are complex. 6 Anemia denotes a low hemoglobin concentration.

Plasma volume expansion or a decrease in red blood cell mass may cause the hemoglobin concentration to decrease and the patient to become anemic20, 23; plasma volume expansion may contribute to both anemia and an increase in natriuretic peptides and partly account for why patients with HF have a lower hemoglobin concentration for a given level of iron deficiency. The severity of anemia and iron deficiency were both strongly related to all-cause and cardiovascular mortality on univariate analyses. Patients with anemia were at increased risk of sudden and HF-related death. Elimination of iron or hemoglobin from the multivariable model strengthened the association of the other with outcome. Therefore, it is likely that both the severity of anemia and iron deficiency contribute to an adverse outcome in patients with HF.
