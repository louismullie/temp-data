## Question

When to recheck troponin

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking when to recheck troponin in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome and how to time high-sensitivity assays using guideline-concordant algorithms. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the initial assessment at presentation including immediate hs-cTn sampling and ECG triage. Then, I should verify how time from symptom onset modifies safety of single-sample strategies versus the need for serial testing. Next, I will apply the ESC 0/1h and 0/2h pathways and confirm when a third sample at 3 hours is required. After that, I need to integrate ECG, risk, and clinical context, including special populations like CKD. Finally, I will determine rule-out, rule-in, and observation dispositions, and ensure documentation of timing and deltas is precise.

> Let me first confirm the basics at arrival: obtain an immediate high-sensitivity cardiac troponin at 0 hour together with a 12-lead ECG, and ensure results return within about 60 minutes for timely decision-making; if the ECG shows STEMI, I must not delay reperfusion for serial troponin testing, whereas in non–ST-elevation presentations I should proceed with structured serial troponin sampling and clinical assessment [^115wc2F7].

> Wait, let me verify how symptom onset timing affects retesting strategy, because this is often where errors creep in; in early presenters within 2–3 hours of symptom onset, a single normal hs-cTn is unsafe since up to half of true MIs can have an initial value below the decision threshold, so serial sampling is mandatory to avoid false negatives, whereas beyond 3 hours the kinetics favor safer accelerated strategies but still require careful context integration [^111en2fF] [^113gceyi].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about single-sample rule-out; in patients presenting ≥ 3 hours after symptom onset with a non-ischemic ECG and low clinical risk, a very low hs-cTn at presentation, often near the assay's limit of detection (for example, 5 ng/L for some hs-cTnT platforms), can support immediate rule-out if operationalized within a validated pathway, but I should confirm assay-specific thresholds and apply clinical judgment because performance varies across platforms and populations [^116NCm5T] [^111en2fF].

> Next, I should review the ESC-endorsed accelerated serial pathways; the 0h/1h and 0h/2h algorithms require a baseline measurement at presentation and a repeat at 1 or 2 hours, with decisions driven by absolute deltas and assay-specific cutoffs to classify patients into rule-out, rule-in, or observation zones, achieving very high negative predictive values and reducing length of stay when correctly implemented with ECG and history integration [^111QnpBh] [^117RsnDP] [^116NCm5T].

> Hmm, wait a minute — how exactly should I time the third measurement if the first two are inconclusive; I initially thought "3 hours from symptom onset", but I should correct myself — ESC specifies obtaining an additional hs-cTn sample at 3 hours after presentation when the 0h/1h (or analogous) results are indeterminate and no alternative diagnosis explains the presentation, which often resolves diagnostic uncertainty and clarifies the delta pattern [^114DjxHW] [^1125VYuT].

> I need to ensure I am not interpreting troponin in isolation; let me consider ECG changes, pretest probability, and risk scores because troponin concentration at presentation alone does not reliably distinguish type 1 MI from type 2 MI or non-ischemic myocardial injury, and even "rule-in" thresholds have only moderate positive predictive value without the clinical picture, so I should use deltas plus context to refine the diagnosis and management [^115RRzAg] [^113GPby9].

> I should double-check special populations; in chronic kidney disease or ESRD, baseline hs-cTn is frequently elevated and sex-specific 99th percentiles are pertinent for interpretation, making serial change more informative than a single static value, and I need to be cautious because atypical symptoms and chronic elevations can obscure the pattern of acute injury despite increased absolute risk [^115DMcyC].

> Next, I should review differential diagnoses during serial testing; if evidence supports a non-coronary cause of troponin elevation such as myocarditis, pulmonary embolism, heart failure, sepsis, or tachyarrhythmia, I can pivot away from ACS pathways and discontinue repeated troponin sampling, provided I have adequate clinical justification and close follow-up plans [^111QnpBh] [^113GPby9].

> I will now examine disposition thresholds to avoid premature closure; safe rule-out requires concordant data, typically a very low initial hs-cTn with minimal delta on 0/1h or 0/2h, non-ischemic ECG, low clinical risk, and preferably > 3 hours since symptom onset, whereas rule-in entails hs-cTn above the 99th percentile with a significant rise and/or very high values where some guidelines and studies discuss thresholds several-fold above the URL to prioritize invasive evaluation, though even 5× URL yields only moderate PPV and must be reconciled with the clinical scenario; patients in the observation zone need continued monitoring and a 3-hour sample after presentation to clarify trajectory, and STEMI requires immediate reperfusion [^111QnpBh] [^115RRzAg] [^11231327].

> Hold on, I should verify that operational details are documented meticulously; I need to record exact symptom onset time, the time stamps for each blood draw, absolute hs-cTn values with calculated deltas, ECG interpretations, and the clinical rationale that ties serial biomarker kinetics to either discharge, observation, or admission, ensuring reproducibility and medicolegal clarity [^111QnpBh].

> Let me reconsider the overall flow to ensure no step is missed; early presenters within 3 hours categorically require serial testing with 0/1h or 0/2h and a 3-hour after-presentation draw if needed, later presenters with low risk and non-ischemic ECG may be ruled out with a single very low value in validated pathways, STEMI bypasses serial testing for reperfusion, indeterminate results mandate the 3-hour sample, and if a non-ACS explanation emerges, I should discontinue the ACS algorithm and redirect care appropriately [^111QnpBh] [^114DjxHW] [^111en2fF] [^11231327].

Recheck troponin at **0/1-hour or 0/2-hour intervals** for suspected NSTEMI using high-sensitivity assays, as per ESC 2023 guidelines [^111QnpBh]. If initial results are inconclusive, **repeat at 3 hours** [^114DjxHW] [^1125VYuT]. For **early presenters (< 3 hours)** from symptom onset, **always perform serial testing** due to possible delayed troponin rise [^115M3h69] [^111en2fF]. In STEMI, **do not delay reperfusion** for troponin testing [^11231327]; in non-ACS myocardial injury, use serial testing to assess rise/fall and guide management [^112sZCCV] [^115RRzAg]. For chronic coronary syndromes, repeat troponin **only if clinical or ECG features** suggest ACS [^111MoUaa].

## Recommended timing for troponin rechecking

### Initial measurement

Obtain the initial measurement **immediately at presentation** [^115wc2F7], with results available **within 60 minutes** [^115wc2F7] [^111QnpBh].

---

### Serial measurements for suspected NSTEMI

Use serial hs-cTn at **0 and 1 hour or 0 and 2 hours** to rule in or rule out NSTEMI [^111QnpBh] [^11231327] [^116meb5x]. If results from the 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithms are inconclusive, **repeat at 3 hours** [^114DjxHW] [^1125VYuT].

---

### Early presenters (< 3 hours from symptom onset)

For patients presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset, **always perform serial testing** because troponin rise may be delayed [^111en2fF]. This serial sampling accounts for delayed biomarker release in early presenters [^113gceyi].

---

### STEMI

Do not delay **reperfusion** for troponin testing [^11231327]. Obtain a baseline troponin before PCI if feasible; do not delay treatment [^111Bz72S].

---

### Non-ACS myocardial injury

Use **serial testing to assess rise and fall** [^112sZCCV], with results guiding management [^115RRzAg].

---

### Chronic coronary syndromes

Repeat troponin **only when clinical or ECG features** suggest ACS [^111MoUaa]. Routine repeat testing is otherwise not indicated [^112U5N2x].

## Clinical scenarios requiring troponin rechecking

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended timing for rechecking** |
|-|-|
| Suspected NSTEMI | - 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithms <br/> - 3-hour if inconclusive [^114DjxHW] |
| Early presenters (< 3 hours) | Serial testing at 0, 1, and 3 hours [^111en2fF] [^113gceyi] |
| STEMI | - Baseline before PCI if feasible <br/> - Do not delay reperfusion [^11231327] |
| Non-ACS myocardial injury | Serial testing to assess rise/fall [^115RRzAg] |
| Chronic coronary syndromes | Repeat only if clinical/ECG features suggest ACS [^111MoUaa] |

## Factors influencing timing of troponin rechecking

- **Assay sensitivity**: High-sensitivity assays enable earlier detection and shorter intervals [^1168fhNh].

- **Clinical presentation**: Symptom onset timing and severity guide interval selection [^111en2fF] [^113gceyi].

- **Patient risk factors**: Higher risk may warrant shorter intervals and closer monitoring [^113GPby9].

- **Institutional protocols**: Local policies and resources influence timing [^113jzvz6].

---

## Clinical implications of delayed or inappropriate troponin rechecking

- **Delayed diagnosis**: Late rechecking can delay MI diagnosis and treatment, increasing adverse events [^116NCm5T].

- **Unnecessary testing**: Inappropriate testing can cause false positives, unnecessary workups, and longer stays [^113jzvz6].

- **Increased costs**: Unnecessary testing and prolonged stays raise healthcare costs [^116meb5x].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Initial measurement**: Immediately at presentation; results within 60 minutes [^115wc2F7].

- **Serial measurements**: 0/1-hour or 0/2-hour algorithms for suspected NSTEMI [^11231327].

- **Early presenters**: Serial testing at 0, 1, and 3 hours [^114DjxHW].

- **STEMI**: Do not delay reperfusion for troponin testing [^111Bz72S].

- **Non-ACS myocardial injury**: Serial testing to assess rise/fall [^112sZCCV].

- **Chronic coronary syndromes**: Repeat only if clinical or ECG features suggest ACS [^111MoUaa].

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^112sZCCV]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

To promote the adoption of common standards, the Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction recommends cardiac troponin testing and the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) as the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction. In practice, there are many causes of troponin elevation, with about half of all increases attributable to conditions other than type 1 myocardial infarction. Nonetheless, the early differentiation between types of myocardial infarction and acute or chronic nonischemic myocardial injury is important because the immediate management of these conditions differs. Prompt treatment with antiplatelet agents, anticoagulation, and coronary revascularization is recommended in type 1 myocardial infarction, whereas these may not be indicated in type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury and may be contraindicated.

Alternative thresholds above the 99th percentile have been proposed to improve the positive predictive value (PPV) and specificity of troponin for type 1 myocardial infarction. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines propose the use of rule-in thresholds above the 99th percentile to guide admission to cardiology and coronary angiography. These rule-in thresholds and those 5 times the URL are purported to give a PPV of at least 70% and 90%, respectively. They were derived in selected patients with chest pain; however, in practice, troponin testing is applied more widely to evaluate patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome presenting with a broader range of symptoms. Guidelines also recommend serial testing.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), particularly in relation to cardiac troponin, the 2023 ESC guidelines recommend using an algorithmic approach. This involves serial high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements at 0 hour/1 hour or 0 hour/2 hours intervals to effectively rule in or rule out NSTEMI.

### 2023 ESC guidelines for the management of acute coronary syndromes [^114DjxHW]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, specifically concerning cardiac troponin, the ESC 2023 guidelines recommend obtaining additional testing after 3 hours. This is advised if the first two high-sensitivity cardiac troponin measurements of the 0 hour/1 hour algorithm are inconclusive and no alternative diagnoses explaining the condition have been made.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of chronic coronary syndromes [^111MoUaa]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for coronary artery disease, specifically concerning cardiac troponin, the ESC 2024 guidelines recommend an immediate referral to the emergency department and/or obtaining repeated measurements of blood troponin. It is preferable to use high-sensitivity or ultrasensitive assays to rule out acute myocardial injury if clinical or ECG assessment suggests acute coronary syndrome rather than chronic coronary syndrome.

### Troponin in early presenters to rule out myocardial infarction [^115M3h69]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays are able to quantify low levels of cardiac troponin in the majority of presumably healthy individuals. This has led to accelerated diagnostic pathways that use a single measurement of cardiac troponin at presentation to rule out myocardial infarction. Such approaches are safe and effective in patients presenting more than 2 or 3 hours after symptom onset. However, concerns remain about the use of a single test strategy in early presenters, and it is unclear how the performance of cardiac troponin changes with time following symptom onset.

Early rule-out thresholds use low levels of cardiac troponin to identify patients at presentation who are at low risk and may not require serial testing. Studies have used either the limit of detection of a high-sensitivity assay or have defined the optimal rule-out threshold as the highest cardiac troponin concentration measurable that enables the greatest proportion of patients to be ruled out with a negative predictive value of ≥ 99.5% for myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days. However, concerns remain that cardiac troponin elevations may not be recognized if testing is performed within a few hours of symptom onset. Indeed, an increase in the proportion of false negatives has been observed in patients presenting within 2 or 3 hours. As such, international guidelines recommend serial sampling in early presenters, which adds complexity to patient assessment and reduces the proportion of patients eligible for a single test rule-out, and therefore the effectiveness of these strategies.

### Incremental value of objective cardiac testing in addition to physician impression and serial contemporary troponin measurements in women [^114iraxf]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend that patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain who are at low risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) receive an objective cardiac evaluation with a stress test or coronary imaging. It is uncertain whether all women derive benefit from this process. The study aimed to determine the incremental value of objective cardiac testing after serial cardiac markers and physician risk assessment.

Women enrolled in the 18-site Myeloperoxidase in the Diagnosis of Acute Coronary Syndrome (MIDAS) study had serial troponin I measured at time 0 and 90 minutes, along with physician risk assessment for the presence of ACS. Risk estimates obtained at the time of ED evaluation were dichotomized as high or non-high risk. The primary outcome was the composite of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or revascularization at 30 days. Logistic regression with receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and net reclassification index were used to determine the diagnostic accuracy for the composite outcome of 30-day MI or revascularization for two models:

- **Model 1**: Troponin I results and physician risk assessment alone.
- **Model 2**: Troponin I results, physician risk assessment, and objective cardiac testing.

A total of 460 women with a median age of 58 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 48.5 to 68 years) were included, and 32 (6.9%) experienced AMI or revascularization by 30 days. Comparison of the area under the ROC curves (AUC) showed that the addition of objective cardiac testing improved the diagnostic accuracy for this composite outcome compared to the combination of troponin I results and physician risk assessment alone.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays and the early rule-out of acute myocardial infarction [^113gceyi]. Heart (2013). Low credibility.

Hoeller and colleagues have addressed an important and clinically relevant question: can high-sensitivity troponin assays be used to rule out myocardial infarction with a single measurement of troponin on presentation? This strategy is not endorsed by international guidelines, and the answer to the question is unequivocal. Troponin concentrations on presentation were within the normal reference range in up to one-fifth of patients who would subsequently be diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction on repeat sampling. Indeed, in patients presenting with symptoms for less than 3 hours, as many as one in two patients with a diagnosis of myocardial infarction had troponin concentrations within the normal reference range on presentation. In these patients, the diagnosis would have been missed if clinicians were to rely on a single measurement of troponin in the emergency department, and the authors conclude that serial sampling is essential for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

One of the strengths of the analysis by Hoeller and colleagues is that they evaluate four high-sensitivity assays, including two prototype assays that are not yet commercially available. They report differences between assays in the sensitivity of a single admission troponin concentration for a final diagnosis of myocardial infarction determined on serial testing, which, if interpreted incorrectly, could infer advantages or disadvantages of one assay over another. Apparent differences in sensitivity between assays are not due to differences in assay precision but are a consequence of variance in the manufacturers' designs.

### Temporal evolution of serum concentrations of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin during 1 year after acute coronary syndrome admission [^112U5N2x]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). High credibility.

At the time of writing, studies on the biological variation of cardiac troponins, measured with contemporary high‐sensitivity assays, are scarce, and their sample sizes have usually been small. Particularly in patients with established chronic coronary syndrome (CCS), such as patients following acute coronary syndrome (ACS), little to no information is available. The parameters of variation found in our study are comparable to earlier reports in subjects sampled from the general "healthy" population. For example, Wu et al. reported a long‐term individual variation of 14% for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs‐cTnI) based on 17 healthy subjects. The coefficient of interindividual or between‐subject variation in their report was lower than in our study, which suggests that cardiac troponins show larger variations in patients with CCS than in healthy individuals. The larger between‐subject variation in a diseased population compared with a healthy one is also confirmed by a study of Meijers et al. comparing biological variation in 83 patients with heart failure to 28 healthy subjects. They reported a coefficient of interindividual or between‐subject variation for high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs‐cTnT) of 96.6% and 51.2%, respectively. The coefficients of variation (CVs), however, were similar in both populations and comparable to our cohort.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin on presentation to rule out myocardial infarction: A stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial [^116NCm5T]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays enable myocardial infarction to be ruled out earlier; however, the safety and efficacy of this approach are uncertain. We investigated whether an early rule-out pathway is safe and effective for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.

- **Methods**: We performed a stepped-wedge cluster randomized controlled trial in the emergency departments of seven acute care hospitals in Scotland. Consecutive patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome between December 2014 and December 2016 were included. Sites were randomized to implement an early rule-out pathway where myocardial infarction was excluded if high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations were < 5 ng/L at presentation. During a previous validation phase, myocardial infarction was ruled out when troponin concentrations were < 99th percentile at 6 to 12 hours after symptom onset. The coprimary outcome was length of stay (efficacy) and myocardial infarction or cardiac death after discharge at 30 days (safety). Patients were followed for one year to evaluate safety and other secondary outcomes.

- **Results**: We enrolled 31,492 patients (59 ± 17 years of age [mean ± SD]; 45% women) with troponin concentrations < 99th percentile at presentation. Length of stay was reduced from 10.1 ± 4.1 to 6.8 ± 3.9 hours (adjusted geometric mean ratio, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.73–0.83]; P < 0.001) after implementation, and the proportion of patients discharged increased from 50% to 71% (adjusted odds ratio, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.45–1.75]). Noninferiority was not demonstrated for the 30-day safety outcome.

### High-sensitivity troponin in the evaluation of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome: a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled trial [^116meb5x]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays permit the use of lower thresholds for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, though it remains uncertain whether this improves clinical outcomes. This study aimed to assess whether introducing a high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) assay, with a sex-specific 99th percentile diagnostic threshold, would reduce subsequent myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.

In a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomised controlled trial conducted across ten secondary or tertiary care hospitals in Scotland, the implementation of an hs-cTnI assay was evaluated in consecutive patients admitted to emergency departments with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Patients were eligible if they presented with suspected acute coronary syndrome and had paired cardiac troponin measurements from both standard care and trial assays. During a 6–12 month validation phase, results from the hs-cTnI assay were concealed from the attending clinician, as care was guided by a contemporary cardiac troponin I (cTnI) assay. Hospitals were randomly allocated to either early (n = 5 hospitals) or late (n = 5 hospitals) implementation. The high-sensitivity assay and sex-specific 99th percentile diagnostic threshold were introduced immediately after the 6-month validation phase in early implementation hospitals, while late implementation was deferred for an additional 6 months. Patients reclassified by the high-sensitivity assay were identified as those with an increased hs-cTnI concentration, where cTnI concentrations were below the detection threshold.

### Point-of-care testing with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays: The challenges and opportunities [^116486qo]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The performance characteristics of point-of-care test (POCT) troponin assays are summarized below, including newer assays that reach the analytical classification of high-sensitivity (hs) assays. In addition to classification based on analytical performance, POCT troponin assays can also be divided into compact desktop systems aimed solely at bedside use and larger systems suitable for close-to-patient operation or use in an emergency testing facility. The analytical and clinical performance characteristics of these systems have been examined in independent evaluations using the same criteria as laboratory-based assays to a predicate method of comparable analytical sensitivity. Furthermore, three new prototype systems have been documented that have potential for clinical use.

Most evaluations of POCT troponin assays have been based on the ability to achieve comparable diagnostic classification for myocardial infarction (MI) in comparison with laboratory-based assays. Diagnosis is based on the ability to detect troponin above the 99th percentile 3–6 hours from presentation. POCT assays meeting contemporary sensitivity criteria are reliable for ruling in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) upon admission for samples exceeding the 99th percentile. However, they may require sampling up to 6 hours post-admission for a safe rule-out.

### Interpreting troponin in renal disease: A narrative review for emergency clinicians [^115DMcyC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) or end stage renal disease (ESRD) can experience several severe complications, including acute coronary syndrome (ACS). While troponin is the biomarker of choice for the evaluation of ACS, interpretation of troponin in CKD/ESRD can be challenging.

This narrative review evaluates troponin elevation in patients with CKD/ESRD, pitfalls in the evaluation with troponin, and an approach to using troponin in these high-risk patients. Patients with CKD/ESRD are at greater risk for ACS and possess higher levels of circulating troponin. Relatedly, these patients often present atypically for ACS.

- **Pitfalls in evaluation**: Several pitfalls must be considered in the use of troponin when evaluating for ACS. While troponin elevation in patients with CKD/ESRD is often considered to be due to underlying renal disease, this elevation has several etiologies, including uremic skeletal myopathy, microinfarctions, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), decreased clearance, and unrecognized congestive heart failure (CHF).

Utilizing troponin assays in this patient population requires a nuanced approach, as the sensitivity and specificity for troponin testing in CKD varies. Concern for ACS with elevated troponin warrants treatment for ACS until proven otherwise, with consideration of atypical presentations along with other causes for patient symptoms that may result in troponin elevation. Patients with CKD/ESRD presenting with symptoms concerning for ACS are challenging. The utilization of troponin assays is important in this population.

### Are troponin assays occasionally deceiving us [^111U8R3h]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Troponin (I or T) is the principal marker of myocardial injury used in clinical practice. Although immune-based methods to determine troponin I levels are generally reliable, the presence of human antibodies interfering with the assay components could lead to erroneous results. In this report, we will discuss the case of a patient with misleadingly elevated troponin I due to high rheumatoid factor titer and provide an insight into the responsible molecular mechanisms.

### Cardiac troponins [^115NvB8M]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins I and T are proteins integral to the function of cardiac muscle. They are highly sensitive markers for the detection of myocardial damage, and the ability to assay their serum levels accurately and quickly has revolutionized the concepts of minor myocardial injury and infarction. They also serve as powerful prognostic indicators of future adverse cardiac events.

Limitations, more so for troponin T than I, include decreased specificity in patients with renal failure and skeletal muscle disease. Rapid, whole blood assays are now available that can be performed at the patient's bedside. This review discusses cardiac troponins, their biochemistry, the assays currently available, and their roles in evaluating cardiac disease in the Emergency Department (ED).

### Point-of-care testing with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays: The challenges and opportunities [^1161jJyc]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Low credibility.

To understand the significant changes in this practice area, it is important to be aware of two key events that occurred following the introduction and subsequent development of cTn assays. First, the change from diagnosis using creatine kinase MB to cTn increased the risk of a biochemical false-positive from 0.044% (classified as abnormal when more than twice the 97.5th reference limit) to 1% (abnormal when above the 99th percentile). The second event is the improvement in troponin assays. Early assays had inadequate sensitivity for detection of troponin. Progressive improvements in assay sensitivity combined with the use of the 99th percentile resulted in previously undiagnosed myocardial injury being detectable in a range of clinical conditions. Currently, hs-cTn assays are in routine clinical use in many laboratories and are defined by two criteria. First, the coefficient of variation (CV) at the 99th percentile upper reference limit should be ≤ 10%, and second, measurable concentrations should be attainable at a concentration at or above the assay's limit of detection (LoD) for > 50% of healthy individuals. Hence, hs-cTn assays represent the reference analytical standard against which diagnostic strategies must now be compared.

At the time of writing, in each clinical situation where troponin elevation has been detected and where myocardial infarction (MI) or acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is not suspected, the troponin elevation has been shown to be prognostic. More troponin is worse than less troponin, and no troponin is better than any troponin.

### Implications of lowering threshold of plasma troponin concentration in diagnosis of myocardial infarction: Cohort study [^1149FRBm]. BMJ (2012).

Objective: To assess the relation between troponin concentration, assay precision, and clinical outcomes in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome.

Design: Cohort study.

Setting: Tertiary centre in Scotland.

Participants: A total of 2,092 consecutive patients admitted with suspected acute coronary syndrome were stratified with a sensitive troponin I assay into three groups (< 0.012, 0.012–0.049, and ≥ 0.050 µg/L) based on the 99th centile for troponin concentration (0.012 µg/L; coefficient of variation 20.8%) and the diagnostic threshold (0.050 µg/L; 7.2%).

Main outcome measure: One-year survival without events (recurrent myocardial infarction, death) in patients grouped by troponin concentration.

Results: Troponin I concentrations were < 0.012 µg/L in 988 patients (47%), 0.012–0.049 µg/L in 352 patients (17%), and ≥ 0.050 µg/L in 752 patients (36%). Adoption of the 99th centile would increase the number of people receiving a diagnosis of myocardial infarction from 752 to 1,104, a relative increase of 47%. At one year, patients with troponin concentrations of 0.012–0.049 µg/L were more likely to be dead or readmitted with recurrent myocardial infarction than those with troponin concentrations < 0.012 µg/L (13% vs 3%, P < 0.001; odds ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 7.9). Compared with troponin ≥ 0.050 µg/L, patients with troponin 0.012–0.049 µg/L had a higher risk profile but were less likely to have a diagnosis of, or be investigated and treated for, acute coronary syndrome.

Conclusion: Lowering the diagnostic threshold to the 99th centile and accepting greater assay imprecision…

### Present and future of cardiac troponin in clinical practice: A paradigm shift to high-sensitivity assays [^116UaJ9t]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Despite its wide utilization and central role in the evaluation of patients with potential ischemic symptoms, misconceptions and confusion about cardiac troponin (cTn) prevail. The implementation of high-sensitivity (hs) cTn assays in clinical practice has multiple potential advantages, provided there is an education process tied to the introduction of these assays that emphasizes the appropriate utilization of the test. Several diagnostic strategies have been explored with hs-cTn assays, including the use of undetectable values, accelerated serial hs-cTn sampling, hs-cTn measurements in combination with a clinical-risk score, and the use of a single hs-cTn measurement with a concentration threshold tailored to meet a clinical need. In this document, we discuss basic concepts that should facilitate the integration of hs-cTn assays into clinical care in years to come.

### Implementation of a high sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay and risk of myocardial infarction or death at five years: observational analysis of a stepped wedge, cluster randomised controlled trial [^114drP4i]. BMJ (2023). High credibility.

To evaluate the impact of implementing a high sensitivity assay for cardiac troponin I on long-term outcomes in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, a secondary observational analysis of a stepped wedge, cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted.

The study was set in 10 secondary and tertiary care centres in Scotland, UK, involving 48,282 consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome. Myocardial injury was defined as any high sensitivity assay result for cardiac troponin I > 99th centile of 16 ng/L in women and 34 ng/L in men.

Hospital sites were randomly allocated to either early (n = 5 hospitals) or late (n = 5 hospitals) implementation of a high sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay with sex-specific diagnostic thresholds.

- **Main outcome measure**: The main outcome was myocardial infarction or death at five years.

- **Results**:
	10360 patients had cardiac troponin concentrations greater than the 99th centile, of whom 1771 (17.1%) were reclassified by the high sensitivity assay. The five-year incidence of subsequent myocardial infarction or death before and after implementation of the high sensitivity assay was 29.4% (5588/18978) vs. 25.9% (7591/29304), respectively, in all patients (adjusted hazard ratio 0.97, 95% confidence interval 0.93 to 1.01), and 63.0% (456/720) vs. 53.9% (567/1051), respectively, in those reclassified by the high sensitivity assay (0.82, 0.72 to 0.94). After implementation of the high sensitivity assay, a reduction in subsequent myocardial infarction or death was observed in patients with non-ischaemic myocardial injury.

### Significance of an early repeat troponin measurement upon presentation to the hospital for acute heart failure [^116eCYLh]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Low credibility.

Although our findings highlight the potential prognostic usefulness of early serial cTn measurements in AHF without ACS, they remain exploratory. Given that our study only evaluated two sequential measurements taken hours apart, there is a possibility that these values reflect variability around a mean. Further studies evaluating multiple measurements of cTn over the initial hours of hospitalization are necessary to determine whether there is a sustained trajectory or if values regress to a mean over time. Additionally, future studies should evaluate whether specific trajectories of change or early peak cTn values can more accurately identify high-risk individuals with AHF. Lastly, understanding the processes that lead to a rising cTn early during hospitalization for AHF is necessary so that targeted therapies can be applied to mitigate this risk.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^112Sh4jv]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

We recognize some strengths and limitations of this study. First, we enrolled consecutive patients in whom the attending clinician suspected acute coronary syndrome by embedding our screening tool into the electronic health care system, avoiding selection bias and ensuring that our study population was representative. Second, all diagnoses were adjudicated according to the Fourth Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction, ensuring that our findings are relevant to contemporary practice. Although few patients had missing troponin values for the evaluation of rule-in thresholds (0.1%), serial testing was performed at the discretion of the attending clinician and was performed in only 53% of patients with myocardial injury or infarction.

It is likely that those patients undergoing serial testing differed from those who had a single test performed. However, our comparison between patients with type 1 and type 2 myocardial infarction and those with myocardial injury was limited to the subgroup of patients with two or more tests performed within 12 hours of presentation. Cardiac troponin was measured with a single high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assay, and we recognize that the performance of rule-in thresholds for myocardial infarction is likely to differ for other assays. Lastly, the approach to patient selection for cardiac troponin testing will vary across health care systems, and we recommend some caution in extrapolating the performance of rule-in thresholds to sites where testing is performed more widely.

### High-sensitivity troponin zones: An alternative approach to clinical decisions [^113wygFf]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity troponin test results span a wide range of clinical values, from 5000 ng/L.

- **Discussion**: At the low end of the spectrum (≤ 100 ng/L for most assays), there are several domains with unique decision points based on thresholds derived from validation studies. Thus, we propose a novel Trop-Zone approach as an evidence-based and user-friendly guide to clinical decision-making within these domains.

- **Conclusion**: In this review, we aim to provide a concise summary of recent guidelines, describe the impact of validation studies, and propose a novel "Trop-Zone" approach that we believe is simpler than existing flowcharts.

### An algorithm for rule-in and rule-out of acute myocardial infarction using a novel troponin I assay [^115nScBg]. Heart (2017). Low credibility.

To derive and validate a hybrid algorithm for the rule-out and rule-in of acute myocardial infarction based on measurements at presentation and after 2 hours with a novel cardiac troponin I (cTnI) assay, the study utilized the following methods:

- **Methods**: The algorithm was derived and validated in two cohorts (605 and 592 patients) from multicentre studies enrolling chest pain patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with the onset of the last episode within 12 hours. The index diagnosis and cardiovascular events up to 30 days were adjudicated by independent reviewers.

- **Results**: In the validation cohort, 32.6% of the patients were ruled out on ED presentation, 6.1% were ruled in, and 61.3% remained undetermined. A further 22% could be ruled out and 9.8% ruled in, after 2 hours. In total, 54.6% of the patients were ruled out with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.4% (95% CI 97.8% to 99.9%) and a sensitivity of 97.7% (95% CI 91.9% to 99.7%); 15.8% were ruled in with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 74.5% (95% CI 64.8% to 82.2%) and a specificity of 95.2% (95% CI 93.0% to 96.9%). Additionally, 29.6% remained undetermined after 2 hours. No patient in the rule-out group died during the 30-day follow-up in the two cohorts.

- **Conclusions**: This novel two-step algorithm based on cTnI measurements enabled just over a third of the patients with acute chest pain to be ruled in or ruled out already at presentation and an additional third after 2 hours. This strategy maximizes the speed of rule-out and rule-in while maintaining a high NPV and PPV, respectively.

### Effectiveness and safety of the ESC-TROP (European Society of Cardiology 0h/1h Troponin Rule-Out Protocol) trial [^114nPpBn]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). High credibility.

Second, the ESC guidelines recommend using the 0h/1h algorithm together with patient history and ECG, and this is the first study to evaluate a standardized combination in clinical practice. The combined evaluation was highly reproducible and both safe and effective. In the present study, we also recommended no further noninvasive testing in low-risk patients because observational studies have shown that the addition of clinical findings and ECG to the 0h/1h protocol can identify patients with a very low risk of ACS. There have been no prior studies that have evaluated a strategy of refraining from noninvasive testing in patients identified as low risk using the 0h/1h protocol. Consequently, the ESC guidelines state that such testing should be considered in this group.

Use of noninvasive testing in low-risk patients is controversial. Previous American Heart Association guidelines recommended stress testing within 72 hours in low-risk patients with chest pain, while the most recent American Heart Association guidelines state that there is no evidence that noninvasive testing within 30 days improves outcomes. Our results support that noninvasive testing in low-risk patients is of little value and is consistent with what has been previously published. Among the 3,142 low-risk patients discharged, only two had a 30-day event consisting of a patient diagnosed with a type 2 AMI and one patient who died of pneumonia. Of those who underwent noninvasive testing during the initial ED stay or as outpatients, few had a positive test, and most were false positives that led to subsequent unnecessary procedures.

### Implications of lowering threshold of plasma troponin concentration in diagnosis of myocardial infarction: Cohort study [^116qRCaD]. BMJ (2012). Low credibility.

To assess the relation between troponin concentration, assay precision, and clinical outcomes in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, a cohort study was conducted at a tertiary center in Scotland. The study involved 2092 consecutive patients admitted with suspected acute coronary syndrome. These patients were stratified using a sensitive troponin I assay into three groups: < 0.012 µg/L, 0.012–0.049 µg/L, and ≥ 0.050 µg/L based on the 99th centile for troponin concentration (0.012 µg/L; coefficient of variation 20.8%) and the diagnostic threshold (0.050 µg/L; 7.2%).

- **Main outcome measure**: One-year survival without events (reMyocardial infarction, death) in patients grouped by troponin concentration.

- **Results**: Troponin I concentrations were < 0.012 µg/L in 988 patients (47%), 0.012–0.049 µg/L in 352 patients (17%), and ≥ 0.050 µg/L in 752 patients (36%). Adoption of the 99th centile would increase the number of people receiving a diagnosis of myocardial infarction from 752 to 1104, representing a relative increase of 47%. After one year, patients with troponin concentrations of 0.012–0.049 µg/L were more likely to be dead or readmitted with reMyocardial infarction than those with troponin concentrations < 0.012 µg/L (13% vs. 3%, P < 0.001; odds ratio 4.7, 95% confidence interval 2.9 to 7.9). Compared with troponin ≥ 0.050 µg/L, patients with troponin 0.012–0.049 µg/L had a higher risk profile but were less likely to have a diagnosis of, or be investigated and treated for, acute coronary syndrome.

Lowering the diagnostic threshold to the 99th centile and accepting greater assay imp…

### Convalescent troponin and cardiovascular death following acute coronary syndrome [^115aGetH]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Taken alongside these reports, our study has important clinical implications regarding the measurement of troponin following an acute coronary syndrome. The American Heart Association estimates that 720,000 individuals within the United States alone will experience a first fatal or non-fatal myocardial infarction during 2018. A further 335,000 will have a recurrent event. This sizeable residual risk persists despite major therapeutic advances, including potent preventative therapies and early revascularization. Improving long-term outcomes in a cost-effective manner will require improved therapeutic targeting.

Within this context, troponin testing is inexpensive and already widely available in clinical practice. In the face of resource constraints, troponin concentrations could be used to guide the use of more costly investigations and in targeting treatments at the subgroup of patients identified to be at greatest risk of adverse events. We have shown that troponin concentrations increase as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) declines, and identifying this pattern could prompt clinicians to reassess cardiac function and encourage uptitration of risk-modifying drugs such as inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. Likewise, the relationship between increasing blood pressure and troponin reinforces the importance of optimization of blood pressure-lowering therapies.

Finally, troponin-guided care may have particular relevance when considering the appropriate use of novel therapeutic agents such as inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin–kexin type 9 and the anti-inflammatory drug canakinumab. Accurate risk stratification will be essential for optimal clinical decision-making.

### Convalescent troponin and cardiovascular death following acute coronary syndrome [^111fHGff]. Heart (2019). High credibility.

High-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing is used in the diagnosis of acute coronary syndromes, but its role during convalescence is unknown. We investigated the long-term prognostic significance of serial convalescent high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations following acute coronary syndrome.

- **Methods**: In a prospective multicentre observational cohort study of 2,140 patients with acute coronary syndrome, cardiac troponin I concentrations were measured in 1,776 patients at 4 and 12 months following the index event. Patients were stratified into three groups according to the troponin concentration at 4 months using the 99th centile (women > 16 ng/L, men > 34 ng/L) and median concentration of those within the reference range. The primary outcome was cardiovascular death.

- **Results**: Troponin concentrations at 4 months were measurable in 99.0% (1,759/1,776) of patients (67 ± 12 years, 72% male), and were ≤ 5 ng/L (median) and > 99th centile in 44.8% (795) and 9.3% (166), respectively. There were 202 (11.4%) cardiovascular deaths following a median of 4.8 years. After adjusting for the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events score, troponin remained an independent predictor of cardiovascular death (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3 to 1.5 per doubling) with the highest risk observed in those with increasing concentrations at 12 months. Patients with 4-month troponin concentrations > 99th centile were at increased risk of cardiovascular death compared with those ≤ 5 ng/L (29.5% (49/166) vs 4.3% (34/795); adjusted HR 4.9, 95% CI 3.8 to 23.7).

Convalescent cardiac troponin concentrations play a critical role in understanding cardiovascular death risk following acute coronary syndrome.

### Patient selection for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing and diagnosis of myocardial infarction: Prospective cohort study [^1117aNRB]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

High sensitivity cardiac troponin assays are now being introduced worldwide, with the exception of the US where they have only recently been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Although cardiac troponin testing in undifferentiated patients may be justified when myocardial infarction is a possibility, it is important that clinicians are aware that elevated cardiac troponin concentrations are not exclusive to type 1 myocardial infarction.

Implementation of high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing should be accompanied by education of clinicians to guide patient selection and the interpretation of elevated troponin concentrations, and testing should be incorporated into evidence-based pathways. If implemented without adoption of a considered approach, high sensitivity cardiac troponin assays may increase diagnostic uncertainty and increase the need for further invasive and non-invasive cardiac investigations with cost implications for the healthcare system.

In the UK, where the approach to investigation is more conservative, we observed that troponin testing was performed in patients with a higher pre-test probability of myocardial infarction, and the positive predictive value of high sensitivity cardiac troponin was higher than in the US. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the positive predictive value across both populations was highest in patients with chest pain, myocardial ischaemia on the electrocardiogram, or known ischaemic heart disease, reflecting the higher prevalence of myocardial infarction in patients with these features.

### Cardiac troponin assays with improved analytical quality: A trade-off between enhanced diagnostic performance and reduced long-term prognostic value [^113L2924]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

According to recommendations, patients are eligible for early discharge or further investigations for ACS based on the troponin results. The algorithms encompass an initial review of the admission sample in patients who present more than 3 hours after symptom onset. If the concentration is below the LOD of the troponin assay, the patient is eligible for "rule-out" and may be discharged if the electrocardiogram and/or the clinical symptoms suggest a lower likelihood of ACS. The remaining patients undergo serial sampling at 1-hour intervals. Based on the baseline and delta values obtained, patient status is established as "rule-out", "observation", or "rule-in" for NSTEMI. Again, ruled-out patients may be discharged if the clinical suspicion of ACS is low; those who are ruled in may go directly to cardiac angiography and eventually invasive treatment, and those in the observation group undergo diagnostic follow-up.

We compared the recommended ESC (cTnT and cTnI (Abbott)) algorithms and those suggested by Body et al. and Neumann et al. to the novel algorithms described in Tables 1 and 2.

- **Table 1**: Single sample rule-out of NSTEMI

- **Table 2**: Serial 0/1 hour algorithms for rule-out and rule-in of NSTEMI

The novel cTnI (sgx) rule-out algorithms were defined based on the following hierarchy of criteria: diagnostic sensitivity for NSTEMI ≥ 99.0%, as previously described, and the maximum possible specificity. Sensitivity was preferred over negative predictive value as the criterion because sensitivity is independent.

### Troponin in early presenters to rule out myocardial infarction [^111en2fF]. European Heart Journal (2023). High credibility.

Are we now able to rule out myocardial infarction at presentation in patients with very recent onset symptoms if cardiac troponin I levels are undetectable? There are several considerations. First, our findings are only applicable to the high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I assays tested here, and additional data are needed in similarly large cohorts to determine whether the same approach could be applied for other assays. In contrast to cardiac troponin I, for cardiac troponin T, the guideline-recommended rule-out threshold of 5 ng/L is based on the limit of detection, and on most platforms, the assay is not able to measure troponin below this threshold.

Second, we demonstrate heterogeneity in the sensitivity and negative predictive value of a threshold of 2 ng/L in sub-groups of patients who presented within 3 hours of symptom onset. In particular, the negative predictive value was less than 99% in those with known ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and renal impairment, although this may in part reflect the extremely small number of patients with these conditions who have undetectable values. This variation was not seen in patients presenting at later time points, suggesting that these factors influence the release kinetics of cardiac troponin or the perception of the onset of symptoms. Further research on the kinetics of cardiac troponin in patients with these conditions is required, and clinicians should exercise caution and clinical judgment when applying the limit of detection to rule out those who present early.

Third, our findings are not applicable to patients.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: Evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^113GPby9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

While the new assays can provide more accurate, rapid detection of myocardial necrosis, they do not indicate the cause of cell death. Improved assay performance must be accompanied by enhanced clinical evaluation of patients to effectively interpret the results and apply them in clinical practice. The universal definition of myocardial infarction was a broad consensus developed by representatives from the American College of Cardiology Foundation, European Society of Cardiology, American Heart Association, and World Heart Federation that provided increased structure and clarity around the diagnosis of myocardial infarction in the era of a troponin gold standard. Importantly, it firmly established the importance of clinical symptoms in conjunction with elevated troponin levels occurring with a characteristic rise and/or fall to establish type 1 myocardial infarction. It also allowed for diagnosis in the context of sudden cardiac death, as well as enhanced categorization for periprocedural myocardial infarctions. As the sensitivity and precision of troponin assays have improved, false-positive results due to assay imprecision are becoming less problematic. However, the pressure on clinical perspective in the interpretation of positive troponin results has increased, given that a positive troponin assay generates a large differential diagnosis.

### Comparison of the efficacy and safety of early rule-out pathways for acute myocardial infarction [^117RsnDP]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

The latest ESC guidelines have introduced a 1-hour pathway that incorporates a risk stratification step using high-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations within the reference range. This approach shows promise and has been validated with both high-sensitivity troponin I and high-sensitivity troponin T assays, with a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.6% (95% CI, 98.4–100) and 99.1% (95% CI, 98.2–99.7), respectively. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have directly compared pathways that use a risk stratification step with low cardiac troponin concentrations with those based exclusively on the 99th centile. Further studies are needed to compare the efficacy and safety of retesting at 1 and 3 hours in pathways that incorporate a risk stratification threshold.

One of the limitations of these studies, including our own, is that they are observational in nature and enroll selected patients rather than all consecutive patients. Indeed, because no patients were discharged on the basis of pathway decisions, the true efficacy and safety of this approach are unknown. The ESC pathway recommends repeat testing in patients who present within 6 hours of symptom onset. Although the inclusion of patients who present early is a strength of our study, fewer patients may be ruled out at presentation by the ESC pathway as a consequence. At present, clinicians do not have evidence from prospective randomized controlled trials to inform their practice. Therefore, we are conducting a multicenter, stepped-wedge, cluster randomized trial to determine the efficacy and safety of our pathway.

### Troponin in early presenters to rule out myocardial infarction [^1119F6zd]. European Heart Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Establishing and accurately recording the exact time of symptom onset for myocardial infarction is challenging, particularly among patient groups who may experience atypical symptoms or cases where symptoms remit or relapse. Several limitations merit consideration. First, we relied on the attending clinician to accurately record the time from symptom onset based on patient history when requesting cardiac troponin. No guidance on what constituted symptom onset was provided, leaving it to clinician judgment. While this method reflects clinical practice, it likely introduced variation in symptom onset recording and misclassification. However, our findings were validated in an external cohort where symptom onset time was standardized and recorded by researchers directly from the patient at enrollment.

Second, we lack detailed information on symptom course and are unable to assess safety in patients with recurrent chest pain. Third, we recorded the time from symptom onset to testing at hourly intervals, with all presentations beyond 12 hours being recorded as > 12 h. This limits our ability to evaluate shorter time intervals and performance in those presenting beyond 12 hours from symptom onset. This also introduces a degree of inaccuracy and potential misclassification in cases where symptom onset lay between integers; we do not know how such cases have been classified by clinicians.

To address these limitations, we evaluated three methods by which the time from…

### Cardiac troponin assays with improved analytical quality: A trade-off between enhanced diagnostic performance and reduced long-term prognostic value [^111oaa2t]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Clinical suspicion of non–ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is a frequent cause of hospital admission, and cardiac troponin (cTn, T, or I) measurement is a cornerstone in the evaluation of these patients. Approximately 40% of patients are "early presenters", and accurate detection of low cTn concentrations for immediate rule‐out of NSTEMI may therefore have clinical utility. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) recommends that patients with a detectable baseline cTn concentration undergo serial testing. Based on the baseline and delta concentrations obtained, such cases can be classified as rule‐out, observation, or rule‐in for NSTEMI.

A few limitations apply when troponin‐based algorithms are used for rule‐out of NSTEMI, for example, the suboptimal analytical sensitivity (unavailability to provide measurable concentrations in all healthy individuals) and large analytical imprecision (reproducibility of sequential measurements) at low troponin concentrations. This could produce a false low delta value leading to an inappropriate rule‐out. Improved analytical sensitivity and precision of these assays might facilitate algorithms with higher specificity, allowing for admission rule‐out in all individuals with low concentrations regardless of the time from symptom onset, and greater reliability of deltas allowing for rule‐out in subjects with high normal or increased baseline concentrations.

### Understanding cardiac troponin part 2: Early rule out of acute coronary syndrome [^111BXisW]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

Chest pain of suspected cardiac origin is a very common emergency department presentation. Over the past decade, there has been an exponential growth in strategies that promote blood sampling at earlier and earlier time points after presentation to facilitate the rule-out of acute coronary syndrome. In part 2 of this series, we examine key concepts from the recent literature with the aim of improving clinicians' understanding of the rule-out strategies available to them and provide a structured overview of strategies that facilitate discharge with blood testing in less than three hours.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^113ugqw9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Use of high‐sensitivity assays and potential challenges

Based on their analytic capabilities, high‐sensitivity assays offer several advantages over their conventional assay counterparts. As previously mentioned, they are extremely sensitive, perhaps allowing for earlier and faster recognition of myocardial infarction (MI) patients, giving clinicians an avenue to diagnose and treat patients more quickly. The new assays are also precise, having small coefficient of variation (CV) levels even at the 99th percentile in reference populations. They are specific for myocardial necrosis, although this topic is controversial.

There are conflicting opinions on the specificity of troponin for myocyte infarction versus ischemia. In brief, there are limited data in the setting of stress tests, during which standard‐sensitivity troponin assays are static, while high‐sensitivity assays detect a small rise in troponin. In addition, experimental models of ischemia, achieved by pacing patients from the coronary sinus, have shown a low‐level elevation in troponin appreciated only with high‐sensitivity troponin assays. Some authors have interpreted similar findings as consistent with ischemia; however, it has also been argued that high‐sensitivity assays are detecting minute levels of myocyte necrosis (thus, minuscule MIs).

In addition, there are several proposed mechanisms of troponin release that are not related to necrosis, namely apoptosis, cellular release of proteolytic products, increased cell wall permeability with stress or stretch, and the production of membranous blebs that contain troponin. Despite the controversy, the potential for high-sensitivity assays to detect early changes in troponin levels remains an area of active investigation.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^116PpnmW]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

In consecutive patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, we evaluated whether troponin concentrations at presentation or their kinetics differed sufficiently to discriminate between myocardial injury and infarction. We report a number of observations that are relevant to practice.

- **Troponin concentrations**: At presentation, troponin concentrations are similar in patients with myocardial injury and those with infarction, regardless of the diagnostic classification.
- **Recommended rule-in thresholds**: The use of thresholds above the 99th percentile provides only marginal improvements in the positive predictive value (PPV) and specificity for type 1 myocardial infarction. Troponin thresholds greater than 1000 ng/L would be required to achieve a PPV of ≥ 75%.
- **Magnitude and rate of change in troponin**: The magnitude and rate of change of troponin can help differentiate type 1 from type 2 myocardial infarction and acute or chronic myocardial injury.

Although we observed important differences in troponin kinetics, the troponin concentration at presentation provides only limited discrimination between type 1 myocardial infarction and other causes of myocardial injury or infarction. Clinical context may be more helpful than any given rule-in threshold to guide the triage and initial management of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in practice.

### Pros and cons of high-sensitivity assays for cardiac troponin [^112GrQ3Z]. Nature Reviews Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

A 3-hour algorithm using high-sensitivity assays for cardiac troponin to rule out myocardial infarction (MI) is recommended in ESC guidelines. Whether faster rule-out algorithms can discriminate between MI and other conditions that elevate the troponin level, or be safely implemented across the whole spectrum of patient risk, is unclear.

### High-sensitivity troponin and the application of risk stratification thresholds in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^1168fhNh]. Circulation (2019). Low credibility.

The clinical perspective of cardiac troponin testing is rapidly evolving alongside significant improvements in assay precision and sensitivity. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays are essential not only for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction but also increasingly for assessing cardiovascular risk. This helps identify patients in the emergency department who are at low risk and could be discharged directly. Given that fewer than 10% of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome experience myocardial infarction, the use of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing holds significant potential to reduce unnecessary hospital admissions, benefiting both patients and healthcare providers.

Although the universal definition of myocardial infarction recommends using sex-specific 99th percentile or upper reference limits from a normal reference population as the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction, there is less consensus on the optimal troponin threshold for evaluating cardiovascular risk. The ideal risk stratification threshold would classify the greatest number of patients without myocardial infarction as low risk without compromising safety. The limit of detection has been proposed; however, assay performance at this level is variable, which may reduce the consistency and effectiveness of this approach. We previously defined the optimal risk stratification threshold as the highest troponin concentration that gave a negative predictive value for myocardial infarction or cardiac death at 30 days.

### Implementation of a sensitive troponin I assay and risk of recurrent myocardial infarction and death in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome [^111cqPqe]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

Although troponin assays have become increasingly more sensitive, it is unclear whether further reductions in the threshold of detection for plasma troponin concentrations will improve clinical outcomes in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

- **Objective**: To determine whether lowering the diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction (MI) with a sensitive troponin assay could improve clinical outcomes.

- **Design, setting, and patients**: All consecutive patients admitted with suspected ACS to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, before (n = 1038; February 1 - July 31, 2008, during the validation phase) and after (n = 1054; February 1 - July 31, 2009, during the implementation phase) lowering the threshold of detection for myocardial necrosis from 0.20 to 0.05 ng/mL with a sensitive troponin I assay were stratified into 3 groups (< 0.05 ng/mL, 0.05–0.19 ng/mL, and ≥ 0.20 ng/mL). During the validation phase, only concentrations above the original diagnostic threshold of 0.20 ng/mL were reported to clinicians.

- **Main outcome measure**: Event-free survival (reMI and death) at 1 year in patients grouped by plasma troponin concentrations.

- **Results**: Plasma troponin concentrations were less than 0.05 ng/mL in 1340 patients (64%), 0.05 to 0.19 ng/mL in 170 patients (8%), and 0.20 ng/mL or more in 582 patients (28%). During the validation phase, 39% of patients with plasma troponin concentrations of 0.05 to 0.19 ng/mL were dead or had reMI at 1 year compared with 7% and 24% of those patients with troponin concentrations of less than 0.05 ng/mL and 0.20 ng/mL or more, respectively.

### Acute coronary syndromes. The diagnostic role of troponins [^113MMiGF]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes (ACSs) represent the acute life-threatening phases of coronary heart disease. Clinical symptoms, EKG, and CK-MB measurements are frequently insufficient to evaluate patients without persisting ST elevations. Serial determinations of troponin T or troponin I after arrival in hospital disclose minor myocardial injury in patients presenting as unstable angina. This finding allows the currently best risk stratification and may contribute to cost-effectiveness. Without elevated troponins, the risk for death or myocardial infarction during 30 days follow-up is not more than 1%. The lack of elevated troponins does not imply that these patients do not have coronary artery disease. Patients with positive evidence of troponins represent a high-risk group who should be hospitalized and further evaluated because the risk for myocardial infarction and death in 30 days is approximately 20%. Studies indicate that early revascularization under glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists represents the optimal treatment.

### Patient selection for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing and diagnosis of myocardial infarction: prospective cohort study [^115HbdJA]. BMJ (2017). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to evaluate how the selection of patients for high sensitivity cardiac troponin testing affects the diagnosis of myocardial infarction across different healthcare settings. This was a prospective study of three independent consecutive patient populations presenting to emergency departments.

The setting included secondary and tertiary care hospitals in the United Kingdom and the United States. High sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations were measured in 8,500 consecutive patients presenting to emergency departments: unselected patients in the UK (n = 1,054) and two selected populations of patients in whom troponin testing was requested by the attending clinician in the UK (n = 5,815) and the US (n = 1,631). The final diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction or myocardial injury was independently adjudicated.

The main outcome measures included the positive predictive value of an elevated cardiac troponin concentration for a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction. Results showed that cardiac troponin concentrations were elevated in 13.7% (144/1,054) of unselected patients, with a prevalence of 1.6% (17/1,054) for type 1 myocardial infarction and a positive predictive value of 11.8% (95% confidence interval 7.0% to 18.2%). In selected patients, in whom troponin testing was guided by the attending clinician, the prevalence and positive predictive value were 14.5% (843/5,815) and 59.7% (57.0% to 62.2%) in the UK and 4.2% (68/1,631) and 16.4% (13.0% to 20.3%) in the US. Across both selected patient populations, the positive predictive value was highest in patients with chest pain, with ischaemia on the e.

### Timing of peak troponin T and creatine kinase-MB elevations after percutaneous coronary intervention [^1125B3sE]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

The prognostic significance of elevations in creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB) and troponin T (cTnT), conventionally measured 6 to 8 hours after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), has been established. However, the time to peak biomarker appearance in the circulation has not been defined. This pilot study aims to address this gap.

- **Design**: A nonrandomized, nonconsecutive patient cohort.
- **Setting**: Clinical practice at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.
- **Patients**: A cohort of 57 patients undergoing elective PCI.
- **Interventions**: Measurements of cTnT and CK-MB were taken at baseline, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, and greater than or equal to 12 hours (mean ± SEM, 18 ± 5 hours) post-PCI.
- **Measurements and results**: Postprocedure cTnT elevations were detected in 30 of 57 patients (53%). Of these, 4 of 30 patients (13%) had peak cTnT at 4 hours (0.80 ± 0.40 ng/mL), 5 of 30 patients (17%) at 8 hours (1.07 ± 0.48 ng/mL), and 21 of 30 patients (70%) had peak cTnT at ≥ 12 hours (0.21 ± 0.06 ng/mL); 22 of 30 patients received abciximab. CK-MB elevations occurred in 14 of 57 patients (25%). Of these, 3 of 14 patients (21%) demonstrated peak CK-MB at 2 hours (18.5 ± 7.9 ng/mL), and the remainder (11 of 14 patients, 79%) reached peak during the 12- to 20-hour interval (20.2 ± 4.4 ng/mL); 12 of 14 patients received abciximab.

In conclusion, more cTnT than CK-MB elevations occur after PCI; however, both biomarkers exhibit a longer time to peak value than anticipated in clinical practice. Early surveillance monitoring (less than 12 hours) does not detect peak biomarker levels, particularly in patients with normal baseline values.

### Troponins in acute coronary syndromes [^115zAaqw]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponins have replaced creatine kinase-MB as the preferred biomarker for establishing the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (MI). Expert recommendations set the diagnostic decision-limit for each assay at the 99th percentile of troponin levels in an apparently healthy reference population, which, due to a lack of standardization, will vary depending upon the manufacturer. Among patients presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), even low-level elevations of cardiac troponin T or I correlate with a higher risk of death and re-ischemic events compared to patients with levels of troponin below the decision limit.

Renal failure does not appear to diminish the prognostic value of troponins among patients with a high clinical probability of ACS. Moreover, patients with elevated levels of troponin derive the most benefit from more intense medical therapy with antithrombin and antiplatelet medications, as well as an early invasive management strategy. Whereas cardiac troponins are extremely specific for myocardial necrosis, they do not discriminate between ischemic and non-ischemic etiologies of myocardial injury. Clinicians must, therefore, determine whether a patient's presenting symptoms are consistent with ACS. Combining troponin with other cardiac biomarkers may offer complementary information on the underlying pathobiology and prognosis in an individual patient.

Future generations of troponin assays may detect specific post-translational modifications of troponins that may increase the analytic sensitivity for myocardial damage and offer insight into the t…

### Serial changes in highly sensitive troponin I assay and early diagnosis of myocardial infarction [^116ahwDc]. JAMA (2011). Low credibility.

The introduction of highly sensitive troponin assays into clinical practice has substantially improved the evaluation of patients with chest pain.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of a highly sensitive troponin I (hsTnI) assay compared with a contemporary troponin I (cTnI) assay and their serial changes in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).

- **Design, setting, and patients**: A total of 1,818 patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome were consecutively enrolled at the chest pain units of the University Heart Center Hamburg, the University Medical Center Mainz, and the Federal Armed Forces Hospital Koblenz, all in Germany, from 2007 to 2008. Twelve biomarkers, including hsTnI (level of detection, 3.4 pg/mL) and cTnI (level of detection, 10 pg/mL), were measured on admission and after 3 and 6 hours.

- **Main outcome measures**: Diagnostic performance for AMI of baseline and serial changes in hsTnI and cTnI results at 3 hours after admission to the emergency department.

- **Results**: Of the 1,818 patients, 413 (22.7%) were diagnosed as having AMI. For discrimination of AMI, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95–0.97) for hsTnI on admission and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.90–0.94) for cTnI on admission. Both were superior to the other evaluated diagnostic biomarkers. The use of hsTnI at admission (with the diagnostic cutoff value at the 99th percentile of 30 pg/mL) had a sensitivity of 82.3% and a negative predictive value (for ruling out AMI) of 94.7%.

### Convalescent troponin and cardiovascular death following acute coronary syndrome [^1161gimw]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

Our findings have clear potential to improve follow-up and management of patients discharged following acute coronary syndrome. We have shown that a single measurement of cardiac troponin during convalescence from an acute coronary syndrome can identify nearly half of patients as low-risk, with a 0.5% annual incidence of cardiovascular death. A further 1 in 10 patients have persistent myocardial injury and are identified as very high risk, with annual event rates approaching 10%, for whom careful assessment and more intensive treatment may be warranted. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that for those at intermediate risk, repeated measurement of cardiac troponin concentrations at 12 months can be used to improve risk estimation and enable prognostic reclassification into either low-risk or high-risk groups.

Convalescent troponin concentrations are not simply a surrogate for the extent of myocardial injury sustained during the index coronary event, as evidenced by the weak correlation between peak troponin during the index hospitalisation and 4-month troponin concentrations. Neither are they merely a reflection of left ventricular function. Instead, they provide greater prognostic information than either of these traditional risk indicators and are additive to all other clinical, biochemical, and echocardiographic risk factors that might typically be available to clinicians when making treatment decisions. Furthermore, within this real-world observational study, we have revealed a substantial treatment gap whereby less than half of patients with troponin concentrations > 99th centile received appropriate follow-up treatment.

### Point-of-care testing with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays: The challenges and opportunities [^114Swbqg]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Methods to improve the safety, accuracy, and efficiency of assessing patients with suspected acute coronary symptoms have occupied decades of study and have supported significant changes in clinical practice. Much of the progress is reliant on results of laboratory-based high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays that can detect low concentrations with high precision. Until recently, point-of-care (POC) platforms were unable to perform with similar analytical precision as laboratory-based assays, and recommendations for their use in accelerated assessment strategies for patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome have been limited.

As POC assays can provide troponin results within 20 minutes and can be used proximate to patient care, improvements in the efficiency of assessing patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome are possible, particularly with new high-sensitivity assays.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^112ghpcL]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

In recent years, several approaches have been proposed to enable clinicians to use cardiac troponin more flexibly. These approaches acknowledge the limitations of applying fixed thresholds to triage a heterogeneous population of patients and the challenges of performing serial testing at precise intervals in clinical practice. The Troponin Only–Manchester Acute Coronary Syndrome rule employs logistic regression to provide individual patient risk estimates for non–ST-segment–elevation myocardial infarction by incorporating age, sex, clinical variables, and a measure of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T at presentation. This rule performs well but does not discriminate type 1 myocardial infarction from other causes of troponin elevation or take into account serial testing.

In a collaborative analysis that pooled data from multiple cohorts, the COMPASS-MI (Calculation of Myocardial Infarction Risk Probabilities to Manage Patients With Suspicion of Myocardial Infarction) investigators highlight that a more flexible approach is needed and demonstrate proof of concept that the negative predictive value and positive predictive value for type 1 myocardial infarction vary across a range of thresholds and delta changes in troponin values. Finally, the myocardial ischemic injury index utilizes a gradient-boosting machine learning algorithm to combine age, sex, and paired high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I values to compute a value (0–100) that reflects the likelihood of type 1 myocardial infarction for an individual patient. Serial testing can be performed at any time point, and the algorithm incorporates this flexibility.

### Timing of preoperative troponin elevations and postoperative mortality after noncardiac surgery [^1118xpSW]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2016). Low credibility.

Even small elevations in preoperative troponin levels have been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes. However, there are currently limited data on the relationship between troponin increase and the timing of surgery.

- **Methods**: We performed a single-institution, retrospective cohort study of 6,030 individuals with a troponin measurement made during the 30 days preceding a noncardiac surgical procedure. Subjects with detectable troponin levels were separated into terciles based on both the magnitude of the value and the time elapsed between this value and the surgery. For those undergoing nonemergent procedures, these nine cohorts were compared with the group of individuals with undetectable preoperative troponin levels using bivariable and multivariable logistic regression.

- **Results**: Thirty-day mortality was 4.7% in the group with undetectable troponin levels and increased with higher concentrations, with rates of 8.9%, 12.7%, and 12.7% in the low, medium, and high tercile groups, respectively. Unadjusted risk of 30-day mortality was highest in those with the highest troponin levels and shortest duration between the measurement and surgery (odds ratio, 4.497; 95% confidence interval, 2.058–9.825). After adjusting for subject characteristics, troponin remained associated with 30-day mortality in several groups, including individuals with troponin levels in the normal range.

- **Conclusions**: Higher levels of preoperative cardiac troponin I were associated with higher postoperative mortality, and a longer time to surgery appeared to reduce this risk for individuals.

### Convalescent troponin and cardiovascular death following acute coronary syndrome [^117Kviqb]. Heart (2019). Low credibility.

In the assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome, international guidelines recommend serial measurement of cardiac troponin in accordance with the universal definition of myocardial infarction. In this acute context, increased troponin concentrations above the 99th centile reference limit have consistently demonstrated a correlation between infarct size and subsequent prognosis. Recently approved high-sensitivity troponin assays have also revealed a gradient of risk associated with concentrations below the diagnostic threshold at the time of initial presentation. However, no guidance is offered on measuring troponin once a diagnosis is established, and long-term risk stratification following hospital discharge is largely dependent on left ventricular function and the presence of residual inducible ischaemia.

Despite the widely accepted view that troponin concentrations typically return to baseline levels within 2 weeks, the exact time course of resolution of cardiac troponin following myocardial infarction remains unclear, and several reports have described persistent elevations up to 7 weeks following initial presentation. Plausible contributory mechanisms include delayed healing of the ruptured plaque, persistent left ventricular dysfunction, or asymptomatic ischaemia.

There is now emerging evidence from post-hoc analysis of clinical trial populations that increased troponin concentrations during the early and intermediate post-myocardial infarction period confer greater risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^115RRzAg]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Although the 99th percentile is the recommended diagnostic threshold for myocardial infarction, some guidelines also advocate the use of higher troponin thresholds to rule in myocardial infarction at presentation. It is unclear whether the magnitude or change in troponin concentration can differentiate causes of myocardial injury and infarction in practice.

- **Methods**: In a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized controlled trial, we identified 46,092 consecutive patients presenting with suspected acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I concentrations at presentation and on serial testing were compared between patients with myocardial injury and infarction. The positive predictive value and specificity were determined at the sex-specific 99th percentile upper reference limit and rule-in thresholds of 64 ng/L and 5-fold of the upper reference limit for a diagnosis of type 1 myocardial infarction.

- **Results**: Troponin was above the 99th percentile in 8,188 patients (18%). The diagnosis was type 1 or type 2 myocardial infarction in 50% and 14%, and acute or chronic myocardial injury in 20% and 16%, respectively. Troponin concentrations were similar at presentation in type 1 (median [25th-75th percentile] 91 [30–493] ng/L) and type 2 (50 [22–147] ng/L) myocardial infarction, and in acute (50 [26–134] ng/L) and chronic (51 [31–130] ng/L) myocardial injury. The 99th percentile and rule-in thresholds of 64 ng/L and 5-fold upper reference limit gave a positive predictive value of 57% (95% CI, 56%-58%).

### New features of troponin testing in different clinical settings [^114RtLDP]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Cardiac troponin levels are routinely measured for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction. These measurements also provide information concerning prognosis and the effect of early intervention in patients with acute coronary syndromes. The recent development of highly sensitive cardiac troponin assays permits detection of very low circulating levels. The use of sensitive troponin assays improves overall diagnostic accuracy in patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes and provides strong prognostic information in stable coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure.

However, increased sensitivity comes with a cost of decreased specificity. Serial testing, as well as clinical context and judgment, are likely to become increasingly important in the interpretation of troponin assay results.

### Troponin: Think before you request one [^113jzvz6]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Acute myocardial infarction (ACS) is one of the most common presentations in acute hospital settings. Troponin (cTn) has emerged as one of the most sensitive biochemical markers for the diagnosis of ACS. However, if used inappropriately and in the absence of true clinical context, it can be elevated in a number of non-cardiac conditions and lead to false clinical diagnoses, inappropriate workups, and increased patient stays in hospitals. The cost of unnecessary clinical testing is another problematic aspect.

At Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport, one of the busiest district general hospitals in Wales, we retrospectively analyzed the nature of troponin requests over a random period of one week, specifically looking at the indications and final diagnostic impact. In many cases, it was found that requests were made without any clinical justification. One of the main, and probably unavoidable, reasons for this was that requests were made from triage before the patient was assessed by a clinician. However, steps were taken to clarify common clinical indications for suspected cardiac diagnosis in which troponin was useful. Additionally, the "tick box" practice for inappropriate laboratory investigations was discouraged. A repeat audit was conducted based on similar principles, and a measurable improvement was identified, with potential significant impact in the future.

### High-sensitivity troponin assays: Evidence, indications, and reasonable use [^1166z793]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

With advances in technology, a new era in troponin assays is approaching. Previous-generation troponin assays have been used as diagnostic and prognostic markers in acute coronary syndrome patients and for risk stratification to guide triage decisions and aid in treatment selection.

- **New, high-sensitivity troponin assays**: Represent an important advance with added sensitivity for cardiac myocyte necrosis, but there remains a need for judicious interpretation with these tests.

These new troponin assays could have several distinct roles in clinical practice:

1. Facilitation of earlier diagnosis and rule out of myocardial infarction (MI);
2. Risk stratification in acute cardiac conditions and prognostic information in stable disease states; and
3. Therapeutic monitoring and drug toxicity evaluation.

However, because they are not specific for the etiology of cardiac cell death, the clinician has an increasing responsibility to interpret each test in clinical context. When commercially available in the United States (US), these high-sensitivity analyses are expected to offer both advantages and disadvantages to practicing clinicians and to enhance the roles of the troponin assay, as well as to open doors to new uses for troponin testing. However, they will also create new challenges in clinical applications, epidemiology, and research. The aim of this review is to discuss the potential clinical and research roles of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin assays and the challenges they may create.

### Serial high-sensitivity troponin measurements for the rapid exclusion of acute myocardial infarction in low-risk patients [^1137jsXo]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

High-sensitivity troponin assays facilitate the rapid exclusion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, elevated results are also seen in other conditions causing myocardial injury. Serial measurements increase the specificity for AMI, helping to rapidly identify patients for whom revascularisation may be appropriate. In this study, we explore a strategy for rapidly excluding AMI in symptomatic patients using serial high-sensitivity troponin measurements.

- **Main findings**: (1) All patients presenting more than 3 hours after symptom onset with a negative result had a second negative result. (2) AMI was excluded in all patients with two results falling below the lower limit of detection of a standard troponin assay by 8 hours post-symptom onset.

### Cardiac troponin thresholds and kinetics to differentiate myocardial injury and myocardial infarction [^111FgAcf]. Circulation (2021). Low credibility.

Although we observed important differences in the kinetics, cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation are insufficient to distinguish type 1 myocardial infarction from other causes of myocardial injury or infarction in practice. Clinical context may be more helpful than any rule-in threshold for guiding initial triage and management decisions.

### High-sensitivity cardiac troponin concentrations at presentation in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^1169mUSK]. JAMA Cardiology (2020). Low credibility.

The introduction of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing into clinical practice has transformed the assessment of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department. Most patients can be discharged using accelerated diagnostic pathways that do not require hospital admission for peak cardiac troponin testing. These pathways are not recommended for patients with ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, but given that interpretation is dependent on experience, there is a risk patients could be inappropriately assessed.
