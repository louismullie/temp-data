## Question

EPS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about EPS, specifically what EPS stands for in this context and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which EPS meaning fits the provided references. Then, I should verify the most authoritative sources to anchor the definition. Next, I will consider alternative meanings that could be confused with the intended term. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically grounded definition with supporting citations.

> Let me first confirm the context. The documents repeatedly discuss electrophysiology studies in cardiology, including syncope, bradycardia, pre-excitation/WPW, and ventricular arrhythmias, which strongly suggests EPS here refers to an invasive cardiac electrophysiology study rather than, say, encapsulated postscript files or other non-cardiac acronyms [^00aff5e1] [^3f87df27] [^4307282b].

> I should verify the definition against high-credibility guidelines. The ACC/AHA/HRS syncope guideline defines EPS as an invasive, catheter-based procedure used to test the integrity of the cardiac conduction system and to assess inducibility of arrhythmias, and it details when EPS is and is not recommended in syncope evaluation, which aligns with the same usage across bradycardia and SVT/WPW guidance [^00aff5e1] [^3f87df27] [^4307282b].

> Wait, let me verify the scope so I don't overgeneralize. EPS in this context is used for diagnosing and risk-stratifying arrhythmias, including bradyarrhythmias and tachyarrhythmias, and it can be both diagnostic and therapeutic when combined with ablation; it is not a first-line test and is typically reserved for selected patients after noninvasive evaluation is inconclusive or when specific risk-stratification questions arise, such as in WPW or ischemic cardiomyopathy scenarios [^3f87df27] [^4307282b] [^52bbeb95].

> Hold on, I should consider alternative meanings to avoid ambiguity. Encapsulated PostScript (.eps) files appear in a different context entirely (FDA cigarette warning graphics), and there are unrelated uses of EPS in other fields, but none of those are relevant to the cardiology references provided here, reinforcing that the correct interpretation is electrophysiology study in this document set [^54c0ed80].

> Let me synthesize a precise definition. EPS stands for electrophysiology study, an invasive catheter-based cardiac procedure that evaluates conduction system function and inducibility of arrhythmias, used selectively in syncope, bradycardia/conduction disease, pre-excitation/WPW, and ventricular arrhythmia contexts to clarify diagnosis, guide therapy, or risk-stratify, with recommendations tailored by guideline-directed clinical scenarios and pretest probability [^00aff5e1] [^3f87df27] [^4307282b].

EPS stands for **electrophysiology study**, an invasive test that maps the heart's electrical system and induces arrhythmias to diagnose and treat rhythm disorders [^6c680851]. It is indicated for unexplained syncope with abnormal ECG or structural heart disease, suspected bradyarrhythmias or tachyarrhythmias, and pre-excitation syndromes such as WPW [^00aff5e1] [^3f87df27] [^4307282b]. EPS is not recommended for syncope with normal ECG and heart structure unless an arrhythmia is suspected [^bc58107d]. Risks include bleeding, infection, vascular injury, and rare serious complications; benefits include definitive diagnosis and potential curative ablation [^6c680851].

---

## Indications for EPS

EPS is indicated in specific clinical scenarios, including:

- **Unexplained syncope**: Especially with abnormal ECG or structural heart disease, to identify arrhythmic causes [^00aff5e1] [^00ad7730].
- **Suspected bradyarrhythmias**: Such as sinus node dysfunction or conduction system disease, when non-invasive tests are inconclusive [^3f87df27] [^52f4975b].
- **Suspected tachyarrhythmias**: Including supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome [^4307282b] [^891739ee].
- **Risk stratification**: For patients with certain conditions, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), and Brugada syndrome [^5f80eb94] [^42ede7a0].

---

## Contraindications and limitations

EPS is generally safe, but certain conditions may limit its use:

- **Normal ECG and normal cardiac structure**: EPS is not recommended for syncope evaluation in patients with a normal ECG and normal cardiac structure unless an arrhythmic etiology is suspected [^bc58107d] [^4fe7c6bf].
- **Limited diagnostic yield**: EPS has limited utility in patients with normal ECG and no structural heart disease, as the likelihood of identifying significant arrhythmias is low [^bc58107d] [^8b3e4482].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Severe coagulopathy, active infection, or inability to tolerate the procedure may preclude EPS.

---

## Procedure and techniques

EPS involves the following steps:

- **Catheter insertion**: Catheters are inserted into the heart via peripheral veins (typically femoral or jugular) and positioned in specific cardiac chambers.
- **Baseline measurements**: Resting electrical activity and conduction intervals are recorded.
- **Programmed stimulation**: Incremental pacing and extrastimuli are delivered to induce arrhythmias.
- **Mapping and ablation**: If an arrhythmia is induced, the source is mapped and ablation may be performed to eliminate the arrhythmogenic focus [^891739ee].

---

## Risks and complications

EPS is generally well tolerated, but potential risks include:

- **Bleeding and hematoma**: At the catheter insertion site.
- **Infection**: Including local and systemic infections.
- **Vascular injury**: Such as pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous fistula.
- **Cardiac complications**: Rarely, cardiac tamponade, stroke, or life-threatening arrhythmias may occur [^6c680851].

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits

EPS provides several clinical benefits:

- **Definitive diagnosis**: Identifies the underlying cause of arrhythmias or syncope.
- **Guided therapy**: Enables targeted treatment, including catheter ablation or device implantation.
- **Risk stratification**: Helps determine the need for interventions such as ICD implantation in high-risk patients [^52bbeb95].

---

## Recent advancements and emerging trends

Recent developments in EPS include:

- **Advanced mapping systems**: Improved accuracy in localizing arrhythmogenic foci.
- **Robotic navigation**: Enhanced precision and reduced radiation exposure.
- **Personalized medicine**: Integration of genetic and patient-specific factors to tailor treatment strategies [^e3ec8eca].

---

EPS is a valuable invasive procedure for diagnosing and treating cardiac arrhythmias, offering definitive diagnosis, risk stratification, and therapeutic options. It is indicated for specific clinical scenarios but is not routinely recommended for patients with normal ECG and normal cardiac structure. Recent advancements continue to improve its accuracy and safety, expanding its clinical utility.

### Functional proteomic analysis of protein kinase C epsilon signaling complexes in the normal heart and during cardioprotection [^01ee3b17]. Circulation Research (2001). Low credibility.

Using two-dimensional electrophoresis, mass spectrometry, immunoblotting, and affinity pull-down assays, we found that myocardial protein kinase C epsilon (PKCepsilon) is physically associated with at least 36 known proteins that are organized into structural proteins, signaling molecules, and stress-responsive proteins. Furthermore, we found that the cardioprotection induced by activation of PKCepsilon is coupled with dynamic modulation and recruitment of PKCepsilon-associated proteins. The results suggest heretofore-unrecognized functions of PKCepsilon and provide an integrated framework for the understanding of PKCepsilon-dependent signaling architecture and cardioprotection.

Here, using LPL and its association with TG as an example, we present statistical and laboratory procedures to identify candidate functional SNPs from dense tagging SNPs (tSNPs). We give examples of statistical tests available for the analysis of association between SNPs and continuous variables. Popular model selection criteria are calculated for the data and their results are compared, while haplotypes are used both as mediators of association and as an additional method of model selection. Having determined the SNPs with the highest likelihood of marking a functional variant, all SNPs in strong LD with these were examined for functional effects. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out on these variant sequences, and those SNPs that showed differences in EMSA were further examined in reporter gene expression studies. For the SNPs that also demonstrated expression differences, the identification of potential DNA-binding factors mediating this effect was carried out using multiplexed-competitor EMSAs (MC-EMSAs) and supershift EMSAs.

### Trametinib (Mekinist) [^cae3e3eb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trametinib PO (also known as Mekinist): 
- Bleeding: use extreme caution in patients with risk factors for Bleeding events (e.g., intracranial bleeding and GI bleeding). Monitor patients who receive trametinib for signs or symptoms of bleeding. Interruption of therapy, a dose reduction, or permanent therapy discontinuation may be necessary in patients who develop grade 3 or 4 bleeding.
- Cardiomyopathy, LV dysfunction: use extreme caution with BRAF V600 mutation-positive, unresectable or metastatic melanoma who received trametinib as monotherapy or in combination with dabrafenib. Evaluate cardiac function prior to starting trametinib (e.g., echocardiogram). Interruption of therapy, a dose reduction, and/or permanent discontinuation may be necessary in patients who develop LV dysfunction.
- DVT, PE: use extreme caution in patients with a history of venous thromboembolic disease. Implement appropriate thromboprophylaxis measures and closely monitor patients for signs of DVT and PE during Trametinib treatment. Initiate prompt medical intervention, including anticoagulant therapy, for the management of DVT or PE. Seek immediate medical attention.
- Gastrointestinal perforation, colitis: use caution in patients with inflammation of the colon. Monitor patients for symptoms of colitis and promptly manage any gastrointestinal adverse effects during Trametinib treatment. Discontinue Trametinib and provide appropriate medical intervention, which may include corticosteroids or surgical intervention.
- Hyperglycemia: use caution in patients with a history of diabetes mellitus. Monitor serum glucose levels at baseline and as clinically indicated during therapy. Initiate or optimize anti-hyperglycemic agents in these patients as necessary.
- ILD, pneumonitis: use extreme caution in patients with a history of pulmonary illness. Monitor patients regularly for signs and symptoms of ILD and pneumonitis during Trametinib treatment. Discontinue Trametinib and initiate appropriate medical intervention, which may include systemic corticosteroids, to manage ILD and pneumonitis.
- Retinal detachment, central retinal vein occlusion: use caution in patients with a history of vision problems. Ophthalmological exams should be performed periodically and promptly in patients who report vision problems. Interruption of therapy, a dose reduction, or permanent therapy discontinuation may be necessary for patients who develop retinal detachments and retinal vein occlusion.

### Concordance of functional in vitro data and epidemiological associations in complex disease genetics [^f37ecc88]. Genetics in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We aimed to assess whether epidemiological evidence on genetic associations for complex diseases concord with in vitro functional data.

Methods

We examined 36 studies on bi-allelic markers and 23 studies on haplotypes where investigators had addressed both epidemiological associations and the functional effect of the same gene variants in luciferase reporter systems in vitro.

Results

There was no correlation between epidemiological odds ratios and luciferase activity ratios (-0.09, P = 0.60). Luciferase activity ratios could not tell whether a probed epidemiologic association would be significant or not (area under receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.52). Luciferase results usually were qualitatively similar across cell lines and experimental conditions, with some exceptions. A luciferase activity ratio of 1.44 adequately separated statistically significant from non-significant functional differences (area under receiver operating characteristics curve, 0.95). Binary and continuous disease outcomes usually gave concordant results; other in vitro methods, in particular EMSA, agreed with luciferase results. Selective reporting and use of different variants and contrasts between functional and epidemiological analyses were common in these studies.

Conclusions

In vitro biological data and epidemiology provide independent lines of evidence on complex diseases. We provide suggestions for improving the design and reporting of studies addressing both in vitro and epidemiological effects.

### 2019 HRS expert consensus statement on evaluation, risk stratification, and management of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy [^8c756f35]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy—epsilon wave definition, leads, prevalence, and diagnostic limitations are provided. The epsilon wave is defined as a reproducible low-amplitude deflection located between the end of the QRS and the onset of the T wave in leads V1–V3. Epsilon waves reflect delayed conduction in the right ventricle, and their prevalence in European and American registries varies from 0.9% to 25%. Epsilon waves may reflect short-term arrhythmic risk but have limited diagnostic utility because they are variable, have low sensitivity and specificity, and are dependent on ECG filter setting and magnification.

### Microarray analysis: a novel research tool for cardiovascular scientists and physicians [^ec23e45d]. Heart (2003). Low credibility.

The massive increase in information on the human DNA sequence and the development of new technologies will have a profound impact on the diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The microarray is a micro-hybridisation based assay. The filter, called microchip or chip, is a special kind of membrane in which are spotted several thousands of oligonucleotides of cDNA fragments coding for known genes or expressed sequence tags. The resulting hybridisation signal on the chip is analysed by a fluorescent scanner and processed with a software package utilising the information on the oligonucleotide or cDNA map of the chip to generate a list of relative gene expression. Microarray technology can be used for many different purposes, most prominently to measure differential gene expression, variations in gene sequence (by analysing the genome of mutant phenotypes), or more recently, the entire binding site for transcription factors. Measurements of gene expression have the advantage of providing all available sequence information for any given experimental design and data interpretation in pursuit of biological understanding. This research tool will contribute to radically changing our understanding of cardiovascular diseases.

### Functional analysis of four LDLR 5' UTR and promoter variants in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia [^62755399]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In order to correctly report to a referring clinician whether or not an identified promoter variant is likely to be FH causing, bioinformatics predictions may be helpful, and although evidence that the variant affects binding of a nuclear protein by an EMSA may be suggestive, an in-vitro assay of the effect on transcriptional strength provides the strongest evidence. Four reported variants identified in FH patients within the LDLR 5′UTR and promoter were investigated.The c.-13A>G variant showed no difference in luciferase activity, suggesting it is not FH causing, whereas c.-101C and c.-121C showed a significant lower expression, suggesting that these variants are likely to be pathogenic and causal of the FH phenotype seen in these patients, and the status of c.-215A>G remains unclear.

### 2019 HRS expert consensus statement on evaluation, risk stratification, and management of arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy [^9f1ade36]. Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM)—clinical evaluation and family assessment should consider genetic and nongenetic causes with an assessment of electrocardiographic and structural abnormalities and arrhythmic risk in adults and children, and the pedigree evaluation should include a 3-generation family tree with emphasis on premature cardiovascular events and associated cardiac and noncardiac phenotypes; mutation analysis, endomyocardial biopsies, and electrophysiology studies (EPSs) are indicated in particular clinical circumstances. A distinguishing feature of ACM is the clinical presentation with documented and/or symptomatic arrhythmia.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Electrophysiology study (EPS) for suspected bradycardia—In patients with symptoms suspected to be attributable to bradycardia, an electrophysiology study (EPS) may be considered in selected patients for diagnosis of, and elucidation of bradycardia mechanism, if initial noninvasive evaluation is nondiagnostic.

### 2017 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the evaluation and management of patients with syncope: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^3630d79b]. Heart Rhythm (2017). Medium credibility.

Electrophysiological study (EPS) in syncope—The EPS can identify a substrate for clinical bradyarrhythmia or tachyarrhythmia as a potential cause of syncope after a nondiagnostic initial evaluation, but “Despite these purported benefits, EPS has a limited role in the evaluation of syncope, especially in patients without known heart disease or with low suspicion of an arrhythmic etiology.” Recommendations state that “EPS can be useful for evaluation of selected patients with syncope of suspected arrhythmic etiology” and that “EPS is not recommended for syncope evaluation in patients with a normal ECG and normal cardiac structure and function, unless an arrhythmic etiology is suspected.” Additional notes include that “An EPS is no longer required in patients with syncope before consideration of ICD therapy” and that “The role of EPS in patients with syncope suspected to be due to VA and acquired nonischemic heart disease is unproven.”

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Electrophysiology study (EPS) diagnostic yield and predictors in symptomatic patients: The diagnostic yield of EPS in symptomatic patients with suspected bradycardia has been shown to vary widely (range, 12%–80%), depending on the patient population studied. In 1 study of patients presenting with unexplained syncope, those who had history of heart disease had a higher incidence of an abnormal EPS compared with patients who had a structurally normal heart, and the likelihood of an abnormal EPS was greater in patients who had an abnormal ECG at baseline (eg, bundle branch block or prior myocardial infarction [MI]).

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^8b3e4482]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Electrophysiological study (EPS) in syncope—diagnostic role is context-dependent, as “The diagnostic efficacy of EPS to determine the cause of syncope is highly dependent on the degree of suspicion of the abnormality (pre-test probability), and also on the EPS protocol,” and an “overview of studies including 625 patients with syncope undergoing EPS” reported that “Sensitivity and specificity of EPS in general are not good”; the pre-test probability of syncope-related bradycardia is “relatively high when there is asymptomatic sinus bradycardia (<50 b.p.m.) or sinoatrial block, usually documented by 12-lead ECG or ECG monitoring,” and registry data indicate that “nowadays ∼2% of patients with unexplained syncope evaluated by cardiologists undergo EPS and even fewer if they are evaluated by other specialists.”

### Global profiling of protein-DNA and protein-nucleosome binding affinities using quantitative mass spectrometry [^25fcea0a]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Interaction proteomics, via mass spectrometry, has contributed invaluably to the identification of physical associations between biological molecules and the translation thereof into cellular protein networks –. Interaction proteomics methodologies are generally semi-quantitative and use label-free or chemical labeling-based relative quantification to call interactions as outliers from a background of non-specific identifications,. Thus, interactions are regularly reported in a binary on/off manner, though semi-quantitative stoichiometric information is beginning to add a quantitative dimension to interaction studies. Nevertheless, a complete characterization of a functioning cell requires knowledge not only of specificity of biomolecular interactions (i.e. does an interaction occur, or not) but also of affinity (i.e. how strong, in absolute terms, is some given interaction). Typical affinity quantitation methods, such as isothermal titration calorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, fluorescence polarization, fluorescence resonance energy transfer, or electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), have been performed on a single interaction, case-by-case basis, and require laborious expression and purification of recombinant proteins. Importantly, chemoproteomic approaches studying protein–small molecule interactions established the possibility of designing absolutely quantitative binding assays using semi-quantitative isobaric labeling and mass spectrometry,. Similarly, thermal proteome profiling is an innovative mass spectrometry approach that uses thermal stability shifts upon small-molecule binding to estimate apparent dissociation constants proteome-wide, again with a semi-quantitative isobaric labeling strategy,. Other protein-centric studies have focused on measuring the DNA-binding landscape of a single, or a few, transcription factors,. However, the inverse problem of interrogating the quantitative protein binding landscape of DNA sequences of interest has received considerably less attention and is still dominated by semi-quantitative workflows,. Here, we present a method for determining, proteome-wide, tens to hundreds of apparent dissociation constants (K d App) of nuclear proteins for DNA and nucleosome ligands simultaneously using affinity purification from nuclear lysates and isobaric 10-plex tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling coupled with mass spectrometry.

### Risk stratification in individuals with the Brugada type 1 ECG pattern without previous cardiac arrest: usefulness of a combined clinical and electrophysiologic approach [^d1fd1e97]. European Heart Journal (2011). Low credibility.

In the current literature, the predictive value of EPS is controversial. Indeed, while some authors, report a high prognostic significance of EPS, others deny its usefulness. However, many of the multicentre studies that have indicated the scant usefulness of EPS display major methodological problems. In particular, these studies used heterogeneous stimulation protocols.,– Furthermore, the precise protocols are often not clearly specified. For example, some authors simply state that ‘heterogeneous protocols were used’,while others use ambiguous definitions, such as ‘up to three extrastilmuli were employed’,which does not indicate whether all patients had triple extrastimuli or whether some underwent a less aggressive protocol. The latter hypothesis seems more probable in a recent large multicentre study by Probst et al.on the basis of the previously published experiences of the participating centres.

It follows that the category of patients with negative EPS may include those in whom the non-inducibility of VT/VF is due to the low intensity of stimulation. In other words, it is possible that some of them would have a positive EPS if more aggressive stimulation were used.

In our multicentre study, two comparably aggressive protocols were employed, and were completed in all cases. As a result, in agreement with many authors, our EPS was frequently positive in both symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. Indeed, in our study, EPS was positive in 50% of symptomatic and 32% of asymptomatic subjects. Consequently, when considered alone, EPS displayed a low positive predictive value (14%). Thus, a positive EPS cannot be considered a gold standard with regard to the decision to implant an ICD.

By contrast, EPS showed a 100% negative predictive value. Indeed, major events occurred only in subjects with positive EPS (14%), while no MAE occurred in patients with negative EPS. The latter data, which conflict with the results of other authors, may be simply explained by the fact that all our patients underwent an aggressive protocol.

In any case, despite the limit of low positive predictive values, our data support the usefulness of EPS in evaluating risk in subjects with the type 1 Brugada pattern, as proposed by the Brugada brothers, and others.In particular, it can help to identify subjects at low risk, i.e. those who really do have a negative EPS. This information is lacking in patients who do not undergo EPS; in our study, 5.3% of these patients suffered MAE.

Electrophysiological study (EPS)—syncope with normal ECG and normal cardiac structure/function: EPS is not recommended for syncope evaluation in patients with a normal ECG and normal cardiac structure and function, unless an arrhythmic etiology is suspected, and supporting data show low diagnostic yield in this setting, including in a prospective series with abnormal ECG versus normal ECG (22% versus 3.7%), low yield without cardiac disease (2.6%), limited diagnostic findings in a 34-patient series (diagnostic in only 4; abnormal not diagnostic in 2; normal in 28), and markedly lower EPS abnormalities when ECG and ambulatory monitor are normal versus abnormal (9% versus 82%).

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the evaluation and management of patients with bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^6c680851]. Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Electrophysiology study (EPS) role and diagnostic yield in suspected bradycardia—An EPS is an invasive, catheter-based procedure that can be used to test the integrity of cardiac conduction system and to assess potential inducibility of various cardiac tachyarrhythmias, and EPS are well tolerated with the risk of serious procedural complications such as cardiac tamponade and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia minimal; an EPS is generally not performed as the first-line diagnostic assessment in patients with suspected bradycardia, and the use of an EPS has almost exclusively been examined in patients with syncope or presyncope and is generally an adjunctive tool in the evaluation of patients in whom bradycardia is suspected but has not been documented after noninvasive evaluation. In most cases, the cause of symptomatic bradycardia can be established without invasive evaluation, the diagnostic yield of EPS in symptomatic patients with suspected bradycardia has been shown to vary widely (range, 12%–80%), and in 1 study of patients presenting with unexplained syncope those who had history of heart disease had a higher incidence of an abnormal EPS compared with patients who had a structurally normal heart; in addition, the likelihood of an abnormal EPS was greater in patients who had an abnormal ECG at baseline, and EPS may also be performed when the patient is undergoing an invasive procedure such as an endomyocardial biopsy.

Heart Rhythm (2018). Medium credibility.

Brugada syndrome—EPS stimulation protocol effects indicate that a less aggressive protocol limited to single or double extrastimuli yielded better predictive values than triple extrastimulus testing (<3 extrastimuli: positive predictive value: 36%; negative predictive value: 87% versus 3 extra-stimuli: positive predictive value: 23%; negative predictive value: 81%), and ventricular arrhythmia induction specifically from the right ventricular apex was not predictive of subsequent cardiac events.

### Common variants of NFE2L2 gene predisposes to acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients with severe sepsis [^af9c9e7b]. Critical Care (2015). Low credibility.

The importance of redox balance in the pathogenesis of ARDS, as well as the implication of NFE2L2 in disease susceptibility or outcome, is supported by the identification of variants in a few genes involved in the oxidative stress response previously associated with ARDS susceptibility or outcome. Marzec et al. assessed the functionality of the SNP rs6721961 (referred to by those authors at position −617 bp) on the promoter region by means of a reporter gene assay and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). In the reporter gene assay, the luciferase activity for the T allele was less than half of the activity for the G allele, indicating a significant reduction of NFE2L2 gene expression. Congruently, results derived from the EMSA showed that the formation of a protein–DNA complex was significantly diminished in the presence of the T allele, suggesting a less efficient binding of the NFE2L2 transcription factor to the ARE-like sequences of its target genes. In the same study, and consistent with these results, the presence of the T allele at rs6721961 was associated with risk for ARDS susceptibility in a nested case–control association study conducted with 30 patients with trauma-induced ARDS and 60 matched at-risk control subjects. A fixed-effects meta-analysis combining these results with those derived from our study confirmed the concordance of effects at the SNP level, showing an OR for the T allele of 2.18 (95 % CI, 1.35–3.50; p = 0.0013). The same SNP was recently found to be associated with 28-day mortality in a nested case–control study that included 224 patients with ARDS from a cohort of 750 patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Also, Cantu et al. found a few NFE2L2 SNPs associated with primary graft dysfunction, a specific form of ARDS developed within 72 hours after lung transplantation. Four of those SNPs (rs10930781, rs1962142, rs2001350, and rs4243387) were also significantly associated with ARDS in our study.

### Cardiovascular disease-associated non-coding variants disrupt GATA4-DNA binding and regulatory functions [^e3ec8eca]. HGG Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

In this work, we implemented a machine learning model to prioritize non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) predicted to alter GATA4-DNA binding. Non-coding SNPs were prioritized based on (1) association with a CVD or cardiovascular traits in the GWAS catalog,(2) variants that occur in DNase I hypersensitive genomic footprints (DGFs) within putative cardiac enhancers,, (3) genotype-dependent expression patterns in cardiac tissue (data from the Genotype-Tissue Expression [GTEx] portal), and (4) support vector machine (SVM)-based model predictions to alter GATA4-DNA binding. Prioritized variants were tested for in vitro binding through electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Additionally, regulatory implications within the cellular context of these four variants were analyzed further through luciferase reporter assay. In short, we present a combined computational and experimental approach that can be applied to prioritize non-coding variants associated with human diseases that alter TF function.

We leveraged genomic datasets (e.g. GWAS catalog, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing [ChIP-seq], DGFs, expression quantitative trait loci [eQTLs]) and computational tools to identify CVDs and quantitative traits-associated SNPs and variants from diverse populations (European, EUR; African, AFR; South Asian, SAS; East Asian, EAS; and American, AMR). To identify potential causal SNPs relevant to CVD biology, we identified 13,982 CVD-associated variants from the GWAS catalog. CVD-associated variants were intersected with known DGFs from multiple heart tissueswithin putative cardiac enhancers that are active during heart development and the adult heart,resulting in 1,535 CVD-associated variants within putative cardiac regulatory elements. These variants were expanded to include variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) from multiple populations (EUR, AFR, SAS, EAS, and AMR; R 2 > 0.80) that have been linked to genotype-dependent expression (eQTLs) in cardiac tissue, resulting in 14,218 unique variants (full list of variants in Data S1). From this final list of variants, 792 genes were identified with genotype-dependent activity in the heart atrial appendage and left ventricle. The computational pipeline to identify CVD-associated SNPs is illustrated in Figure 1 A, and a full list of differentially expressed genes is available in Data S1.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy—electrophysiological study (EPS) prognostic value: The value of an electrophysiological study is uncertain in asymptomatic patients with preserved ventricular function for predicting subsequent risk for sudden cardiac death, electrophysiology studies induce sustained VT in approximately 60% of patients of whom half had prior spontaneous sustained VT, inducible sustained VT did not predict subsequent appropriate ICD shocks in primary prevention ICD recipients, and in 1 study symptomatic patients without inducible VT were less likely to receive appropriate ICD shocks; in asymptomatic patients without evidence of VA on ambulatory monitoring, a negative study may have limited value for ICD decision-making.

Functional assessment of LPL SNPs

To investigate the effect of the putative functional LPL SNPs on DNA-binding proteins, EMSAs were performed using probes of ∼30 bp sequences that encompassed the common or rare variant of each of the 23 SNPs. Nuclear extracts from Huh7 (human liver cell line) and human smooth muscle cells were used in the assays to include a wide range of possible DNA-binding proteins that may be involved in LPL regulation. Initial EMSA analysis revealed potential binding differences between eight wild-type and variant alleles (rs17410577, rs268, rs327, rs326, rs331, rs3289, rs3208305 and rs2197089; Fig. 2) using the Huh7 cell line, and all these were followed-up for further analysis. Using nuclear extract from human smooth muscle cells did not provide any further allele-specific bands to those found using the Huh7 cell line (data not shown). The probes that did not bind any proteins by EMSAs, or those that the common and rare variants were bound by the same intensity, and therefore likely to bind outside the SNP location, were rejected from further analysis. The relative location of SNPs examined and those that showed allele-specific protein binding are shown in.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of syncope (version 2009) [^982123c0]. European Heart Journal (2009). Medium credibility.

Electrophysiological study (EPS)—indications and diagnostic criteria: In patients with ischaemic heart disease, EPS is indicated when initial evaluation suggests an arrhythmic cause of syncope unless there is already an established indication for ICD (Class I, Level B). In patients with bundle branch block (BBB), EPS should be considered in non-neurally mediated syncope when non-invasive tests have failed to make the diagnosis, and in patients with syncope preceded by sudden and brief palpitations, EPS may be performed when other non-invasive tests have failed to make the diagnosis; in selected cases of Brugada syndrome, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and in selected high-risk occupations, an EPS may be performed, whereas EPS is not recommended in patients with normal ECG, no heart disease, and no palpitations (Class III, Level B). EPS is diagnostic, and no additional tests are required, in cases of sinus bradycardia with prolonged corrected sinus node recovery time (CSNRT) (>525 ms) (Class I, Level B). A small prospective study reported that patients with CSNRT ≥800 ms had an eight times higher risk of syncope than those with a CSNRT below this value.

### Association study of notch 4 polymorphisms with Alzheimer's disease [^636f9a1a]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The NOTCH4 gene is located at 6p21.3, a site shown in several studies to have significant linkage with Alzheimer's disease.

Objective

To investigate the potential impact of two polymorphisms within this gene on the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease.

Methods

Genotyping of promoter and 5'-UTR polymorphisms was done in Scottish, English, and French populations. The potential functionality of the 5'-UTR polymorphism was assessed by testing its impact on A beta load in Alzheimer brains and also by undertaking electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transfection experiments.

Results

No association of the Notch4 polymorphisms alone with the disease was observed in any of the populations. However, an interaction of the 5'-UTR C/T polymorphism with the epsilon 4 allele of the APOE gene was detected in United Kingdom populations but not in the French. No relation between the 5'-UTR polymorphism and A beta loads was detected overall or in the presence or absence of the epsilon 4 allele. No DNA protein specific binding was found with proteins from neuroblastoma, glioma, or astrocytoma cells, and no allele dependent transcriptional activity was detected.

Conclusions

No association between two NOTCH4 polymorphisms alone and Alzheimer's disease was observed in the three populations, but there was evidence of an increased risk associated with the 5'-UTR CC genotype in epsilon 4 bearers in the United Kingdom. As no functionality for this polymorphism could be determined, it is likely that the interaction is spurious or results from a linkage disequilibrium of this 5'-UTR polymorphism with another marker elsewhere in the 6p21.3 locus.

### Functional impact of a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the OPRD1 promoter region [^62aac273]. Journal of Human Genetics (2010). Low credibility.

The delta-opioid receptor mediates rewarding effects of many substances of abuse. We reported an increased frequency of the minor G-allele of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs569356 (the only variant identified so far in the promoter region of the delta-opioid receptor gene (OPRD1)) in subjects with opioid dependence. In this study, we examined the functional significance of this variant. OPRD1 promoter region harboring SNP rs569356 was amplified by PCR and inserted into a firefly luciferase reporter vector. HEK293 cells were co-transfected with these constructs and a renilla luciferase vector to control for transfection efficiency. Expression of firefly luciferase (driven by the OPRD1 promoter) was measured by a dual luciferase reporter assay and normalized by renilla luciferase expression. Moreover, alleles altering expression were further assessed for binding of human brain nuclear proteins by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The minor G-allele was associated with significantly greater expression levels of firefly luciferase than the major A-allele of SNP rs569356 (P=0.003). EMSA also showed specific gel shift bands, suggesting that SNP rs569356 is situated in the binding site of potential transcription factors. These results suggest that the minor G-allele of SNP rs569356 may enhance transcription factor binding and increase OPRD1 expression.

### Treatment of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy / dysplasia: an international task force consensus statement [^2b8bbeeb]. European Heart Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Electrophysiological study

Electrophysiological study (EPS) is a valuable diagnostic test for differential diagnosis between ARVC/D and idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia and may provide useful information regarding the VT inducibility for optimization of detection/discrimination algorithms and effective antitachycardia pacing protocols in patients undergoing ICD implantation. However, conflicting data exist concerning the role of inducibility of sustained VT or VF for prediction of long-term arrhythmic outcome in ARVC/D patients.,, Discrepancies between the study results may be explained by differences in arrhythmic endpoints (i.e. life-saving vs. any appropriate ICD discharge).

The largest multicentre studies on ARVC/D patients who received an ICD demonstrated that EPS is of limited value in identifying patients at risk of arrhythmic cardiac arrest because of its low predictive accuracy. In these studies, the reported incidence of ‘life-saving’ ICD discharges for treatment of fast VT or VF did not differ significantly in patients who were and were not inducible at EPS, regardless of the specific indication for ICD implantation. The study by Corrado et al.on the outcome of 106 ARVC/D patients receiving an ICD for primary prevention reported that the positive and negative predictive value of inducibility for VT or VF was 35 and 70%, respectively. In this study, the type of ventricular tachyarrhythmia inducible at the time of EPS (i.e. VT or VF) did not predict a statistically different arrhythmic outcome over the follow-up. The North American Multidisciplinary study on 98 ARVC patients receiving an ICD confirmed that inducible VT or VF at pre-implant EPS did not predict appropriate interventions on fast VT or VF during a mean follow-up of 3.3 years.On the contrary, in the cohort of ARVC/D patients reported in the Johns Hopkins studies, inducibility was the most significant independent predictor of appropriate ICD firing. However, in the study by Bhonsale et al.the positive and negative predictive values of inducibility were 65 and 75%, respectively, and a sizeable proportion of patients experienced ICD interventions during follow-up despite a lack of inducibility of VT/VF. Moreover, the predictive value of inducibility for ‘life-saving’ ICD discharges was not demonstrated by either univariate or multivariate analysis. In asymptomatic patients, Bhonsale et al.reported that the combination of ≥2 factors such as inducibility at EPS, proband status, non-sustained VT, and PVCs ≥1000/24 h, predicts an incremental risk of appropriate ICD interventions; however, a statistically significant association with life-saving shocks for treatment of rapid VT or VF has not been demonstrated. In the study by Saguner et al.inducible VT was an independent predictor of composite endpoint including cardiac death, heart transplantation, unstable VT/VF, and syncope.

### Expression in vascular endothelial cells is modulated by a coronary artery disease-associated genetic variant and influences monocyte transendothelial migration [^2ee7857d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 3 
Effects of rs17514846 on gene transcription regulation. Luciferase reporter assays were performed by transfecting vascular endothelial cells with luciferase plasmids containing 60 bp ofencompassing rs17514846 (left) or with luciferase plasmids containing 3, 22‐bp repeats containing rs17514846 (right). Both assays included Renilla luciferase as a transfection efficiency control. Columns and error bars represent mean (normalized to the C allele data) andvalues, respectively. N=3 experiments.

In addition, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using EC nuclear protein extracts was performed to investigate if there was a difference between the 2 alleles of rs17514846 in nuclear protein binding. We found preferential nuclear protein binding to the labeled C allele probe compared with the labeled A allele probe (lanes 2 and 9, respectively; Figure 4). Moreover, the DNA‐protein complex was hardly detected in the presence of the unlabeled C allele probe as a competitor in 20× molar excess (lane 4; Figure 4). However, it was still readily detectable in the presence of the unlabeled A allele probe (lane 6; Figure 4). These data indicate that the C allele has greater affinity for binding of nuclear proteins compared with the A allele.

Fluorescence‐labeled double‐stranded 25‐mer oligonucleotide probes corresponding to the sequence encompassing the rs17514846 site, with either C or A at the rs17514846 site, were individually incubated with or without vascular endothelial cell nuclear protein extracts, in the presence or absence of unlabeled C allele oligonucleotide, unlabeled A allele oligonucleotide, or an unrelated oligonucleotide, respectively, followed by nondenaturing PAGE and fluorescence detection of the labeled probes. Arrows indicate a‐protein complex and the free probe. Image shown is a representative from 3 experiments.

### Polymorphic variants in the GRK5 gene promoter are associated with diastolic dysfunction in coronary artery bypass graft surgery patients [^1b38b77c]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 5 (GRK5) is a mediator of cardiovascular homeostasis and participates in inflammation and cardiac fibrosis, both being involved in the development of diastolic dysfunction (DD). While mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the GRK5 promoter are unclear, we tested the hypotheses, that (1) GRK5 expression varies depending on functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the GRK5 promoter and (2) this is associated with DD in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.

Methods

We amplified and sequenced the GRK5 promoter followed by cloning, reporter assays, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). GRK5 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was determined in right atrial tissue sampled from 50 patients undergoing CABG surgery. In another prospective study, GRK5 genotypes were associated with determinants of diastolic function using transesophageal echocardiography in 255 patients with CABG with normal systolic left ventricular (LV) function. Specifically, we measured ejection fraction (EF), transmitral Doppler early filling velocity (E), tissue Doppler early diastolic lateral mitral annular velocity (E' lateral), and calculated E/E', E' norm and the difference of E' lateral and E' norm to account for age-related changes in diastolic function.

Results

We identified 6 SNPs creating 3 novel haplotypes with the greatest promoter activation in haplotype tagging (ht) SNP T(-678)C T-allele constructs (P < .001). EMSAs showed allele-specific transcription factor binding proving functional activity. GRK5 mRNA expression was greatest in TT genotypes (TT: 131 fg/µg [95% CI, 108-154]; CT: 109 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 93-124]; CC: 83 [95% CI, 54-112]; P = .012). Moreover, GRK5 genotypes were significantly associated with determinants of diastolic function. Grading of DD revealed more grade 3 patients in TT compared to CT and CC genotypes (58% vs 38% vs 4%; P = .023). E´ lateral was lowest in TT genotypes (P = .007) and corresponding E/E' measurements showed 1.27-fold increased values in TT versus CC genotypes (P = .01), respectively. While E' norm values were not different between genotypes (P = .182), the difference between E' lateral and E' norm was significantly higher in TT genotypes compared to CC and CT genotypes (-1.2 [interquartile range {IQR}, 2.7], -0.5 [IQR, 3.4], and -0.4 [IQR, 4.2; P = .035], respectively).

Conclusions

A functional GRK5 SNP results in allele-dependent differences in GRK5 promoter activity and mRNA expression. This is associated with altered echocardiographic determinants of diastolic function. Thus, SNPs in the GRK5 promoter are associated with altered perioperative diastolic cardiac function. In the future, preoperative testing for these and other SNPs might allow to initiate more specific diagnostic and perioperative pathways to benefit patients at risk.

Functional follow-up

We performed experimental functional follow-up of the WNT4 locus, one of the most significant loci with plausible functional relevance in pregnancy. First we examined the expression level of WNT4 in human endometrial stromal cells, before and after decidualization using mRNA-seq technology. We predicted specific transcription factors binding using a Bioinformatic approach and studied the presence of H3K4me3 marks and open chromatin domains overlapping the hypothetical causal SNP by ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq, respectively. We performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) to determine whether the variant differentially affected specific transcription factor binding. Detailed description of these analyses can be found in the Supplementary Text (Functional analyses of the WNT4 locus).

### Oritavancin (orbactiv) [^7e18780b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Oritavancin is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)] .

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The antimicrobial activity of oritavancin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimal inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) based on animal models of infection.

Exposure-response analyses from both preclinical and clinical studies support the treatment of clinically relevant Gram-positive microorganisms (e.g. S. aureus and S. pyogenes) causative of ABSSSI with a single 1,200 mg dose of ORBACTIV.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a thorough QTc study of 135 healthy subjects at a dose 1.3 times the 1,200 mg recommended dose, ORBACTIV did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

The population PK analysis was derived using data from the two Phase 3 ABSSSI clinical trials in 297 patients. The mean (± SD) pharmacokinetic parameters of oritavancin in patients following a single 1,200 mg dose are presented in Table 3.

Oritavancin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics at a dose up to 1,200 mg. The mean, population-predicted oritavancin concentration-time profile displays a multi-exponential decline with a long terminal plasma half-life.

Distribution

Oritavancin is approximately 85% bound to human plasma proteins.

Based on population PK analysis, the population mean total volume of distribution is estimated to be approximately 87.6 L, indicating oritavancin is extensively distributed into the tissues.

Exposures of oritavancin in skin blister fluid were approximately 20% of those in plasma (AUC0-24) after single 800 mg dose in healthy subjects.

Metabolism/Excretion

Non-clinical studies including in vitro human liver microsome studies indicated that oritavancin is not metabolized. No mass balance study has been conducted in humans. In humans, oritavancin is slowly excreted unchanged in feces and urine with less than 1% and 5% of the dose recovered in feces and urine, respectively, after 2 weeks of collection.

Oritavancin has a terminal half-life of approximately 245 hours and a clearance of 0.445 L/h based on population pharmacokinetic analyses.

### Anagrelide [^6d45a681]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Toxicity

Torsades de pointes and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with anagrelide. Obtain a pre-treatment cardiovascular examination including an ECG in all patients. During treatment with anagrelide monitor patients for cardiovascular effects and evaluate as necessary.

Anagrelide increases the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and increases the heart rate in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Do not use anagrelide in patients with known risk factors for QT interval prolongation, such as congenital long QT syndrome, a known history of acquired QTc prolongation, medicinal products that can prolong QTc interval and hypokalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Hepatic impairment increases anagrelide exposure and could increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment for QTc prolongation and other cardiovascular adverse reactions. The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be assessed before treatment is commenced. Reduce anagrelide dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Avoid use of anagrelide in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

In patients with heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or electrolyte abnormalities, consider periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Anagrelide is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor and may cause vasodilation, tachycardia, palpitations, and congestive heart failure. Other drugs that inhibit PDE3 have caused decreased survival when compared with placebo in patients with Class III-IV congestive heart failure [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

In patients with cardiac disease, use anagrelide only when the benefits outweigh the risks.

5.2 Pulmonary Hypertension

Cases of pulmonary hypertension have been reported in patients treated with anagrelide. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating and during anagrelide therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] .

5.3 Bleeding Risk

Use of concomitant anagrelide and aspirin increased major hemorrhagic events in a postmarketing study. Assess the potential risks and benefits for concomitant use of anagrelide with aspirin, since bleeding risks may be increased. Monitor patients for bleeding, including those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Measuring luteinising hormone pulsatility with a robotic aptamer-enabled electrochemical reader [^ed75b2e0]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Developing a high-affinity LH-specific aptamer

The LH aptamer was generated via a nitrocellulose-membrane-based SELEX method (Fig. 2a). In order to obtain a highly specific LH aptamer, we applied counter selection against follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a glycoprotein sharing a structural similarity with LH. Both LH and FSH share the same ɑ-chain and hence it is necessary to evolve an aptamer that can differentiate between the two through interactions with the β-chain or at the interface between the two subunits. The gel electrophoresis image after each round of selection was used to monitor the selection process. Twenty rounds of selection were performed before sequencing. We obtained eight major sequences. B10, B11 and B35 only showed one base variation between them. Enzyme-linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA) was used to screen the DNA aptamers for their affinity in binding to LH (Supplementary Fig. 1). The concentration–response curve obtained by ELONA of the best LH-binder aptamer B23 is shown in Fig. 2b. No significant FSH interaction was observed. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K D) was estimated to be 321 nM. Further cross-reaction studies were conducted to investigate the specificity of B23 aptamer against multiple proteins using ELONA and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (Fig. 2c). No significant nonspecific interactions were observed in either assay. A clear concentration–response relation was observed in the EMSA gel. We also performed DNA–protein interaction study using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to investigate the binding kinetics of LH and B23 aptamer. SPR response data from a titration study were fitted to a 1:1 binding model (Supplementary Fig. 2). The estimated K off was 1.2 × 10 −3 s −1. It is a relatively fast off-rate (slow off-rates are normally < 10 −5 s −1). This feature benefits a continuous sensing-format design by allowing fast regeneration. A circular dichroism (CD) study of B23 investigated the conformational change dynamics upon binding of LH. Figure 2d shows the CD spectra before and after adding 1 μM LH in buffer. The negative peak at 240 nm becomes more negative and the positive peak at 280 nm increases after binding, providing evidence of a structure-switching conformational change of the aptamer upon LH binding. This feature is important as in the electrochemical biosensor design, conformational change is needed to generate the signal change on target binding.

### European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) / Heart Rhythm Society (HRS) / Asia Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) / Latin American Heart Rhythm Society (LAHRS) expert consensus on risk assessment in cardiac arrhythmias: use the right tool for the right outcome, in the right population [^5f80eb94]. Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Invasive electrophysiological study (EPS)—risk stratification in congenital and primary arrhythmic conditions: EPS may be considered for risk stratification of SCD in patients with tetralogy of fallot who have one or more risk factors among LV dysfunction, non-sustained VT and QRS duration exceeding 180 ms. EPS may be considered in patients with congenital heart disease and non-sustained VT to determine the risk of sustained VT or identify SVT that could be ablate. EPS may be considered in asymptomatic patients with spontaneous type 1 Brugada ECG pattern, or drug-induced type 1 ECG pattern and additional risk factors. EPS is not recommended for additional risk stratification in patients with either long or short QT, catecholaminergic VT or early repolarization, and is not recommended for risk stratification in patients with ischemic or non-ischemic DCM who meet criteria for ICD implantation.

### A commonly occurring polymorphism upstream of the estrogen receptor alpha alters transcription and is associated with increased HDL [^db601082]. Atherosclerosis (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Given the role of estrogen in the regulation of lipid metabolism, we screened for functional polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor alpha (ER*), and examined for their influence on serum cholesterol.

Methods and Results

We identified a novel C>T polymorphism (ERNE-145), with a minor allele frequency of 41%. This polymorphism was immediately adjacent to a putative glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding site, which we showed to be functional by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. The C allele was associated with glucocorticoid-induced reduction in promoter activity compared to control in luciferase reporter studies (p<0.05; n=7). This effect was abolished by the T allele. To investigate the functional significance of ERNE-145, its association with serum cholesterol levels was examined in 1662 post-menopausal women enrolled in the RUTH trial. ERNE-145 genotype (p=0.001), BMI (p<0.001), diabetes mellitus (p<0.001), and ethnicity (p=0.002) were significantly associated with HDL cholesterol. ERNE-145 genotype explained 8.2% of the variability of HDL: each copy of the variant T allele was associated with a 0.041 mmol/L (CI 0.017-0.066) increase in HDL.

Conclusion

A novel polymorphism upstream of ER* abolished negative transcriptional regulation by an adjacent GR binding sequence, and was strongly associated with HDL levels in a large cohort of post-menopausal women.

### Diagnosis of Guillain-Barrésyndrome and validation of brighton criteria [^b6687e68]. Brain (2014). Low credibility.

Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute polyradiculoneuropathy with a variable clinical presentation. Accurate diagnostic criteria are essential for patient care and research, including clinical trials and vaccine safety studies. Several diagnostic criteria for Guillain-Barré syndrome have been proposed, including the recent set by the Brighton Collaboration. In the present study we describe in detail the key diagnostic features required to meet these Brighton criteria in a study population of 494 adult patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome, previously included in therapeutic and observational studies. The patients had a median age of 53 years (interquartile range 36-66 years) and males slightly predominated (56%). All patients developed bilateral limb weakness which generally involved both upper and lower extremities. The weakness remained restricted to the legs in 6% and to the arms in 1% of the patients. Decreased reflexes in paretic arms or legs were found initially in 91% of patients and in all patients during follow-up. Ten (2%) patients however showed persistence of normal reflexes in paretic arms. Disease nadir was reached within 2 weeks in 80%, within 4 weeks in 97% and within 6 weeks in all patients. A monophasic disease course occurred in 95% of patients, of whom 10% had a treatment-related fluctuation. A clinical deterioration after 8 weeks of onset of weakness occurred in 23 (5%) patients. Cerebrospinal fluid was examined in 474 (96%) patients. A mild pleocytosis (5 to 50 cells/μl) was found in 15%, and none had more than 50 cells/μl. An increased cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration was found only in 64% of patients, highly dependent on the timing of the lumbar puncture after onset of weakness (49% at the first day to 88% after 2 weeks). Nerve electrophysiology was compatible with the presence of a neuropathy in 99% of patients, but only 59% fulfilled the current criteria for a distinct subtype of Guillain-Barré syndrome. Patients with a complete data set (335) were classified according to the Brighton criteria, ranging from a high to a low level of diagnostic certainty, as level 1 in 61%, level 2 in 33%, level 3 in none, and level 4 in 6% of patients. Patients categorized in these levels did not differ with respect to proportion of patients with preceding events, initial clinical manifestations or outcome. The observed variability in the key diagnostic features of Guillain-Barré syndrome in the current cohort study, can be used to improve the sensitivity of the diagnostic criteria.

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the Evaluation and management of Patients with bradycardia and cardiac Conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^52f4975b]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Electrophysiology study (EPS) procedural role and typical use in suspected bradycardia: EPS are well tolerated and the risk of serious procedural complications such as cardiac tamponade and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia is minimal. An EPS is generally not performed as the first-line diagnostic assessment in patients with suspected bradycardia, and most patients who undergo an EPS have already undergone a series of noninvasive cardiac evaluations, such as ECG, tilt table testing, echocardiogram, and/or ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, which may have been inconclusive. EPS have been performed almost exclusively in patients with unexplained syncope or presyncope, and in most cases the cause of symptomatic bradycardia can be established without invasive evaluation. The use of an EPS has almost exclusively been examined in patients with syncope or presyncope, and is generally an adjunctive tool in patients in whom bradycardia is suspected but has not been documented after noninvasive evaluation; EPS may be a reasonable approach in syncope associated with trauma with high pretest probability for significant conduction disease (eg, LBBB), and may also be performed when the patient is undergoing an invasive procedure such as an endomyocardial biopsy.

### Motixafortide (Aphexda) [^98732e93]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Specific Populations

Renal Impairment

Based on the population PK analysis, in patients with mildly to moderately decreased renal function, the pharmacokinetic profile of motixafortide was not significantly affected. While the effect of severe renal impairment on the clearance of motixafortide has not been evaluated, a significant effect is not anticipated.

Hepatic Impairment

Motixafortide is catabolized in both the liver and blood, and animal data suggest that the main excretion pathway of its metabolites is via the kidneys and biliary excretion is minimal. Based on the population PK analysis, mildly impaired liver function did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic profile of motixafortide. The effect of moderate to severe hepatic impairment has not been evaluated, but the risk for adverse reactions due to increased exposure is low because motixafortide is administered as a single dose.

Race/Ethnicity

In the population PK analysis, ethnicity as a covariate was not found to be a statistically significant predictor of motixafortide PK.

Gender

In the population analysis, minimal effect of gender was seen on the overall pharmacokinetic profile of motixafortide. Despite higher relative bioavailability in females compared to males, the mg/kg dosing strategy and generally lower body weights in females result in only 10% higher exposures (AUC0-24hand Cmax) in females versus males for a weight-based dose and therefore is not considered clinically meaningful.

Age

In the population PK analysis, age as a covariate was not found to be a statistically significant predictor of motixafortide PK.

Drug Interaction Studies

In vitro studies showed a lack of significant (>25%) cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition in human hepatocytes, a lack of CYP induction potential in human hepatocytes, and a low potential for transporter-mediated interactions. As such, motixafortide has a low potential for both metabolism- and transporter-mediated drug interactions.

12.6 Immunogenicity

The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies between studies, including those of motixafortide.

No pre-existing or treatment-emergent (up to 8 weeks post-administration) anti-drug antibodies were detected in 84 patients with multiple myeloma who received one or two administrations of motixafortide in combination with filgrastim for hematopoietic stem cell mobilization in the GENESIS study [see Clinical Studies (14)] .

### Differential binding of transcription factor E2F-2 to the endothelin-converting enzyme-1b promoter affects blood pressure regulation [^e920aadd]. Human Molecular Genetics (2003). Low credibility.

The endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE)-1 gene is a candidate for human blood pressure (BP) regulation and we report the identification of the new gene variants T-839G, C-338A, L75F, A677V and C+295T. Transient transfection of the reporter constructs containing the -338A allele showed an increase in promoter activity compared with the wild-type promoter. EMSA revealed the specific binding of E2F-2 to both ECE-1b promoter sequences, with the -338A allele being associated with an increased affinity to E2F-2 compared with -338C. The clinical relevance of this finding was analyzed in 704 hypertensive patients. In untreated hypertensive women, both the -338A and -839G alleles were significantly associated with ambulatory BP values. This study provides the first evidence of a link between the cell-cycle-associated E2F family and BP regulation via a component of the endothelin system.

### Five criteria predict induction and ablation of supraventricular tachycardia [^db14f806]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2025). Medium credibility.

6 Conclusion

We describe five simple preoperative criteria that predict whether patients are likely to have SVT induced and ablated at an EPS. The criteria can be incorporated into a scoring system to predict the probability of SVT induction and ablation in individual patients. They can be used to select patients for EPS and ablation of SVT, to provide a rationale for avoiding EPS in high‐risk cases, and to manage patient and operator expectations.

Figure 5 
Disrupted synergistic transactivation between mutant KLF13 and GATA4.

A, In cultured Hela cells, the transactivation of the ACTC1 promoter by GATA4 in synergy with E144X, E194X or C199R mutant was abolished by each mutation when compared with that by GATA4 and WT KLF13. B, In the presence of GATA4, transactivation of the MYH7 promoter‐driven luciferase in Hela cells by WT, E144X, E194X, or C199R mutant revealed that the mutations ablated the synergistic transcriptional activation between each mutant and GATA4. All the experiments were performed in triplicate, with the results expressed as mean±SD. Here, each * indicates P <0.001, in comparison with its WT counterpart. WT indicates wild type.

DiminishedAbility of the MutantProteins

As is shown in Figure 6, nuclear extracts form Hela cells transfected with WT KLF13‐pcDNA3.1 had the ability to specifically bind to biotinylated ACTC1 ‐ or MYH7 ‐DNA probes because the binding could be competed by the corresponding excess cold probes. The ability of E144X‐, E194X‐, or C199R‐mutant KLF13 protein to bind to the ACTC1 ‐DNA probes diminished to an undetectable level (Figure 6A). Similarly, E144X‐, E194X‐, or C199R‐mutant KLF13 protein showed a diminished binding ability to the MYH7 ‐DNA probes (Figure 6B).

### Mavorixafor (Xolremdi) [^ab62ceb7]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

7.2 Effect of XOLREMDI on Other Drugs

CYP2D6 Substrates

The use of XOLREMDI with drugs that are another drug highly dependent on CYP2D6 for clearance is contraindicated [see Contraindications (4)] .

Mavorixafor is a CYP2D6 inhibitor. Mavorixafor increases exposure of CYP2D6 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates.

CYP3A4 Substrates

Monitor for CYP3A4 substrate related adverse reactions more frequently, unless otherwise recommended in the substrate's Prescribing Information, when XOLREMDI is used concomitantly with CYP3A4 substrates where minimal substrate concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions.

Mavorixafor is an inhibitor of CYP3A4. Mavorixafor may increase the Cmaxand AUC of CYP3A4 substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions from the CYP3A4 substrate.

P-gp Substrates

Monitor for P-gp substrate related adverse reactions more frequently, unless otherwise recommended in the substrate's Prescribing Information, when XOLREMDI is used concomitantly with P-gp substrates where minimal substrate concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions.

Digoxin: Measure serum digoxin concentrations before initiating concomitant use with XOLREMDI, and continue monitoring serum digoxin concentrations as recommended in the Prescribing Information for digoxin [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .

Mavorixafor is an inhibitor of P-gp. Mavorixafor may increase the Cmaxand AUC of P-gp substrates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], which may increase the risk of adverse reactions from the P-gp substrate.

Metformin: Monitor for glycemic control and adjust the dose of metformin as necessary. Mavorixafor may decrease the mean Cmaxand AUC of metformin, which may reduce metformin's effectiveness. The mechanism of this interaction is unknown.

7.3 Drugs that Prolong the QTc Interval

Obtain an electrocardiogram when initiating, during concomitant use, and as clinically indicated in patients receiving concomitant medications with a known potential to prolong the QTc interval [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

XOLREMDI causes QTc interval prolongation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)] . Concomitant use of XOLREMDI with other products that prolong QTc interval may result in a greater increase in QTc interval and adverse reactions associated with QTc interval prolongation, including torsade de pointes, other serious arrythmias, and sudden death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

### Unique features of action potential initiation in cortical neurons [^bf091122]. Nature (2006). Excellent credibility.

Neurons process and encode information by generating sequences of action potentials. For all spiking neurons, the encoding of single-neuron computations into sequences of spikes is biophysically determined by the cell's action-potential-generating mechanism. It has recently been discovered that apparently minor modifications of this mechanism can qualitatively change the nature of neuronal encoding. Here we quantitatively analyse the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons in vivo, in vitro and in computational models. Unexpectedly, key features of the initiation dynamics of cortical neuron action potentials--their rapid initiation and variable onset potential--are outside the range of behaviours described by the classical Hodgkin-Huxley theory. We propose a new model based on the cooperative activation of sodium channels that reproduces the observed dynamics of action potential initiation. This new model predicts that Hodgkin-Huxley-type dynamics of action potential initiation can be induced by artificially decreasing the effective density of sodium channels. In vitro experiments confirm this prediction, supporting the hypothesis that cooperative sodium channel activation underlies the dynamics of action potential initiation in cortical neurons.

### Oritavancin diphosphate (Kimyrsa) [^a4f3bb76]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Oritavancin is an antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)] .

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

The antimicrobial activity of oritavancin appears to correlate with the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve to minimal inhibitory concentration (AUC/MIC) based on animal models of infection. The AUC from time zero to 72 hours correlates with antimicrobial activity in both preclinical and clinical studies.

Exposure-response analyses from both preclinical and clinical studies support the treatment of clinically relevant gram-positive microorganisms (e.g. S. aureus and S. pyogenes) causative of ABSSSI with a single 1,200 mg dose of oritavancin.

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a thorough QTc study of 135 healthy subjects at a dose 1.3 times the 1,200 mg recommended dose, oritavancin did not prolong the QTc interval to any clinically relevant extent.

12.3	Pharmacokinetics

The mean (±SD) pharmacokinetic parameters of oritavancin products (KIMYRSA and oritavancin) in patients with ABSSSI are presented in Table 3.

Oritavancin exhibits linear pharmacokinetics at a dose up to 1,200 mg. The mean, population-predicted oritavancin concentration-time profile displays a multi-exponential decline with a long terminal plasma half-life.

Distribution

Oritavancin is approximately 85% bound to human plasma proteins.

Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, the population mean total volume of distribution is estimated to be approximately 87.6 L, indicating that oritavancin is extensively distributed into the tissues.

Exposures of oritavancin in skin blister fluid were approximately 20% of those in plasma (AUC0-24) after single 800 mg dose in healthy subjects.

Metabolism/Excretion

Non-clinical studies, including in vitro human liver microsome studies, indicated that oritavancin is not metabolized. No mass balance study has been conducted in humans. In humans, oritavancin is slowly excreted unchanged in feces and urine, with less than 1% and 5% of the dose recovered in feces and urine, respectively, after 2 weeks of collection.

Oritavancin has a terminal half-life of approximately 245 hours and a clearance of 0.445 L/h, based on population PK analyses.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: clinical and radiological manifestations, pathophysiology, and outstanding questions [^e8316670]. The Lancet: Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

The clinical calculator "Diagnostic criteria for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome" for posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.

The diagnostic criteria for Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the identification and diagnosis of PRES in patients presenting with specific neurological symptoms and risk factors. This tool is particularly useful in differentiating PRES from other neurological conditions with similar presentations.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the presence of at least one acute neurological symptom, at least one risk factor, specific findings on brain imaging, and the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Acute neurological symptoms may include seizures, encephalopathy, confusion, headache, or visual disturbances. Risk factors encompass severe hypertension or blood pressure fluctuations, renal failure, immunosuppressant therapy, chemotherapy, eclampsia, or an autoimmune disorder. The brain imaging should either be normal, show bilateral vasogenic edema, or cytotoxic edema with a pattern indicative of PRES.

The diagnostic criteria for PRES are met if all four components are present. If any of these components are absent, the diagnostic criteria for PRES are not met, suggesting the need for further investigation into alternative diagnoses. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the diagnosis of PRES, facilitating early recognition and appropriate management of this condition.

The diagnostic criteria tool for Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) helps in assessing whether a patient meets the necessary conditions for this diagnosis. It uses four specific criteria, each requiring a decision on whether they apply to the patient or not. With these inputs, the tool determines whether the diagnostic criteria for PRES are fulfilled.

Here are the criteria that need to be evaluated:

- At least one acute neurological symptom must be present. This could include seizures, encephalopathy, confusion, headaches, or visual disturbances.
- The patient should have at least one significant risk factor. These can include severe hypertension or fluctuations in blood pressure, renal failure, immunosuppressant therapy, chemotherapy, eclampsia, or an autoimmune disorder.
- Brain imaging should show normal results, or patterns of bilateral vasogenic edema or cytotoxic edema consistent with PRES.
- There should be no alternative diagnosis that better explains the symptoms.

Upon gathering information corresponding to each of these criteria, the tool assigns a boolean value (true or false) for each one. The computation checks all criteria using these steps:

- Define boolean variables for each criterion: A for acute neurological symptoms, B for risk factors, C for brain imaging results, and D for the absence of alternative diagnoses.
- Each variable is evaluated to see if it matches the expected definition, indicating the presence of that criterion.
- The tool ascertains if all four variables are true, meaning the diagnostic criteria are fully satisfied.

The output is straightforward:

- If all four criteria (A, B, C, and D) are true, the result is "Diagnostic criteria are met."
- If any of these criteria are not satisfied, it concludes that the "Diagnostic criteria are not met."

By incorporating these evaluations, the tool provides a comprehensive method to determine whether the conditions for diagnosing PRES are met in a patient.

### Functional reconstruction of the lower lip with fujimori flap and long-term follow-up with clinical and electrophysiologic evaluations [^7a0f5c14]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

The Fujimori gate flap is an innervated flap raised from the nasolabial area for reconstruction of the lower lip. No electromyographic or clinical long-term studies have analyzed the long-term outcomes of lower lip reconstruction performed using this method. The aim of the present study was to assess the outcomes of lower lip reconstruction with the Fujimori gate flap using clinical and electrophysiologic examinations.

Patients and Methods

Ten patients who had been treated with this procedure were evaluated clinically and electrophysiologically. The follow-up period was 1 year for all patients, and the patients underwent regular assessments.

Results

All flaps survived completely, and no wound healing problems were encountered. Four patients underwent revision in the late postoperative period. The electrophysiologic studies revealed the presence of reinnervation in all 10 patients.

Conclusions

In the present study, we found that the Fujimori gate flap is a versatile flap for ideal reconstruction of lower lip defects. Our electrophysiologic assessments showed that the transferred muscle had undergone reinnervation and that the donor area innervation had been preserved. The findings from the serial clinical and electrophysiologic assessments indicated satisfactory results.

### Disorders of vergence eye movements [^5c228d7f]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to re-interpret disorders of vergence in the light of recent studies that view disjunctive eye movements as but one component of three-dimensional gaze control.

Recent Findings

Most natural eye movements combine vergence with saccades, pursuit and vestibular eye movements. Electrophysiological studies in epileptic patients, as well as evidence from monkeys, indicate that frontal and parietal cortex govern vergence as a component of three-dimensional gaze. Clinicians apply Hering's law of equal innervation to interpret disjunctive movements as the superposition of conjugate and vergence commands. However, electrophysiological studies indicate that disjunctive saccades are achieved by programming each eye's movement independently. Patients with internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) may have preserved vergence, which can be recruited to compensate for loss of conjugacy. Vergence may also enable gaze shifts in saccadic palsy. Some forms of nystagmus suppress or change with convergence; co-contraction of the horizontal rectus muscles does not appear to be the explanation. Rather, effects of near viewing on central vestibular mechanisms or differential activation of specific types of extra-ocular muscle fiber may be responsible.

Summary

Interpretation of disorders of vergence is aided by applying a scheme in which their contributions to three-dimensional gaze control is considered.

### Amcinonide [^3296d02e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of amcinonide TOP: 
- Adrenal suppression, Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia: use extreme caution with prolonged use of high-potency corticosteroids or use in areas where the epidermal barrier is disrupted (i.e., skin abrasion), and the use of an occlusive dressing. Limit the use of high-potency corticosteroids to the shortest duration necessary. Avoid applying corticosteroids to areas with disrupted skin barrier or using occlusive dressings. Discontinue Amcinonide immediately. Manage Cushing's syndrome, HPA suppression, hyperglycemia, or other adverse effects under medical guidance.
- Hyperglycemia: use caution in patients with diabetes mellitus. Monitor blood glucose levels regularly, especially in individuals at risk for hyperglycemia. Manage hyperglycemia under medical supervision, considering appropriate interventions or adjustments to diabetes management.
- Mask symptoms of infections: use caution receiving topical corticosteroids to areas of infection, including tuberculosis of the skin, dermatologic fungal infection, and cutaneous or systemic viral infection. Prior to using Amcinonide, perform a thorough examination of the affected area to identify any existing infections. Discontinue Amcinonide and promptly address the underlying infection with appropriate medical treatment.
- Skin ulceration: use caution in patients with markedly impaired circulation or peripheral vascular disease. Regularly monitor high-risk patients, use minimal Amcinonide dose, avoid occlusive dressings, and promote proper wound care. Discontinue Amcinonide, seek medical attention for wound assessment, implement proper wound management, and consider alternative treatments.

### Meperidine hydrochloride (meperidine HCl) [^7049f16f]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

General

Opioid analgesics can have a narrow therapeutic index in certain patient populations, particularly when combined with CNS depressant drugs. The use of these products should be reserved for cases where the benefits of opioid analgesia outweigh the known risks of respiratory depression, altered mental state, and postural hypotension.

Use of meperidine may be associated with increased potential risks and should be used with caution in the following conditions: sickle cell anemia, pheochromocytoma, acute alcoholism; adrenocortical insufficiency (e.g., Addison’s disease); CNS depression or coma; delirium tremens; debilitated patients; kyphoscoliosis associated with respiratory depression; myxedema or hypothyroidism; prostatic hypertrophy or urethral stricture; severe impairment of hepatic, pulmonary, or renal function; and toxic psychosis.

The administration of meperidine may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions. All opioids may induce or aggravate seizures in some clinical settings.

Interactions with Other CNS Depressants

Meperidine should be used with caution and consideration should be given to starting with a reduced dosage in patients who are concurrently receiving other central nervous system depressants including sedatives or hypnotics, general anesthetics, phenothiazines, other tranquilizers, and alcohol. Drug-drug interactions may result in respiratory depression, hypotension, profound sedation, or coma if these drugs are taken in combination with the usual doses of meperidine.

Interactions with Mixed Agonist/Antagonist Opioid Analgesics

Agonist/antagonist analgesics (i.e., pentazocine, nalbuphine, butorphanol, and buprenorphine) should be administered with caution to a patient who has received or is receiving a course of therapy with a pure opioid agonist analgesic such as meperidine. In this situation, mixed agonist/antagonist analgesics may reduce the analgesic effect of meperidine and/or may precipitate withdrawal symptoms in these patients.

Supraventricular Tachycardias

Meperidine should be used with caution in patients with atrial flutter and other supraventricular tachycardias because of a possible vagolytic action which may produce a significant increase in the ventricular response rate.

Convulsions

Meperidine may aggravate preexisting convulsions in patients with convulsive disorders. If dosage is escalated substantially above recommended levels because of tolerance development, convulsions may occur in individuals without a history of convulsive disorders.

Acute Abdominal Conditions

The administration of meperidine or other narcotics may obscure the diagnosis or clinical course in patients with acute abdominal conditions.

### Clinical validity of DSM-5 attenuated psychosis syndrome: advances in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment [^d255894a]. JAMA Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Since the release of the DSM-5 diagnosis of attenuated psychosis syndrome (DSM-5-APS) in 2013, several research studies have investigated its clinical validity. Although critical and narrative reviews have reviewed these progresses, no systematic review has comprehensively summarized the available evidence regarding the clinical validity of DSM-5-APS.

Objective

To provide current evidence on the clinical validity of DSM-5-APS, focusing on recent advances in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.

Evidence Review

A multistep literature search using the Web of Science database, Cochrane Central Register of Reviews, Ovid/PsychINFO, conference proceedings, and trial registries from database inception to June 16, 2019, was conducted following PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines and PROSPERO protocol. Studies with original data investigating individuals diagnosed using DSM-5-APS or meeting comparable criteria were included. The results of the systematic review were summarized in tables and narratively synthesized against established evidence-based antecedent, concurrent, and prognostic validators. A quantitative meta-analysis was conducted to explore the cumulative risk of psychosis onset at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months in individuals diagnosed using DSM-5-APS criteria.

Findings

The systematic review included 56 articles, which reported on 124 validators, including 15 antecedent, 55 concurrent, and 54 prognostic validators. The epidemiological prevalence of the general non-help-seeking young population meeting DSM-5-APS criteria was 0.3%; the prevalence of individuals meeting DSM-5-APS criteria was variable in clinical samples. The interrater reliability for DSM-5-APS criteria was comparable with that of other DSM-5 mental disorders and can be optimized by the use of specific psychometric instruments. DSM-5-APS criteria were associated with frequent depressive comorbid disorders, distress, suicidality, and functional impairment. The meta-analysis included 23 prospective cohort studies, including 2376 individuals. The meta-analytical risk of psychosis onset was 11% at 6 months, 15% at 12 months, 20% at 24 months, and 23% at 36 months. Research into predisposing and precipitating epidemiological factors, neurobiological correlates, and effective treatments for DSM-5-APS criteria has been limited.

Conclusions and Relevance

Over recent years, DSM-5-APS criteria have received substantial concurrent and prognostic validation, mostly driven by research into the clinical high-risk state for psychosis. Precipitating and predisposing factors, neurobiological correlates, and effective treatments are undetermined to date.

### Electrophysiologic techniques in critical illness-associated weakness [^84a4ecf7]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2006). Low credibility.

Neuromuscular disorders are increasingly recognized in the critically ill but conventional electrodiagnostic techniques often provide non-specific results or are hampered by local conditions that prevent adequate disease classification. Muscle fiber inexcitability is a common phenomenon in critical illness myopathy possibly secondary to disordered sodium channel fast inactivation and associated with loss of myosin staining. Direct muscle stimulation techniques, measuring evoked response amplitudes and comparison of nerve and muscle stimulated responses, are recognized methods of demonstrating this phenomenon. Other measures studied in this population include increased compound motor action potential duration, motor unit number estimates and mean step area of individual motor unit potentials during motor unit number estimate studies. An electrophysiologic approach to the study of patients with critical illness associated weakness is proposed.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^eed1955a]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy—electrophysiology study (EPS) yield and prognostic value: The value of an electrophysiological study is uncertain in asymptomatic patients with preserved ventricular function for predicting subsequent sudden cardiac death risk. Electrophysiology studies induce sustained VT in approximately 60% of patients, most of whom have prior spontaneous sustained VT. In patients with primary prevention ICDs, inducible sustained VT did not predict subsequent appropriate ICD shocks; in 1 study including symptomatic patients, those without inducible VT were less likely to receive appropriate ICD shocks. In asymptomatic patients without evidence of VA on ambulatory monitoring, a negative electrophysiology study may have limited value in decision-making for an ICD, and existing studies include most symptomatic patients, making recommendations on asymptomatic patients difficult.

### Gemcitabine [^5b95ec51]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Tables 13 and 14 present the incidence of selected adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, occurring in ≥10% of gemcitabine-treated patients and at a higher incidence in the gemcitabine with cisplatin arm, reported in a randomized trial (Study 4) of gemcitabine with cisplatin (n=69) administered in 21-day cycles as compared to etoposide with cisplatin (n=66) in patients receiving first-line treatment for locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC [see Clinical Studies (14.3)] . Additional clinically significant adverse reactions are provided following Table 14.

Patients in the gemcitabine/cisplatin (GC) arm received a median of 5 cycles and those in the etoposide/cisplatin (EC) arm received a median of 4 cycles. The majority of patients receiving more than one cycle of treatment required dose adjustments; 81% in the GC arm and 68% in the EC arm. The incidence of hospitalizations for adverse reactions was 22% in the GC arm and 27% in the EC arm. The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment for adverse reactions was higher in the GC arm (14% versus 8%). The proportion of patients who were hospitalized for febrile neutropenia was lower in the GC arm (7% versus 12%). There was one death attributed to treatment, a patient with febrile neutropenia and renal failure, which occurred in the GC arm.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of gemcitabine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Blood and Lymphatic System: TMA

Cardiovascular: Congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, supraventricular arrhythmias

Vascular: Peripheral vasculitis, gangrene, capillary leak syndrome

Skin: Cellulitis; pseudocellulitis; severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP); desquamation and bullous skin eruptions

Hepatic: Hepatic failure, hepatic veno-occlusive disease

Pulmonary: Interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, pulmonary eosinophilia, pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)

Nervous System: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES)

### RE-MIND study: a propensity score-based 1: 1 matched comparison of tafasitamab + lenalidomide (L-MIND) versus lenalidomide monotherapy (real-world data) in transplant-ineligible patients with relapsed / refractory (R / R) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [^92b2eb76]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

A 1: 1 estimated propensity score matching methodology ensured balancing of nine pre-specified baseline covariates. The primary analysis set, Matched Analysis Set 25, included patients who received a LEN starting dose of 25 mg/day. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed best objective response rate. Key secondary endpoints included overall survival and complete response rate. Results: 490 patients were enrolled in RE-MIND across 58 centers in the US and Europe, of which 140 fulfilled the ePS matching criteria. The MAS25 included 76 patients each from the two cohorts. Baseline characteristics between cohorts were comparable. The primary endpoint was met with a significantly better ORR of 67. 1% for the L-MIND cohort versus
34. 2% for the RE-MIND cohort.

Conclusions: Significantly better ORR, CR and OS indicate potential synergistic effects of the tafasitamab + LEN combination in ASCT-ineligible R/R DLBCL. ePS-based 1: 1 matching allows robust estimation of the treatment effect of tafasitamab when added to LEN. RE-MIND demonstrates the utility of real-world data in interpreting non-randomized trials. Clinical trial information: NCT04150328. Grzegorz S.

### Emotional concepts shape the perceptual representation of body expressions [^a78e9e5a]. Human Brain Mapping (2024). Medium credibility.

The results of Experiment 2 demonstrated that conceptual knowledge influenced the perceptual representation of body expression as early as 172 ms, with occipitotemporal electrodes being primarily responsible for this prediction. Numerous electrophysiological evidence indicated that N170 reflected the configural process of bodies and faces (Eimer et al.; Lane et al.; Meeren et al.; Righart & de Gelder,). The combination of our results with this evidence indicates that conceptual knowledge of the emotion category shapes the configural process of body expressions. This finding concurs with a previous study, which used RSA to reveal that conceptual knowledge predicts the neural representation of facial expression in the rFG (Brooks et al.), a region that has been considered to be a source of the N170 (Luo et al.). Our results also indicated that the representation of conceptual knowledge influences the early stage of the perceptual process and not the semantic process stage. Meanwhile, a previous electrophysiological study pointed out that emotion concepts contributed to the perception of emotions at a later stage (Fugate et al.). In our electrophysiological experiment (Experiment 2), the task was implicit, which may have led to non‐significant results in perceptual categorization; this assumption is based on another study demonstrating that emotion decoding accuracy declines later in implicit tasks than in explicit tasks (Smith & Smith,).

Moreover, our study revealed that the classification accuracy of six emotion body expressions was significantly higher than chance at 160 ms post‐stimulus and peaked at 214 ms. The time period was later than finding reported in previous reserach, which found that the accuracy of facial expressions reached significance over the chance level for the first time between 31 and 90 ms and peaked between 91 and 150 ms (e.g. Smith & Smith,). Meanwhile, in our recent study using faces without hair, decoding accuracy reached significance at approximately 79 ms and peaked at 290 ms (Li et al.). Another study on the decoding of facial expressions, which also used facial images without hair, showed that decoding accuracy reached significance from 120 ms and peaked at 270 ms (Muukkonen et al.). In the present study, all body images were displayed in grayscale with black clothes and balanced illumination. In short, we suggest that the heterogeneity of time course regarding emotion classification between the findings of our study and those of prior research may be due to the different design of experimental stimuli.

### Prevention of axonal loss after immediate dosage titration of immunoglobulin in multifocal motor neuropathy [^4ddfc7d0]. European Journal of Neurology (2024). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The findings of the present study suggest that in MMN further axonal damage in previously affected nerves can be prevented following continuous IgG treatment using an immediately titrated dosage regimen. Furthermore, the correlation between the axonal loss at both time points and the clinical performance at follow‐up indicates that the electrophysiological findings are of clinical relevance.

Previous clinical and electrophysiological studies have shown conflicting results as to whether continuous IgG treatment can prevent clinical and electrophysiological deterioration in the long‐term disease course. In a study from 2002 on 11 intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)‐treated MMN patients followed for 4–8 years, the Dutch group observed a slight but significant decrease in muscle strength at last follow‐up compared to the maximal improvement following IVIg commencement. This was accompanied by a significant reduction in the CMAP amplitude of most nerves, leading the authors to conclude that progressive axonal loss in MMN is inescapable. These findings were supported by an Italian study from 2004 on 10 IVIg‐treated MMN patients followed for 5–12 years in whom a similar progressive clinical and electrophysiological deterioration took place.

### Assessing spontaneous sensory neuron activity using in vivo calcium imaging [^fccf7eda]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

The proportion of neurons with spontaneous activity in control (∼10%) and CFA inflamed (∼32% on day 1) mice is broadly in line with that previously reported in the literature through electrophysiological studies in rats. So far, few studies have reported on spontaneous activity in sensory neurons using calcium indicators in vivo. In comparison to our baseline data, 2 studies using a GCaMP3 transgenic mouse line, reported much lower levels (0.13%-0.19%) of spontaneously active calcium transients,, and another study using a GCaMP6s mouse line also found a lower proportion of neurons that were spontaneously active at baseline in anaesthetised mice (∼4%). These reports may have underestimated the true proportion of spontaneously active neurons because they used a standard deviation–based method for their analysis. We found this method to be less accurate for predicting spontaneous activity (Supplementary Fig. 1, available at). Another potential reason for why others reported lower levels of spontaneous activity could be because the overall acquisition rate for their recordings was slower in comparison to ours (<0.2-1.7 Hz vs 3.65 Hz). At the temporal resolution of 0.2 Hz, lower frequency firing could more easily be missed. Finally, differences in the levels of spontaneous activity could have been caused by differences in anaesthetic regimens: we used isoflurane in combination with urethane, whereas the study of Chen et al. used ketamine and xylene.Indeed, anaesthesia can impact peripheral neuron excitability, with the proportion of neurons with spontaneous activity reportedly higher (∼14%) in awake animals.

There are many advantages of using in vivo imaging to study spontaneous activity over electrophysiology. One of the major challenges of using electrophysiology is that it is difficult to record spontaneously active nociceptive neurons (eg, compared with A fibres) because they are the smallest in size. By contrast, all sizes and subgroups of sensory neuron can be visualised using GCaMP calcium indicators,, thereby reducing the bias toward recording from a particular fibre type. Electrophysiology is low throughput (tens of neurons per experiment), whereas we typically record from ∼400 to 500 neurons/DRG in an imaging experiment; therefore, imaging is not only faster but also the simultaneous recording of many neurons allows for the examination of coordinated patterns of spontaneous firing. Finally, neurons must be activated to visualise them when using electrophysiology, which can cause neuronal sensitisation and increase spontaneous firing when done repeatedly through receptive field testing.By contrast, no activation is required for visualising neurons before starting the recordings using in vivo imaging.

### Trigeminal nerve involvement in bulbar-onset anti-IgLON5 disease [^d3f9e955]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this article, we describe clinical, electrophysiologic, and radiologic features indicating various degrees of trigeminal nerve injury in 2 cases of bulbar-onset IgLON5-D. Patient 1 had a major complaint of facial burning pain evocative of trigeminal neuropathy. The blink-reflex study was unremarkable, but LEPs brought electrophysiologic evidence of a selective small-fiber dysfunction in both trigeminal nerves, which correlated well with the clinical features. Indeed, although LEPs specifically study A-delta fibers, the blink-reflex loop involves large myelinated fibersand may be preserved in case of a selective small-fiber disease. Electrophysiology and neuroimaging were concordant as both LEPs and MRI abnormalities were more marked on the right side. Patient 2 had no sensitive nor neuralgic symptoms but displayed radiologic and electrophysiologic signs of trigeminal nerve involvement, both were more severe on the left side. The blink-reflex study was abnormal, indicating a large-fiber trigeminal neuropathy. The R1 and R2 responses showed prolonged latencies, suggesting a demyelinating mechanism. In addition, a brainstem dysfunction might also have contributed to the prolonged R2 latencies because these responses rely on polysynaptic pathways running through the dorsolateral pons and medulla.LEPs were not performed because he had no symptom evocative of small-fiber involvement.

### Territory-wide cohort study of Brugada syndrome in hong kong: predictors of long-term outcomes using random survival forests and non-negative matrix factorisation [^c36a37c0]. Open Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

EPS is the hallmark test for risk stratification in BrS and other proarrhythmic conditions. In our study, the positive EPS test was a significant predictor of subsequent spontaneous VT/VF episodes. However, 5 out of 36 patients with a negative EPS test nevertheless went on to develop spontaneous VT/VF. Only 21 out of 76 patients (28%) with a positive EPS had spontaneous VT/VF on follow-up. In other words, 72% of these patients are actually ‘low-risk’ patients. These findings suggest that EPS outcome alone is not a good deciding factor for determining whether patients are at a high or low risk of arrhythmogenesis. Out of the 22 patients who were both asymptomatic and EPS negative, none had developed spontaneous VT/VF. Therefore, this category of BrS patients appears to be truly at low risk of VT/VF and SCD.

Application of machine learning to improve risk prediction

RSF builds hundreds of trees and generates outcome prediction by voting method for analysing right censored survival data.The advantage is that unlike the Cox proportional hazard model, it does not make assumptions about the individual hazard functionand ranks the significance of predictors for spontaneous VT/VF. The advantage of RSF is that the boosting tree structure can capture the nonlinear effects and complex interactions among the variables, which can reduce prediction variance and bias, and improve learning performance.RSF was shown to improve predictive performance for sudden cardiac arrest events in the left ventricular structura predictors of SCD Registryand ventricular tachyarrhythmias in congenital long QT syndrome.

NMF represents a group of algorithms used for dimensional reduction and feature extraction on non-negative data.This permitted hidden features between risk variables to be identified. This non-negativity makes the resulting matrices easier to inspect and makes the interpretation easier for real-world applications, such as identification of hidden stages in embryonic stem cell differentiation,DNA methylation profiling of human cardiac tissueand unsupervised cf-mRNA transcriptome decomposition.NMF was recently used by our teams for mortality risk prediction in acquired long QT syndrome patientsand arrhythmic risk stratification in BrS patients.In this study, these latent factors were then used as inputs an RSF model. We showed that the combined NMF-RSF model provided the best time-to-event outcome predictions, when compared with RSF and Cox regression models.

### Nerve conduction abnormalities beyond conduction block in multifocal motor neuropathy. impact on diagnostic criteria accuracy [^5a060dcf]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, our study highlights the possible advantage of expanding the diagnostic criteria of MMN to include additional nerve conduction parameters beyond CB, significantly improving the diagnostic sensitivity and only marginally reducing the specificity. The frequent occurrence of temporal dispersion and other electrophysiological abnormalities observed in demyelinating or paranodal neuropathies suggests a broader electrophysiological profile in MMN than is currently recognized. Adopting a more inclusive diagnostic framework may facilitate earlier and more accurate diagnoses, reducing the delay in initiating effective IVIg therapy, improving patient outcomes, and facilitating patient inclusion in clinical trials.

Heart Rhythm (2020). High credibility.

Invasive electrophysiological study (EPS)—syncope and conduction disease evaluation: EPS is indicated in patients with syncope and previous myocardial infarction, or other scar-related conditions when syncope remains unexplained after non-invasive evaluation. EPS may be considered in patients with syncope and asymptomatic sinus bradycardia, in a few instances when non-invasive tests (e.g. ECG monitoring) have failed to show a correlation between syncope and bradycardia. EPS may be considered in patients with syncope and bifascicular block, when the mechanism of syncope remains unexplained after non-invasive evaluation. EPS may be helpful in patients with syncope and presence of a cardiac scar, including those with a previous myocardial infarction, or other scar-related conditions, when the mechanism of syncope remains unexplained after non-invasive evaluation.

Invasive electrophysiological study (EPS)—ischemic cardiomyopathy and ICD decision pathways: Patients with ICM without a primary indication for an ICD, EF ≤40%, and non-sustained VT on ambulatory cardiac monitoring are candidates for an EPS according to the findings in the MUSTT trial, in which, 35% of patients with inducible sustained VT had a significantly lower risk of death with an ICD. The MADIT trial initially also utilized an EPS in post-MI patients with an EF ≤30%, and non-sustained VT events to implant an ICD, however, MADIT-II subsequently eliminated the need for an EPS in post-MI patients with an EF ≤30%, and therefore post-MI patients with an EF ≤30% do not currently need to undergo an EPS to guide decisions on whether to implant an ICD. In patients with heart failure and EF ≤35%, an EPS is not recommended for risk assessment for the decision on ICD indication.
