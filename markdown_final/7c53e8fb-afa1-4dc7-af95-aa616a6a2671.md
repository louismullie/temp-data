## Question

Is staph responsible for causing erysipelas?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Staphylococcus aureus (staph) is responsible for causing erysipelas. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how erysipelas is defined and distinguished clinically from cellulitis. Then, I should verify the dominant microbiology for erysipelas across guidelines and reviews. Next, I will examine the specific, and possibly controversial, role of S. aureus (including MRSA) as either a primary cause or as a secondary complicating pathogen. After that, I need to check pathophysiologic coherence with what we see clinically. Finally, I will review diagnostic and treatment implications to ensure the conclusion is clinically actionable and reference-aligned.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. Erysipelas is an acute infection involving the superficial dermis and upper subcutaneous tissue that presents with a sharply demarcated, raised, erythematous plaque; this contrasts with cellulitis, which extends deeper with less-defined borders, so I need to keep that anatomic distinction in mind as I weigh pathogens and treatment decisions.

> I should confirm the core microbiology next. Multiple sources consistently indicate that streptococci — especially Group A Streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), although Groups C and G also occur — are the predominant cause of classic erysipelas, which aligns with long-standing clinical teaching and mechanistic data from patient biopsies and serologies in erysipelas cohorts [^116mEAXB] [^112AqZoA] [^114VQbBJ].

> Wait, let me verify the role of S. aureus specifically. Guidelines and reviews explicitly state S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas and, when it does cause superficial skin infection, it tends to be more suppurative and less diffusely spreading than what we classically call erysipelas; that rarity and clinical phenotype mismatch are important to avoid overattributing nonpurulent erysipelas to staphylococci [^116mEAXB] [^112AqZoA].

> Hmm, wait a minute — one review does say erysipelas can be caused by streptococci or S. aureus, which could suggest a broader pathogen list, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; the preponderance of guideline-based evidence supports streptococci as the primary cause, and the S. aureus attribution in that review likely reflects atypical or complicating presentations rather than classic, nonpurulent erysipelas as strictly defined [^111BLSVZ] [^116mEAXB] [^112AqZoA].

> Let me consider pathophysiology to cross-check plausibility. Erysipelas often involves lymphatic spread and superficial dermal inflammation — processes tightly associated with streptococcal virulence factors — whereas S. aureus classically drives purulent disease with abscess formation, a different lesion biology that points away from staphylococci as the primary cause for nonpurulent erysipelas [^113XSys7] [^116mEAXB].

> I should confirm how staph shows up in this disease spectrum. Local complications of erysipelas — such as bullae or frank abscess — may be secondarily infected by S. aureus, including MRSA, especially when there is delayed therapy or specific host risk factors; that pattern supports staph as a secondary complicating pathogen rather than the initial driver of classic erysipelas [^112kEBGe] [^117Eaoir] [^112AqZoA].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic strategy to avoid overtesting. The yield of cultures in nonpurulent cellulitis and erysipelas is low, and IDSA recommends not obtaining routine blood or skin cultures in typical cases; this matters because low microbiologic yield can create uncertainty and lead to unnecessary staph-directed broadening unless clinical features truly warrant it [^116mEAXB] [^112f7YD2].

> I need to ensure treatment implications align with the likely pathogen. For uncomplicated, nonpurulent erysipelas, empiric therapy should target streptococci, with penicillin-class agents being preferred; the FDA label for penicillin V explicitly includes erysipelas among streptococcal infections, and broader staphylococcal coverage should be reserved for patients with MRSA risk, purulence, or treatment failure suggesting a staphylococcal or mixed process [^116knTPW] [^114fk4T8] [^112AqZoA].

> Hold on, I should verify the MRSA question because it often drives practice. The role of MRSA in classic erysipelas remains controversial and is not routinely presumed in nonpurulent presentations; that said, in purulent infections or when systemic toxicity and risk factors are present, adding MRSA-active therapy is reasonable, in line with broader SSTI principles [^112AqZoA] [^116mEAXB].

> Let me double-check evidence around recurrence to see if it reinforces the streptococcal paradigm. Prophylactic oral penicillin reduces recurrences of leg cellulitis/erysipelas in trials and systematic reviews, which is more consistent with recurrent streptococcal disease than with a staphylococcal pathogenesis, further supporting streptococci as the dominant pathogen in classic erysipelas [^1139Z69g] [^1143GMZE].

> Synthesis and conclusion: I need to be precise here. Classic, nonpurulent erysipelas is caused predominantly by streptococci, especially Group A Streptococcus; S. aureus is an uncommon primary cause, though it may complicate erysipelas secondarily with purulence or abscess formation, and the routine need for anti-staphylococcal (including MRSA) coverage in uncomplicated erysipelas is not supported by guideline-based evidence unless risk factors or purulent features are present [^116mEAXB] [^112AqZoA] [^113XSys7].

> Final answer: No, Staphylococcus aureus is not responsible for causing classic erysipelas; streptococci, particularly Group A Streptococcus, are the primary etiologic agents, with S. aureus appearing rarely as a primary cause and more often as a secondary invader in suppurative complications, which should guide both diagnostic restraint and focused, streptococcus-directed empiric therapy in uncomplicated cases [^116mEAXB] [^112AqZoA] [^116knTPW].

---

No, erysipelas is not caused by Staphylococcus aureus; it is almost always due to **beta-hemolytic streptococci** [^116knTPW] (primarily group A, and less often groups B, C, or G) [^116mEAXB]. S. aureus is a rare cause [^116mEAXB] and is typically associated with purulent or abscessing lesions, not the classic sharply demarcated, non-purulent erysipelas [^113XSys7]. Empiric therapy should target **streptococci** [^112Y49h4]; add anti-staphylococcal coverage only if there is purulence, abscess, or MRSA risk factors [^112AqZoA].

---

## Primary causative organisms of erysipelas

Group A streptococcus (GAS, S. pyogenes) is the **predominant cause of erysipelas**, accounting for most cases [^112Y49h4] [^114VQbBJ]. Other **beta-hemolytic streptococci (groups B, C, and G)** also cause erysipelas, though less often than GAS [^112AqZoA].

---

## Role of staphylococcus aureus in erysipelas

- **Rare involvement**: S. aureus is rarely implicated in erysipelas and is not considered a primary causative organism [^116mEAXB].

- **Association with purulence**: When S. aureus is involved, it typically presents with purulent or abscessing lesions, which are not characteristic of classic erysipelas [^112kEBGe].

- **Clinical distinction**: Erysipelas is characterized by sharply demarcated, non-purulent lesions [^112AqZoA], whereas S. aureus infections usually present with purulent, abscess-forming lesions [^116mEAXB].

---

## Clinical features distinguishing erysipelas from staphylococcal infections

| **Feature** | **Erysipelas (streptococcal)** | **Staphylococcal infections** |
|-|-|-|
| Lesion appearance | - Sharply demarcated <br/> - Raised <br/> - Non-purulent [^116mEAXB] | - Poorly demarcated <br/> - Purulent <br/> - Abscess-forming [^114JW9ff] |
| Common sites | - Face <br/> - Lower extremities [^112AqZoA] | - Anywhere <br/> - Often associated with abscesses [^111tWNDR] |
| Systemic symptoms | - Fever <br/> - Chills <br/> - Malaise | - Variable <br/> - Often localized |
| Complications | - Lymphangitis <br/> - Recurrence [^112kEBGe] | - Abscess formation <br/> - Necrosis [^114JW9ff] |

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Clinical diagnosis**: Erysipelas is primarily diagnosed clinically based on characteristic lesions and systemic symptoms [^116mEAXB].

- **Laboratory tests**: Blood cultures and skin cultures are not routinely recommended [^112Y49h4] due to low yield [^112f7YD2].

- **Differentiation**: Clinical presentation and lesion characteristics help differentiate erysipelas from staphylococcal infections [^112AqZoA].

---

## Treatment implications

Empiric therapy should initially target **streptococci** — the primary causative organisms of erysipelas [^112Y49h4]. Add **staphylococcal coverage** only if there is clinical suspicion of purulence or abscess or MRSA risk [^111tWNDR] [^112AqZoA].

---

## Conclusion

Erysipelas is primarily caused by **beta-hemolytic streptococci**, particularly group A streptococcus. Staphylococcus aureus is rarely involved and is typically associated with purulent or abscessing lesions, not classic erysipelas. Therefore, initial empiric antibiotic therapy should target streptococci, with anti-staphylococcal coverage added only when clinically indicated [^112Y49h4].

### WSES/GAIS/WSIS/SIS-E/AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections [^112AqZoA]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

Erysipelas is a fiery red, tender, and painful plaque with well-demarcated edges, commonly caused by Streptococcus spp., usually S. pyogenes. S. aureus rarely causes erysipelas.

Erysipelas is distinguished clinically from cellulitis by two features: the lesions are raised above the level of the surrounding skin, and there is a clear line of demarcation between involved and uninvolved tissue. Streptococci are the primary cause, whereas the role of S. aureus, specifically MRSA, remains controversial.

- **Treatment**: Antibiotic therapy is recommended for 5 days, which may be extended to 10 days if symptoms do not resolve. Intravenous antibiotics are advised if there are signs of systemic inflammation.

- **Empiric antibiotic regimens (normal renal function)**:
	- Target pathogens include S. aureus and streptococci, as CA-MRSA is unusual.

- **Outpatient therapy or step down**:
	- **One of the following oral antibiotics**:
		- Amoxicillin-clavulanate 1 g every 8 hours
		- Cephalexin 500 mg every 6 hours
	- In patients at risk for CA-MRSA, which includes those with immunocompromised status, personal or household contact with MRSA infection or colonization in the past 12 months, prior antibiotic use for 5 days during the last 90 days, or in those who do not respond to first-line therapy, add one of the following oral antibiotics:
		- Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole 160/800–320/1600 mg every 12 hours
		- Minocycline 100 mg every 12 hours
		- Doxycycline 100 mg every 12 hours

### Cutaneous bacterial infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes in infants and children [^113XSys7]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) are among the most common bacterial infections in children. The medical burden of SSSIs, particularly abscesses, has increased nationwide since the emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. SSSIs represent a wide spectrum of disease severity. Prompt recognition, timely institution of appropriate therapy, and judicious antimicrobial use optimize patient outcomes. For abscesses, incision and drainage are paramount and might avoid the need for antibiotic treatment in uncomplicated cases. If indicated, empiric antimicrobial therapy should target Streptococcus pyogenes for nonpurulent SSSIs, such as uncomplicated cellulitis, and Staphylococcus aureus for purulent SSSIs, such as abscesses.

### Common bacterial skin infections [^113Mk8Jr]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Family physicians frequently treat bacterial skin infections in both office and hospital settings. Common skin infections include cellulitis, erysipelas, impetigo, folliculitis, and furuncles and carbuncles.

- **Cellulitis**: An infection of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue characterized by poorly demarcated borders, usually caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus species.

- **Erysipelas**: A superficial form of cellulitis with sharply demarcated borders, almost exclusively caused by Streptococcus.

- **Impetigo**: Caused by Streptococcus or Staphylococcus, leading to the lifting of the stratum corneum and the commonly seen bullous effect.

- **Folliculitis**: An inflammation of the hair follicles, often bacterial, commonly caused by Staphylococcus. If the infection is deeper and involves more follicles, it progresses to the furuncle and carbuncle stages, often requiring incision and drainage.

All of these infections are typically diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated empirically. For antibiotic treatment, a medication active against gram-positive organisms, such as penicillinase-resistant penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones, should be selected. Children, patients with diabetes, or those with immunodeficiencies are more susceptible to gram-negative infections and may require a second- or third-generation cephalosporin.

### Management of common bacterial infections of the skin [^112kEBGe]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Bacterial skin infections commonly encountered in the community include impetigo, folliculitis/furunculosis, simple abscesses, erysipelas, and other nonnecrotizing cellulitis. The review focuses on recent epidemiological, bacteriological, and therapeutic advances.

- **Recent findings**: Impetigo and erysipelas occur in about 20 and 1 person per 1000 per year, respectively. The main risk factors for erysipelas are toe-web intertrigo and lymphedema. The true incidence of furunculosis is unknown, whereas outbreaks in small communities are reported worldwide. *Staphylococcus aureus* is the predominant pathogen for impetigo and furunculosis, and methicillin-resistant strains play a growing role in both diseases. Erysipelas is mainly caused by streptococci, whereas local complications (i.e. abscesses or blisters) may be due to staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant strains in involved geographic areas. Recent trends for treating impetigo and furunculosis predate community-acquired methicillin-resistant *S. aureus*. For outbreaks of furunculosis, stringent decolonization measures are showing promise, whereas there is no validated therapeutic regimen for chronic furunculosis. Trends for erysipelas involve ambulatory treatments and reduced duration of antibiotics.

- **Summary**: Despite better epidemiological or bacteriological knowledge of common bacterial skin infections, the exact role of methicillin-resistant staphylococci needs regular surveys in involved geographic areas. Antibiotic treatment must be active on staphylococci and, to a lesser degree, on streptococci.

### Skin findings of Staphylococcus aureus toxin-mediated infection in relation to toxin encoding genes [^113tL9nx]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome and toxic shock syndrome are associated with exfoliatins and superantigens, respectively, and are easy to distinguish in their usual presentation. However, there is confusion about the mild forms of these two staphylococcal diseases. These mild forms are both designated as "staphylococcal scarlet fever" despite differences in their pathophysiology and clinical presentation. Our study aimed to distinguish between the clinical characteristics of the rash associated with exfoliatins and the rash associated with superantigens.

- **Methods**: Patients were selected from the French National Reference Center for Staphylococci. We retrospectively compared the clinical characteristics of patients with a generalized rash during Staphylococcus aureus infection. Patients who met the criteria of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome or toxic shock syndrome were excluded. The patients were classified into two groups depending on the presence of a gene coding for exfoliatin or for superantigenic toxin.

- **Results**: We included 13 cases with exfoliatin and 9 with superantigens. The patients of the exfoliatin group were more likely to have facial involvement, fold involvement, and a superficial focus of infection. In the second group, S. aureus was isolated from a deeper focus in 8 of 9 patients.

- **Conclusion**: Mild forms of S. aureus toxin-mediated infection affect the pediatric population. Examination made it possible to distinguish an exanthema associated with an exfoliatin from one associated with a superantigen.

### Interventions for the prevention of recurrent erysipelas and cellulitis [^1139Z69g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). High credibility.

Erysipelas and cellulitis, collectively referred to as cellulitis, are common bacterial skin infections that typically affect the lower extremities. Despite their significant morbidity, the evidence supporting various prevention strategies remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the beneficial and adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis or other prophylactic interventions for the prevention of recurrent episodes of cellulitis in adults aged over 16.

- **Search methods**: We searched databases up to June 2016, including the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. Additionally, five trial registry databases were examined, and reference lists of included studies and reviews were checked for further relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We also reviewed two sets of dermatology conference proceedings and BIOSIS Previews.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials evaluating any therapy for the prevention of recurrent cellulitis.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently conducted study selection, data extraction, bias assessment, and analyses. The primary prespecified outcome was the recurrence of cellulitis during and after treatment. Secondary outcomes included incidence rate, time to next episode, hospitalization, quality of life, development of antibiotic resistance, adverse reactions, and mortality.

- **Main results**: We included six trials with a total of 573 evaluable participants, aged on average between 50 and 70.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: results of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network's PATCH II trial [^115M9d34]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). High credibility.

Cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg is a common, painful infection of the skin and underlying tissue, with repeat episodes causing significant morbidity and leading to high health service costs. This study assessed whether prophylactic antibiotics prescribed after an initial episode of cellulitis of the leg could prevent further occurrences.

The study was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial involving patients recently treated for leg cellulitis, conducted across 20 hospitals. Randomization was executed using a computer-generated code, and treatments were allocated by post from a central pharmacy. Participants were enrolled for a maximum of three years, receiving their randomized treatment for the first six months.

The trial included 123 participants, representing 31% of the target due to slow recruitment. A majority (79%) had experienced one episode of cellulitis before joining the study. The primary outcome, which was the time to recurrence of cellulitis, included all randomized participants and was blinded to treatment allocation. The results indicated that treatment with penicillin reduced the risk of recurrence by 47% [HR 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26–1.07, P = 0.08]. In the penicillin V group, 12 out of 60 participants (20%) had a repeat episode, compared with 21 out of 63 (33%) in the placebo group. This results in a number needed to treat (NNT) of eight participants to prevent one repeat episode of cellulitis [95% CI NNT(harm) 48 to ∞ to NNT(benefit) 3]. No difference was observed between the groups in the number of participants with oedema or ulceration.

### Treatment of skin and soft tissue infections [^1145FNnq]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacterial etiologies of skin and soft tissue infections, ranging in virulence from very mild to limb- and life-threatening. Antibiotic coverage recommendations are varied and subject to controversy, while antibiotic resistance patterns are evolving with many different biochemical mechanisms. Rapid bacterial identification using mass spectrometry is on the horizon. Therapeutic considerations should include cost and adherence issues.

### A systematic review showing the lack of diagnostic criteria and tools developed for lower-limb cellulitis [^114AhEfn]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and associated subcutaneous tissue, with 60% of cases affecting the lower limb. Erysipelas is a form of cellulitis that presents with more marked superficial inflammation.

The diagnosis of cellulitis can be challenging, with 31% of patients who present with suspected lower-limb cellulitis in the emergency department (ED) subsequently being given a diagnosis other than cellulitis. Routine biochemical and haematological blood tests and blood cultures are not specific for cellulitis. This results in avoidable hospital admissions and unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics. Definitive diagnostic criteria could potentially improve clinical care and the validity of clinical research on cellulitis by ensuring appropriate case definition. However, there are currently no agreed diagnostic criteria for cellulitis.

Patients with cellulitis commonly present to primary care services or the ED. A recent U.K. cellulitis research priority setting partnership ranked questions on 'diagnostic criteria' as important for future cellulitis research.

The aim of this systematic review was to identify and conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of studies that have developed or validated diagnostic criteria or tools for lower-limb cellulitis.

We define diagnostic criteria or tools as the inclusion of a minimum of one variable that has been tested against at least one clinical feature. In this paper, 'cellulitis' refers to lower-limb cellulitis only. Lower-limb erysipelas is included as it is clinically indistinguishable in many cases.

### Penicillin V potassium [^116knTPW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The dosage of Penicillin V should be determined according to the sensitivity of the causative microorganisms and the severity of the infection, and adjusted to the clinical response of the patient. The usual dosage recommendations for adults and children 12 years and over are as follows:

- **Streptococcal infections**: Mild to moderately severe infections of the upper respiratory tract, including scarlet fever and erysipelas, should be treated with 125 to 250 mg (200,000 to 400,000 units) every 6 to 8 hours for 10 days.

- **Pneumococcal infections**: Mild to moderately severe respiratory tract infections, including otitis media, require 250 to 500 mg (400,000 to 800,000 units) every 6 hours until the patient has been afebrile for at least 2 days.

- **Staphylococcal infections**: Mild skin and soft tissue infections (for which culture and sensitivity tests should be performed) require 250 to 500 mg (400,000 to 800,000 units) every 6 to 8 hours.

- **Fusospirochetosis (Vincent's infection) of the oropharynx**: Mild to moderately severe infections should be treated with 250 to 500 mg (400,000 to 800,000 units) every 6 to 8 hours.

For the prevention of recurrence following rheumatic fever and/or chorea, administer 125 mg to 250 mg (200,000 to 400,000 units) twice daily on a continuing basis. For prophylaxis against bacterial endocarditis in patients with congenital heart disease or rheumatic or other acquired valvular heart disease undergoing dental or upper respiratory tract surgical procedures, administer 2 grams of penicillin V (1 gram for children under 60 lbs.) 1 hour before the procedure, followed by 1 gram (500 mg for children under 60 lbs.) thereafter.

Changes to outcomes during the trial

Given the difficulties in achieving the target recruitment rate of 400 participants, some analyses that had been planned were subsequently dropped. These included:

- **Planned subgroup analysis**: Based on patients with and without recellulitis prior to entry into the trial.
- **Separate models for predictors of response**: Based on ipsilateral and contralateral repeat episodes.
- **Assessment of the impact**: On the quality of life of patients with cellulitis, assessed only in those identified during the acute stage of the index episode.

If possible, data from PATCH I and II trials will be combined to inform these analyses at a later date.

Sample size

Sample size estimates assumed a 50% reduction in relapse rate relative to placebo based on a log-rank test for time-to-event data. This provided 80% power, at a two-sided significance level of 5%, with 20% loss to follow-up. A 50% reduction relative to placebo was determined as a minimum clinically useful gain, given the lengthy duration and possible inconvenience of long-term prophylaxis.

Previous studies suggest a range of possible recurrence rates for patients with cellulitis, ranging from 30% to 50%, depending on the population being studied and the duration of follow-up. A conservative relapse rate for the placebo group of 25% was chosen, which resulted in a required sample size of 400 participants. Assuming that the relapse rate for those with recellulitis would be higher (35–50%), this also provided sufficient power.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network's PATCH II trial [^115iRHvp]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

The protective effects of penicillin V in preventing recurrence of cellulitis did not vary between the treatment phase and the non-treatment follow-up phase of the trial (nonproportional hazards, P = 0.7). The difference in relapse rates during the treatment phase was −8%, 95% CI (−17% to 1%): 2/60 (penicillin V) and 7/63 (placebo). During the post-treatment phase, the between-group difference was −9%, 95% CI (−24% to 7%): 10/56 (penicillin V) and 14/53 (placebo).

Of the 33 participants with at least one confirmed episode of cellulitis, three had two repeat episodes, three had three, two had four, and one had seven repeats. There was no significant difference in the total number of repeat episodes between the treatment groups (P trend = 0.10).

Sixty participants had no oedema and/or ulceration at baseline. Of these, 35 (58%) developed oedema and/or ulceration during the trial, although only nine experienced a repeat episode. There were no significant between-group differences in the presence of oedema or ulceration either during the treatment phase (penicillin V 37% vs. placebo 21%; P = 0.31), or overall (penicillin V 67% vs. placebo 53%; P = 0.40).

During the trial, 36 participants experienced at least one of the prespecified adverse events of interest. None of the seven deaths were considered to be treatment or trial-related. The total number of adverse events of special interest was similar for both treatment groups: nausea (13 penicillin V and 11 placebo); diarrhoea (14 penicillin V and 18 placebo); thrush (three penicillin V and three placebo).

### Erysipelas caused by group A streptococcus activates the contact system and induces the release of heparin-binding protein [^114VQbBJ]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Bacterial skin infections, such as erysipelas or cellulitis, are characterized by fever and a painful erythematous rash. Despite the high prevalence of these infections, little is known about the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. This is partly due to the fact that a bacterial diagnosis is often difficult to attain. To gain insight into the pathogenesis of erysipelas, we investigated samples obtained from infected and noninfected areas of skin from 12 patients with erysipelas.

Bacterial cultures, detection of specific streptococcal antibodies in convalescent sera, and immunohistochemical analyses of biopsies indicated group A streptococcal etiology in 11 of the 12 patients. Electron micrographs of erythematous skin confirmed the presence of group A streptococcal cells and showed limited solubilization of the surface-attached M protein. Degradation of high-molecular-weight kininogen and upregulation of the bradykinin-1 receptor in inflamed tissues indicated activation of the contact system in 11 patients. Analyses of the release of the vasoactive heparin-binding protein (HBP) showed increased levels in the infected areas compared with the noninfected areas.

The results suggest that group A streptococci induce contact activation and HBP release during skin infection, which likely contribute to the symptoms seen in erysipelas: fever, pain, erythema, and edema.

### Cellulitis and erysipelas: Prevention [^116LAGsJ]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Low credibility.

Cellulitis is a common problem caused by spreading bacterial inflammation of the skin, characterized by redness, pain, and lymphangitis. Up to 40% of affected individuals experience systemic illness. Erysipelas, a form of cellulitis, is marked by superficial inflammation and typically affects the lower limbs and the face. The most common pathogens in adults are streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. Both conditions can result in local necrosis and abscess formation, with about one quarter of affected individuals experiencing more than one episode within three years.

- **Methods and outcomes**: We conducted a systematic overview aimed at addressing the clinical question: What are the effects of treatments to prevent recurrence of cellulitis and erysipelas? We searched Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other key databases up to February 2015. Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version.

- **Results**: At this update, 323 studies were retrieved from electronic databases. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 184 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Title and abstract appraisal led to the exclusion of 170 studies, with further review of 14 full publications. Among these, one systematic review was added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for one PICO combination.

- **Conclusions**: In this systematic overview, we categorized the efficacy of two interventions based on information related to their effectiveness and safety.

### Staphylokinase promotes the establishment of Staphylococcus aureus skin infections while decreasing disease severity [^116MUGxC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Skin infections are frequently caused by Staphylococcus aureus and can lead to fatal sepsis. The microbial mechanisms controlling the initiation and progression from mild skin infection to severe disseminated infection remain poorly understood. Using a combination of clinical data and in vitro and ex vivo assays, we show that staphylokinase, secreted by S. aureus, promotes the establishment of skin infections in humans and increases bacterial penetration through skin barriers by activating plasminogen. However, when infection is established, the interaction between staphylokinase and plasminogen does not promote systemic dissemination but induces the opening and draining of abscesses, thereby decreasing disease severity in neutropenic mice. Additionally, increased staphylokinase production is associated with noninvasive S. aureus infections in patients. Our results highlight the dual roles of staphylokinase in S. aureus skin infections, both promoting the establishment of infections and decreasing disease severity.

### Current epidemiology, etiology, and burden of acute skin infections in the United States [^112bxqm3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) are characterized by microbial invasion of the skin layers and underlying soft tissues, ranging in severity from mild to life-threatening. Among the most common infections encountered in both ambulatory and hospital settings, SSTIs in the United States have increased dramatically in incidence in recent decades. The burden of SSTIs and their complications is considerable, resulting in hospitalization, surgery, bacteremia, and, on occasion, death. Although *Staphylococcus aureus* and beta-hemolytic streptococci represent traditional culprits in SSTI, more recently, Gram-negative organisms, as well as mixed pathogens (both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria), have become significant causes of acute skin infections. These include healthcare-associated (HCA) complicated SSTIs (cSSTIs), such as diabetic foot infections.

Several schemes exist for SSTI classification, each typically relying on numerous variables such as the location where the infection occurred, causative pathogen, progression rates, depth of extension, and clinical presentation or severity. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) proposed a new categorization schema: "acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections" (ABSSSI). In formal guidance for the development of drugs to treat such infections, the FDA defined ABSSSI as bacterial cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infection, or major cutaneous abscess, with a lesion size area of at least 75 cm² (measured by area of redness, edema, or induration).

### Guideline for the management of acute sore throat [^112rGMcj]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2012). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to inflammatory markers, the ESCMID 2012 guidelines recommend not to routinely obtain inflammatory markers (such as ESR, CRP, procalcitonin, anti-DNase B) for the assessment of patients with acute sore throat.

### Erysipelas-like inflammation following breast surgery [^113nja3q]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Impaired lymph drainage is an inevitable consequence of any form of surgery that disrupts lymphatics, resulting in a degree of lymphoedema that may vary from subtle to dramatic. Although classically involving an entire limb, lymphoedema may be more localized, confined to only a small area such as a skin flap. Infection is a well-recognized complication of lymphoedema. However, not all inflammatory episodes occurring in the setting of lymphatic dysfunction can be clearly attributed to infection, as this article demonstrates.

Five patients presented over a 5-year period with distinctive erysipelas-like inflammation affecting the breast, which occurred several weeks following reduction mammaplasty in four patients and breast reconstruction in one patient. No clinical response was obtained with standard antibiotics. This inflammatory problem may represent a previously unreported complication of breast surgery, with an incidence of 4% following reduction mammaplasty. Recent research supports the notion that this type of episode is most likely due to a non-infective inflammatory process related to lymphatic dysfunction induced by surgery.

### Penicillin V potassium [^114fk4T8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of penicillin V potassium and other antibacterial drugs, penicillin V potassium should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Penicillin V potassium tablets are indicated in the treatment of mild to moderately severe infections due to penicillin G-sensitive microorganisms. Therapy should be guided by bacteriologic studies (including sensitivity tests) and by clinical response.

- **Note**: Severe pneumonia, empyema, bacteremia, pericarditis, meningitis, and arthritis should not be treated with penicillin V during the acute stage. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed.

The following infections will usually respond to an adequate dosage of penicillin V:

- **Streptococcal infections (without bacteremia)**: Mild-to-moderate infections of the upper respiratory tract, scarlet fever, and mild erysipelas.

- **Note**: Streptococci in groups A, C, G, H, L, and M are very sensitive to penicillin. Other groups, including group D (enterococcus), are resistant.

### Ery-tab [^112sAqkH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Ery-tab® is intended to reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Ery-tab® and other antibacterial drugs. Ery-tab® should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Ery-tab® tablets are indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the following diseases:

- **Upper respiratory tract infections**: Mild to moderate infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Haemophilus influenzae (when used with adequate doses of sulfonamides, as many strains of H. influenzae are not susceptible to the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved).

- **Lower respiratory tract infections**: Mild to moderate severity infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Streptococcus pneumoniae.

- **Listeriosis**: Caused by Listeria monocytogenes.

- **Respiratory tract infections**: Infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae.

- **Skin and skin structure infections**: Mild to moderate severity infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus, though resistant staphylococci may emerge during treatment.

### Risk factors for abscess formation in patients with superficial cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg [^117Eaoir]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Superficial cellulitis of the leg (erysipelas) is a frequent skin infection, with abscess formation being the most common local complication. Determinants of abscess formation in patients with leg cellulitis have not yet been clearly established.

- **Objective**: To assess the risk factors for abscess formation in patients with leg cellulitis.

- **Methods**: The clinical, biological, and bacteriological records of all patients referred to the dermatology department of a university hospital for superficial cellulitis of the leg during a 3-year period were retrospectively reviewed. Using univariate and multivariate analysis, patients' main characteristics at baseline were compared between the group of patients who developed an abscess and the group who did not.

- **Results**: A total of 164 patients (93 female, 71 male), with a mean age of 65 ± 18 years, were included. Abscess occurred in 13 cases (8%). The following general factors were positively associated with abscess formation: male sex, smoking, alcohol abuse, and delayed introduction of antibiotic treatment. Based on multivariate analysis, only chronic alcohol abuse (odds ratio [OR] 4.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08–20.57) and delayed antibiotic treatment initiation (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.02–2.04) remained independently associated with abscess formation.

- **Conclusions**: Alcohol abuse and delayed initiation of antibiotic treatment are risk factors for abscess formation in patients with cellulitis of the leg. Patients with these predictors must be monitored carefully for abscess formation.

### Erythromycin [^11673Fna]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Erythromycin is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of designated organisms in the following diseases:

- **Upper respiratory tract infections**: Mild to moderate infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae (when used concomitantly with adequate doses of sulfonamides, since many strains of H. influenzae are not susceptible to the typical erythromycin concentrations achieved. See appropriate sulfonamide labeling for prescribing information).

- **Lower respiratory tract infections**: Mild to moderate infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae or Streptococcus pyogenes.

- **Listeriosis**: Caused by Listeria monocytogenes.

- **Pertussis (whooping cough)**: Caused by Bordetella pertussis. Erythromycin is effective in eliminating the organism from the nasopharynx of infected individuals, rendering them noninfectious. Some clinical studies suggest that erythromycin may be helpful in the prophylaxis of pertussis in exposed, susceptible individuals.

- **Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae**.

- **Skin and skin structure infections**: Mild to moderate infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus (resistant staphylococci may emerge during treatment).

- **Diphtheria**: Infections due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae, as an adjunct to antitoxin, to prevent the establishment of carriers and to eradicate the organism in carriers.

- **Erythrasma**: In the treatment of infections due to Corynebacterium minutissimum.

### Current epidemiology, etiology, and burden of acute skin infections in the United States [^112f7YD2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

- **Etiology**: Because the microbiology of SSTIs remains elusive, arguably more so than in other common conditions such as bloodstream infections, clinicians must make many treatment decisions based on an educated guess regarding which pathogens are causing infection. In cellulitis, in particular, it is challenging to obtain a microbiologic diagnosis. When a culture is obtained, the probability of isolating an organism is low. For example, needle aspiration of inflamed skin is positive in only 5%–40% of cases, while punch biopsy cultures yield results in 20%–30%, primarily due to Streptococcus spp. and S. aureus. Since yield from blood cultures is low (≤ 5%) in patients with cellulitis and erysipelas, cultures are not routinely recommended; therefore, SSTIs with known pathogens are not necessarily representative of all SSTIs. This fact certainly makes the etiology of the vast majority of SSTIs uncertain.

- As with uncomplicated cellulitis, the majority of SSTIs where purulent material can be obtained are caused by Gram-positive pathogens, mainly S. aureus and streptococci. Gram-positive pathogens are typically identified in more than 80% of culture-positive skin infections (such as abscess or surgical-site infections), and S. aureus is the most common cause of culture-confirmed SSTIs in the United States. At the same time, because of the emergence and spread of resistance among both Gram-positive (in particular, MRSA) and Gram-negative organisms, treatment of SSTIs has become more challenging over the last two decades.

### Nafcillin [^111gs3rP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Nafcillin is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by penicillinase-producing staphylococci that have shown susceptibility to the drug. It is critical to perform culture and susceptibility tests initially to determine the causative organism and its susceptibility to the drug.

Nafcillin should not be used for infections caused by organisms susceptible to penicillin G. If susceptibility tests indicate that the infection is due to a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus species, therapy with Nafcillin for Injection should be discontinued and alternative therapy should be provided.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Nafcillin for Injection and other antibacterial drugs, this medication should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empirical selection of therapy.

### Group a streptococcal infections of the skin: molecular advances but limited therapeutic progress [^1123MEes]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

With the sequencing of several Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) genomes, there have been major advances in understanding the pathogenesis of group A Streptococcus-associated diseases. This review focuses on group A Streptococcus skin infections and summarizes data published in the English language medical literature in 2004 and 2005.

- **Recent findings**: Group A Streptococcus shows enormous and evolving molecular diversity driven by horizontal transmission between group A Streptococcus strains and between group A Streptococcus and other streptococci. Acquisition of prophages accounts for much of the diversity, conferring both virulence through phage-associated virulence factors and increased bacterial survival against host defenses. Studies of group A Streptococcus isolates outside the US also question the generalizability of classic group A Streptococcus M serotype associations with specific disease entities such as acute rheumatic fever and necrotizing fasciitis. The distinction between throat and skin group A Streptococcus has become blurred. Although there have been few advances in treatment of group A Streptococcus skin infections, developments towards group A Streptococcus vaccines are promising.

- **Summary**: The diversity of group A Streptococcus remains a challenge for vaccine development. As acute rheumatic fever and streptococcal pyoderma occur predominantly in disadvantaged populations, international funding support will be necessary for any group A Streptococcus vaccine to have a sustained impact on the global burden of disease.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network's PATCH II trial [^114FmLXa]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Data collection was achieved through routine telephone follow-up calls from the coordinating centre, conducted every three months during the treatment phase and every six months during the follow-up phase. Participants were asked to complete a study diary to record adverse events and health service resource use. If participants experienced a repeat episode of cellulitis, they were asked to inform the trial staff immediately. Any repeat episodes not reported were identified during regular telephone interviews.

Health service resource use was captured using diaries, which included inpatient admissions, outpatient visits, GP consultations, other prescribed drugs for cellulitis, and time away from normal daily activities.

The primary outcome measure for the trial was the time to the next episode of cellulitis. The next confirmed episode was defined as the next episode of cellulitis (in either leg) that had been reported by the participant and confirmed by a medical practitioner. The episode was considered to have started on the first day of symptoms reported by the participant. Episodes reported by participants that resulted in antibiotic treatment but were not confirmed by a medical professional were documented as self-reported cases and included in the sensitivity analysis.

Secondary outcome measures included:

- **Proportion of participants**: The proportion of participants with repeat episodes of cellulitis at the end of the treatment phase and at the end of the non-intervention follow-up phase.
- **Number of repeat episodes**: The total number of repeat episodes of cellulitis.
- **New conditions**: The proportion of participants with new oedema and/or ulceration.

### Burden, risk factors, and infectious complications of cellulitis and erysipelas in US adults and children in the emergency department setting [^116Ncg2p]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Little is known about the use and burden of emergency department (ED) visits for cellulitis/erysipelas in the United States.

- **Objective**: To determine the prevalence, risk factors, complications, and cost of emergency care for cellulitis/erysipelas in the United States.

- **Methods**: Cross-sectional study of the 2006 to 2016 National Emergency Department Sample, including a 20% sample of US ED visits (N = 320,080,467).

- **Results**: The mean annual incidence of ED visits with a primary diagnosis of cellulitis/erysipelas was 2.42 to 3.55 per million adult and 1.14 to 2.09 per million pediatric ED visits. ED visits for cellulitis/erysipelas decreased significantly from 2006 to 2015 (Rao-Scott chi-square, P < .0001). ED visits with versus without a primary diagnosis of cellulitis/erysipelas were associated with public or no insurance and lower household income quartiles and were more likely to occur during weekends and summer months. The mean cost of ED visits for cellulitis/erysipelas more than doubled in adults (from $720 to $1680) and tripled in children (from $939 to $2,823) from 2006 to 2016. ED visits for cellulitis/erysipelas were associated with multiple risk factors and increased infectious complications.

- **Limitations**: No data on cellulitis and erysipelas treatment or recurrence.

- **Conclusion**: There is a substantial and increasing burden of ED visits for cellulitis/erysipelas in the United States. Many ED visits occurred for uncomplicated cellulitis/erysipelas, in part because of healthcare disparities.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: 2012 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^113QZa4G]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, particularly concerning chronic group A streptococcal carriers, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend not attempting to identify or administer antimicrobial therapy in patients with asymptomatic group A streptococcus carriage. This recommendation is due to the low likelihood of these carriers spreading GAS pharyngitis to close contacts, and their minimal risk of developing suppurative or non-suppurative complications, such as acute rheumatic fever.

### Current and future trends in antibiotic therapy of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infections [^116pjXgX]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2016). Low credibility.

In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued recommendations and guidance on developing drugs for the treatment of skin infections using a new definition of acute bacterial skin and skin-structure infection (ABSSSI). The new classification includes cellulitis, erysipelas, major skin abscesses, and wound infection with significant skin involvement, clearly identifying a severe subset of skin infections. The main goal of the FDA was to better identify specific infections where the advantages of a new antibiotic could be precisely estimated through quantifiable parameters, such as improvement in lesion size and systemic signs of infection.

Before the spread and diffusion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in skin infections, antibiotic therapy was relatively straightforward. Using an empiric approach, a β-lactam was the preferred therapy, and cultures from patients were rarely obtained. With the emergence of MRSA in the community setting, initial ABSSSI management has been changed and readdressed. Dalbavancin, oritavancin, and tedizolid are new drugs, approved or in development for ABSSSI treatment, that have also proved efficient against MRSA. Dalbavancin and oritavancin have a long half-life and can be dosed less frequently. This, in turn, allows treatment of patients with ABSSSI in an outpatient setting, avoiding hospitalization or potentially allowing earlier discharge, without compromising efficacy.

In conclusion, the characteristics of long-acting antibiotics could represent an opportunity for the management of ABSSSI and…

### Staphylococcal skin and soft tissue infections [^114JW9ff]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Staphylococcus aureus is the most common bacteria causing purulent skin and soft tissue infections. Many disease-causing S. aureus strains are methicillin-resistant; thus, empiric therapy should be given to cover methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Bacterial wound cultures are important for characterizing local susceptibility patterns. Definitive antibiotic therapy is warranted, although there are no compelling data demonstrating the superiority of any one antibiotic over another. Antibiotic choice is predicated by infection severity, local susceptibility patterns, and drug-related safety, tolerability, and cost. Response to therapy is expected within the first days; 5 to 7 days of therapy is typically adequate to achieve cure.

### Recognizing and managing staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in the emergency department [^111ix2Fm]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Low credibility.

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a superficial blistering disorder caused by exfoliative toxin-releasing strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Bacterial toxins are released hematogenously, and following a prodromal fever and exquisite tenderness of the skin, patients present with tender erythroderma and flaccid bullae, followed by superficial generalized exfoliation. The head-to-toe directed exfoliation lasts up to 10 to 14 days without scarring, provided there is proper treatment.

Children younger than 6 years are predominantly affected due to their lack of toxin-neutralizing antibodies and the immature renal system's inability to excrete the causative exotoxins. The epidemiology, pathophysiology, and essential primary skin lesions used to diagnose staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome are summarized for the pediatric emergency medicine physician.

### Ceftriaxone sodium [^111Q68iC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Before instituting treatment with ceftriaxone, appropriate specimens should be obtained for isolation of the causative organism and for determination of its susceptibility to the drug. Therapy may be initiated prior to obtaining results of susceptibility testing.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of ceftriaxone for injection, USP and other antibacterial drugs, ceftriaxone for injection, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

Ceftriaxone for injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible organisms:

- **Lower respiratory tract infections**: Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, or Serratia marcescens.

- **Acute bacterial otitis media**: Caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producing strains), or Moraxella catarrhalis (including beta-lactamase producing strains).

Note: In one study, lower clinical cure rates were observed with a single dose of ceftriaxone compared to 10 days of oral therapy.

### Skin and soft tissue infections [^117XRnu9]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Primary skin infections, such as pyodermas, typically begin with some breach in the epidermis, leading to infection by organisms like Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, which normally colonize the skin. Host-associated factors like immunosuppression, vasculopathy, neuropathy, or decreased lymphatic drainage may predispose individuals to skin infections. The clinical syndromes associated with skin infections are often distinctive and are defined most simply by anatomic distribution. Although they are often mild and self-limited, skin infections can become more aggressive and involve deeper structures, including fascia and muscle. This article discusses skin and soft tissue infections, including impetigo; hair follicle-associated infections (such as folliculitis, furuncles, and carbuncles); erysipelas; cellulitis; necrotizing fasciitis; pyomyositis; septic bursitis; and tenosynovitis.

### The role of bacterial skin infections in atopic dermatitis: Expert statement and review from the International Eczema Council Skin Infection Group [^111UekoT]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2020). Low credibility.

Untreated bacterial skin infection in atopic dermatitis (AD) may become systemic and lead to life-threatening complications including sepsis, endocarditis, and bone and joint infections. Despite the significant morbidity caused by bacterial skin infection in AD, there is a lack of consensus on how to define and treat associated bacterial colonization and infection. Although there are many diagnostic criteria for AD itself, there are no validated diagnostic criteria for infected AD.

The International Eczema Council, a group of approximately 100 experts in AD worldwide, has recently initiated a taskforce to define the role of bacterial skin infections and their management in AD through consensus statements in an effort to provide level D evidence. It is hoped that input from clinical experts will contribute to better defining the wide-ranging clinical presentations of S. aureus infection in AD and, more importantly, to identify better those who may benefit from existing or novel antimicrobial treatments.

Based on a systematic search of the literature, including terms for AD and 'infection', 'bacteria', 'staphylococcus aureus', and 'microbiome' (detailed search strategy available on request), this narrative review defines the clinical features of bacterial infection in AD and our understanding of the host and bacterial factors that influence microbial colonization and virulence.

### Erythromycin lactobionate [^1114K6Vc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Erythromycin lactobionate for injection, USP is indicated for the treatment of infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the diseases listed below when oral administration is not possible or when the severity of the infection requires immediate high serum levels of erythromycin. Intravenous therapy should be replaced by oral administration at the appropriate time.

- **Upper respiratory tract infections**: These include infections of mild to moderate degree caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci); Streptococcus pneumoniae (Diplococcus pneumoniae); and Haemophilus influenzae. The latter requires concurrent use of adequate doses of sulfonamides, as many strains of H. influenzae are not susceptible to the erythromycin concentrations ordinarily achieved (see appropriate sulfonamide labeling for prescribing information).

- **Lower respiratory tract infections**: These are infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (Diplococcus pneumoniae).

- **Respiratory tract infections due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae**.

- **Skin and skin structure infections**: These are infections of mild to moderate severity caused by Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus (note that resistant staphylococci may emerge during treatment).

- **Diphtheria**: Used as an adjunct to antitoxin for infections due to Corynebacterium diphtheriae to prevent the establishment of carriers and to eradicate the organism in carriers.

- **Erythrasma**: In the treatment of infections due to Corynebacterium minutissimum.

### Coagulase-negative staphylococcus skin and soft tissue infections [^114sYJVp]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms can be part of the normal flora of human skin but also act as pathogens in skin and soft tissue infections. This review summarizes infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococcus species based on research from the PubMed database:

- **Medical conditions and infection types**: abscess, cellulitis, cyst, draining, epidermidis, felon, folliculitis, furuncle, infection, osteomyelitis, paronychia, sinus

- **Organisms and components**: auricularis, biofilm, capitis, coagulase, contaminant, epidermidis, haemolyticus, hominis, lugdunensis, mecA, microbiome, negative, saprophyticus, simulans, staphylococcus

- **Characteristics and properties**: indolent, skin, soft, systemic, tissue, virulence, virulent, vulvar

Relevant papers and references generated by the search were reviewed.

Skin and soft tissue infections have been observed to be caused by many coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms:

- **Staphylococcus species**: Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus lugdunensis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus simulans

Coagulase-negative staphylococcus skin infections predominantly present as abscesses and paronychia. They are most common in elderly patients or those who are immunosuppressed and tend to be broadly susceptible to antibiotic treatment.

In conclusion, although less common, coagulase-negative staphylococcus organisms can result in skin and soft tissue infections, particularly in older and/or immunocompromised individuals.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network's PATCH II trial [^113ko84Y]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

The statistical analysis of the primary outcome included all randomized participants with no exclusions (intention-to-treat). Time to recurrence was assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Participants with limited follow-up data, including deaths, were included in the analysis but censored accordingly. Results presented are unadjusted (taken as the primary analysis), as well as adjusted for stratification factors.

Additional sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were planned: (i) including self-confirmed episodes of cellulitis; (ii) excluding randomized participants who did not start treatment or who reported a relapse within 4 weeks of randomization, as such 'relapses' probably reflect incomplete treatment of the index episode rather than a true recurrence.

For the secondary outcomes, a test for nonproportional hazards was used to assess whether there was a significant change in treatment effect over time. The percentage difference in events between penicillin V and placebo for each treatment phase was calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The proportion of participants reporting multiple episodes was compared across treatment groups using a χ² test for trend. The proportion of participants with new oedema and/or ulceration subsequent to enrolment in the trial was compared across treatment arms using a χ² test and presented by treatment phase.

Although the planned subgroup analysis and predictors of response model were of limited value due to lack of power, exploratory analyses for the stratification factors were conducted.

### World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines for management of skin and soft tissue infections [^116mEAXB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The term "non-necrotizing cellulitis" has been used to incorporate two entities, erysipelas and cellulitis, which are diffusely spreading skin infections not associated with suppurative foci. However, a fine distinction exists between erysipelas and cellulitis. Erysipelas has a clear line of demarcation between involved and uninvolved tissue and lesions raised above the surrounding normal skin. Cellulitis involves deeper layers of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue and has less distinctive features than erysipelas. These conditions are commonly caused by streptococcal species, usually beta-hemolytic streptococci (usually group A). Staphylococcus aureus rarely causes erysipelas and cellulitis, but such infections usually are more suppurative and less diffuse.

Superficial, non-necrotizing infections caused by certain strains of group A-streptococcal (GAS) may be associated with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, characterized by rapid progression of septic shock and organ failure. As previously discussed, the recent dramatic increase in community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) makes the empiric treatment of staphylococcal infections troubling.

- **Diagnostic challenges**: Diagnostic studies have a low yield in patients with superficial soft tissue infections and usually do not help with the diagnosis. However, establishing whether cellulitis represents signs of a deeper and/or more severe infectious process can be difficult but is of considerable importance as the majority of necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs) are originally diagnosed as cellulitis. Lack of clinical response could be due to unusual organisms, resistant strains of staphylococcus or streptococcus, or deeper processes.

### Epidemiology of ophthalmia neonatorum: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111YXZdw]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

- **Incidence of ON stratified by causative organisms**: Staphylococcus spp. were the most frequently isolated gram-positive bacteria associated with the incidence of ON, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, the least frequent. Serratia marcescens were the most frequently isolated gram-negative bacteria associated with the incidence of ON, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the least frequent.

- **Resistance patterns by causative organism**: The pooled resistance of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli is highest to Penicillin [91.67% (95% CI 87.96–94.31%), I² = 0.00% for Staphylococcus aureus; 100.00% (95% CI 0.00–100.00%), I² = 0.00% for Escherichia coli], and lowest to Gentamicin [20% (95% CI 15.85–24.91%), I² = 0.00% for Staphylococcus aureus; 59.30% (95% CI 52.36–65.89%), I² = 0.00% for Escherichia coli]. The pooled resistance of Pseudomonas spp. and Klebsiella spp. to Gentamicin is 50% (95% CI 43.11–56.89%, I² = 0.00%) and 50.02% (95% CI 27.50–72.53%, I² = 95.3%), respectively.

### Endogenous endophthalmitis secondary to erysipelas [^1173ooF5]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Low credibility.

A 64-year-old woman with chronic right arm lymphoedema presented with progressive and painful vision loss in the right eye following a diagnosis of erysipelas in the ipsilateral arm. Visual acuity was light perception. Biomicroscopy revealed marked conjunctival injection, decreased corneal transparency, and an inflammatory mass in the anterior chamber, which precluded fundoscopy. The ocular ultrasonography features were consistent with acute endophthalmitis, and the patient was admitted to the hospital.

A systemic evaluation, including a complete physical examination, echocardiography, and blood tests, ruled out other sources of infection besides the cutaneous site. Blood cultures were positive for group A Streptococcus. A diagnosis of unilateral acute endophthalmitis due to group A Streptococcus bacteraemia secondary to erysipelas was made and successfully treated with optimal medical care, including prompt intravitreal and systemic antibiotic administration. Despite resolution of the infectious process, visual acuity did not improve.

### Severe Streptococcus pyogenes infections, United Kingdom, 2003–2004 [^112KutKg]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Diseases caused by the Lancefield group A streptococcus, Streptococcus pyogenes, are among the most varied in terms of clinical spectra and severity, ranging from the ubiquitous pharyngitis to rarer life-threatening manifestations such as necrotizing fasciitis. Interest in these diseases was renewed after the United States and several countries in Europe reported increasing numbers of cases of invasive S. pyogenes disease during and since the 1980s. These apparent changes triggered several rapid global initiatives, coordinated by a World Health Organization working group, including review of microbiologic diagnostic methods and commencement of enhanced surveillance in several countries during the mid-1990s.

In light of these changes, a cohesive network of 11 countries was formed in September 2002 to gain insight into the epidemiology of severe S. pyogenes disease across Europe. This network was funded by the European Union Fifth Framework Programme. To meet the Strep-EURO program objectives, the United Kingdom and other countries established population-based enhanced surveillance of severe S. pyogenes disease. Surveillance was undertaken to obtain accurate and comparable measures of overall and disease-specific incidence among participants and to compare demographic, risk factor, and clinical profiles of case-patients between countries, as well as microbiologic characteristics of S. pyogenes isolates collected.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: results of the UK Dermatology Clinical Trials Network's PATCH II trial [^114Yi8dG]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

No difference was found in the effect of penicillin V on the primary endpoint between those with a history of previous cellulitis [HR = 0.38, 95% CI (0.11–1.27)] and no previous history [HR = 0.60, 95% CI (0.25–1.44), P interaction = 0.58]. Similarly, no difference in the effect on the primary endpoint was found between those with oedema and/or ulceration at baseline [HR = 0.48, 95% CI (0.16–1.43)] and those without [HR = 0.58, 95% CI (0.23–1.50), P interaction = 0.79].

- **Resource use and cost**: There were no significant differences between the groups in any resource items or costs. Overall, there was a non-statistically significant reduction in NHS costs favouring penicillin V: (penicillin V – placebo) −£93, 95% CI (−£372 to £128), P = 0.45, as well as in broader societal costs: −£215, 95% CI (−£1155 to £707), P = 0.67. A full cost-effectiveness analysis for PATCH I and II will be published separately.

The number of hospital admissions for the treatment of repeat episodes was low in both groups. Of the 36 repeat episodes recorded during the trial, only three resulted in a hospital admission (two in penicillin V; one in placebo).

### Omadacycline for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections [^1177KWYj]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

For clinical trial assessments of antimicrobial therapeutics in skin and soft tissue infections, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines an acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) as cellulitis/erysipelas, a wound infection, or a major cutaneous abscess that has an area of erythema, induration, or fluctuance of ≥ 75 cm². This definition guides how antibiotics are developed for ABSSSI, which can differ from clinical practice by excluding common diseases such as diabetic foot infections, animal bite wounds, and catheter-associated skin infections.

Omadacycline is an aminomethylcycline, which is a semisynthetic tetracycline antibiotic, approved in the United States for the treatment of ABSSSI and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. It demonstrated potent in vitro activity against common gram-positive aerobes, many gram-negative aerobes, anaerobes, and atypical bacterial pathogens. Omadacycline is active against strains that exhibit common mechanisms of resistance specific to tetracyclines, such as efflux pumps and ribosomal protection, as well as strains that are resistant to currently available antibiotics for ABSSSI, including β-lactams, glycopeptides, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones. This article reports the integrated analysis of two phase III studies of omadacycline in the treatment of ABSSSI.

### Advanced imaging for detection of foci of infection in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia- Can a scan save lives [^116gLzJy]. Seminars in Nuclear Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Skin pathologies, such as eczema, burns, or skin disruption from ulceration, increase the chance of blood contamination during sampling. This can rarely lead to false positive blood cultures, suggesting Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) when bloodstream infection is not present. However, patients with skin pathologies are at higher risk of bloodstream infection as their skin barrier provides less defense to infection. Thus, it can be difficult to differentiate SAB and contamination in a patient with a fever and disrupted skin.

- **Direct tissue invasion**: Tissue invasion can be particularly severe with virulent strains of S. aureus such as Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL) and/or methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). When these types of S. aureus enter the bloodstream, the clinical outcomes are increasingly poor. As such, foci detection and directed treatment must be prioritized. PVL acts to suppress the local immune response, resulting in deep skin infection and large abscesses, requiring incision and drainage. PVL also characteristically causes necrotic lung abscesses and cavities. Such cavitations are visible on chest radiography or CT, appearances that should lead to consideration of SAB in patients without a prior diagnosis. MRSA may also form abscesses, with the additional challenge of drug resistance.

- **Haematogenous spread (blood)**: S. aureus can spread to numerous body sites via the blood, including lung, bone, muscle, heart valves, and brain. The infection pattern in those who inject drugs, in whom SAB is common, may be lung abscesses and right-sided endocarditis due to the bloodstream spread.

### Prophylactic antibiotics for the prevention of cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg: Results of the UK dermatology clinical trials network's PATCH II trial [^1143GMZE]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2012). High credibility.

Cellulitis (erysipelas) of the leg is a common, painful infection of the skin and underlying tissue. Repeat episodes are frequent, causing significant morbidity and resulting in high health service costs.

- **Objectives**: To assess whether prophylactic antibiotics prescribed after an episode of cellulitis of the leg can prevent further episodes.

- **Methods**: This was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial including patients recently treated for an episode of leg cellulitis. Recruitment took place in 20 hospitals. Randomization was conducted using a computer-generated code, and treatments were allocated by post from a central pharmacy. Participants were enrolled for a maximum of 3 years and received their randomized treatment for the first 6 months of this period.

- **Results**: Participants (n = 123) were randomized, accounting for 31% of the target due to slow recruitment. The majority (79%) had experienced one episode of cellulitis upon entry into the study. The primary outcome of time to recurrence of cellulitis included all randomized participants and was blinded to treatment allocation. The hazard ratio (HR) indicated that treatment with penicillin reduced the risk of recurrence by 47% [HR 0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26–1.07, P = 0.08]. In the penicillin V group, 12 out of 60 (20%) had a repeat episode compared with 21 out of 63 (33%) in the placebo group. This equates to a number needed to treat (NNT) of eight participants to prevent one repeat episode of cellulitis [95% CI NNT(harm) 48 to ∞ to NNT(benefit) 3]. No difference was found between the two groups in the number of participants with oedema, ulceration, or related adverse events.

### Erysipeloid: A review [^113yAYpq]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Erysipeloid is an occupational skin infection caused by the traumatic penetration of *Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae*. The disease is characterized clinically by an erythematous edema with well-defined and raised borders, usually localized to the back of one hand and/or fingers. Vesicular, bullous, and erosive lesions may also be present. The lesion may be asymptomatic or accompanied by mild pruritus, pain, and fever.

In addition to cutaneous infection, *E. rhusiopathiae* can cause endocarditis, which may be acute or subacute. Endocarditis is rare and has a male predilection. It usually occurs in previously damaged valves, predominantly the aortic valve. Endocarditis does not occur in patients with valvular prostheses and is not associated with intravenous drug misuse.

Diagnosis of localized erysipeloid is based on the patient's history (occupation, previous traumatic contact with infected animals or their meat) and clinical picture (typical skin lesions, lack of severe systemic features, slight laboratory abnormalities, and rapid remission after treatment with penicillin or cephalosporin).

### Assessment of antibiotic treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^111PYrVi]. JAMA Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

The optimum antibiotic treatment for cellulitis and erysipelas lacks consensus. The available trial data do not demonstrate the superiority of any agent, and data are limited on the most appropriate route of administration or duration of therapy.

To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic therapy for non-surgically acquired cellulitis, the following databases were searched up to June 28, 2016: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (2016, issue 5), Medline (from 1946), Embase (from 1974), and Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Information System (LILACS) (from 1982). In addition, five trials databases and the reference lists of included studies were searched. Further searches of PubMed and Google Scholar were undertaken from June 28, 2016, to December 31, 2018.

Randomized clinical trials comparing different antibiotics, routes of administration, and treatment durations were included. For data collection and analysis, the standard methodological procedures of the Cochrane Collaboration were used. For dichotomous outcomes, the risk ratio and its 95% confidence interval were calculated. A summary of findings table was created for the primary end points, adopting the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The primary outcome was the proportion of patients cured, improved, recovered, or symptom-free or symptom-reduced at the end of treatment, as reported by the trial. The secondary outcome was any adverse event.

A total of 43 studies with various comparisons were analyzed.

### Severe relapsing erysipelas associated with chronic Streptococcus agalactiae vaginal colonization [^113BXFZc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

We report a case of severe erysipelas of the breast due to infection with Streptococcus agalactiae and demonstrate that strains isolated from the skin were closely related to strains isolated from the vagina. This is consistent with the claim that the vagina acts as a reservoir for S. agalactiae isolates responsible for erysipelas relapse. The hypervirulence of strains and the persistence of a bacterial reservoir may explain why 5 months of prophylaxis with penicillin V (1 million U daily) was necessary to achieve permanent eradication of vaginal carriage and to prevent recurrence of erysipelas caused by S. agalactiae infection.

### Erysipelas: recognition and management [^115bGS1k]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Erysipelas is an acute bacterial infection of the dermis and hypodermis that is associated with clinical inflammation. It is a specific clinical type of cellulitis and, as such, should be studied as a distinct entity. Erysipelas is generally caused by group A streptococci; it is highly probable that streptococcal toxins also play a role, which could, in part, help explain the clinical inflammation.

Erysipelas of the leg is the main clinical type encountered, with the face, arm, and upper thigh being the other most common sites for occurrence. After a sudden onset, areas of erythema and edema characteristically enlarge with well-defined margins. Athlete's foot is the most common portal of entry for the disease. Erysipelas is generally associated with high fever, and adenopathy and lymphangitis are sometimes present.

At the time of diagnosis, it is important to look for clinical markers of severity (local signs and symptoms, general signs and symptoms, co-morbidity, social context) which would necessitate hospitalization. There are many differential diagnoses, particularly in the case of atypical dermo-hypodermitis. Some bacterial infections may have specific clinical aspects or may lead to a diagnosis of cellulitis. Necrotizing cellulitis or fasciitis are life-threatening diseases and a rapid diagnosis is important.

Other noninfectious types of cellulitis have been reported in many diseases, both localized or generalized. The biology of typical erysipelas is of little value in diagnosis, and a laboratory workup is usually not required.

### Ery [^117PESBh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Clinical pharmacology**: The exact mechanism by which erythromycin reduces lesions of acne vulgaris is not fully known; however, the effect appears to be due in part to the antibacterial activity of the drug.

- **Microbiology**: Erythromycin acts by inhibition of protein synthesis in susceptible organisms by reversibly binding to 50S ribosomal subunits, thereby inhibiting translocation of aminoacyl transfer-RNA and inhibiting polypeptide synthesis. Antagonism has been demonstrated in vitro between erythromycin, lincomycin, chloramphenicol, and clindamycin.
