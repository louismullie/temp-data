## Question

Does keflex cover staph

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Keflex (cephalexin) covers Staphylococcus aureus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the exact organism and resistance phenotypes involved. Then, I should verify cephalexin's intrinsic activity and labeled indications. Next, I will review contemporary guidelines for skin and soft tissue infections, cellulitis, and osteoarticular disease. After that, I should examine randomized and pediatric data to see how cephalexin performs in real-world settings. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and note exceptions and dosing considerations, making sure I anchor each point to authoritative sources.

> Let me first confirm the organism and resistance context. Staphylococcus aureus exists as methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and this distinction determines whether beta-lactams like cephalexin are effective, because MRSA carries mecA-mediated resistance to essentially all beta-lactams, including first-generation cephalosporins [^f1f23a9c] [^80830b04].

> I need to check cephalexin's intrinsic activity. The FDA labeling explicitly states cephalexin is active against Staphylococcus aureus, but only methicillin-susceptible isolates, and lists skin and skin structure infections and bone infections caused by susceptible S. aureus as approved indications, which confirms activity against MSSA but not MRSA [^f1f23a9c] [^d412c847].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about empiric therapy. I should review guideline positions for nonpurulent cellulitis, where streptococci predominate. The IDSA recommends beta-lactam therapy targeting streptococci, with cephalexin as an accepted oral option, and advises against routine MRSA coverage unless specific risk factors are present, which aligns with cephalexin's MSSA activity and supports its use when MRSA risk is low [^4da44506] [^d3b916cf].

> Next, I should review pediatric osteoarticular infections, because cephalexin is often used for step-down therapy. The PIDS/IDSA guideline recommends high-dose oral cephalexin as preferred convalescent therapy for MSSA acute bacterial arthritis and acute hematogenous osteomyelitis after initial parenteral therapy, reflecting reliable oral bioavailability and clinical efficacy in this setting, again contingent on MSSA susceptibility [^83d2ff88] [^bdb3a477].

> I will now examine direct clinical evidence. In a multicenter RCT of uncomplicated cellulitis without abscess, adding trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin did not improve cure rates versus cephalexin alone, reinforcing that routine MRSA coverage is unnecessary in typical nonpurulent cellulitis and that cephalexin monotherapy is effective when streptococci and MSSA are the likely pathogens [^0148392e] [^7ab94428].

> But wait, what if the infection is purulent or MRSA risk is high? I should double-check purulent SSTI guidance. For abscesses or purulent infections, IDSA recommends incision and drainage with MRSA-active agents such as TMP-SMX, clindamycin, or doxycycline, and if both streptococcal and MRSA coverage are desired, combining TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam like cephalexin is reasonable, which underscores that cephalexin alone is insufficient when MRSA is suspected or confirmed [^7b5071a7] [^4da44506].

> Let me consider dosing and pharmacodynamics, especially in children. Standard pediatric dosing of 25–50 mg/kg/day divided QID is commonly used, but pharmacokinetic modeling suggests that higher weight-based regimens may be needed to reliably achieve 40–50% fT > MIC for MSSA with higher MICs, and some pediatric osteoarticular guidance endorses higher-dose cephalexin for step-down, while observational data suggest TID regimens can be effective in selected contexts, though QID remains standard in many practices [^b63c2b73] [^227a035a] [^5e74c90d].

> I should confirm special scenarios. In diabetic foot infections, cephalexin is an appropriate oral option for mild infections targeting gram-positive cocci, including MSSA, when no MRSA risk factors are present, and therapy should be adjusted to culture results and clinical response, which fits the general principle of using cephalexin for MSSA when risk is low [^f5af4713] [^01a1a470].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure my bottom line is precise. Yes, Keflex (cephalexin) covers Staphylococcus aureus, but only methicillin-susceptible strains; it does not cover MRSA, so empiric use should be guided by the likelihood of MRSA based on local epidemiology and patient-specific risk factors, with cephalexin monotherapy appropriate for nonpurulent cellulitis and as oral step-down for MSSA osteoarticular infections, while MRSA-active therapy is indicated for purulent infections or when MRSA risk is substantial [^f1f23a9c] [^4da44506] [^83d2ff88].

---

Keflex (cephalexin) **covers methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA)** [^f1f23a9c] but **does not cover methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)** [^80830b04]. It is a first-generation cephalosporin indicated for skin and soft tissue infections [^d412c847] caused by MSSA, and is commonly used when MRSA risk is low [^4da44506]. For MRSA, use clindamycin, doxycycline, TMP-SMX, or vancomycin depending on severity and local resistance patterns [^168387e9] [^4da44506].

---

## Spectrum of activity against staphylococcus species

Cephalexin exhibits **activity against MSSA**, the most common community-acquired staphylococcal pathogen [^f1f23a9c]. It is **inactive against MRSA** because MRSA produces the mecA gene, which encodes penicillin-binding protein 2a (PBP2a), resulting in resistance to all beta-lactam antibiotics, including cephalexin [^80830b04] [^f1f23a9c].

---

## Clinical indications and guidelines

Cephalexin is indicated for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) [^d412c847] caused by susceptible staphylococcal species, particularly MSSA [^f1f23a9c]. According to the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines, cephalexin is recommended for mild to moderate SSTIs when MRSA risk is low or when MSSA is confirmed by culture [^4da44506] [^66470b52].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting efficacy

Several clinical studies and trials have demonstrated the **effectiveness of cephalexin in treating MSSA infections**:

- A randomized controlled trial comparing cephalexin alone versus cephalexin combined with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for uncomplicated cellulitis found no significant difference in clinical cure rates, indicating that cephalexin alone is effective in nonpurulent cellulitis where MRSA is not suspected [^0148392e] [^7ab94428].
- Pediatric studies have shown cephalexin to be effective in treating uncomplicated skin infections caused by MSSA, with clinical cure rates comparable to other oral antibiotics [^68b43bef].

---

## Limitations and resistance considerations

While cephalexin is effective against MSSA, it is **not effective against MRSA** [^f1f23a9c]. Therefore, it is crucial to assess MRSA risk factors before prescribing cephalexin empirically. Risk factors for MRSA include:

- Prior history of MRSA infection or colonization
- Recent hospitalization or healthcare exposure
- Recent antibiotic use
- Presence of purulent infection or abscess

In cases where MRSA risk is high or confirmed, **alternative antibiotics** such as clindamycin, doxycycline, TMP-SMX, or vancomycin should be considered based on severity and local resistance patterns [^168387e9] [^4da44506].

---

## Clinical outcomes and safety profile

Cephalexin is generally well-tolerated, with common adverse effects including gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and mild allergic reactions [^notfound]. Serious adverse effects, such as anaphylaxis or severe hypersensitivity reactions, are rare but possible, particularly in patients with a history of beta-lactam allergies [^611d8295].

---

## Comparison with other antibiotics

| **Antibiotic** | **Mssa coverage** | **Mrsa coverage** | **Clinical considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Cephalexin | Yes | No | - First-line for mild MSSA infections <br/> - Well-tolerated |
| Clindamycin | Yes | Yes (variable) | - MRSA coverage <br/> - Watch for inducible resistance |
| Doxycycline | Yes | Yes (variable) | - MRSA coverage <br/> - Not for children < 8 years |
| TMP-SMX | Yes | Yes | - MRSA coverage <br/> - Poor streptococcal coverage |
| Vancomycin | Yes | Yes | - Reserved for severe MRSA infections <br/> - IV only |

---

## Clinical scenarios where cephalexin is appropriate

Cephalexin is appropriate in the following clinical scenarios:

- Uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections caused by MSSA [^d412c847]
- Nonpurulent cellulitis where MRSA risk is low [^4da44506]
- Pediatric skin infections caused by MSSA [^68b43bef]
- Patients with beta-lactam allergy (excluding immediate hypersensitivity reactions) [^ebbf918e]

---

## Clinical scenarios where cephalexin is not recommended

Cephalexin is **not recommended** in the following scenarios:

- Confirmed or high risk of MRSA infection [^4da44506]
- Severe infections requiring hospitalization or parenteral therapy
- Patients with immediate hypersensitivity reactions to beta-lactam antibiotics [^ebbf918e]

---

Keflex (cephalexin) **effectively covers MSSA** and is a first-line option for mild to moderate SSTIs when MRSA risk is low. It does not cover MRSA, so clinicians should assess risk factors and local resistance patterns before prescribing. For MRSA, use clindamycin, doxycycline, TMP-SMX, or vancomycin based on severity and susceptibilities [^168387e9].

### Clinical trial: comparative effectiveness of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus cephalexin alone for treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized controlled trial [^7ab94428]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) is the most common organism isolated from purulent skin infections. Antibiotics are usually not beneficial for skin abscess, and national guidelines do not recommend CA-MRSA coverage for cellulitis, except purulent cellulitis, which is uncommon. Despite this, antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are prescribed commonly and increasingly for skin infections, perhaps due, in part, to lack of experimental evidence among cellulitis patients. We test the hypothesis that antibiotics targeting CA-MRSA are beneficial in the treatment of cellulitis.

Methods

We performed a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial from 2007 to 2011. We enrolled patients with cellulitis, no abscesses, symptoms for <1 week, and no diabetes, immunosuppression, peripheral vascular disease, or hospitalization (clinicaltrials.gov NCT00676130). All participants received cephalexin. Additionally, each was randomized to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or placebo. We provided 14 days of antibiotics and instructed participants to continue therapy for ≥1 week, then stop 3 days after they felt the infection to be cured. Our main outcome measure was the risk difference for treatment success, determined in person at 2 weeks, with telephone and medical record confirmation at 1 month.

Results

We enrolled 153 participants, and 146 had outcome data for intent-to-treat analysis. Median age was 29, range 3-74. Of intervention participants, 62/73 (85%) were cured versus 60/73 controls (82%), a risk difference of 2.7% (95% confidence interval, -9.3% to 15%; P = .66). No covariates predicted treatment response, including nasal MRSA colonization and purulence at enrollment.

Conclusions

Among patients diagnosed with cellulitis without abscess, the addition of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin did not improve outcomes overall or by subgroup.

### Twice-and thrice-daily cephalexin dosing for Staphylococcus aureus infections in children [^b63c2b73]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cephalexin is used for the treatment of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) infections in children. Although 4 times daily dosing is recommended, less frequent dosing regimens are often prescribed to improve treatment acceptability and adherence. We developed a population pharmacokinetic model of cephalexin in children to determine a twice-daily (BID) and thrice-daily (TID) cephalexin dosing regimen for MSSA infections.

Methods

A population pharmacokinetic model was developed using a nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach. The dataset used was from a prospective open-label pharmacokinetic study of orally administered cephalexin in 12 children 1-16 years of age with bone and joint infections. Simulations were performed to determine a BID and TID dosing regimen so that ≥90% of children in this age group would achieve the pharmacodynamic target for MSSA (ie, time that the free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration of the bacteria for at least 40% of the dosing interval).

Results

The final model was 1 compartment with a transit compartment model to account for delay in oral absorption. For BID dosing, doses of 22-45 and 80mg/kg were required for MSSA with minimum inhibitory concentrations of 1-2 and 4mg/L, respectively. For TID dosing, the respective required doses were 15-25 and 45mg/kg.

Conclusions

Our study proposes a BID and TID cephalexin dosing regimen that can be prospectively evaluated. Through reducing the dose frequency of this widely prescribed antibiotic, we can reduce the medication burden for children and improve treatment compliance for MSSA infections.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Cephalexin is a cephalosporin antibacterial drug [see Microbiology (12.4)]

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption:

Cephalexin is acid stable and may be given without regard to meals. Following doses of 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1 g, average peak serum levels of approximately 9, 18, and 32 mcg/mL, respectively, were obtained at 1 hour. Serum levels were detectable 6 hours after administration (at a level of detection of 0.2 mcg/mL).

Distribution:

Cephalexin is approximately 10% to 15% bound to plasma proteins.

Excretion:

Cephalexin is excreted in the urine by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Studies showed that over 90% of the drug was excreted unchanged in the urine within 8 hours. During this period, peak urine concentrations following the 250 mg, 500 mg, and 1 g doses were approximately 1000, 2200, and 5000 mcg/mL respectively.

Drug Interactions:

In healthy subjects given single 500 mg doses of cephalexin and metformin, plasma metformin mean Cmaxand AUC increased by an average of 34% and 24%, respectively, and metformin mean renal clearance decreased by 14%. No information is available about the interaction of cephalexin and metformin following multiple doses of either drug.

12.4 Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Cephalexin is a bactericidal agent that acts by the inhibition of bacterial cell-wall synthesis.

Resistance

Methicillin-resistant staphylococci and most isolates of enterococci are resistant to cephalexin. Cephalexin is not active against most isolates of Enterobacter spp., Morganella morganii, and Proteus vulgaris. Cephalexin has no activity against Pseudomonas spp ., or Acinetobacter calcoaceticus . Penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae is usually cross-resistant to beta-lactam antibacterial drugs.

Antimicrobial Activity

Cephalexin has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]

Gram-positive bacteria

Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible isolates only)

Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible isolates)

Gram-negative bacteria

Escherichia coli

Haemophilus influenzae

Klebsiella pneumoniae

Moraxella catarrhalis

Proteus mirabilis

### Effect of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole vs cephalexin alone on clinical cure of uncomplicated cellulitis: a randomized clinical trial [^0148392e]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Emergency department visits for skin infections in the United States have increased with the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). For cellulitis without purulent drainage, β-hemolytic streptococci are presumed to be the predominant pathogens. It is unknown if antimicrobial regimens possessing in vitro MRSA activity provide improved outcomes compared with treatments lacking MRSA activity.

Objective

To determine whether cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole yields a higher clinical cure rate of uncomplicated cellulitis than cephalexin alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Multicenter, double-blind, randomized superiority trial in 5 US emergency departments among outpatients older than 12 years with cellulitis and no wound, purulent drainage, or abscess enrolled from April 2009 through June 2012. All participants had soft tissue ultrasound performed at the time of enrollment to exclude abscess. Final follow-up was August 2012.

Interventions

Cephalexin, 500 mg 4 times daily, plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 320 mg/1600 mg twice daily, for 7 days (n=248 participants) or cephalexin plus placebo for 7 days (n=248 participants).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome determined a priori in the per-protocol group was clinical cure, defined as absence of these clinical failure criteria at follow-up visits: fever; increase in erythema (>25%), swelling, or tenderness (days 3-4); no decrease in erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 8-10); and more than minimal erythema, swelling, or tenderness (days 14-21). A clinically significant difference was defined as greater than 10%.

Results

Among 500 randomized participants, 496 (99%) were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis and 411 (82.2%) in the per-protocol analysis (median age, 40 years [range, 15-78 years]; 58.4% male; 10.9% had diabetes). Median length and width of erythema were 13.0 cm and 10.0 cm. In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 182 (83.5%) of 218 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 165 (85.5%) of 193 in the cephalexin group (difference, -2.0%; 95% CI, -9.7% to 5.7%; P=.50). In the modified intention-to-treat population, clinical cure occurred in 189 (76.2%) of 248 participants in the cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group vs 171 (69.0%) of 248 in the cephalexin group (difference, 7.3%; 95% CI, -1.0% to 15.5%; P=.07). Between-group adverse event rates and secondary outcomes through 7 to 9 weeks, including overnight hospitalization, recurrent skin infections, and similar infection in household contacts, did not differ significantly.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with uncomplicated cellulitis, the use of cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole compared to cephalexin alone did not result in higher rates of clinical resolution of cellulitis in the per-protocol analysis. However, because imprecision around the findings in the modified intention-to-treat analysis included a clinically important difference favoring cephalexin plus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, further research may be needed.

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^83d2ff88]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

PIDS/IDSA pediatric acute bacterial arthritis—Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin susceptible (MSSA): Parenteral preferred therapy is Cefazolin or Semisynthetic penicillin, e.g., oxacillin, nafcillin, with alternatives Clindamycin or Vancomycin; oral convalescent preferred therapy is Cephalexin, with alternative Clindamycin. Duration can be as short as 10 to 14 days when there is rapid clinical improvement and consistent, progressive decrease in CRP by the end of the first week of treatment, whereas 21 to 28 days may be preferred with slower clinical response, inadequate source control, or persistently elevated CRP.

### Randomized controlled trial of cephalexin versus clindamycin for uncomplicated pediatric skin infections [^68b43bef]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare clindamycin and cephalexin for treatment of uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused predominantly by community-associated (CA) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). We hypothesized that clindamycin would be superior to cephalexin (an antibiotic without MRSA activity) for treatment of these infections.

Patients and Methods

Patients aged 6 months to 18 years with uncomplicated SSTIs not requiring hospitalization were enrolled September 2006 through May 2009. Eligible patients were randomly assigned to 7 days of cephalexin or clindamycin; primary and secondary outcomes were clinical improvement at 48 to 72 hours and resolution at 7 days. Cultures were obtained and tested for antimicrobial susceptibilities, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis type, and Panton-Valentine leukocidin status.

Results

Of 200 enrolled patients, 69% had MRSA cultured from wounds. Most MRSA were USA300 or subtypes, positive for Panton-Valentine leukocidin, and clindamycin susceptible, consistent with CA-MRSA. Spontaneous drainage occurred or a drainage procedure was performed in 97% of subjects. By 48 to 72 hours, 94% of subjects in the cephalexin arm and 97% in the clindamycin arm were improved (P = .50). By 7 days, all subjects were improved, with complete resolution in 97% in the cephalexin arm and 94% in the clindamycin arm (P = .33). Fevers and age less than 1 year, but not initial erythema > 5 cm, were associated with early treatment failures, regardless of antibiotic used.

Conclusions

There is no significant difference between cephalexin and clindamycin for treatment of uncomplicated pediatric SSTIs caused predominantly by CA-MRSA. Close follow-up and fastidious wound care of appropriately drained, uncomplicated SSTIs are likely more important than initial antibiotic choice.

MSSA acute bacterial arthritis antimicrobial choice and cephalexin dosing—For children with ABA caused by MSSA, a beta-lactam agent is preferred for initial parenteral treatment (cefazolin, nafcillin or oxacillin) and for definitive oral treatment (cephalexin). “High dose” cephalexin (100 mg/kg/day in 4 divided doses) was first studied and remains adequate as convalescent therapy following initial parenteral therapy and surgical management. Modeling using a pharmacodynamic driver of 40% T > MIC suggests higher doses may be required for strains with MICs of 2 and 4 mg/L, and the MIC90 for MSSA is 4–8 mg/L, suggesting oral therapy should follow initial parenteral therapy, surgical debridement, and clinical response. The higher doses (120 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours) needed to achieve this target in 100%, 90% and 80% of children for MSSA with MICs of 0.25, 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively, do not appear necessary for good outcomes after oral transition. Using the same target, proposed cephalexin dosages (administered Q8H) are 45 mg/kg/day for MSSA with an MIC of 1 mg/L; 75 mg/kg/day for an MIC of 2 mg/L; and 135 mg/kg/day for an MIC of 4 mg/L, with those doses proposed for children weighing 10–15 kg.

Skin cancer reconstruction—evidence on prophylaxis and decolonization: One randomized controlled trial that compared the utility of 2 g of cephalexin to placebo delivered 1 hour before flap or graft reconstructions of the nose or ear found that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the risk of surgical-site infections but not of tissue necrosis nor wound dehiscence. A randomized study of 203 Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriers found that decolonization with intranasal mupirocin and chlor- hexidine body wash before skin cancer excision did not reduce the rate of surgical-site infections after reconstruction.

### Oral cephalexin population pharmacokinetics and target attainment analysis in infants 7-60 Days old [^cfed7c27]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

There are limited data to guide oral antibiotic dosing in neonates and young infants, particularly for intravenous (IV) to oral transition. Cephalexin is a promising oral treatment for neonatal pathogens, including Enterobacterales and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA). However, maturational changes in gastrointestinal absorption and kidney function during early infancy complicate extrapolation of dosing from older populations. We evaluated cephalexin pharmacokinetics (PK) and simulated dosing strategies to achieve pharmacodynamic (PD) targets in infants ≤60 days old.

Methods

This prospective, single-center study enrolled infants 0-60 days receiving cephalexin either as part of routine clinical care or as a single 25 mg/kg study dose. Plasma concentrations were analyzed using non-linear mixed-effects modeling. Simulations assessed the probability of target attainment (PTA) for free time above MIC (fT>MIC) for ≥ 50% and ≥ 70% of the dosing interval across MICs 1-16 mg/L, assuming 10% protein binding. We also simulated the cumulative fractional response (CFR) using typical MIC distributions for Enterobacterales and MSSA.

Results

The analysis included 144 samples from 33 infants with median post-natal age 31 days (range 9-56) and median gestational age 37 weeks (range 29-41). A one-compartment model with first-order absorption and lag time best described the data. Weight influenced apparent volume of distribution and apparent clearance. Additionally, we identified a maturational effect on absorption rate using post-natal age and on apparent clearance using post-menstrual age. For Enterobacterales, 25 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours achieved >90% CFR for a 50% fT>MIC target. For MSSA, 25 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours was sufficient. Higher or more frequent dosing was required to meet the more stringent 70% fT>MIC target.

Conclusions

Oral cephalexin can achieve necessary PD targets in infants 7-60 days old. These findings support the use of model-informed dosing strategies to guide safe and effective oral antibiotic use in early infancy, including for IV-to-oral transition.

### 2018 WSES / SIS-E consensus conference: recommendations for the management of skin and soft-tissue infections [^168387e9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

What oral antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs)? What intravenous antibiotics can be used for the management of MRSA skin and soft-tissue infections?

For oral antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: linezolid (recommendation 1A), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) (recommendation 1B), a tetracycline (doxycycline or minocycline) (recommendation 1B), or tedizolid (Recommendation 1A).

For intravenous (IV) antibiotic coverage of MRSA in patients with SSTI, we suggest the following agents: daptomycin (10 mg/kg/dose IV once daily) (recommendation 1A), IV linezolid (recommendation 1A), IV ceftaroline (recommendation 1A), IV dalbavancin (recommendation 1A), IV vancomycin (recommendation 1A), IV tigecycline (recommendation 1A), or IV tedizolid (recommendation 1A).

Seven to 14 days of therapy is recommended but should be individualized on the basis of the patient’s clinical response (recommendation 1A). IV to oral switch should occur when criteria of clinical stability have been reached (recommendation 1C).

For CA-MRSA, recommended oral agents are clindamycin, although clindamycin resistance is now very common, tetracyclines, TMP-SMX, linezolid, tedizolid, and occasionally, fluoroquinolones. Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that TMP-SMX, doxycycline, and minocycline are effective for such infections. If coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin alone, or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam (e.g. penicillin, cephalexin, or amoxicillin).

### Clinical practice guideline by the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (PIDS) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA): 2023 guideline on diagnosis and management of acute bacterial arthritis in pediatrics [^0e0ffab7]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2024). High credibility.

PIDS/IDSA pediatric acute bacterial arthritis (ABA) empiric therapy decisions are best informed by review of the most recent data on ABA pathogens identified in a clinician’s region, particularly with respect to susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) isolates. Across reports, bacterial pathogens other than S. aureus accounted for from 15.4% to 92.1%, with Group A Streptococcus representing up to 14% in some studies; outside S. aureus, Kingella kingae, and group A Streptococcus, no other pathogen occurred in greater than 5% of cases in any study. For S. aureus coverage, many isolates remain susceptible to anti-staphylococcal penicillins (ASP) such as oxacillin and nafcillin and to first-generation cephalosporins such as cefazolin and cephalexin; cefazolin and nafcillin/oxacillin are considered therapeutically equivalent in pediatric ABA, although no comparative data are available for an ASP and cefazolin. In regions with low rates of CA-MRSA arthritis (less than ~10%), some experts begin therapy with oxacillin/nafcillin or cefazolin for children with mild to moderate illness, watching closely for a response to treatment. Where resistance to methicillin is estimated to be 10–20% or greater, consideration should be given for empiric therapy to include agents active against invasive CA-MRSA, and effective empiric therapy for CA-MRSA ABA is expected with clindamycin (unless local clindamycin resistance rates are high), vancomycin, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and linezolid. Clindamycin resistance occurs in both MRSA and MSSA and should be a factor in selecting empiric therapy, with documented rates of 5% to 40% of all S. aureus isolates.

### Antibiogram for periprosthetic infections: a tool for better informed selection of empiric antibiotics for surgical site infections [^6079029d]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Periprosthetic infection after breast reconstruction is not an uncommon complication, with incidence up to 24%. These infections are often treated empirically without knowing the causative bacteria or its sensitivities to various antibiotics. Even if cultures are obtained, results may not be available for several days.

Methods

A retrospective chart review of 553 patients at a single institution between January 2009 and July 2014 was performed, identifying patients who (1) underwent implant-based breast reconstruction and subsequently suffered an infection and (2) had cultures available with sensitivities. We reviewed patient demographics, implant characteristics, prophylactic intravenous antibiotics, oral antibiotic maintenance used, microbiologic details, and outcomes. The goal was to identify the most common causative bacteria, as well as their sensitivities to commonly used antibiotics, to help guide antibiotic decision-making.

Results

Of the 553 patients who underwent implant-based reconstruction, 114 (20.6%) patients suffered periprosthetic infections. Of these patients, 32 (28.1%) patients (56 reconstructions, with 33 tissue expanders and 23 implants) had cultures performed revealing 43 bacterial species, with the most common being Staphylococcus aureus (23.2%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.8%). Ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam were equally effective covering 100% of Pseudomonas, enteric, and atypical organisms (P = 1), whereas vancomycin covered 100% of gram-positive organisms. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole covered 100% of S. aureus, whereas clindamycin only covered 71% of S. aureus (P = 0.03). Additionally, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was better able to cover atypical and enteric organisms. Ciprofloxacin covered 71% of Pseudomonas compared with 56% for levofloxacin (P = 0.14). Interestingly, cephalexin, a common choice for perioperative prophylaxis, was highly ineffective for gram-positive species in patients who later returned with infections.

Conclusions

This study supports the efficacy of current intravenous antibiotics protocols but questions the efficacy of both clindamycin and levofloxacin in empirically treating periprosthetic infections and cephalexin in providing effective perioperative prophylaxis against skin flora. Because bacterial sensitivities vary by location and patient population, this study encourages other centers to develop their own antibiogram specifically tailored to periprosthetic infections to improve antimicrobial decision making and potentially improve implant salvage.

### Analysis of empiric antimicrobial strategies for cellulitis in the era of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^d1e4aa96]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The rise in community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections potentially complicates the empiric management of cellulitis. The threshold at which drugs active against MRSA, such as clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), should be incorporated into empiric therapy is unknown.

Objective

To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of using cephalexin, TMP/SMX, or clindamycin for outpatient empiric therapy of cellulitis, given various likelihoods of infection due to MRSA.

Methods

A decision analysis of the empiric treatment of cellulitis was performed from the perspective of a third-party payer. The model included initial therapy with cephalexin, clindamycin, or TMP/SMX, followed by treatment with linezolid in cases of clinical failure. Probability and cost estimates were obtained from clinical trials, epidemiologic data, and publicly available cost data and were subjected to sensitivity analysis.

Results

Under the base-case scenario (37% probability of infection by S. aureus and a 27% MRSA prevalence), cephalexin was the most cost-effective option. Clindamycin became a more cost-effective therapy at MRSA probabilities from 41-80% when the probability of staphylococcal infection was greater than 40%. TMP/SMX was cost-effective only at very high likelihoods of MRSA infection. Variables with the most influence in the model were probability of S. aureus being methicillin-resistant, cost of linezolid, probability of a cure with cephalexin for a non-MRSA infection, and probability of infection due to S. aureus.

Conclusions

Cephalexin remains a cost-effective therapy for outpatient management of cellulitis at current estimated MRSA levels. Cephalexin was the most cost-effective choice over most of the modeled range of probabilities, with clindamycin becoming more cost-effective at high likelihoods of MRSA infection. TMP/SMX is unlikely to be cost-effective for treatment of simple cellulitis. Further studies of the microbiology of cellulitis, the epidemiology of MRSA, and the clinical effectiveness of clindamycin and TMP/SMX in skin and soft tissue infections are needed.

### Diabetic foot disorders. A clinical practice guideline (2006 revision) [^01a1a470]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2007). Medium credibility.

Diabetic foot infections—empiric initiation, culture guidance, and monitoring: Reliable specimens for cultures may be obtained through curettage of the infected ulcer, and oral antibiotic therapy is usually sufficient as initial therapy. Antimicrobial treatment should be started as soon as possible with an agent providing adequate gram positive coverage, recognizing that gram negative organisms might also be involved. Although the incidence of MRSA infections has increased, methicillin-sensitive S aureus (MSSA) remains the most likely pathogen in community-acquired diabetic foot infections; therefore, initial antibiotic coverage must be tailored to cover MSSA unless culture/sensitivity or pathogen history indicates specific coverage, and antibiotics should be adjusted according to culture results and the patient’s response to treatment. While many useful oral agents such as cephalexin, clindamycin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, and levofloxacin are available for mild to moderate infections, relatively few have been studied or have demonstrated superiority and IDSA guidelines contain no specific recommendations. All antibiotic treatments should be monitored for development of resistance, and most cases of cellulitis respond within 3 to 5 days of initiation of appropriate antibiotics; if cellulitis is slow to respond, worsens, or recurs following several days of treatment, the ulceration should be reassessed and possibly reevaluated. Bacteria frequently develop resistance, especially with prolonged therapy, which is not uncommon with the quinolones.

Cellulitis without abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage—empiric antibiotic selection and MRSA coverage is outlined as follows: treatment with β-lactams, such as cefazolin or oxacillin, was successful in 96% of patients, suggesting MRSA-directed therapy is usually unnecessary; however, MRSA coverage may be prudent with penetrating trauma, illicit drug use, purulent drainage, or concurrent MRSA elsewhere. Options for MRSA include intravenous vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, or telavancin, or oral doxycycline, clindamycin, or SMX-TMP; if oral coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired, use clindamycin alone or combine SMX-TMP or doxycycline with a β-lactam (eg, penicillin, cephalosporin, or amoxicillin). The activity of doxycycline and SMX-TMP against β-hemolytic streptococci is not known, and in the absence of abscess, ulcer, or purulent drainage, β-lactam monotherapy is recommended; a double-blind study showed SMX-TMP plus cephalexin was no more efficacious than cephalexin alone in pure cellulitis.

Acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (AHO) oral step-down selection—When an empiric antistaphylococcal beta-lactam active against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) yields clinical and laboratory response without a proven pathogen, oral cephalexin is a good option, and after effective vancomycin empiric therapy a switch to oral cephalexin for presumed MSSA may be considered if community CA-MRSA frequency is less than 10% to 20% and the child is not known to be colonized with CA-MRSA; oral clindamycin may be considered in this scenario, and other agents (linezolid or TMP-SMX) may be considered case-by-case.

Preferred antibiotics are usually penicillinase-resistant penicillin, such as dicloxacillin, 500 mg four times per day; alternatively, cephalexin 500 mg four times a day or clindamycin 300 mg four times a day may be used if the patient has a penicillin allergy. A patient should be asked about a history of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in herself or in members of her household, and a 10–14-day course of antibiotics usually is recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence from suboptimally treated mastitis.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic evaluation of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin and soft tissue infections in the emergency department [^21eb0f71]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) infections commonly present as skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs). Treatment often includes incision and drainage with or without adjunctive antibiotics. Emergency department (ED) pharmacists wished to provide specific data to emergency physicians to better inform antibiotic choices for patients with SSTIs.

Study Objectives

The objectives of this study were to describe local susceptibility trends of CA-MRSA isolates obtained from patients with SSTIs and describe diagnostic and empiric therapeutic management of CA-MRSA SSTIs among ED health care providers at University of Utah Hospitals and Clinics.

Methods

Susceptibility of all unique CA-MRSA SSTI isolates for 2008 were identified and compiled into an antibiogram. ED providers evaluated their diagnostic and treatment habits using a self-assessment questionnaire, which was verified against charted information documented in the electronic medical records for patients presenting to the ED with a CA-MRSA SSTI.

Results

The ED antibiogram indicated that 57/58 (98%) CA-MRSA SSTI isolates were susceptible to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (SMX/TMP); 50/58 (86%) isolates were susceptible to tetracycline, and 47/58 (81%) isolates were susceptible to clindamycin. Incision and drainage were performed in 23/25 (92%) patient cases, which was consistent with providers' perceived habits (100%). SMX/TMP monotherapy was preferred among 23/35 (66%) providers, however, SMX/TMP combined with cephalexin was the antibiotic regimen prescribed in 9/22 (41%) patient cases.

Conclusions

Cephalexin was often added to cover for potential cellulitis due to Streptococcus spp., however, the surrounding erythema may simply be an extension of the CA-MRSA infection. Department-specific antibiograms are useful in guiding empiric antibiotic selection and may help providers judiciously prescribe antibiotics only when necessary.

### Device evaluation, treatment, and explantation recommendations (DETER): review and best practices for managing neuromodulation device infections [^74da9786]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Depth of Infection (Superficial Vs Deep)

Superficial

Superficial infections occur at the epidermis and dermis layers and generally respond well to oral antibiotics.Device-related spinal infections occur in subcutaneous tissue layers where leads, catheters, implantable pulse generators (IPGs), and ITPs are implanted, typically in the fat between the dermis and superficial muscle fascia. Superficial infections can be identified by erythema, swelling, warmth, and tenderness in a visually distinct area surrounding a wound. It is helpful to outline the border of erythema using a permanent surgical marker to monitor for spreading infection. Superficial infections often have little or no purulent exudate and are not typically associated with an underlying abscess.A recent large retrospective review reaffirmed that localized tenderness and erythema were the most common initial presentations of SSI.Therefore, ensuring frequent postoperative visits (ie, 5-day, 2-week, 6-week) is helpful for early identification of any potential SSI. With superficial SSIs, there may be purulent drainage, although this is less common, and the patient may appear clinically well.

Attempts should always be made to culture any purulent drainage, which will assist in tailoring the antibiotic regimen. This should be attempted aseptically before initiating antibiotic therapy.Once there is a suspected superficial SSI, empiric oral antibiotics should be started to cover the suspected bacterial organism, including S. aureus, as it is the most frequently isolated organism from SCS SSIs.,For a 7-day treatment course, a first-generation cephalosporin, such as cephalexin, would be appropriate. However, if the patient is at high risk for MRSA colonization or if local community MRSA rates are high, it is recommended that an additional second oral antibiotic with MRSA coverage, such as doxycycline or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, should be added.If oral antibiotics successfully treat the infection, the SSI’s erythematous border should serially decrease. Alternatively, if oral antibiotics fail, erythema will begin to extend beyond the drawn border, and in this instance, an infectious disease specialist should be consulted, and device explantation should be considered.

### Maximizing positive outcomes for patients with staphylococcal infections [^99371d34]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Maximizing positive outcomes for serious Gram-positive infections, such as those caused by Staphylococcus species, requires an aggressive treatment approach. Although specific approaches will depend upon many factors, the underlying common strategy should recognize the positive contribution of minimizing complications and inpatient treatment duration and the efficient use of healthcare resources, while also focusing on rapid resolution of infection and safety and tolerability. To advance the standard of care for patients, we need to utilize therapies that enable such a range of factors to be improved. Treatment guidelines are useful to establish evidence-based standards of care, but they are updated infrequently and there is currently no pan-European consensus for the treatment of staphylococcal infections. With the benefit of the clinical experience that has been acquired for the most recently licensed antibiotics, together with an appreciation of the appropriate usage of older agents, there are good prospects for achieving positive outcomes earlier and in a greater range of patients with staphylococcal infections, and treatment guidelines should be updated regularly to reflect this.

### MRSA: treating people with infection [^80830b04]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2016). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin, as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics, including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection, particularly in people with prolonged hospital admissions, with underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. About 8% of S aureus in blood cultures in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of selected treatments for MRSA infections at any body site? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 312 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 133 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 55 studies and the further review of 78 full publications. Of the 78 full articles evaluated, 15 systematic reviews and one subsequent RCT were added at this update. In addition, six studies were added to the Comment sections. We performed a GRADE evaluation for 12 PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview we categorised the efficacy for five interventions, based on information about the effectiveness and safety of cephalosporins (ceftobiprole, ceftaroline), daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, pristinamycin (streptogramins), and tigecycline.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis and resistance in surgical site infection after immediate tissue expander reconstruction of the breast [^ed7d2403]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

A recent survey of plastic surgeons showed that the majority prescribed prophylactic antibiotics after hospital discharge for breast reconstruction. There is no clinical evidence that this practice reduces surgical site infection (SSI) after immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction. Furthermore, multiple studies have suggested that current antibiotic choices may not be appropriately covering the causative organisms of SSI.

Methods

An institutional breast reconstruction database from January 2005 to December 2011 was queried to identify patients undergoing immediate tissue expander reconstruction of the breast. The bacteriology of the infection, prophylactic and empiric antibiotic use, and antibiotic sensitivities were analyzed.

Results

In 557 cases of immediate tissue expander breast reconstruction performed in 378 patients, SSIs were diagnosed in 50 (9.0%) cases. Two hundred patients were given oral antibiotics at discharge; 178 did not receive antibiotics. Surgical site infection developed in 12.0% of patients given oral antibiotics and in 13.5% of those not receiving antibiotics (P = 0.67). Wound culture data were obtained in 34 SSIs. Twenty-nine had positive cultures. The most common offending organisms were methicillin-sensitive (11) and methicillin-resistant (6) Staphylococcus aureus. Despite increased use of postoperative prophylaxis over the years, SSI incidence remained unchanged. However, trends toward increased resistance of SSI organisms to the preoperative and postoperative prophylaxis agents were observed. When first-generation cephalosporins were used as prophylaxis, SSI organisms showed resistance rates of 20.5% (preoperative cefazolin) and 54.5% (postoperative cephalexin).

Conclusions

Administration of extended prophylactic antibiotics does not reduce overall risk of SSI after expander-based breast reconstruction but may influence antibiotic resistance patterns when infections occur. The organisms most commonly responsible for SSI are often resistant to cefazolin.

### Clinical guidance for group A streptococcal cellulitis-CDC (...) [^3da0bbaf]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Multiple bacteria can cause cellulitis.
- Cellulitis typically involves erythema, pain, and warmth locally and can include systemic symptoms.
- Diagnosed by physical examination, cellulitis is treated with antibiotics.
- Prevention focuses on good wound care.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with cellulitis. Risk factors Anyone can get cellulitis, but some factors increase a person's risk. Breaks in the skin Disruption of the cutaneous barrier is a risk factor for developing cellulitis:
- Chickenpox and shingles
- Chronic skin conditions
- Fungal skin infections
- Injection drug use
- Injuries and wounds. Antibiotic therapy for non-purulent cellulitis IDSA recommends treatment with an antibiotic that is active against streptococci. Healthcare providers may select antibiotics that cover both Staphylococcus aureus and group A strep.

Treatment options Treat mild cellulitis with oral antibiotics and consider intravenous antibiotics for systematic infections. Group A strep remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. Oral antibiotics Treatment duration The recommended treatment duration is 5 days for most cellulitis cases. Cases in which there hasn't been improvement during this time period may require longer durations of treatment. Other treatment In addition, the following actions are recommended to reduce the risk of recurrent infection:
- Elevate the affected area
- Treat predisposing factors Complications Complications from cellulitis are uncommon but can include serious infections. Occasionally: Cellulitis can result in bacteremia. Rarely: Cellulitis can result in deep tissue infections, such as
- Infective endocarditis
- Necrotizing soft tissue infections
- Osteomyelitis
- Septic thrombophlebitis
- Suppurative arthritis.

Prevention Reduce the spread of group A strep bacteria with standard infection control practices, including good hand hygiene and respiratory etiquette. Wound care Early identification and management of superficial skin lesions is also key to cellulitis prevention. Patients with recurrent lower-extremity cellulitis should be inspected for tinea pedis and treated if present. Traumatic or bite wounds should be cleaned and managed appropriately to prevent secondary infections.

### Frequency of dosing of cephalexin for oral step-down therapy of pediatric osteoarticular infections caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [^5e74c90d]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteoarticular infections are one of the more common invasive bacterial infections encountered in children. There exist significant practice variations in both the diagnosis and treatment of such infections. However, the practice of transitioning from parenteral therapy to oral antibiotics has been well validated by several studies. For methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), cephalexin is often recommended. Prospective, controlled data regarding optimal dosing of cephalexin in pediatric osteomyelitis are not available. We sought to review our retrospective, uncontrolled data on four times daily (QID) versus three times daily (TID) dosing of cephalexin for pediatric osteoarticular infections. Children ≥1 month to <18 years of age admitted to Rady Children's Hospital-San Diego with a diagnosis of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis between January 1, 2002, and November 30, 2007, were identified and previously reported. Only patients with culture-positive MSSA infections are included in this report. Demographic and clinical data were manually extracted from the electronic medical record. Fifty-nine patients were treated with cephalexin and had records available for review through our electronic medical record. Thirty-eight patients (64.4%) were treated QID, and 21 patients (35.6%) were treated TID. Clinical cure was achieved in all patients with only one adverse event occurring in the QID group. In this retrospective chart review of children with osteoarticular infections caused by MSSA treated with cephalexin, similar clinical outcomes were found with QID versus TID dosing.

### Hemorrhagic cystitis due to cephalexin and review of the literature [^67283598]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

We present a case of a 9-year-old male who presented to the ED for left knee swelling and fever that was diagnosed with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and osteomyelitis. He was treated and discharged with oral cephalexin, and later returned to the ED after 2 days with abdominal pain and hematuria that was diagnosed as drug induced HC. This case explains the rarity of HC being induced by antibiotics, as most cases of drug induced HC are caused by chemotherapeutic agents. We have described several cases of HC caused by antibiotics, but currently there have not been significantly documented cases of HC caused by cephalexin. This highlights the importance of keeping antibiotics on the list of possibilities when diagnosing a drug-induced HC.

Impetigo and ecthyma—therapy selection and dosing state that bullous and nonbullous impetigo can be treated with oral or topical antimicrobials, but oral therapy is recommended for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission of infection, and treatment for ecthyma should be an oral antimicrobial. Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either topical mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high). Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high). Because S. aureus isolates from impetigo and ecthyma are usually methicillin susceptible, dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended, and when methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate).

### Antibiotics for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin and soft tissue infections: the challenge of outpatient therapy [^c100e4de]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections are becoming increasingly prevalent in both community and hospital settings. Certain strains are notorious for causing skin and soft tissue infections in patients with no established risk factors. In this article, we report our findings on the dynamic antibiotic resistance pattern of MRSA and outpatient prescription trend for skin and soft tissue infections within our community.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective medical record review of 1876 patients evaluated in the emergency department of an urban community hospital from 2003 to 2012. Data regarding culture isolates and associated antimicrobial resistance, antibiotic treatment, site of specimen collection, age, race, and sex were collected and analyzed.

Results

Analysis of 1879 culture specimens yielded 2193 isolates. In some cases, a single specimen yielded polymicrobial growth. Staphylococcus aureus represented 996 isolates (45.4%); 463 were methicillin-susceptible (21.1%) and 533 (24.3%) were methicillin-resistant. Most patients were prescribed a single- or poly-drug regimen of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, cephalexin, and clindamycin. Antimicrobial resistance analysis indicated that MRSA became increasingly resistant to the aforementioned antibiotics over time: 10% and 6% in 2012 vs 3.5% and 3.4% in 2007 for clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively.

Conclusion

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a particularly virulent, rapidly adaptive pathogen that is becoming increasingly difficult to combat with existing antibiotics. Care must be taken to ensure appropriate treatment and follow-up of patients with known MRSA infections.

### Current treatment options for acute skin and skin-structure infections [^2a0571f8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

TREATMENT GUIDELINES

Most recently, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) published practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ABSSSIs. This publication predates the FDA approval of several newer antibiotics for the treatment of ABSSSIs, including dalbavancin, oritavancin, tedizolid, and delafloxacin. The guidelines divide ABSSSIs into purulent and nonpurulent categories. Cellulitis and erysipelas are considered nonpurulent, while abscesses are categorized as purulent. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, ceftaroline, and telavancin are all considered appropriate antimicrobial agents for treatment of severe purulent infections, while trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are recommended for moderate purulent infections. For methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), cefazolin and clindamycin are recommended for severe infections and dicloxacillin and cephalexin for moderate infections. Vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam is recommended as a first-line treatment option for severe nonpurulent infections, particularly suspected necrotizing or polymicrobial infections. However, this combination has been associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury when compared with vancomycin with or without other beta-lactams. Options for treatment of mild to moderate nonpurulent infections include cefazolin, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, and penicillin. Although there is a lack of data to support the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy, the guidelines recommend a treatment duration of 7–10 days.

Recent antibiotic development for ABSSSIs has focused largely on the coverage of gram-positive organisms, especially MRSA (Table 2). However, acute skin infections that involve gram-negative pathogens are associated with a potential risk for inadequate antimicrobial therapy. Clinicians need to consider risk factors for infections due to gram-negative pathogens in selected patients. Moreover, although gram-negative pathogens are commonly found in polymicrobial infections, they have also been observed in monomicrobial skin infections. Cultures with only gram-negative pathogens have been reported in approximately 13% of patients hospitalized with serious skin infections (not limited to ABSSSI), while mixed cultures have been found in 11%–21%. Selection of empiric antibiotic therapy for suspected gram-negative skin infections should be guided by local epidemiologic patterns, as well as infection type and individual patient characteristics.

### Cefdinir: an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin [^30cde031]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Cefdinir is an advanced-generation, broad-spectrum cephalosporin antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, acute bacterial otitis media, and uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections in adult and pediatric patients.

Objective

The purpose of this article was to review the in vitro antimicrobial activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, and potential role of cefdinir.

Methods

Studies were identified by a MEDLINE search (January 1983-September 2001) of the English-language medical literature, a review of identified articles and their bibliographies, and a review of data on file with the manufacturer. Clinical efficacy data were selected from all published trials mentioning cefdinir. Information concerning in vitro susceptibility, safety, chemistry, and the pharmacokinetic profile of cefdinir also was reviewed.

Results

Cefdinir has a broad spectrum of activity against many gram-negative and gram-positive aerobic organisms, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Cefdinir is stable to hydrolysis by 13 of the common beta-lactamases. It is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (mean time to peak plasma concentration, 3 hours) and is almost entirely eliminated via renal clearance of unchanged drug. The terminal disposition half-life of cefdinir is approximately 1.5 hours. Efficacy has been demonstrated in 19 clinical trials in adults and children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (eg, pharyngitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, acute bronchitis, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia), and skin and skin-structure infections. The adverse-event profile is similar to that of comparator agents, although in 4 adult and adolescent studies and 1 adult study, diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in cefdinir recipients than in recipients of penicillin V, cephalexin, cefaclor, and cefprozil.

Conclusions

Cefdinir is an alternative to other antimicrobial agents and can be dosed once or twice daily for the treatment of upper and lower respiratory tract infections and skin and skin-structure infections. Similar to other oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, cefdinir has activity against common pathogens of the respiratory tract and skin and is stable in the presence of selected beta-lactamases. The clinical choice of an oral expanded-spectrum cephalosporin will be based on patient acceptance, frequency of administration, and cost.

Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2021). High credibility.

Antimicrobial management in AHO when microbial etiology is identified notes that for MSSA isolates, first-generation cephalosporins (eg, cefazolin) or ASP (eg, oxacillin and nafcillin) are the preferred parenteral agents, and excellent outcomes with the transition to oral therapy with high-dose cephalexin or clindamycin are well documented; for MSSA infections, the safety and tolerability benefits of beta-lactam therapy are likely to be greater than glycopeptides (vancomycin), lincosamides (clindamycin), and oxazolidinones (linezolid), but no controlled data comparing efficacy, tolerability, and adverse event profiles between agents have been collected specifically in children with AHO. For CA-MRSA isolates that are susceptible, clindamycin is the preferred agent, with tolerability and safety benefits greater than vancomycin, the ability to convert readily from parenteral to oral therapy due to good enteral bioavailability, and potential adherence improved by adding flavoring to the liquid formulation. Vancomycin remains the preferred initial antimicrobial agent for clindamycin-resistant CA-MRSA infections, and other MRSA-active agents may be considered as alternatives (eg, ceftaroline, daptomycin, linezolid, and TMP-SMX) but have been used less often than vancomycin for the treatment of AHO; few published data exist for treatment outcomes, safety, tolerability, or standardized dosing of antimicrobial agents.

### Randomized controlled noninferiority trial comparing daptomycin to vancomycin for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections in an observation unit [^f26ce702]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Incidence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is increasing in complicated skin and skin structure infection (cSSSI) presenting to emergency departments (EDs). Treatment is heterogeneous and can require inpatient admission to an observation unit (OU). Vancomycin is commonly used in the OU for treatment, but increasing MRSA resistance to vancomycin suggests the need for alternatives. Daptomycin is an alternative but it is not known how it compares with vancomycin.

Objective

This study tested the hypothesis that daptomycin is noninferior to vancomycin for the treatment of cSSSI in an OU, using a relative risk (RR) of 1.3 as the noninferiority limit.

Methods

Subjects admitted to an ED-based OU with a diagnosis of cSSSI were eligible. Consenting subjects were randomized 1:1 to intravenous (i.v.) vancomycin at 15 mg/kg dosing every 12 h or i.v. daptomycin at 4 mg/kg once. Subjects were followed until they met objective criteria for discharge home or hospital admission. Discharged patients were prescribed 10-14 days of oral cephalexin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or clindamycin if allergic to either of these medications. The primary endpoint was meeting objective discharge criteria with no change in antibiotic therapy or return to the ED for the same cellulitis within 30 days of OU discharge.

Results

There were 100 patients enrolled. RR for satisfying the endpoint was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.58-1.98) for daptomycin compared with vancomycin. Hospital admission rates were 36% and 32% for daptomycin and vancomycin treatment, respectively.

Conclusion

Daptomycin was not inferior to vancomycin in the treatment of cSSSI in an OU.

In cases of recurrent skin abscess, it is necessary to look for the presence of foreign materials and identify and correct local factors that may cause recurring infection. For recurrent skin abscess bacterial culture testing should be performed to verify the causative bacteria and antibiotics susceptibility to define a targeted therapy.

If an abscess is treated with prolonged antibiotics without drainage, it can lead to formation of sterile pus surrounded by thick fibrous tissue. It makes a hard lump that sometimes mimics malignancy. The treatment is surgical drainage with excision of fibrous wall.

### Common pediatric skin conditions with protracted courses: a therapeutic update [^51137340]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

This article reviews some of the recent literature on therapeutic modalities and their efficacy in common pediatric skin conditions. Immunotherapy and laser therapy of warts and molluscum contagiosum show therapeutic promise. Bleach baths may help in eradicating Staphylococcus aureus carriage and in improving atopic dermatitis. Cephalexin continues to show efficacy even with increased incidence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. More studies have looked at the use of systemic immunosuppressants for alopecia areata and vitiligo in children, although risks and benefits of therapy must be weighed. The excimer laser shows promise as a treatment modality for both alopecia areata and vitiligo.

### WSES / GAIS / WSIS / SIS-E / AAST global clinical pathways for patients with skin and soft tissue infections [^17e0cbcc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

The prevalence of CA-MRSA varies worldwide, ranging from less than 1% in some countries to more than 50% in others, with the prevalence been higher in children than in adults.

Clindamycin has been used to treat CA-MRSA, although clindamycin resistance is now very common. Like penicillin, clindamycin has activity against group A and B streptococci and S. aureus. It has virtually no activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, clindamycin is bacteriostatic, and its use is at high risk for the development of Clostridioides difficile infection.

Several observational studies and one small randomized trial suggest that trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), doxycycline, and minocycline are effective against CA-MRSA. However, they have no activity against group A and B streptococci. Therefore, if coverage for both streptococci and MRSA is desired for oral therapy, options include clindamycin, linezolid or tedizolid alone or the combination of either TMP-SMX or doxycycline with a beta-lactam agent (amoxicillin, cephalexin) or azithromycin in the case of beta-lactam allergy.

For many years glycopeptides have been the microbiological agents of choice in complicated Gram-positive infections. Frequent use of vancomycin as the drug of choice for treatment of infections caused by MRSA has putatively led to selection of the isolates with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin.

Fortunately, staphylococcal resistance to glycopeptides such as in vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and in vancomycin resistant S. aureus (VRA) remains rare, although rising minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of glycopeptides may affect the efficacy of these antibiotics. Heterogeneous vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) shows MICs in the susceptible range (≤ 2 μg/mL), because of a sub-population that expresses a resistant phenotype. Infections caused by VRSA, VISA and hVISA can lead to higher rates of vancomycin treatment failure and are associated with extended hospitalization, higher risk of persistent infection, and elevated treatment costs.

### Pediatricians' perspectives on the impact of MRSA in primary care: a qualitative study [^afd15841]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Medical Management

All participants routinely prescribe oral antibiotics for purulent SSTIs and stated that they prescribe antibiotics independent of performing I&D. This practice preceded the emergence of CA-MRSA.

"I always put them on an oral antibiotic. I don't leave it up to God to do it."

Some reported that now they empirically prescribe antibiotics with activity against CA-MRSA (e.g. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or clindamycin) for patients with purulent SSTIs whereas they previously used cephalexin, while other participants still chose cephalexin as a first-line antibiotic. Participants were not aware of community rates of resistance to these antibiotics and thus resistance data was not an important factor in their antibiotic selection. For cases of pustulosis in infants, some participants reported prescribing only topical therapy with mupirocin.

Surgical Management

Owing to the increased incidence of purulent SSTIs in their practices, some participants reported that they now perform I&D more frequently, however, overall use of I&D is low. There was variation in the perception of the importance of I&D. Some participants questioned whether this procedure was necessary for all patients, especially if they had been treated with appropriate antibiotics.

"I believe a lot of these can be treated without I&Ding. you're giving antibiotics."

"I'll start them on something (antibiotics) and then follow-up. I find that I'm able to sort of manipulate around it because it's not that urgent."

Although a few participants perform I&D of deeper lesions and use packing, most only perform very limited procedures (e.g. a small incision or nick with a needle or scalpel).

Diagnostic Testing

Most participants reported performing cultures of purulent SSTIs routinely which is a change in practice due to CA-MRSA.

"10 years ago I wouldn't culture on a routine basis. I culture everything now."

Participants mentioned that there are circumstances where cultures are not routinely performed, such as recurrent infections or lesions that appear to be resolving. No participants reported performing cultures for the benefit of epidemiologic surveillance at the practice or community level.

### Staphylococcus aureus: methicillin-susceptible S. aureus to methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus [^b7b4ee41]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

The evolution of methicillin-resistant and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has demanded serious review of antimicrobial use and development of new agents and revised approaches to prevent and overcome drug resistance. Depending on local conditions and patient risk factors, empirical therapy of suspected S. aureus infection may require coverage of drug-resistant organisms with newer agents and novel antibiotic combinations. The question of treatment with inappropriate antibiotics raises grave concerns with regard to methicillin-resistant S. aureus selection, overgrowth, and increased virulence. Several strategies to reduce the nosocomial burden of resistance are suggested, including shortened hospital stays and outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy of the most serious infections.

Table 4—empirical antibiotic therapy according to clinical presentation and microbiological data aligns infection severity and risk factors with likely pathogens and candidate agents. For mild infection with no complicating factors targeting gram‑positive cocci (GPC), potential regimens include semisynthetic penicillinase‑resistant penicillin (cloxacillin) or 1st generation cephalosporins (cephalexin). For mild infection with β‑lactam allergy or intolerance (GPC), options include clindamycin, fluoroquinolone (levo/moxi‑floxacin), trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline. For moderate or severe infection without complicating factors (GPC ± GNR), options include β‑lactam; β‑lactamase inhibitor regimens (amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam), 2nd or 3rd generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone), or group 1 carbapenem (ertapenem). For moderate or severe infection with MRSA risk factors, the table states to “consider adding, or substituting with” glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin), linezolid, daptomycin, fusidic acid, trimethoprim‑sulfamethoxazole, or doxycycline. Footnotes specify practical use: antibiotics enclosed in boxes are cited as examples; “where more than one agent is listed, only one of them should be prescribed unless otherwise indicated”; “oral antibiotic agents should generally not be used for severe infections, except as a follow‑on (switch) after initial parenteral therapy”; and clinicians should “consider modifying doses or agents selected for patients with comorbidities such as azotaemia, liver dysfunction, and obesity.”

Case Report

A previously healthy 9-year-old male presented to the Riverside University Health System Emergency Department for swelling of his left knee associated with fever, decreased appetite, and fatigue. Lab results showed normal white blood cell (WBC) count, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 8.07 mg/dL, and normal procalcitonin. Blood cultures were drawn, and synovial aspiration was performed. Joint fluid results were inconsistent with septic arthritis, and the patient was discharged home. Blood culture grew Staphylococcus aureus. The patient was asked to return for treatment. Left knee magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed changes consistent with osteomyelitis of the proximal tibia and blood cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus again. The patient was diagnosed with methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and osteomyelitis. He was given a 6-week course of antibiotics that began with intravenous cefazolin. After a negative blood culture at 72 hours and a CRP level <1 mg/dL, the patient was discharged with 1500 mg cephalexin orally every 8 hours.

Two days after discharge, the patient experienced sudden onset of abdominal pain associated with episodes of hematuria and presented back to the emergency department (ED). Urinanalysis showed hematuria with 333 RBCs, 7 WBCs, trace protein, and specific gravity of 1.010. One hyaline cast was found. No urine eosinophils or peripheral eosinophilia were present. Complete metabolic panel showed creatinine to be 0.7 mg/dL. Abdominal CT and ultrasound of kidney and bladder showed no signs of a renal stone. A clinical diagnosis of HC was made after ruling out other causes of hematuria such as nephrolithiasis or nephritis. Cephalexin was changed to IV cefazolin to complete the remaining 5 weeks of the original 6-week course. Subsequent lab testing showed stable creatinine and UA after 48 hours of discontinuation of cephalexin showed 5 RBCs. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed, and the patient was discharged home with follow-up scheduled with infectious disease. During outpatient follow-up, hematuria did not recur.

### Importance of understanding pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic principles in the emergence of resistances, including community-associated Staphylococcus aureus [^e8a83409]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic parameters have been defined to predict efficacy in antimicrobial selection for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections (uSSSIs). Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) are the bases for describing the in vivo behavior of antimicrobial agents. T>MIC is the duration of time that a pathogen is exposed to concentrations of antimicrobial agents that exceed the MIC of that particular organism. For antimicrobials with time-dependent activity (eg, penicillin and cephalosporins), the T>MIC needed to eradicate bacteria is generally 40% to 50% of the dosing interval. The most frequently prescribed oral antimicrobials for uSSSI are oral cephalosporins, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, macrolides, anti-staphylococcal penicillins, and fluoroquinolones. The selected oral agent should display a broad spectrum of antimicrobial coverage, be able to be dosed once, or at most twice, a day, and show high levels of target attainment (> or = 90%) for eradicating the key pathogens associated with uSSSI. The recent emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the community setting (CA-MRSA) is especially troublesome in that oral cephalosporins (and all other beta-lactam agents) are contraindicated, requiring alternative therapeutic approaches. While a common cause of cutaneous disease, including abscess formation, CA-MRSA has caused life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis and pneumonia. Treatment of abscesses produced by this pathogen consists of incision and drainage followed by an appropriate oral antimicrobial, based upon knowledge on the local resistance prevalence rates or as directed by culture and susceptibility testing.

Etiology and empiric coverage considerations—β-lactamase–producing Haemophilus influenzae has a prevalence of 27% to 43% in the United States and would not be expected to respond to amoxicillin unless clavulanate is added; penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae varies geographically (highest in the southeast about 41% and lowest in the northwest about 26%), so initial empirical antibiotic regimens should be guided by local surveillance; Staphylococcus aureus is found in up to 10% of ABRS cases and is nearly always resistant to amoxicillin but susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanate, yet we do not routinely cover for this organism during initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for ABRS.

Impetigo and ecthyma—treatment recommendations: “Bullous and nonbullous impetigo can be treated with oral or topical antimicrobials, but oral therapy is recommended for patients with numerous lesions or in outbreaks affecting several people to help decrease transmission of infection. Treatment for ecthyma should be an oral antimicrobial.” For topical therapy, “Treatment of bullous and nonbullous impetigo should be with either mupirocin or retapamulin twice daily (bid) for 5 days (strong, high).” For systemic therapy, “Oral therapy for ecthyma or impetigo should be a 7-day regimen with an agent active against S. aureus unless cultures yield streptococci alone (when oral penicillin is the recommended agent) (strong, high),” and “dicloxacillin or cephalexin is recommended,” while “When MRSA is suspected or confirmed, doxycycline, clindamycin, or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMX-TMP) is recommended (strong, moderate).” Additionally, “Systemic antimicrobials should be used for infections during outbreaks of poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis to help eliminate nephritogenic strains of S. pyogenes from the community (strong, moderate).”

### Nationwide organism susceptibility patterns to common preoperative prophylactic antibiotics: what are we covering? [^d46876cb]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Many periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) are caused by organisms not susceptible to first-generation cephalosporins. We sought to evaluate the national susceptibility patterns of organisms to cefazolin and, or oxacillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin using antibiogram data.

Methods

Publically available regional and state antibiograms were evaluated for antibiotic susceptibility patterns to commonly infecting gram-positive organisms. The number of isolates tested in each antibiogram and percent of strains susceptible to oxacillin, clindamycin, and vancomycin were recorded. Oxacillin is used as a surrogate to cefazolin in antibiograms. A comparison of antibiotic susceptibilities was performed.

Results

Seven state and 38 regional antibiograms were reviewed. Oxacillin was a sensitive antibiotic in 99.2 ± 4.8% of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates, 0 ± 0% of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates, 44.5 ± 13.7% of coagulase-negative staphylococcus organism isolates (CNS), and 30.6 ± 10.5% of Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates. Clindamycin was a sensitive antibiotic in 75.8 ± 8.4% of MSSA isolates, 60.2 ± 13.2% of MRSA isolates, 60.3 ± 11.4% of CNS isolates, and 56.2 ± 6.5% of S epidermidis isolates. Vancomycin was a sensitive antibiotic in 99.9 ± 0.4% of MSSA isolates, 99.8 ± 0.4% of MRSA isolates, 99.8 ± 0.5% of CNS isolates, and 99.6 ± 0.7% of S epidermidis isolates. Clindamycin was significantly less sensitive in MSSA isolates as compared with oxacillin and vancomycin (P < .0001). Oxacillin was significantly less sensitive in CNS, S epidermidis, and MRSA isolates as compared with clindamycin and vancomycin (P < .0001).

Conclusion

The national clindamycin susceptibility pattern is limited to MSSA and may not have an optimal susceptibility profile suitable for use as a prophylactic antibiotic. Cefazolin continues to have excellent coverage against MSSA.

### The use of perioperative cephalexin in penicillin allergic patients in dermatologic surgery: an advisory statement [^1c71089e]. Dermatologic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Approximately 10% of patients report penicillin allergy. Based on historical guidelines, patients with a penicillin allergy should receive an alternative to cephalexin for prophylaxis in dermatologic surgery.

Objective

To determine, based on evidence, if cephalexin should be used as a first-line prophylactic antibiotic in dermatologic surgery for patients with penicillin allergy.

Methods

Systematic review of the literature was performed with defined search terms.

Results

Less than 5% of those with penicillin allergy labels have a true penicillin allergy. For patients with true, persistent penicillin allergy, there is an overall low cross-reactivity with cephalosporins, especially with cephalosporins that do not share identical R1 side chain. The first-generation cephalosporins, including cephalexin, have a slightly higher risk of cross-reactivity in patients with reported allergy to amino-penicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin) but not other penicillins. The risk of severe cross-reactivity of cephalosporins in patients with low-risk penicillin allergies is extremely low. Cephalexin has a superior side effect profile and efficacy compared to alternatives.

Conclusion

Cephalexin should be used as the first-line prophylactic antibiotic in dermatologic surgery for patients with documented penicillin allergy, including anaphylaxis. There may be a higher risk of cross-reactivity with cephalexin in patients with a confirmed amino-penicillin allergy.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^c58884cc]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Periocular inflammation—preseptal and orbital cellulitis require antibiotics that cover Staphylococcus species and Streptococcus species, with consideration for anaerobic coverage; treatment of both preseptal and orbital cellulitis should begin with amoxicillin/clavulanate (875 mg/125 mg) orally, 2 times daily for 10 d, with oral fluoroquinolones (such as moxifloxacin) as a substitute if not available; if infection is isolated to the preseptal space, evacuation can be nonemergent, but if there is any question of orbital involvement or lack of response, we recommend emergent evacuation, as orbital cellulitis is a true medical emergency and failure to treat quickly can lead to blindness, intracranial infection, and possibly death. Antibiotics: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Emergent evacuation for orbital cellulitis: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Nonemergent evacuation for periorbital cellulitis: Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Empirical therapy for serious Gram-positive infections: making the right choice [^ea9c012d]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

It is well established that delaying the administration of effective antimicrobials for the treatment of serious infections has a significant impact on patient outcomes. In this atmosphere of urgency, decision-making regarding therapy is further complicated by the current high rates of drug resistance among important pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus. To improve treatment outcomes, decrease the risk of mortality and reduce hospital costs, physicians should always administer the most appropriate antimicrobial for the given scenario. When a staphylococcal infection is suspected but the resistance phenotype is not known, agents that are effective against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus provide optimal empirical coverage. However, the number of such empirical monotherapeutic options is limited. Daptomycin has proven clinical efficacy as compared with comparator agents in Gram-positive infections, and could be considered an appropriate therapy for the treatment of infections caused by either methicillin-susceptible S. aureus or methicillin-resistant S. aureus.

### MRSA colonisation (eradicating colonisation in people without active invasive infection) [^dd9ba306]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) contains a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics, including flucloxacillin, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection. Until recently, MRSA has primarily been a problem associated with exposure to the healthcare system, especially in people with prolonged hospital admissions or underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. In many countries worldwide, a preponderance of S aureus bloodstream isolates are resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic overview, aiming to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatment for MRSA nasal or extra-nasal colonisation in adults? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to June 2014 (Clinical Evidence overviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this overview).

Results

At this update, searching of electronic databases retrieved 850 studies. After deduplication and removal of conference abstracts, 356 records were screened for inclusion in the overview. Appraisal of titles and abstracts led to the exclusion of 273 studies, and the further review of 83 full publications. Of the 83 full articles evaluated, no studies were added at this update. We performed a GRADE evaluation for three PICO combinations.

Conclusions

In this systematic overview, we categorised the efficacy for five interventions based on information about the effectiveness and safety of antiseptic body washes, chlorhexidine-neomycin nasal cream, mupirocin nasal ointment, systemic antimicrobials, and other topical antimicrobials.

### Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in community-acquired skin infections [^e1ba52ca]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Our report demonstrates that the proportion of patients with community-acquired SSTI caused by MRSA is increasing, and CA-MRSA is now the most common cause of community-acquired SSTIs at our center. Other reports have suggested that CA-MRSA is becoming more common in other geographic areas in the United States and Europe. A high proportion of CA-MRSA strains (such as the USA 300 ST:8 strain) have been found to carry the Panton-Valentine leukocidin gene, which has been associated with SSTI and necrotizing pneumonia. We have noted anecdotally that many patients with CA-MRSA exhibit a spontaneous abscess or furunculosis that the patient thinks was caused by a spider bite.

The bacterial causes of common community-acquired SSTIs are generally gram-positive organisms such as S. aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Because of the predictable etiology of these infections, most physicians do not routinely obtain cultures from these patients. Obtaining cultures of SSTIs is now of greater importance to monitor the extent of CA-MRSA infections in one's community and guide therapy in areas in which CA-MRSA is already prevalent.

Most community-acquired SSTIs are treated with antimicrobial drugs such as cephalexin and dicloxacillin. Patients requiring intravenous therapy are most commonly given agents such as cefazolin or oxacillin. In areas with a high prevalence of CA-MRSA, empiric treatment for SSTIs with β-lactam agents such as cephalexin or dicloxacillin may no longer be appropriate. Oral agents such as clindamycin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and rifampin should be considered for CA-MRSA. Although inducible clindamycin resistance was not found in the few patients we tested, clinical failure due to inducible clindamycin resistance among CA-MRSA has been reported. Whether the addition of rifampin to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole improves outcomes in SSTI is not clear, but this combination appears to be more effective in eradicating MRSA colonization. Macrolides, tetracycline, and fluoroquinolones have inconsistent activity against the MRSA isolates identified in our study and other reports of CA-MRSA. For severe infections treated in the inpatient setting, clindamycin or vancomycin should be included as part of empiric therapy.

### The Staphylococcus aureus network adaptive platform trial protocol: new tools for an old foe [^e4ed7b1c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Statistical Principles and Framework

There are 2 key elements in the statistical analysis plans: (1) repeated analyses of the core primary endpoint over the trial lifetime to evaluate prespecified decision criteria for stopping or continuing recruitment to a domain; and (2) analysis and reporting of core and domain-specific secondary endpoints once a decision threshold (superiority, noninferiority, or futility) is reached for a domain. The predefined decision criteria for a domain are:

Noninferiority—if the posterior probability of noninferiority of the investigational agent vs the standard of care is >99%; where noninferiority is defined as an odds ratio (OR) of <1.2 for the primary endpoint (where OR >1 indicates an increase in mortality). An OR of 1.2 corresponds to an absolute difference of 2.5% between intervention and standard care arms if the mortality rate in the standard care arm is 15%.
Superiority—if the posterior probability of superiority of the investigational agent vs the standard of care is >99%, where superiority is defined as an OR of <1.0 for the primary endpoint.
Futility for noninferiority—if the posterior probability of noninferiority is <1% within the maximal sample size of 7000.
Futility for superiority—if the posterior probability for superiority is <1% within the maximal sample size of 7000.

Where specified within a domain-specific appendix, agents that achieve noninferiority thresholds may be subsequently tested for superiority thresholds without a public declaration of the noninferiority result. For example, if cefazolin achieved the threshold for noninferiority to (flu)cloxacillin in the MSSA silo and backbone antibiotic domain, and the analysis indicated it would not be futile to assess for superiority, participants would continue to be randomized to cefazolin or (flu)cloxacillin.

The first platform Bayesian update will be performed after 500 eligible platform participants have completed 90 days of follow-up (“completers”); thereafter, updates will be performed with every 500 additional completers until the trial is concluded. A detailed description of the statistical design and principles and the trial simulations will be published separately.

### Are all β-lactams similarly effective in the treatment of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia? [^136b23f2]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2011). Low credibility.

Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) is susceptible to many beta-lactams. We compared cloxacillin and cefazolin, the first-line recommended antibiotics, and other beta-lactams in the treatment of MSSA bacteraemia. This was a retrospective cohort study. Included were adult patients with clinically-significant MSSA bacteraemia treated with a beta-lactam that was started within 48 h after blood cultures were taken. We separated between empirical treatment administered to the patient before receipt of final blood culture results and definitive treatment administered thereafter. Univariate and multivariable analyses for 30-day (empirical treatment) and 90-day (definitive treatment) mortality were conducted, including the type of beta-lactam administered to the patient. Five-hundred and forty-one patients were included for the analysis of empirical treatment and 498 patients alive at 7 days were evaluable for definitive treatment. Empirical treatment with cloxacillin or cefazolin (n = 131) was associated with lower 30-day mortality as compared with cefuroxime (n = 98, p 0.058), ceftriaxone or cefotaxime (n = 194, p 0.008) and beta-lactam-beta-lactamase combinations (n = 61, p 0.013), with adjusted odds ratios (OR) for death ranging from 1.98 to 2.68. Definitive treatment with cefazolin (n = 72) was not significantly different from cloxacillin (n = 281); adjusted OR for 90-day mortality 0.91 (95% confidence interval 0.47-1.77). Treatment with cefazolin both in the empirical and definitive periods was not significantly different from cloxacillin; adjusted OR 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.18-3.62). Treatment of MSSA bacteraemia with cefazolin is not significantly different from treatment with cloxacillin, while treatment with other beta-lactams, including second and third generation cephalosporins, might be associated with higher mortality.

### Cefoxitin sodium (cefoxitin) [^812263cc]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

(5) Septicemia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains), Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, and Bacteroides species including B. fragilis.

(6) Bone and joint infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains).

(7) Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes and other streptococci (excluding enterococci e.g., Enterococcus faecalis [formerly Streptococcus faecalis]), Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella species, Bacteroides species including B. fragilis, Clostridium species, Peptococcus niger, and Peptostreptococcus species.

Appropriate culture and susceptibility studies should be performed to determine the susceptibility of the causative organisms to CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP. Therapy may be started while awaiting the results of these studies.

In randomized comparative studies, CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP and cephalothin were comparably safe and effective in the management of infections caused by gram-positive cocci and gram-negative rods susceptible to the cephalosporins. CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP has a high degree of stability in the presence of bacterial beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases.

Many infections caused by aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria resistant to some cephalosporins respond to CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP. Similarly, many infections caused by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria resistant to some penicillin antibiotics (ampicillin, carbenicillin, penicillin G) respond to treatment with CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP. Many infections caused by mixtures of susceptible aerobic and anaerobic bacteria respond to treatment with CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP.

Prevention:

CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP is indicated for the prophylaxis of infection in patients undergoing uncontaminated gastrointestinal surgery, vaginal hysterectomy, abdominal hysterectomy, or cesarean section.

If there are signs of infection, specimens for culture should be obtained for identification of the causative organism so that appropriate treatment may be instituted.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP and other antibacterial drugs, CEFOXITIN FOR INJECTION, USP should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### MRSA: treating people with infection [^6a7bb38a]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2010). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection, especially in people with prolonged hospital admissions, with underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. About 20% of S aureus in blood cultures in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland is resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatment for MRSA infections at any body site? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to November 2009 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 11 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: clindamycin, daptomycin, fusidic acid, glycopeptides (teicoplanin, vancomycin), linezolid, macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin), quinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), quinupristin-dalfopristin, pristinamycin, rifampicin, tetracyclines (doxycycline, minocycline, oxytetracycline), tigecycline, trimethoprim, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole).

### Cellulitis in children: a retrospective single centre study from Australia [^6dea275f]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Fifty-two patients underwent surgical procedures including subcutaneous abscess drainage (37/52, 71.2%), finger or toe-nail removal (14/52, 26.9%) and foreign body removal (1/52, 1.9%).

Most non-admitted patients received oral antibiotics only (95/96, 99.0%), commonly cephalexin (70/95, 73.7%) for a median duration of 5 days (IQR 5–7). Three patients received parenteral antibiotics (online supplemental table S2). Documented follow-up was less likely in non-admitted patients compared with those admitted (11.5% vs 38.8%, p<0.01).

The most frequent investigations were full blood count, C reactive protein and wound swab (table 7). Blood cultures were performed in 45.6% (94/206) of admitted cases with only one positive results: coagulase negative Staphylococcus, a probable skin contaminant. Investigations were less common in non-admitted patients (p<0.001) (table 7).

Table 7 
Investigations carried out in children presenting with cellulitis

Wound swabs yielded pathogens in 36.1% (109/302) of patients. S. aureus was most frequently identified (n=94, 86.2%): 60 (63.8%) methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA); 34 (36.2%) methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 22 (20.2%) S. pyogenes (table 8). Fourteen children had mixed gram-positive infections: MSSA and S. pyogenes (n=10); MRSA and S. pyogenes (n=3); MSSA and MRSA (n=1). S. pyogenes was detected in isolation in only nine cases.

### Evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of sydenham chorea: consensus guidelines [^5bdf56bb]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Sydenham chorea—initial antibiotic management is recommended at diagnosis as a precautionary measure in all patients, independently of microbiological confirmation of streptococcal throat infection; evidence for a recent streptococcal infection is usually not available in the majority of patients (85% in total but mainly by serological testing; by positive throat culture for GAS in only 37%). In the absence of penicillin allergy, treatments of choice are a single dose of intramuscular benzathine benzylpenicillin G, or a 10-day course of oral penicillin V or amoxicillin, while oral cephalexin (or other first-generation cephalosporin) or a macrolide may be used with nonimmediate or immediate allergy to penicillin, respectively.

### No benefit with addition of TMP / SMX to cephalexin for nonpurulent (...) [^f639759b]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does the addition of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole to cephalexin increase the rate of cure for uncomplicated cellulitis. Bottom Line Compared with cephalexin alone, covering for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci with cephalexin plus TMP/SMX does not improve rates of clinical cure when treating nonpurulent cellulitis. However, a trend favoring the combination regimen was found in a modified intention-to-treat population in this study, so further research may be required. . Synopsis Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend treating nonpurulent cellulitis with an antibiotic that is active only against streptococci. However, in practice, clinicians often prescribe an antibiotic regimen that includes activity against MRSA.

Using concealed allocation, these investigators randomized 500 patients who presented to the emergency department with nonpurulent, uncomplicated cellulitis to receive a seven-day course of cephalexin plus TMP/SMX or cephalexin plus matching placebo. Bedside ultrasonography was used to exclude patients with abscess. The primary outcome was clinical cure at 14 to 21 days in the per-protocol group. No significant difference was detected, with approximately 85% clinical cure in both groups. P =. 07). Although this difference was not statistically significant, the 95% confidence interval includes the minimal clinically important difference of 10%, suggesting a possible benefit.

Adverse events, which were reported as mild 90% of the time, were not different between the two groups. Study design: Randomized controlled trial.

### The Staphylococcus aureus network adaptive platform trial protocol: new tools for an old foe [^17e5aabc]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS BLOODSTREAM INFECTION—THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM

Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections (SABs) are common worldwide and considered among the “bread and butter” of clinical infectious diseases practice. More than 120 000 episodes occur per year in the United States, with a 30-day mortality per episode of 20%–30% in high-income countries. Almost all patients with SAB require hospitalization, typically receive a minimum of 2 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, and remain in hospital an average of 20 days. For such a common condition, a surprising number of basic therapeutic questions remain unanswered. Among others, these include: Is an anti-staphylococcal penicillin or cefazolin preferred for methicillin-susceptible SAB? Can combination therapy for methicillin-resistant SAB improve therapeutic efficacy without significant increases in toxicity? Is switching to oral antibiotics as safe and efficacious as continued intravenous therapy?

Traditional Fixed Randomized Trial Designs Are Blunt Tools

Clinical trials for SAB are challenging and expensive. Despite the burden of disease, <3000 participants have been enrolled in completed randomized clinical trials (n = 15) for SAB from 2000 to 2021. The sample size of these trials ranges from 15 to 758. Challenges include the heterogeneity of the disease, variability in therapeutic and diagnostic approaches, and difficulties in recruitment. The limited evidence results in considerable variability in clinical practice. Traditional trial designs are based on achieving a sample size calculated a priori according to a series of assumptions, which often prove to be inaccurate or are manipulated to align with available funding, so underpowered trials may be completed without providing definitive answers.

Adaptive Platform Trials—Cutting Through Uncertainty to Answer Questions Efficiently

Recently, trials making use of disease-based platforms and within-trial adaptations (ie, platform trials) have gained prominence. These trials can answer multiple questions simultaneously and adapt to make the most efficient use of a given budget and sample size. The RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVID-19 Therapy), REMAP-CAP (Randomised Embedded Multifactorial Adaptive Platform-Community Acquired Pneumonia), and the National Institutes of Health–funded ACTIV (Acceperating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines) and ACTT (Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial) trials are examples of platform trials that have provided clinically relevant answers to multiple therapeutic questions for coronavirus disease 2019.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^901ff5f7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Table 5—Recommended therapy for infections following animal bites outlines oral and intravenous dosing with organism coverage notes. Oral amoxicillin-clavulanate 875/125 mg bid is listed, and intravenous ampicillin-sulbactam 1.5–3.0 g every 6–8 h and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.37 g every 6–8 h are options. Doxycycline is dosed as 100 mg bid orally and 100 mg every 12 h intravenously with the comment “Excellent activity against Pasteurella multocida; some streptococci are resistant.” Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SMX-TMP) is 160–800 mg bid orally or 5–10 mg/kg/day of TMP component intravenously with “Good activity against aerobes; poor activity against anaerobes.” Clindamycin is 300 mg tid orally or 600 mg every 6–8 h intravenously with “Good activity against staphylococci, streptococci, and anaerobes; misses P. multocida.” Cefuroxime 500 mg bid orally and 1 g every 12 h intravenously has “Good activity against P. multocida; misses anaerobes.” Under fluoroquinolones, the class note is “Good activity against P. multocida; misses MRSA and some anaerobes,” with ciprofloxacin 500–750 mg bid orally or 400 mg every 12 h intravenously, and moxifloxacin 400 mg daily orally or intravenously marked “Monotherapy; good for anaerobes also.”

### Cefaclor as a first-line treatment for acute uncomplicated cystitis: a retrospective single-center study [^2c6fa01a]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

There has also been an increasing issue on multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria. Typically, MDR bacteria are associated with UTl infections. However, some MDR bacteria have become quite prevalent causes of community-acquired infections, spreading into the community, and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. In other words, patients with AUC should be managed in terms of not only the treatment of current cystitis but also the prevention of such pathogens in a prospective view. For example, the third-generation cephalosporin, which covers a variety of gram-negative rods and has also been frequently prescribed to outpatients with AUC as empirical therapy, has been reported to contribute to the production of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL).

These tendencies thus call for a new look at the therapeutic options, which have a relatively narrower spectrum, and we believe that one of the suitable alternatives is cefaclor (CCL), whose spectrum of activity is identical to that of cephalexin classified as the first-generation cephalosporins except that CCL also showed the added activity against β-lactamase-producing Haemophilus influenzae. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of CCL in patients with AUC.

### Positive bacterial culture results at a dermatologic surgery center: a single-site retrospective review [^5051f24e]. Dermatologic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Typical prophylactic coverage of suspected cutaneous surgical-site infections (SSIs) predominantly covers gram-positive bacteria. Data regarding the frequency of infection with unusual bacteria, not covered by prophylaxis, are not available.

Objective

A retrospective 10-year review of culture-positive infections at a single academic site was performed.

Materials and Methods

All positive bacterial culture results at the Washington University Center for Dermatologic and Cosmetic Surgery between October 31, 2007, and October 31, 2017, were collected and analyzed.

Results

Coagulase-negative staphylococcus accounted for 20.8% of positive culture results. Staphylococcus aureus caused 45.4% of infections. The remaining 33.8% were due to non-S. aureus bacteria, most frequently with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.8%). Numerous other gram-negative organisms and unusual gram-positive organisms were cultured. The lower extremity and ear were the only sites more likely to be infected with non-S. aureus bacteria. Smokers and immunosuppressed individuals were not more likely to have an SSI with non-S. aureus bacteria.

Conclusion

A significant proportion of all SSIs with positive culture results was due to bacteria that are not sensitive to beta-lactam prophylaxis. Broader coverage for suspected SSI should be considered, particularly on the lower extremity and ear.

### IDSA clinical practice guideline for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in children and adults [^e02cba14]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, more specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy (MRSA coverage), IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend to do not provide routine antimicrobial coverage for S. aureus or MRSA during initial empiric therapy of ABRS, although S. aureus (including MRSA) is a potential pathogen in ABRS.

### International consensus recommendations for the use of prolonged-infusion β-lactam antibiotics: endorsed by the American college of clinical pharmacy, British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, European society of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and Society of Infectious Diseases Pharmacists [^bc3e13a7]. Pharmacotherapy (2023). High credibility.

Prolonged-infusion β-lactams—preclinical bacterial killing (background question II) indicates that in vitro and animal data, predominantly with gram-negative bacteria, demonstrated equivalent or better killing for prolonged infusion (PI) compared to short infusion (SI); this is likely attributable to greater fT>MIC with PI compared with SI. Only one study observed reduced bacterial killing and lower survivorship with continuous infusion (CI) relative to SI (methicillin in a rabbit infective endocarditis model of Staphylococcus aureus). Increased bacterial killing with PI relative to SI at equivalent total daily exposures is only likely to be observed when there is an increased ability to achieve critical pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) targets with the PI regimen relative to the SI regimen, and a meta-regression reported minimal effect of infusion mode when appropriate exposure is achieved in both arms (e.g., 40%–70% fT>MIC for SI and a Css/MIC ratio of >4 for CI).

### MRSA colonisation (eradicating colonisation in people without active / invasive infection) [^e5ff1cca]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has a gene that makes it resistant to methicillin as well as to other beta-lactam antibiotics, including flucloxacillin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, cephalosporins, and carbapenems. MRSA can be part of the normal body flora (colonisation), especially in the nose, but it can cause infection. Until recently, MRSA has primarily been a problem associated with exposure to the healthcare system, especially in people with prolonged hospital admissions, with underlying disease, or after antibiotic use. In many countries worldwide, a preponderance of S aureus bloodstream isolates are resistant to methicillin.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatment for MRSA nasal or extra-nasal colonisation? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to January 2010 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 9 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: antiseptic body washes, chlorhexidine-neomycin nasal cream, mupirocin nasal ointment, systemic antimicrobials, tea tree oil preparations, and other topical antimicrobials.

Micron-sized chamber production and cell growth

Liquefied agarose (5% w/v) in M9 minimal media (supplemented with 0.2%(w/v) glucose, 0.1%(w/v) casamino acids, 2 μg ml −1 thiamine, 40 μM A22 and 20 μg ml −1 cephalexin) was dispersed on glass slides and the silica mold (pillar facing downwards) was placed on top. The molds contained either round or rectangular pillars, or various geometrical shapes, as described above. Once the agarose solidified, the mold was removed and ~ 5 μl of live cell culture at OD 600 0.4–0.55 (pre-treated with 16 μM A22 for 10–15 min) was applied on top. To allow the cells to adapt to the different shapes, slides were incubated at RT or 30 °C in a parafilm-sealed petri dish together with a wet tissue to prevent drying. After incubation, cells were covered with a pre-cleaned cover glass (♯1.5) for live cell imaging. For STED imaging, cells were first fixed with ice-cold methanol for 5 min and carefully rinsed with PBS prior to cover glass application.

Table 4. 
Antibiotic Options for EOS in SAB—Dosing, Administration, Pharmacological Properties

Principles:
For beta-lactams, maximum doses have been recommended to overcome theoretical issues with drug exposure (bioavailability). Lower doses in specific circumstances have been recommended in the footnotes.
Dosing regimens to minimise patient inconvenience have been prioritised, as explained in footnotes.
Doses are suggestions only and alternate doses used as standard local practice can be maintained.
Contraindications and precautions, including significant drug interactions, and drug toxicities and their required monitoring are not listed and are the responsibility of the prescribing team to review and manage. Some considerations are provided to aid the choice of drug.
We have not recommended dose changes for obesity or pregnancy in the setting of EOS (ie, step-down therapy after a period of intravenous therapy/source control/clinical stability). Despite a potential effect of obesity and pregnancy on pharmacokinetics (increased volume of distribution), we do not think this warrants dose adjustment for step-down therapy.
With increased creatinine clearance in pregnancy, there is a theoretical concern that the concentration of the antibiotics may not be above the required MIC for a sufficient period of time. However, general practice in obstetric dosing of antibiotics is to dose at the highest end of the dosing range, as is currently planned in the SNAP study.

Table 5. 
Hierarchy of Recommended Oral Antibiotics for EOS by Silo (ie Susceptibility of S. aureus)

After study-mandated minimum treatment durations, the antibiotic choice, route, and total duration of treatment are at clinician's discretion. The assigned treatment strategy is continued unless a participant dies or withdraws from the domain or the treating clinician deems continued participation no longer in their best interests.

Participant Timeline

As indicated in Table 6, minimal assessments or investigations are required on top of routine care, apart from the eligibility assessments, and data collection.

### Safe use of selected cephalosporins in penicillin-allergic patients: a meta-analysis [^ebbf918e]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Recent analysis of clinical data and a clearer understanding of the role of chemical structure in the development of cross-reactivity indicate that the increased risk of an allergic reaction to a cephalosporin in penicillin-allergic patients is smaller than previously postulated.

Method

Medline and EMBASE databases were searched with the keywords: cephalosporin, penicillin, allergy, and cross-sensitivity for the years 1960 through 2005. Among 219 articles retrieved, 9 served as source material for this evidence-based meta-analysis.

Results

A significant increase in allergic reactions to cephalothin (odds ratio [OR] = 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1 to 5.5), cephaloridine (OR = 8.7; CI = 5.9 to 12.8), and cephalexin (OR = 5.8; CI = 3.6 to 9.2), and all first generation cephalosporins plus cefamandole (OR = 4.8; CI = 3.7 to 6.2) were observed in penicillin allergic patients; no increase was observed with second generation cephalosporins (OR = 1.1; CI, 0.6 to 2.1) or third generation cephalosporins (OR = 0.5; CI = 0.2 to 1.1). Clinical challenges, skin testing, and monoclonal antibody studies point to the paramount importance of similarities in side chain structure to predict cross-allergy between cephalosporins and penicillins.

Conclusion

First-generation cephalosporins have cross-allergy with penicillins, but cross-allergy is negligible with second- and third-generation cephalosporins. Particular emphasis should be placed on the role of chemical structure in determining the risk of cross-reactivity between specific agents.
