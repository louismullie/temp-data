## Question

Whats the blister that forms on lips during high fever called and reason for it

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the blister that forms on the lips during high fever is called and what causes it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical description. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology linking fever to blister formation. Next, I will consider key differentials that can mimic this presentation. Finally, I will confirm the terminology and provide a concise, reference-backed answer.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. The description of a lip blister occurring with high fever strongly suggests herpes simplex labialis, also known as a cold sore or fever blister, which classically presents as a cluster of small, painful, fluid-filled vesicles on the lip or perioral skin that crust and heal within about a week, often triggered by systemic illness or fever [^77b647b0] [^d12e9e2a].

> Wait, let me verify the pathophysiology before I jump ahead. HSV-1 establishes lifelong latency in the trigeminal ganglion; fever, stress, or other triggers can reactivate the virus, leading to axonal transport to the lip epithelium, viral replication, and vesicle formation, which explains why these lesions often accompany febrile illnesses [^f63b878e] [^d12e9e2a].

> Hold on, I should consider important differentials that can look similar. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease can cause oral ulcers and a vesicular rash on hands and feet, but the lip lesions are typically inside the mouth rather than on the vermilion border and are accompanied by a different distribution of rash, so this is less likely here [^8f37da77]. Erythema multiforme can produce lip erosions and target lesions, often triggered by HSV itself, but it tends to be more extensive and recurrent, and the primary lesion here sounds more focal and vesicular rather than targetoid, which makes EM less likely in a first presentation like this [^4dab6fcd]. Stevens-Johnson syndrome presents with widespread mucosal erosions and systemic toxicity, which does not match a solitary lip blister with fever, so I should not conflate these entities [^a2a44786].

> I need to ensure the terminology is precise. The lesion is called a fever blister or, more formally, herpes simplex labialis (also known as a cold sore), and the reason it appears during high fever is reactivation of latent HSV-1 driven by systemic stress and immune modulation during febrile illness [^77b647b0] [^f63b878e].

> Let me reconsider any nuances. While HSV-1 is the usual culprit, HSV-2 can occasionally cause orolabial disease, and immunocompromised hosts may have atypical or more severe presentations; however, in immunocompetent patients with a classic perioral vesicle during fever, HSV-1 reactivation remains the most parsimonious explanation [^ef34f396] [^cab7e5c0].

---

The blister that forms on the lips during high fever is called a **fever blister** or **cold sore** (herpes labialis) [^77b647b0]. It is caused by **reactivation of HSV-1** [^f63b878e] from latency in the trigeminal ganglion, triggered by fever, stress, or immune suppression [^d12e9e2a]. The lesion presents as a cluster of painful, fluid-filled vesicles on the lip that crust and heal in 7–10 days [^d12e9e2a]; management is supportive, and antivirals (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) can shorten duration if started early [^71f9d557] [^cc262abb].

---

## Clinical appearance and course

Fever blisters typically present as a cluster of **small, painful, fluid-filled vesicles** on the lip or perioral skin [^77b647b0]. The vesicles rupture within 24–48 hours, forming shallow ulcers that crust and heal within 7–10 days without scarring [^d12e9e2a]. Prodromal symptoms — tingling, itching, or burning — often precede the eruption by 6–24 hours [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology

HSV-1 establishes lifelong latency in the trigeminal ganglion [^f63b878e]; **reactivation** is triggered by fever, stress, ultraviolet exposure, or immunosuppression, leading to axonal transport of virus to the lip and vesicle formation [^d12e9e2a].

---

## Triggers and risk factors

Common triggers include:

- **Fever or systemic illness**: Common precipitant of reactivation [^notfound].
- **Stress**: Physical or emotional stressors [^notfound].
- **Ultraviolet radiation**: Sun exposure is a frequent trigger [^8b326c5c].
- **Immunosuppression**: HIV, chemotherapy, or corticosteroids increase risk [^3941f843].

---

## Differential diagnosis

Other conditions that can mimic fever blisters include:

| **Condition** | **Distinguishing features** |
|-|-|
| Herpes zoster (shingles) | Unilateral, dermatomal, often with severe pain [^7ea0d0de] |
| Hand-foot-and-mouth disease | Oral ulcers with vesicles on hands and feet [^8f37da77] |
| Erythema multiforme | Target lesions, often HSV-associated [^a42812db] |
| Stevens-Johnson syndrome | Severe mucosal involvement, systemic toxicity [^a2a44786] |

---

## Management

Management is supportive and includes:

- **Supportive care**: Analgesics, antipyretics, and topical antiseptics [^notfound].
- **Antiviral therapy**: Acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir shorten duration if started within 24–48 hours of prodrome [^71f9d557] [^cc262abb].
- **Prevention**: Avoid triggers, use sunscreen, and consider suppressive antivirals for frequent recurrences [^8b326c5c] [^29a80122].

---

## Complications

Complications are uncommon but include **secondary bacterial infection**, **herpetic whitlow** (digital infection), and **eczema herpeticum** (widespread HSV in atopic dermatitis) [^a24769bf] [^4b6ed43d].

---

Fever blisters are **HSV-1 reactivation lesions** on the lip, triggered by fever or stress; they are self-limited but can be shortened with early antivirals [^77b647b0] [^71f9f557].

### Mitochondrial changes associated with viral infectious diseases in the paediatric population [^d12e9e2a]. Reviews in Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

2.3.1 Structure and replication cycle

HSV presents a typical morphology with an icosahedral capsule of 162 capsomeres, covered with a viral envelope, and includes a genome comprising a single DNA molecule, from 120 to 250 kbp. The viral infection exhibits a definitive tendency toward tropism, being highly recurrent on the surfaces of organs that become infected. The productive phase of infection, where the virus releases multiple viral proteins, is followed by a latency phase in which the viral genome remains within host cells throughout the life of the infected individual. Occasionally, latent HSV can undergo reactivation processes and once again lead to a productive phase in which numerous viral proteins are released.

The HSV viral cycle can be divided into different phases including(i) entry phase; (ii) expression of viral genes, the glycoproteins and other virion components involved in the development of the infection, including UL41, which induces inhibition of host protein synthesis, destroying most of the mRNAs, allowing HSV to fully take over the protein synthesis machinery and increase efficiency of virus production and UL13 protein kinase, whose absence blocks infection. Once in the cell, the capsid passes through the nuclear pores and releases the DNA into the nucleoplasm. It is probable that the cellular cytoskeleton contributes to transport to the nucleus. (iii) Replication, carried out in the cell nucleus; (iv) combination, encapsidation and release, meaning that the linear viral DNA is packaged in a preformed capsid containing the viral protease; and (v) latency periods alternating with reactivation periods, in which the virus can be transported through the axon to the periphery, producing lytic infection at the level of the epithelial cells.

2.3.2 HSV in the paediatric population

Neonatal HSV infection causes high mortality and significant morbidity. Incidence estimates range from 1/3000 to 1/20,000 births. Type 2 predominates over type 1 HSV. In the United States, paediatric HSV infections are common; as many as 36% of children < 14 years of age have serologic evidence of HSV‐1 infection. Often around the age of 5, a child's first cold sore may appear. Cold sores (also called fever blisters or oral herpes) start as small blisters that form around the lips and mouth. After a few days, the blisters crust over and heal completely in a week.

### HFMD symptoms and… [^8f37da77]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Symptoms of hand, foot, and mouth disease include fever, mouth sores, and a skin rash on the hands and feet.
- HFMD is common in infants and children younger than 5 years old.
- Most children have mild symptoms for 7 to 10 days. Signs and symptoms HFMD symptoms usually include fever, mouth sores, and skin rash. Fever and flu-like symptoms Children often get a fever and other flu-like symptoms 3 to 5 days after they catch the virus. These can include:

- Fever
- Eating or drinking less
- Sore throat
- Feeling unwell. Mouth sores Your child can get painful mouth sores. These sores usually start as small red spots, often on the tongue and insides of the mouth. The spots blister and can become painful. Signs that swallowing might be painful for your child:

- Not eating or drinking
- Drooling more than usual
- Only wanting to drink cold fluids. Skin rash Your child can get a rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

It can also show up on the buttocks, legs, and arms. The rash usually is not itchy and looks like flat or slightly raised red spots; sometimes with blisters that have an area of redness at their base. Fluid in the blister can contain the virus that causes HFMD. Keep blisters clean and avoid touching them. Viral meningitis Although very rare, a small number of people with HFMD get viral meningitis. This causes fever, headache, stiff neck, or back pain. The infected person may require to be hospitalized for a few days. Keep Reading: About Viral Meningitis Encephalitis or paralysis While extremely rare, a small number of people. with HFMD get encephalitis or paralysis. Healthcare providers can usually identify HFMD by examining the rash appearance while considering the child's age and other symptoms. Sometimes, they might collect samples from the child's throat or poop.

Then they will send them to a laboratory to test for the virus.

### Recent advance in management of herpes simplex in Japan [^c3a48ea4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Herpes simplex, a common infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV), is transmitted through contact of the skin/mucous membrane and establishes latency in the sensory ganglia for the rest of the life of the host. HSV occasionally reactivates and forms blisters around the lips or genitalia in some patients. Repeated overt symptoms, and, much more frequent, subclinical reactivation in the mucosa, make the host retain anti-HSV immunity continuously, resulting in maintaining steadily elevated antibody titer at any point after infection. Clinical symptoms differ in primary infection and recurrence. Primary infections sometimes manifest as severe symptoms such as fever and lymphadenopathy in addition to blisters/erosions of the skin, gingiva, lips, and oral mucosa, while recurrent herpes is generally mild. Diagnosing typical herpes simplex is not difficult, but when the course and manifestations are typical, definitive tests to identify HSV infection are limited since serology is not useful except with primary infection. For treatment, safe and effective oral antiviral drugs are available. Patient-initiated therapy is a new method of administration labeled in Japan. Amenamevir, an inhibitor of viral helicase primase, is available in Japan and labeled in addition to herpes zoster. These new diagnostic and therapeutic tools should be used for better management of herpes simplex.

### Improving aseptic injection standards in aesthetic clinical practice [^94acf3b7]. Dermatologic Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

3 RESULTS

Various recommendations were made to provide a step‐by‐step procedure to achieve and maintain a high standard of asepsis and infection control. The recommendations were divided into three phases for patients and health care professionals, covering preprocedure (including patient selection), during‐procedure, and postprocedure considerations.

3.1 Patient selection

Selecting appropriate patients and, critically, not treating inappropriate patients is crucial for avoiding complications with STF. 19 Obtaining a thorough patient history of skin conditions, as well as allergies, systemic disease, current medication, and previous procedures is mandatory clinical practice. 17

Although infections following treatment with STF are uncommon, 20 skin conditions and infections can be exacerbated, causing complications following dermal filler procedures. 19 In general, there are several broad areas of infection risk to consider before injecting a patient: viral, bacterial, and fungal (usually Candida) species, which may also occur as polymicrobial infections. 21

Disruption of the skin due to inflammatory or infective conditions, such as rosacea, dermatitis or Herpes simplex, may also permit infection 17 and pretreatment of underlying conditions may be important to enable adequate healing time to restore the skin's barrier function. 22 H. simplex is a common viral infection following dermal injection, 21, 23 and patients with a history of cold sores or fever blisters may be pretreated with antivirals such as acyclovir, famciclovir, or valacyclovir to reduce the severity and duration of cutaneous herpes infections. 19, 21, 23 To prevent virus reactivation, prophylactic treatment may be of value for patients with a known history of H. simplex infection, especially when injecting in the perioral area and lips. 19 In cases of active inflammatory dermatitis, including atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis, the clinician must make their best judgment for treatment based on the severity of the condition and its proximity to the treatment area. 19

### Adoption of innovation in herpes simplex virus keratitis [^ba0d1c76]. Cornea (2020). Medium credibility.

"But there were also other fevers… Many had their mouths affected with aphthous ulcerations. There were also many defluxions about the genital parts, ulcerations, and boils (phymata), externally and internally, about the groins. Watery ophthalmies of chronic character, with pains and fungous excrescences of the eyelids, externally and internally, called fig, which destroyed the sight of many persons".

 — Hippocrates, Book II Section III, Of the Epidemics (c. 400 BCE), translated by Francis Adams

Since antiquity, infections caused by the human herpes simplex virus (HSV) have presented a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for physicians. The first possible descriptions of HSV infections were documented by ancient Greek scholars such as Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE to c. 375 BCE), who used the term "herpes" to describe skin lesions which would "creep" or "crawl" over affected areas. – Medical, cultural, and even political references to such orocutaneous eruptions would appear thereafter, from the Roman emperor Tiberius forbidding the act of kissing during his reign (14–37 AD), to Shakespeare's description of lesions arising "O'er ladies' lips… with blisters plagues" in his tragedy Romeo and Juliet. It was not until the mid to late 19th century that an infectious agent was implicated, with the work of a French dermatologist Vidaldemonstrating human transmission by the induction of herpetic vesicles in healthy subjects after inoculation with infected fluid. The corneal manifestations of HSV infection also gained recognition around this time, with Swiss ophthalmologists Horner and Emmert describing "herpes corneal febrilis", and "dendritic keratitis"respectively, both characterized by a nonspecific prodrome of fever and coryza, followed by vision-reducing corneal disease. HSV was later successfully isolated in experimental rabbit models of herpetic keratitis performed by Löwenstein, Gruter, and Lipshütz. These early investigations at the turn of the 20th century laid the foundation for our current understanding of HSV infections.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^a24769bf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) cause a spectrum of clinical infections, including:
Cold sores or "fever blisters" (rashes made up of painful clusters of small, fluid-filled blisters)
Genital rashes or ulcers
Sores on the fingers or toes, called "herpetic whitlow"
A severe skin rash in individuals with eczema (called eczema herpeticum)
Primary HSV gingivostomatitis, which is common in young children and associated with many ulcers in and around the mouth, drooling, high fever, and swollen lymph nodes in the neck
Severe, life-threatening illness in young infants that can affect the brain, liver, and lungs. Newborns who are infected with HSV may or may not have a skin rash.
Encephalitis or meningitis in older children and adults.

Like varicella, the chickenpox, and shingles virus, HSV stays in the body after a person's first infection. Reactivation of HSV-related skin rashes and cold sores is common. Cases of oral HSV may not be obvious and the virus may be present in saliva even in the absence of visible sores. The virus spreads though contact with infected sores or contaminated secretions. People with cold sores should avoid kissing or having their mouths come in contact with newborns or immune compromised individuals. There is no vaccine available for HSV.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 9 refugees, immigrants, and migrants [^5cd21eba]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Fever and rash in returned travelers — viral etiologies and dengue features are highlighted: "Many illnesses fall into the category of fever with a rash", and "In returned travelers, fever and rash are most often, but not always, due to viral infections", though "bacterial infections, parasitic infections, systemic fungal infections, and some noninfectious conditions can also cause fever and rash". When rash shows "petechiae/purpura or by abundant vesicles, pustules, or widespread blisters, the evaluation should be prompt and thorough". Among systemic viral illnesses, "The first 3 conditions discussed — dengue, chikungunya, and Zika — are viral diseases transmitted by Aedes spp. mosquitoes and often present as undifferentiated fevers", with rashes providing clues because "Rashes, particularly widespread petechial eruptions, provide important diagnostic information" and "Viral illnesses often occur in small outbreaks". For dengue, it is "characterized by an abrupt onset of high fever, frontal headache (often accompanied by retro-orbital pain), and myalgia", and a macular rash "may appear 2–4 days after illness onset", while "A petechial rash may occur in classic and severe dengue".

### Herpetic infection in epidermolysis bullosa [^a700c399]. Pediatric Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with various forms of epidermolysis bullosa have fragile skin which can act as a breeding ground for multiple microbial agents. Standard wound care practices advocate the use of special dressings on open erosions as well as antibiotic topical medications to treat and prevent cutaneous infections. We report a child with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa admitted to our institution because of fevers at home. She was treated with multiple antibiotics for a cutaneous infection of the right hand. During her hospital stay, she sustained persistent fevers, and oral erosions developed, with progressive hemorrhagic crusting. Viral culture of the lip grew herpes simplex virus type 1, consistent with a diagnosis of herpetic gingivostomatitis. We present this patient to illustrate the importance of investigating wounds of epidermolysis bullosa patients for viral agents when faced with managing a child with an unclear source of fever. To the best of our knowledge, although this is the first report of herpetic gingivostomatitis in association with epidermolysis bullosa, it is likely to be more prevalent than the literature could suggest.

### Lipschutz ulcers: evaluation and management of acute genital ulcers in women [^1a448b98]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Acute genital ulcers are painful and distressing to women and perplexing to the providers who care for them. The differential diagnosis includes sexually and nonsexually transmitted infections, autoimmune conditions, drug reactions, and local manifestations of systemic illness. However, in many cases, no causative agent is identified, and lesions are classified as idiopathic aphthosis. In the setting of fever and acute onset of genital ulcers in girls and women, the term Lipschutz ulcers has been used to describe ulcers associated with an immunologic reaction to a distant source of infection or inflammation. The aims of this article are to review the differential diagnosis and pathogenesis of acute genital ulcers, to offer an evaluation and classification scheme, and to discuss treatment options for the dermatologist who cares for women and girls with vulvar ulcers.

### Clinicopathological challenges of diagnosing reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption [^f22caf69]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Case presentation

Case 1

An adolescent male presented to an Emergency Department (ED) with an 8 day history of sore throat. He had cough and high-grade fevers. His lips were erythematous, and he had left-sided cervical lymphadenopathy. His medical history included scarlet fever and three episodes of Group A Streptococcus tonsillitis confirmed by throat cultures. He had a documented penicillin allergy, so had been prescribed erythromycin by a general practitioner on the fifth day of the illness. However, the commencement of erythromycin was thought to be unrelated to his symptoms including the development of cracked, bleeding lips, painful ulcers of the oropharynx (figure 1) and preputial mucosa on the third day of the illness.

At the ED, he was moderately dehydrated. He was admitted for intravenous (IV) fluid support and treated with cephalexin for suspected bacterial pharyngitis. He later developed non-purulent limbic-sparing conjunctivitis and dyspnoea. A chest X-ray revealed right upper lobe pneumonia. Initial differential diagnoses included Kawasaki disease and Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS). However, IgM serology returned positive for M. pneumoniae, and a diagnosis of RIME was made. His antibiotic therapy was changed to roxithromycin.

Case 2

A young girl with no significant medical history presented with a blistering rash, with conjunctivitis and labial and oropharyngeal mucositis (figure 2a-c). There was no history of recent new medications preceding the onset of symptoms.

Figure 2
Examples of non-mucosal involvement, such as pseudotargetoid lesions (a), purpuric macules (b) and papulonodules (c).

Nitrous oxide sedation was used because of severe pain and procedural anxiety. This helped to facilitate IV access, blood tests, ophthalmology and dermatology assessments. The rash had both well-circumscribed vesicles surrounded by erythematous rings and areas of yellow crusted ulceration. Ophthalmology examination revealed purulent bilateral conjunctivitis. There was extensive haemorrhagic mucositis and crusting of the lips, mouth and throat. Blood tests showed a high C-reactive protein level, but the white cell count was normal. Nasopharyngeal PCR testing for viral and bacterial pathogens returned positive for influenza B only.

Both children in this case series required nasogastric feeding support until the oropharyngeal lesions improved with a course of steroids and analgesia.

General Dosing Instructions

Instruct patients that if they miss a dose of ISENTRESS, they should take it as soon as they remember. If they do not remember until it is time for the next dose, instruct them to skip the missed dose and go back to the regular schedule. Instruct patients not to double their next dose or take more than the prescribed dose.

Film-Coated Tablets and Chewable Tablets

Inform patients that the chewable tablet forms can be chewed or swallowed whole, but the film-coated tablets must be swallowed whole.

For Oral Suspension

Instruct parents and/or caregivers to read the Instructions for Use before preparing and administering ISENTRESS for oral suspension to pediatric patients. Instruct parents and/or caregivers that ISENTRESS for oral suspension should be administered within 30 minutes of mixing.

Severe and Potentially Life-threatening Rash

Inform patients that severe and potentially life-threatening rash has been reported. Advise patients to immediately contact their healthcare provider if they develop rash. Instruct patients to immediately stop taking ISENTRESS and other suspect agents, and seek medical attention if they develop a rash associated with any of the following symptoms as it may be a sign of a more serious reaction such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis or severe hypersensitivity: fever, generally ill feeling, extreme tiredness, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, eye inflammation, facial swelling, swelling of the eyes, lips, mouth, breathing difficulty, and/or signs and symptoms of liver problems (e.g., yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes, dark or tea colored urine, pale colored stools/bowel movements, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, or pain, aching or sensitivity on the right side below the ribs). Inform patients that if severe rash occurs, their physician will closely monitor them, order laboratory tests and initiate appropriate therapy.

### Repeated episodes of fixed eruption 3 months after discontinuing pegylated interferon-α-2b plus ribavirin combination therapy in a patient with chronic hepatitis C virus infection [^8fb53020]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

We report a 73-year-old man who developed repeated episodes of erythematous, bullous plaques beginning 3 months after discontinuation of combination treatment with pegylated interferon (IFN)-alpha-2b and ribavirin for hepatitis C virus infection. The first episode resolved within a week without treatment, but the lesions recurred about once a month and were associated with high fever. Physical examination found darkly reddish, pigeon-egg-sized erythematous plaques with occasional flaccid blisters, predominantly on the trunk and proximal limbs, lip and penis. Histological examination showed well-demarcated foci of full-thickness epidermal necrosis and exocytosis of lymphoid cells. Pegylated IFN-alpha2b and ribavirin produced no response in lymphocyte stimulation tests. Systemic prednisolone led to rapid healing of skin lesions at the time of the fifth episode, leaving pigmented macules, but lesions recurred at the same sites within weeks of discontinuation of this treatment. It is uncertain whether this case represented a prolonged drug rash provoked by pegylated IFN-alpha2b or a fixed eruption in response to another antigen.

### Exuberant oral lesions in an immunocompromised patient [^5d01c5c7]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the etiological agent commonly associated with this disease?
A. Human papillomavirus 13 and 32
B. Human papillomavirus 2 and 4
C. Human papillomavirus 6, 11, 16, and 18
D. Herpes simplex virus 1
E. Epstein-Barr virus

Answers:
A. Human papillomavirus 13 and 32 — Incorrect. The HPVs 13 and 32 are low-risk oncogenic subtypes and related to Heck disease.
B. Human papillomavirus 2 and 4 — Incorrect. HPVs 2 and 4 are more associated to common warts present in the oral cavity.
C. Human papillomavirus 6, 11, 16, and 18 — Correct. HPV 6 and 11 are associated with a low oncogenic risk, while HPV 16 and 18 are related to a high oncogenic risk. These four HPV subtypes are commonly detected in oral condyloma accuminatum. The molecular analysis was positive for high-risk oncogenic deoxyribonucleic acid-human papillomavirus in the presented case.
D. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) — Incorrect. HSV-1 is an alphaherpesvirus, which causes an infection that is usually asymptomatic, affecting skin and mucosa. Gingivostomatitis is the most common manifestation of primary HSV (HSV-1) infection, mainly manifesting as multiple painful oral lesions, swollen gums, blisters, and sores. The lesions described are incompatible with those reported in this case, which were painless.
E. Epstein-Barr virus — Incorrect. Epstein-Barr virus is a herpesvirus, which is widespread throughout the world. A typical clinical manifestation is infectious mononucleosis, which is characterized by tonsillitis and/or pharyngitis, an increase of cervical lymph nodes sensitivity and size, and moderate-to-high fever. The clinical findings are not compatible with those observed in the present case.

### Interventions for prevention of herpes simplex labialis (cold sores on the lips) [^8b326c5c]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Herpes simplex labialis (HSL), also known as cold sores, is a common disease of the lips caused by the herpes simplex virus, which is found throughout the world. It presents as a painful vesicular eruption, forming unsightly crusts, which cause cosmetic disfigurement and psychosocial distress. There is no cure available, and it recurs periodically.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for the prevention of HSL in people of all ages.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases up to 19 May 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Oral Health Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL in the Cochrane Library (Issue 4, 2015), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), LILACS (from 1982), the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, Airiti Library, and 5 trial registers. To identify further references to relevant randomised controlled trials, we scanned the bibliographies of included studies and published reviews, and we also contacted the original researchers of our included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for preventing HSL in immunocompetent people.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. A third author was available for resolving differences of opinion.

Main Results

This review included 32 RCTs, with a total of 2640 immunocompetent participants, covering 19 treatments. The quality of the body of evidence was low to moderate for most outcomes, but was very low for a few outcomes. Our primary outcomes were 'Incidence of HSL' and 'Adverse effects during use of the preventative intervention'. The evidence for short-term (≤ 1 month) use of oral aciclovir in preventing recurrent HSL was inconsistent across the doses used in the studies: 2 RCTs showed low quality evidence for a reduced recurrence of HSL with aciclovir 400 mg twice daily (risk ratio (RR) 0.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.51; n = 177), while 1 RCT testing aciclovir 800 mg twice daily and 2 RCTs testing 200 mg 5 times daily found no similar preventive effects (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.87; n = 237; moderate quality evidence and RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.07; n = 66; low quality evidence, respectively). The direction of intervention effect was unrelated to the risk of bias. The evidence from 1 RCT for the effect of short-term use of valaciclovir in reducing recurrence of HSL by clinical evaluation was uncertain (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.28; n = 125; moderate quality evidence), as was the evidence from 1 RCT testing short-term use of famciclovir. Long-term (> 1 month) use of oral antiviral agents reduced the recurrence of HSL. There was low quality evidence from 1 RCT that long-term use of oral aciclovir reduced clinical recurrences (1.80 versus 0.85 episodes per participant per a 4-month period, P = 0.009) and virological recurrence (1.40 versus 0.40 episodes per participant per a 4-month period, P = 0.003). One RCT found long-term use of valaciclovir effective in reducing the incidence of HSL (with a decrease of 0.09 episodes per participant per month; n = 95). One RCT found that a long-term suppressive regimen of valaciclovir had a lower incidence of HSL than an episodic regimen of valciclovir (difference in means (MD) -0.10 episodes per participant per month, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.05; n = 120). These trials found no increase in adverse events associated with the use of oral antiviral agents (moderate quality evidence). There was no evidence to show that short-term use of topical antiviral agents prevented recurrent HSL. There was moderate quality evidence from 2 RCTs that topical aciclovir 5% cream probably has little effect on preventing recurrence of HSL (pooled RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.72; n = 271). There was moderate quality evidence from a single RCT that topical foscarnet 3% cream has little effect in preventing HSL (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.40; n = 295). The efficacy of long-term use of topical aciclovir cream was uncertain. One RCT found significantly fewer research-diagnosed recurrences of HSL when on aciclovir cream treatment than on placebo (P < 0.05), but found no significant differences in the mean number of participant-reported recurrences between the 2 groups (P ≥ 0.05). One RCT found no preventive effect of topical application of 1,5-pentanediol gel for 26 weeks (P > 0.05). Another RCT found that the group who used 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclo dextrin 20% gel for 6 months had significantly more recurrences than the placebo group (P = 0.003). These studies found no increase in adverse events related to the use of topical antiviral agents. Two RCTs found that the application of sunscreen significantly prevented recurrent HSL induced by experimental ultraviolet light (pooled RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.33; n = 111), but another RCT found that sunscreen did not prevent HSL induced by sunlight (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.25 to 5.06; n = 51). These RCTs did not report adverse events. There were very few data suggesting that thymopentin, low-level laser therapy, and hypnotherapy are effective in preventing recurrent HSL, with one to two RCTs for each intervention. We failed to find any evidence of efficacy for lysine, LongoVital® supplementation, gamma globulin, herpes simplex virus (HSV) type I subunit vaccine, and yellow fever vaccine in preventing HSL. There were no consistent data supporting the efficacy of levamisole and interferon, which were also associated with an increased risk of adverse effects such as fever.

Authors' Conclusions

The current evidence demonstrates that long-term use of oral antiviral agents can prevent HSL, but the clinical benefit is small. We did not find evidence of an increased risk of adverse events. On the other hand, the evidence on topical antiviral agents and other interventions either showed no efficacy or could not confirm their efficacy in preventing HSL.

### MTORC2 confers neuroprotection and potentiates immunity during virus infection [^f63b878e]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) is a double stranded DNA virus, which causes one of the most notorious viral infections known to humanity. Globally, an estimated 3.7 billion people under age 50 (67%) harbor HSV-1 virions for life and contribute to high transmission rate via symptomatic and/or asymptomatic shedding of the virus. More commonly, HSV-1 causes fever blisters and cold sores but it is also known to cause distressing ocular infections leading to blindness in untreated patients and, in severe cases, life threatening diseases such as viral encephalitis or meningitis which in turn, may result in permanent nervous system damage in surviving patients. After primary infection, HSV-1 remains latent in neuronal tissues including the trigeminal ganglia and reactivates under stress situations. In general, about 74 viral proteins usurp the host assembly to make the host microenvironment permissive to virus replication in neurons as well as the mucosal epithelium, which forms the common site for symptomatic infection and virus shedding. During the infection, several host proteins combat HSV-1 replication by inducing innate and adaptive immune responses. Host cells also activate stress responses, including programmed cell death, which limits spread of virus. Although apoptosis plays an important role in antiviral defense mechanisms, excessive cell death in neurons during neuronal HSV-1 infection may be detrimental to host survival. This phenomenon might be one of the reasons behind severities during viral encephalitis. Exploring the role of pro-survival host factors including key signaling mechanisms may shed light on new ways to combat severe HSV-1 infections.

### Erythema multiforme [^4dab6fcd]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Mucosal involvement

The typical primary lesion of the oral mucosa consists of vesicles, but they rupture easily, giving way to post-bullous erosions. The initial mucosal lesions are rarely visualized. The onset of the disease is often brisk, preceded by tingling sensations in the affected areas. Lesions preferentially occur on non-keratinized mucous membranes such as the lips, cheeks, ventral surfaces of the tongue and are often painful. The gum is typically spared, allowing the differential diagnosis of primary herpetic infection, which is accompanied by general signs and symptoms, fever, and painful cervical lymph nodes. Involvement of the vermilion of both lips is common, with the presence of hemorrhagic crusts. Skin rosettes are inconsistent. The intensity of oral involvement varies; it can be minimal with few lesions, or, conversely, extremely extensive, preventing any food intake with subsequent hospitalization. Mucosal lesions spontaneously resolve within two to three weeks without leaving a scar. Outbreaks of oral erythema multiforme can recur at an unpredictable rate. Some patients will have only one outbreak in their lifetime, while others will have one to two per year. Conversely, some patients will have frequent or even continuous outbreaks. The current body of research does not provide any evidence to explain why patients differ in the frequency of outbreaks from once in lifetime to annually or continuous EM flare-ups. In HSV-induced EM some patients will only have one episode while others will have recurrences every month. HSV lesions do not always precede EM. The diagnosis is confirmed when long term suppressive antiviral therapy reduces the EM flares. The prognosis of oral erythema multiforme is dominated by the frequency of these recurrences, making this condition sometimes disabling, warranting a preventive treatment.

Oral EM

Isolated oral EM is a subset of EM that presents with clinical features of multiple self-limited irregular oral ulcers. The disease can be recurrent. HSV is the most common triggering agent. The diagnosis is challenging and is based on the exclusion of other mucosal diseases such as auto-immune bullous diseases, erosive mucosal lichen planus, and SJS, rendering the biopsy a crucial step in management. The current epidemiologic data is not enough to support this phenotype but in our experience, cases of isolated oral EM lesions without any skin manifestations, in the absence of drug intake and after ruling out auto-immune bullous diseases and connective tissue diseases by serology and/or biopsy would be considered and treated as EM.

### Coxsackievirus A6-induced hand-foot-mouth disease [^8304953c]. JAMA Dermatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Importance

Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is an acute, self-limited, highly contagious viral illness that commonly affects children younger than 5 years. It is most typically caused by enterovirus 71 or coxsackievirus A16 and results in asymptomatic infection or mild disease. Immunocompetent adults are rarely affected. Recently, there have been increasing reports of a more severe form of HFMD associated with fevers, joint pains, and widespread painful eruptions. Some of these patients required hospitalization for supportive care. These severe cases were most commonly caused by coxsackievirus A6.

Observations

We describe a 37-year-old white man with widespread, crusted, pruritic papules on the scalp, ears, and face and a purpuric and targetoid painful vesicular eruption on his hands and feet, with associated fevers, neurologic symptoms, and arthritis, who required hospitalization for supportive care. His infection with coxsackievirus A6 was confirmed based on polymerase chain reaction from his oral mucosa and cutaneous vesicle fluid.

Conclusions and Relevance

Dermatologists should be familiar with the severe variant of HFMD caused by coxsackievirus A6, include it in their differential diagnosis of acute febrile blistering diseases, and be aware that certain patients may require hospitalization.

### Identification of a herpes simplex labialis susceptibility region on human chromosome 21 [^e5887f2f]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Most of the United States population is infected with either herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type 2, or both. Reactivations of HSV-1 infection cause herpes simplex labialis (HSL; cold sores or fever blisters), which is the most common recurring viral infection in humans.

Methods

To investigate the possibility of a human genetic component conferring resistance or susceptibility to cold sores (i.e., a HSL susceptibility gene), we conducted a genetic linkage analysis that included serotyping and phenotyping 421 individuals from 39 families enrolled in the Utah Genetic Reference Project.

Results

Linkage analysis identified a 2.5-Mb nonrecombinant region of interest on the long arm of human chromosome 21, with a multipoint logarithm of odds score of 3.9 noted near marker abmc65 (D21S409). Nonparametric linkage analysis of the data also provided strong evidence for linkage (P = 0.0005). This region of human chromosome 21 contains 6 candidate genes for herpes susceptibility.

Conclusions

The development of frequent cold sores is associated with a region on the long arm of human chromosome 21. This region contains several candidate genes that could influence the frequency of outbreaks of HSL.

### Rare case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome with bronchiolitis obliterans as a chronic complication [^424beb72]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

A young girl in her teens presented with fever, rashes and various mucocutaneous symptoms. Flat erythematous macules were seen mainly on the limbs, without blisters or skin detachments. The lips were swollen with crusts and haemorrhage. The oral cavity and pharynx showed ulcerative lesions with exudate. Severe bilateral ocular lesions with pseudomembrane formation and corneal epithelial defects were present. Also, urogenital lesion and gastrointestinal symptoms with frequent haematochezia were observed. Her symptoms and pathological findings were consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. She was treated with prednisolone and methylprednisolone pulse therapy. Her ocular and cutaneous symptoms improved without severe chronic complications. However, 1month later, she developed dyspnoea, and a pulmonary function test revealed severe obstructive ventilation disorder. After discharge, she was regularly followed up for respiratory complications. High-resolution chest CT performed 9 months after onset revealed mosaic perfusions and bronchiectasis, consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans.

### Recurrent erythema multiforme major in an 8-year-old patient with recurrence of herpetic gingivostomatitis and HLA-B✱5801 haplotype: a causal or casual relationship? [^ae6a8ad4]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Case report

An 8-year-old boy presented to the pediatric emergency room for the abrupt onset of erythematous patches with central vesicles localized to the upper and lower limbs, including the palmo-plantar regions. The lesions appeared a few days after the spontaneous resolution of a herpetic gingivostomatitis. The patient had no drug history and was otherwise healthy. His personal history included a previous EM minor episode after herpetic stomatitis, which occurred 1 year prior. He was discharged with the diagnosis of recurrent EM minor and treated with acyclovir therapy. Three days after discharge, the patient came back to the emergency room because of the onset of extensive de-epithelialization of the oral mucosa, tongue, and lips (Fig 1, A); ocular hyperemia associated with photophobia; genital erosions; and symmetrical blisters and ulcerations involving the upper and lower limbs (Fig 1 B and C) and the trunk. He had also fever, malaise, and myalgia. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 serology found a positivity of IgM and IgG; cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, and Rickettsia and Mycoplasma pneumoniae serology (both IgM and IgG) were negative.

Fig 1
An 8-year-old boy presents with abrupt onset of extensive sero-heamatic crusts covering his lips, associated with de-epithelialization of the oral mucosa and tongue (A). Blisters and ulcerations with perilesional erythema are evident on the upper limbs including palmar regions (B) and lower limbs (C).

Two skin biopsies performed on his left leg found epidermal spongiosis, keratinocytes apoptosis with blistering at the dermoepidermal junction, and poor dermal inflammatory infiltrate (Fig 2, A and B); direct immunofluorescence was negative. The clinical history, cutaneous lesions, serologic results and histopathologic findings suggested the diagnosis of HSV-related EM major.

### SHEA practice update: infection prevention and control (IPC) in residential facilities for pediatric patients and their families [^a40b9d2a]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The varicella-zoster virus is the cause of chickenpox and shingles. It is highly contagious.

Chickenpox

Chickenpox is characterized by fever and an itchy body rash of fluid-filled blisters on a red base ("dew drops on a rose petal"). The rash is typically scattered over the body, including the scalp, and eventually forms scabs. The severity of disease increases with age and is most severe in those with weakened immune systems. Chickenpox may also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or bacterial infection. Routine vaccination against varicella reduces the risk of acquiring chickenpox.

A person with chickenpox is highly contagious, starting from 2 days before the first appearance of the rash until all the blisters have completely dried and crusted. The virus is transmitted by respiratory secretions and direct contact with the blisters. At least one hospital outbreak involving a family-centered residential facility has been reported.

Shingles

After a person recovers from chickenpox, the varicella-zoster virus remains dormant in their body. Shingles (also called herpes zoster) is an illness that occurs when the latent varicella-zoster virus becomes active again. A person with shingles has clusters of small, painful blisters. Sometime people can have pain without blisters or before the blisters occur. Shingles can develop anytime but is most common among those over 60 years of age and when a person is immune compromised. Pain may persist after the shingles blisters have healed.

A person with shingles is contagious until all their blisters have completely dried and crusted. The virus spreads during shingles through direct contact with the skin or contaminated items. In immune compromised patients, the virus also may be present in respiratory droplets. Although person-to-person transmission has been described in the hospitaland adult long-term care facilitysettings, if an individual has a healthy immune system and can cover their localized rashes, transmission is unlikely to occur.

### The rash that presents as target lesions [^5a1cb21f]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We have explored the rash that appears as target lesions, with the central and dominant diseases belonging to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis group. After presenting the clinical patterns of an individual target lesion and classifying them into different types of lesions, the contribution has been organized with groups characterized by such specific findings according to the type of lesion: flat or raised, typical or atypical, presence or absence of fever, presence or absence of mucosal ulcerations, presence or absence of arthralgias, and/or internal organ involvement. Other specific features, such as histologic appearance, immunofluorescence findings, and laboratory changes, are considered. We provide clinicians with an algorithmic, systematic, and logical approach to diagnose the condition of the patients who present with targetoid lesions, and enable them to differentiate between those with serious systemic and life-threatening diseases from others with ordinary skin ailments.

### Reactive infectious mucocutaneous eruption following COVID-19 infection in vaccinated patients [^42a1690a]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Case 4

A 12-year-old male developed mucositis 8 days after positive test for SARS-CoV-2 by RAT. His initial symptoms included generalized headache, rhinorrhea, wet cough, fatigue, and fever (38.5 °C). These symptoms resolved 5 days posttest but he acutely developed painful oral mucosal eruption with oral swelling, blisters along the inside of lips, gingival lining, and tongue with fever. Ten days post infection, the patient reported dysuria and an enlarging lesion at the urethral meatus.

The patient's medical history included remote infantile eczema, recurrent croup, and ADHD managed with methylphenidate. He did not have any known allergies, pertinent medication or social history. His vaccinations were up to date including 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty COVID-19. Physical examination revealed hemorrhagic crusting of the lips with white sloughing of the tongue, buccal mucosa, and hard palate (Fig 4). There was a circumferential area of hemorrhagic crusting of the urethral meatus. Cervical lymphadenopathy was noted. Preliminary investigations revealed elevated CRP of 64.3 mg/L but were otherwise unremarkable. Additional infectious workup was negative including negative urinalysis, HSV1/HSV2 PCR, varicella PCR and Mycoplasma pneumoniae PCR, and no clinically relevant growth on mouth and fungal cultures.

### Ziprasidone (Geodon) [^d6c5a019]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

For a list of all side effects that have been reported, ask your doctor or pharmacist for the GEODON Professional Package Insert.

What To Do For An Overdose

In case of an overdose, call your doctor or poison control center right away or go to the nearest emergency room.

Other Important Safety Information

A serious condition called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) can occur with all antipsychotic medications including GEODON. Signs of NMS include very high fever, rigid muscles, shaking, confusion, sweating, or increased heart rate and blood pressure. NMS is a rare but serious side effect that could be fatal. Therefore, tell your doctor if you experience any of these signs.

Delayed-onset drug reaction called drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) can occur with ziprasidone. Signs of DRESS may include rash, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. Other severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCAR), such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome can occur with ziprasidone. Signs of Stevens-Johnson syndrome may include rash with blisters which could include ulcers in mouth, skin shedding, fever and target-like spots in the skin. DRESS and other SCAR are sometimes fatal; therefore, tell your doctor immediately if you experience any of these signs.

Adverse reactions related to high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), sometimes serious, have been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. There have been few reports of hyperglycemia or diabetes in patients treated with GEODON, and it is not known if GEODON is associated with these reactions. Patients treated with an atypical antipsychotic should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia.

### A painful rash on a white woman [^8ff9b340]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Based on the patient's history and photograph (Fig 1), what is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Morbilliform drug eruption
B. Irritant contact dermatitis
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy
D. Erysipelas
E. Herpes zoster

Answers:
A. Morbilliform drug eruption – Incorrect. Morbilliform drug eruption is typically bilateral and symmetric upon presentation. It is commonly caused by recently started antibiotics but may be caused by initiation of multiple classes of drugs. Onset is typically within 4 weeks of beginning a new medication, making this answer less likely, as this patient had been on the same chemotherapy regimen for greater than 6 months.
B. Irritant contact dermatitis – Incorrect. The clinical manifestations of irritant contact dermatitis range from mild skin dryness and erythema to acute or chronic eczematous dermatitis and even skin necrosis. This patient did not report exposure to chemical or physical irritants.
C. Cutaneous metastasis of internal malignancy – Correct. Cutaneous metastases can display a wide morphologic spectrum of appearance in various locations, which is why in a patient with history of recent malignancy, a new rash located on the trunk should raise suspicion for a cutaneous metastasis. See Fig 2 for biopsy results of this lesion. This variable clinical morphology includes nodules, papules, plaques, tumors, and ulcers. Lung cancer commonly metastasizes to the head, neck, and trunk. Cutaneous metastases occur in 0.7% to 0.9% of all patients with cancer.
D. Erysipelas – Incorrect. Erysipelas manifests as areas of skin erythema, edema, and warmth and develops as a result of bacterial entry via breaches in the skin barrier. This rash is sometimes accompanied by symptoms including a high fever of sudden onset with chills, and most cases affect the lower leg, ankle, or foot. This patient's rash slowly progressed over 4 weeks, unlike erysipelas, which develops more acutely and involves desquamation of the skin 5 to 10 days after onset.
E. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Although this patient fits the age group that is commonly affected with herpes zoster, this patient's rash does not fit clinically. The rash starts as erythematous papules, typically in a single dermatome or several contiguous dermatomes and evolves into grouped vesicles or bullae. This patient's rash does somewhat follow along contiguous dermatomes, but does not consist of papules or vesicles as you would expect with herpes zoster.

5.1	General

DENAVIR should only be used on herpes labialis on the lips and face. Because no data are available, application to human mucous membranes is not recommended. Particular care should be taken to avoid application in or near the eyes since it may cause irritation. Lesions that do not improve or that worsen on therapy should be evaluated for secondary bacterial infection. The effect of DENAVIR has not been established in immunocompromised patients.

### Triage of the pediatric patient in the emergency department: are we all in agreement? [^f8351cd5]. Pediatrics (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare triage categorization as a measure of perceived patient acuity on presentation to the emergency department by pediatric emergency medicine (PEM) attending physicians, nurses, and pediatric residents with their general emergency medicine (GEM) counterparts.

Methods

A questionnaire that contained 12 pediatric triage scenarios was sent to all PEM attending physicians, triage-trained nurses, and pediatric residents and their GEM counterparts at a large urban hospital with separate pediatric and general emergency departments. Participants were asked to use a 3-tier triage system (emergent, urgent, nonurgent) to assign a triage level for each patient scenario.

Results

The response rate was 99%. The kappa level of agreement was highest (.39) among the PEM physicians. Significantly more GEM attending physicians triaged the following scenarios at a higher acuity level as compared with PEM attending physicians with a trend toward emergent triage: simple febrile seizure, 50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 30%-70%) versus 7.7% (95% CI: 1%-34%); 18-month-old with fever and bumps on lips, 21% (95% CI: 9%-43%) versus 0% (95% CI: 0%-23%); and 15-month-old well-appearing child with high fever, 50% (95% CI: 30%-70%) versus 7.7% (95% CI: 1%-34%). Significant differences were found between GEM and PEM triage-trained nurses only in the 15-month-old high fever scenario and between GEM and pediatric residents in the 15-month-old high fever scenario, the 18-month-old with fever and bumps on lips scenario, and a fever/limp scenario.

Conclusions

The level of agreement of triage assignment within each group was only fair. GEM participants and PEM participants agreed on most scenarios. However, GEM participants were more likely to triage children with certain febrile illnesses at higher acuity levels as compared with their PEM counterparts.

### Valacyclovir hydrochloride (valacyclovir) [^3af04e8f]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Valacyclovir tablets are used in children:

to treat cold sores (for children ≥ 12 years of age)
to treat chickenpox (for children 2 to < 18 years of age)

Valacyclovir tablets do not cure herpes infections (cold sores, chickenpox, shingles, or genital herpes).

The efficacy of valacyclovir tablets has not been studied in children who have not reached puberty.

 What are cold sores, chickenpox, shingles, and genital herpes? Cold sores are caused by a herpes virus that may be spread by kissing or other physical contact with the infected area of the skin. They are small, painful ulcers that you get in or around your mouth. It is not known if valacyclovir tablets can stop the spread of cold sores to others.

 Chickenpox is caused by a herpes virus. It causes an itchy rash of multiple small, red bumps that look like pimples or insect bites usually appearing first on the abdomen or back and face. It can spread to almost everywhere else on the body and may be accompanied by flu-like symptoms.

 Shingles is caused by the same herpes virus that causes chickenpox. It causes small, painful blisters that happen on your skin. Shingles occurs in people who have already had chickenpox. Shingles can be spread to people who have not had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine by contact with the infected areas of the skin. It is not known if valacyclovir tablets can stop the spread of shingles to others.

5.1 General

XERESE is intended for cutaneous use only for herpes labialis of the lips and around the mouth. XERESE should not be used in the eye, inside the mouth or nose, or on the genitals.

There are other orofacial lesions, including bacterial and fungal infections, which may be difficult to distinguish from a cold sore. Patients should be encouraged to seek medical advice when a cold sore fails to heal within 2 weeks.

XERESE has a potential for irritation and contact sensitization [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### Widespread rash in a 45-year-old woman after moxifloxacin administration [^98cfb9e1]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 45-year-old African woman presented with fever, throat pain, and a rapidly deteriorating rash after taking moxifloxacin for 10 days. She exhibited extensive erythematous and purpuric macules, blisters, and significant mucosal involvement, covering 40% of her body surface area (Figs 1 and 2).

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)
B. Stevens-Johnson syndrome
C. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
D. Erythema multiforme major
E. Pemphigus vulgaris

Answers:
A. TEN or Lyell's syndrome – Correct. This diagnosis is supported by the extensive epidermal necrosis involving more than 30% of the body surface and the significant mucosal involvement observed in the patient. TEN is a serious and life-threatening dermatological condition characterized by diffuse erythematous and purpuric maculae aggregating into large areas of skin detachment. The presence of Nikolsky's sign, where slight mechanical pressure causes further skin detachment, is indicative of the severe epidermal damage observed in TEN. Given these clinical features and the patient's history of moxifloxacin use, TEN is the most appropriate diagnosis.
B. Stevens-Johnson syndrome – Incorrect. This involves less than 10 percent of the body surface.
C. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome – Incorrect. This typically spares mucosal surfaces and can be excluded based on the extensive involvement and mucosal lesions in this patient.
D. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme major usually presents with less extensive target lesions and skin detachments.
E. Pemphigus vulgaris – Incorrect. This shows intraepidermal acantholysis on histopathology rather than the full-thickness epidermal necrosis seen in TEN.

### Safety of hydroxychloroquine: what a dermatologist should know [^7ba4a1f7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous rash and pruritus are the most common skin reactions in up to 10% of patients receiving HCQ. The typical presentations are maculopapular, erythematous, or urticarial rashes, usually occurring within 4 weeks of treatment. Sometimes pruritus may be presenting as isolated, unresponsive to antihistamine therapy. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is an acute adverse skin reaction to drugs, characterized by the development of edema and erythema followed by the eruption of multiple punctiform, non-follicular, sterile pustules, predominantly in intertriginous areas, associated with fever and leukocytosis. AGEP has been rarely described in association with HCQ. It occurs rapidly and has prompt resolution within a few weeks. Sometimes AGEP and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) may occur simultaneously (overlapping), with a potentially severe mucosal involvement. SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are highly life-threatening adverse drug reactions characterized by the local detachment of the epidermis and mucous membranes, with possible involvement of internal organs. The main drugs implicated are allopurinol, carbamazepine, different antibiotics, and also HCQ. SJS and TEN typically occur when the average cumulative dose exceeds 100 mg. The condition starts with fever and flu-like symptoms lasting 1–3 days, followed by photophobia, conjunctival itching, dysphagia, and skin pain. It manifests with atypical targetoid skin lesions characterized by a central opaque or dark erythematous maculo-papular component, indicative of epidermal necrosis, which evolve into vesicles or blisters within 1–3 days, causing skin detachment. Involvement with intermediate extension is termed SJS/TEN overlap. In most cases, erosions of the mucous membranes (oropharynx, eyes, and genitals) usually appear a few days before the skin lesions. Supportive therapy is recommended for the treatment of SJS/TEN, which may include systemic corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, cyclosporine, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) antagonists. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe T cell-mediated delayed-type adverse reaction. It presents with fever, diffuse morbilliform rash, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, organ involvement, and hematological abnormalities (eosinophilia and lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes). Human herpesvirus 6 reactivation plays a role in the pathogenesis of DRESS. The mortality rate is up to 10%. It represents a rare HCQ adverse event, with a delayed onset.

### About… [^c70b249c]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Hand, foot, and mouth disease is common in children under 5 years old, but anyone can get it.
- The illness is usually not serious, but it is very contagious.
- To prevent spreading HFMD, wash your hands often, clean and disinfect surfaces, and avoid close contact with others. What it is HFMD is a common illness that usually causes fever, mouth sores, and skin rash. It can spread quickly at schools and day care centers. Most people get better on their own in 7 to 10 days. Signs and symptoms Most children have mild symptoms for 7 to 10 days. Symptoms may include:

- Fever
- Sore throat
- Painful mouth sores that blister
- Rash commonly found on the hands and feet Complications from HFMD are rare. Keep Reading: Detailed HFMD Symptoms and When to See a Doctor. How it spreads HFMD is caused by viruses. A person infected with one of these viruses is contagious. This means they can pass the virus easily to other people.

HFMD can spread through contact with:

- Droplets with virus particles made after person sneezes, coughs, or talks
- Objects and surfaces that have virus particles
- Fluid from blisters
- Poop Keep Reading: HFMD: Causes and How It Spreads. Prevention HFMD is very contagious. To help prevent catching or spreading HFMD: Wash your hands oftenwith soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after changing diapers, using the toilet, and coughing, sneezing, or blowing your nose. Help children wash their handsand keep blisters clean. Avoid touching your facewith unwashed hands, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth. Clean and disinfectfrequently touched surfaces and shared items, including toys and doorknobs. Avoid close contactwith an infected person, such as hugging or kissing them. Manage symptoms at home Relieve pain and fever. Take over-the-counter medications to relieve fever and pain caused by mouth sores. Never give aspirin to children.

Prevent dehydration. You can take steps to relieve symptoms and prevent dehydration while you or your child are sick. Drink enough liquids. Mouth sores can make it painful to swallow, so your child may not want to drink much. Make sure they drink enough to stay hydrated.

Cutaneous rash

Cutaneous rashes may appear as part of allergic and/or infusion-related reactions, or later during the treatment. The first type is an acute hypersensitivity reaction, that may occur within minutes to hours of the drug administration. The manifestation may include pruritus, flushing, urticaria, hypotension, anaphylaxis. Hereon, we are going to focus on cutaneous rashes as TRAEs. Moreover, it is important to clarify that often, in trials, the term rash is used as a "grouped term", namely including several subtypes, such as generalized rash, rash pustular, rash maculo-papular, etc.

T-DM1-related rash was reported in up to ⁓12% of patients, (Supplementary Table S6), while there are no reports of this AE in the trials investigating T-DXd, HER3-DXd, and Dato-DXd, although, for these last two compounds, we only have some preliminary data available. In the study investigating SYD985, rash maculopapular was reported in only 3% of patients in the dose-expansion cohort.

As previously mentioned, Trop2 is highly expressed in skin, and indeed the frequency of cutaneous rash with SG varied from 12% to 30% among trials, (Supplementary Table S8), and we are waiting for the reports on the cutaneous AEs for the other anti-Trop2 ADC, Dato-DXd.

To correctly assess cutaneous eruptions, and in order to understand the correlation to the treatment, it is always important to review the patient's concomitant medication list, including prescription and over-the-counter drugs. The rash needs to be analyzed in terms of body distribution (skin, mucous membranes), types of alterations (blister, purpura, skin necrosis, etc), and the co-occurrence of symptoms such as lymphadenopathy, fever, dyspnea, hypotension, among others.

### Fever and rash [^ee7d974c]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Infectious causes of fever and rash pose a diagnostic challenge for the emergency provider. It is often difficult to discern rashes associated with rapidly progressive and life-threatening infections from benign exanthems, which comprise the majority of rashes seen in the emergency department. Physicians must also consider serious noninfectious causes of fever and rash. A correct diagnosis depends on an exhaustive history and head-to-toe skin examination as most emergent causes of fever and rash remain clinical diagnoses. A provisional diagnosis and immediate treatment with antimicrobials and supportive care are usually required prior to the return of confirmatory laboratory testing.

### Disseminated tense bullae on newborn [^3a96ef23]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Impetigo bullosa
B. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
C. Diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM)
D. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome
E. Erythema multiforme

Answers:
A. Impetigo bullosa – Incorrect. Impetigo bullosa is a skin infection caused mainly by Staphylococcus aureus, with the rare appearance of intact vesicles or bullae. Typically, the lesions are copious, especially in the mouth and nose regions. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be obtained with Gram stain and culture.
B. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex – Incorrect. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is one of the main types of bullous epidermolysis, which is represented by fragility of the skin, and due to minor mechanical trauma, nonscarring blisters and erosions are formed. Its diagnosis is established through molecular genetic testing and skin biopsy.
C. DCM – Correct. DCM is characterized by generalized infiltration of mast cells in the skin, with frequent formation of bullae. Bullous lesions are frequently observed, with reports of bullous lesion involvement in 62% to 69% of the patients, and may even be the first presentation of DCM. Bullae appear mainly on the trunk, scalp, and extremities, developing into erosions and thickening of the skin. Clinically, patients have pruritus, generalized erythema, pachydermia, and a darker skin color compared with that of normal-appearing skin. In order to assist the diagnosis, histologic examinations are typically performed. Frequent follow up and proper treatment are essential for significant improvement in overall clinical outcomes and disease control. Treatments include the use of antihistamines, systemic and topical corticosteroids, and mast cell stabilizers.
D. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome – Incorrect. Staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome is a cutaneous infection that can cause bullae and erosions in newborns. The risk of skin infection is greater for premature and immunosuppressed newborns. Antibiotic therapy is administered in cases of suspected staphylococcal-scalded skin syndrome, in which thorough hygiene measures should be taken until the results of the tests are available. Its diagnosis is established by culture and sensitivity evaluation.
E. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. Erythema multiforme is a disease that manifests through blisters, macules, papules, and plaques on the body and that is caused by a reaction to infection or medication. In particular, there are often acral lesions, which can appear first on the limbs, head, and neck and subsequently spread elsewhere. Its diagnosis can be confirmed by clinical findings and histopathologic tests.

### The diagnosis and management of acute and chronic urticaria: 2014 update [^ba7d4458]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2014). Medium credibility.

Chronic urticaria (CU) initial evaluation and lesion characterization — The initial patient evaluation should be focused to determine (through history and physical examination) whether the lesions that patients describe are consistent with CU (D). Lesions are typically edematous pink or red wheals with surrounding erythema, are generally pruritic, and individual lesions usually fade within 24 to 48 hours; painful or burning dysesthesia suggests cutaneous vasculitis, and angioedema is nonpruritic, brawny, nonpitting edema without erythema affecting the lips, tongue, eyelids, and genitalia. The clinician should obtain objective assessments of body surface area covered in hives, itch severity, and quality of life at the initial and each subsequent visit, and photographic documentation might assist in determining consistency with urticaria or angioedema. The medical work-up should be done while keeping in mind that CU is of undetermined cause in the majority of cases (C).

### Sequelae of viral CNS infections including outcomes, mechanisms, and knowledge gaps [^ac645d79]. Npj Viruses (2025). Medium credibility.

Herpesviruses

Several members of the Herpesviridae family can cause severe neurological disease and long-term sequelae. This is a family of double-stranded DNA viruses, classified into three subfamilies: α, β, and γ viruses. With regard to human herpesviruses, the α-herpesvirus subfamily most commonly induces serious CNS disease in otherwise healthy individuals: this subfamily consists of HSV-1, HSV-2, and varicella zoster virus (VZV). The β-herpesvirus subfamily includes human cytomegalovirus and human herpesvirus (HHV) type 6, while the γ-herpesvirus subfamily comprises Epstein-Barr virus and HHV-8. For the sake of relevance and clarity, we will focus on α-herpesviruses in this review, as they are highly neurotropic, establish life-long latency in sensory ganglia, and can be periodically reactivated throughout life.

Herpes simplex virus type 1

HSV-1 is highly prevalent worldwide, infecting over 65% of people under the age of 50. It is mainly transmitted through oral secretions, and during primary infection, the virus replicates in mucosal epithelial cells before establishing latency in the sensory neurons of peripheral ganglia. These reservoirs of latent virus are crucial to the survival of the virus, as they can persist throughout an individual's lifetime and can be periodically reactivated.

Many infected individuals are asymptomatic, and the dominant symptom the virus is best recognized for is small blisters or 'cold sores' around the mouth. In addition to this typical manifestation, both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can cause devastating disease in neonates. Infection may occur intrapartum via exposure to the virus in the genital tract during delivery, or through intrauterine or postnatal routes. Neonatal infections can present as localized skin, eye, and mouth (SEM) disease, disseminated multi-organ disease, or localized CNS disease. The mortality rate is ~40% for disseminated disease, even with antiviral treatment, and nearly half of infants with CNS disease still exhibit neurological abnormalities at 24 months of age. While neonatal disease is rare, affecting less than 5 cases per 10,000 births in the US, this highlights the capacity of HSV to induce profound and lasting pathology.

### Levetiracetam (Keppra) [^afa3c276]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Anaphylaxis and Angioedema

KEPPRA can cause anaphylaxis or angioedema after the first dose or at any time during treatment. Signs and symptoms in cases reported in the postmarketing setting have included hypotension, hives, rash, respiratory distress, and swelling of the face, lip, mouth, eye, tongue, throat, and feet. In some reported cases, reactions were life-threatening and required emergency treatment. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of anaphylaxis or angioedema, KEPPRA should be discontinued and the patient should seek immediate medical attention. KEPPRA should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established [see Contraindications (4)].

5.4 Serious Dermatological Reactions

Serious dermatological reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), have been reported in both pediatric and adult patients treated with KEPPRA. The median time of onset is reported to be 14 to 17 days, but cases have been reported at least four months after initiation of treatment. Recurrence of the serious skin reactions following rechallenge with KEPPRA has also been reported. KEPPRA should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered.

5.5 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity

Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including KEPPRA. These events can be fatal or life-threatening, particularly if diagnosis and treatment do not occur as early as possible. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis, sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. KEPPRA should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established [see Contraindications (4)].

### Rifampin [^879a4ed1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including rifampin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When rifampin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by rifampin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

The patient should be told that rifampin may produce a discoloration (yellow, orange, red, brown) of the teeth, urine, sweat, sputum, and tears, and the patient should be forewarned of this. Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained.

Rifampin is a well characterized and potent inducer of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters and might therefore decrease or increase concomitant drug exposure and impact safety and efficacy (see DRUG INTERACTIONS). Therefore, patients should be advised not to take any other medication without medical advice.

The patient should be advised that the reliability of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives may be affected; consideration should be given to using alternative contraceptive measures.

Patients should be instructed to take rifampin either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.

Patients should be instructed to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following: rash with fever or blisters, with or without peeling skin, itching, or swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, darkened urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, light-colored bowel movements, fever, headache, fatigue, myalgias, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing and pain or swelling of the joints.

Patients should be advised to seek medical advice immediately if their symptoms of mycobacterial disease, including, but not limited to, cough, fever, tiredness, shortness of breath, malaise, headache, pain, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, skin ulcers or lesions, worsen (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Advise patients to abstain from alcohol, hepatotoxic medications or herbal products while taking rifampin.

Compliance with the full course of therapy must be emphasized, and the importance of not missing any doses must be stressed.

Information for Patients

Patients should be informed of the following information before initiating therapy with an NSAID and periodically during the course of ongoing therapy. Patients should also be encouraged to read the NSAID Medication Guide that accompanies each prescription dispensed.

Ibuprofen tablets like other NSAIDs, may cause serious CV side effects, such as MI or stroke, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious CV events can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness, slurring of speech, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Cardiovascular Effects).
Ibuprofen tablets, like other NSAIDs, can cause GI discomfort and, rarely, serious GI side effects, such as ulcers and bleeding, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious GI tract ulcerations and bleeding can occur without warning symptoms, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of ulcerations and bleeding, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative signs or symptoms including epigastric pain, dyspepsia, melena, and hematemesis. Patients should be apprised of the importance of this follow-up (see WARNINGS, Gastrointestinal Effects- Risk of Ulceration, Bleeding and Perforation).
Ibuprofen tablets, like other NSAIDs, can cause serious skin side effects such as exfoliative dermatitis, SJS and TEN, which may result in hospitalization and even death. Although serious skin reactions may occur without warning, patients should be alert for the signs and symptoms of skin rash and blisters, fever, or other signs hypersensitivity such as itching, and should ask for medical advice when observing any indicative sign or symptoms. Patients should be advised to stop the drug immediately if they develop any type of rash and contact their physicians as soon as possible.
Patients should promptly report signs or symptoms of unexplained weight gain or edema to their physicians.
Patients should be informed of the warning signs and symptoms of hepatotoxicity (e.g., nausea, fatigue, lethargy, pruritus, jaundice, right upper quadrant tenderness and "flu-like" symptoms). If these occur, patients should be instructed to stop therapy and seek immediate medical therapy.
Patients should be informed of the signs of an anaphylactoid reaction (e.g. difficulty breathing, swelling of the face or throat). If these occur, patients should be instructed to seek immediate emergency help (see WARNINGS).
In late pregnancy, as with other NSAIDs, ibuprofen tablets should be avoided because it may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.

### Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-induced granulomatous dermatitis with enlarged histiocytes clinically manifesting as painful edematous nodules with high fever similar to Sweet's syndrome [^917958eb]. The Journal of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

A 72-year-old woman with a history of diffuse large B cell lymphoma and recent recurrence visited our department complaining of several painful edematous nodules with blisters on her face. She had iteratively developed cutaneous eruptions after every treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for neutropenia, and each time the eruption improved after the cessation of the G-CSF treatment. The blisters became crusty and the skin lesions slightly improved, but on the 24th hospital day, the eruption formed painful erythematous nodules with erosion, and the patient also developed a high fever of up to 38°C. A biopsy specimen showed a dermal infiltrate of increased and enlarged plump histiocytes, some of which indicated karyomitosis with a small number of lymphocytes. No increase in the number of eosinophils or neutrophils was noted. These eruptions lasted for 15 days and disappeared with the recovery of the peripheral blood count and attendant cessation of G-CSF. We diagnosed this case as G-CSF-induced granulomatous dermatitis with enlarged histiocytes. Several cases with maculopapular rash and dermal inflammatory infiltrate composed of interstitially arranged large histiocytes have been reported. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of G-CSF-induced granulomatous dermatitis with enlarged histiocytes clinically manifesting as painful edematous nodules with a high fever, similar to Sweet's syndrome. We speculated that the infiltrating cells were not neutrophils but histiocytes, presumably because of agranulocytosis.

A previously well 11-month-old infant presented with lethargy, a blanching rash, vomiting and diarrhoea. She was diagnosed with suspected gastroenteritis and discharged. The patient deteriorated and re-presented 24 h later with lumbar puncture (LP) confirming Neisseria meningitidis. Following an initial good response to ceftriaxone, the patient then developed a blistering facial rash on day 3 for which topical aciclovir was started with no improvement. She subsequently developed fever and redeveloped a rising C reactive protein (CRP). A CT of the head on day 6 was normal, however a repeat LP on day 7 showed persistently raised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), white cell count (WCC), high proteins and low CSF glucose. A CSF viral PCR confirmed concurrent herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 for which parenteral aciclovir was started. The patient responded well to bacterial and viral anti-infective treatments and was subsequently discharged on day 16 with no neurological sequelae.

Introduction: Both skin and mucosal inflammation can be associated with conditions such as autoimmune diseases (SLE, Behçet's disease), erythema multiforme (EM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), each linked to different triggers. Recently, the recognition of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections as a distinct cause has led to the identification of a unique clinical entity known as Mycoplasma-induced rash and mucositis (MIRM)/Reactive Infectious Mucocutaneous Eruption (RIME).

Objectives: We present a case of recurrent RIME, highlighting the challenges in its diagnosis and treatment options.

Methods: 13-year-old female adolescent with multiple episodes of recurrent oral and genital ulcers over the past eighteen months, the first one requiring hospitalization due to extensive oral and genital mucositis, leading to reduced oral intake. A diagnosis of MIRM was assumed (positive Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG/IgM serology) and she was treated with IV methylprednisolone and azithromycin, with complete recovery after 3 weeks. During the next 6 months she had three mild new episodes of oral aphthosis, 3–5 days duration, with fast improvement with steroids. On the current episode she reported rhinorrhea and a productive cough over the past 7 days; four days after, aphtous lesions in the mouth, lips and peribuccal/labial edema were noted. She was seen by her pediatrician and prescribed oral steroids, without any improvement. Additionally, this time she developed bullous and edematous genital lesions, and she was hospitalized due to progression of the oral and genital lesions with increasing pain and refusal to eat. She reported no fever, eye redness, asthenia, fatigue, exanthema, arthralgia, myalgia, vaginal discharges, dysuria, headache, or other neurological symptoms. Laboratory results showed hemoglobin 15.4g/dl, leukocytes 21,700/ul, neutrophils 61%, ESR 9mm/h, CRP 1.34mg/dl. She was admitted and intravenous methylprednisolone 1mg/kg was started. She had no fever and was hemodynamically stable, yet there was a progressive and gradual worsening of oral and genital mucosal lesions, accompanied by bilateral non-exudative conjunctival hyperemia and nasal skin lesions. Observed by Ophthalmology, which ruled out episcleritis, scleritis or uveitis. A multidisciplinary approach (Dermatology, Gynecology) led to the application of local treatments and further investigation showed normal protein electrophoresis, immunoglobulins A, G, M, and E, C3, C4, CH50, as also negative anti-dsDNA antibody, ANA, anti-Sm and anti-RNP. Bacteriological and mycological exams of oral and genital lesions, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae and herpes virus 6/7 oral and genital polymerase chain reaction were negative. Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgG/IgM serologies were positive. Skin biopsy, HLA-B51, anti-BP180, anti-BP230, anti-desmoglein IgG/IgM are pending. A diagnosis of recurrent RIME was assumed and given the lack of improvement after 4 days of intravenous corticosteroids, it was decided to administer IVIG 2g/kg as an addition to the treatment.

### ABM clinical protocol # 26: persistent pain with breastfeeding [^ccaa98c6]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Viral infection — herpes simplex virus (HSV) and herpes zoster involving the breast carry transmission risk and restrict breastfeeding. HSV infection of the breast or nipple skin can result in neonatal transmission during breastfeeding, and culturing blisters is optimal; mothers should not breastfeed on the affected side and expressed milk should be discarded until lesions have healed. For herpes zoster, exposure can cause chicken pox in unimmunized infants; in most situations, it should be treated similarly to HSV and women should not breastfeed or use expressed breast milk from an affected breast until the lesions have healed, and infants may be given Zoster immunoglobulin if appropriate.

### Lip ulceration in an immunocompromised patient [^cab7e5c0]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old woman presented with an enlarging, painful ulceration on the lip that developed over the previous 2 weeks. She had a history of myelodysplastic syndrome treated with azacitidine. History was remarkable for peripheral blood stem cell transplantation for myelodysplastic syndrome 1 year earlier. Physical examination found an ulceration of the right lower mucosal and vermilion lip extending onto the cutaneous lip, with overlying hemorrhagic crusts (Fig 1, A). She also had erosive papules on the hard palate. The remainder of her examination was unremarkable. Tzanck smear found multinucleated giant cells (Fig 2). The lesion continued to expand despite valacyclovir treatment for 7 days.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Labial necrotizing fasciitis
B. Herpes zoster
C. Paraneoplastic pemphigus
D. Treatment-resistant herpes labialis
E. Mucocutaneous histoplasmosis
Answers:
A. Labial necrotizing fasciitis – Incorrect. Labial necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive bacterial infection that results in fascial and subcutaneous necrosis of polymicrobial origin, with group A Streptococcus as a common cause. It is usually preceded by an invasive procedure, penetrating injury, or burns.
B. Herpes zoster – Incorrect. Herpes zoster is caused by reactivation of varicella zoster virus and is common in individuals older than 60 years and immunosuppressed. The prodromal period of dysesthesia is followed by development of grouped vesicles on an erythematous base, classically in a dermatomal distribution.
C. Paraneoplastic pemphigus – Incorrect. Paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP) is a mucocutaneous blistering disorder seen in association with lymphoproliferative disorders, presenting with severe stomatitis and polymorphous skin lesions.
D. Treatment-resistant herpes labialis – Correct. Treatment-resistant herpes labialis was the most likely diagnosis given the patient's oral mucocutaneous presentation, positive Tzanck smear, immunocompromised state, and lack of clinical response to valacyclovir. The ulceration's extension onto the cutaneous lip with scalloped edges and hard palate involvement is typical for herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. Approximately 4% to 7% of HSV isolates from immunosuppressed patients show acyclovir resistance compared with 0.3% in immunocompetent patients. These lesions are larger, have deeper ulcerations, or have a verrucous appearance.
E. Mucocutaneous histoplasmosis – Incorrect. Mucocutaneous histoplasmosis usually occurs in the setting of disseminated histoplasmosis in immunocompromised individuals. Skin findings are nonspecific and may include mucocutaneous erosions, ulcers, or vegetative plaques. Other organs often involved include the lungs, bone marrow, liver, or spleen.

Patients and methods

Samples from three independent SJS/TEN patient cohorts were brought together for the purpose of this study.

Nevirapine patient cohort

Patients were prospectively recruited, as previously described, after informed consent was obtained. 10 The study was approved by the research ethics committees of the College of Medicine, Malawi, and Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, Liverpool, U.K. Briefly, the study recruited 1117 antiretroviral‐naive HIV‐positive patients from the Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, between March 2007 and December 2008. All were self‐reported black African, over the age of 16, years and had no baseline jaundice. All patients were diagnosed as having clinical stage 3/4 HIV or had a CD4 + count < 250 cells μL⁻¹ and were treated with fixed‐dose nevirapine (NVP), lamivudine and stavudine with follow‐up over 26 weeks. CD4 + counts and liver function tests (LFTs) were monitored at 0, 6, 14 and 18 weeks. A total of 51 patients presented with NVP‐induced cutaneous hypersensitivity fulfilling the criteria of one or more of the following phenotypes: (i) MPE with no systemic manifestations and improvement only on stopping treatment; (ii) DRESS – widespread rash with systemic manifestations (i.e. fever, cough or abnormal LFTs); (iii) SJS – extensive rash affecting two or more mucous membranes or blistering eruptions affecting < 10% of body surface area (BSA); (iv) TEN – blistering rash affecting > 30% of BSA and two or more mucous membranes. Patients with 10–30% affected BSA had the overlap syndrome.

Each of the 51 patients with hypersensitivity were age‐ and sex‐matched to two NVP‐tolerant HIV‐positive controls (n = 102). Blood samples were taken from patients prior to commencement of NVP treatment (0 weeks) and then at 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 and 20 weeks. In patients in whom a hypersensitivity reaction occurred, a sample was taken at the time of the first presentation (acute reaction) and no further sample taken thereafter as the patient was discontinued from the study. For comparison to adverse reaction samples, tolerant control samples at the 2‐week time point were used. Serum was isolated and frozen at –80 °C. The purpose of analysing this cohort was to determine variability in serum HMGB1 levels between different types of cutaneous adverse drug reactions during the acute phase vs. tolerant controls.

### Kaposi varicelliform eruption in a patient with epidermolysis bullosa simplex generalized severe [^4b6ed43d]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

This case report is an original presentation of Kaposi varicelliform infection in a patient with generalized EB. HSV is highly prevalent and endemic throughout the world. Kaposi varicelliform eruptions are potentially life-threatening infections caused by HSV infection over a preexisting dermatosis. These eruptions often manifest as febrile eruptions of dome-chapped blisters and hemorrhagic crusting but may also present as erosions without vesicles or pustules and worsening of a preexisting dermatosis. The upper body is the most common site of infection, with a predilection for the head and neck. In some cases, the infection may progress to a fulminating, life-threatening stage and can have severe sequelae, including herpes keratitis, disseminated infection with visceral involvement, and death. The most common form is eczema herpeticum on atopic dermatitis. Although eczema herpeticum is rare, a subset of patients with atopic dermatitis seems to have a predisposition for HSV infection because of defects in specific proteins critical for skin barrier functionand innate immunity. Other cases have been described in conjunction with Grover's disease, bullous pemphigoid, Darier disease, Hailey-Hailey disease, burns, and Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.

To our knowledge, only 1 other article reported a case of herpetic infection in a child affected with EB. The patient presented a gingival-stomatitis in a dystrophic EB.

In a multicenter observational study of hospitalized children with eczema herpeticum, the delayed initiation of acyclovir therapy was associated with increased length of stay. This study's findings emphasize the importance of early acyclovir therapy for children with eczema herpeticum. Our patient was hospitalized for 12 days, and acyclovir therapy was initiated after 5 days of hospitalization. The case highlights the importance of the diagnosis of herpetic infection of EB lesions in the case of an unclear source of fever because the best prognosis is correlated with early diagnosis and prompt treatment. However, a prompt diagnosis of an infectious blistering disease on top of a mechanical blistering disease can be tricky to discern.

### Diagnosis and management of monkeypox: a review for the emergency clinician [^c7dbd4c6]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

The outbreak of monkeypox in May and June 2022 is the largest outside of central and western Africa since the 2003 outbreak in the United States. Monkeypox, like smallpox, is caused by an orthopoxvirus, though its clinical manifestations tend to be less severe. It is characterized by a prodromal flu-like illness with lymphadenopathy followed by a centrifugally spreading rash, sometimes involving the face, palms, soles, and oral mucosa. Although the vast majority of cases resolve with symptomatic management, a small number of patients can suffer severe outcomes including, but not limited to, secondary bacterial skin infections, pneumonitis, ocular sequelae, encephalitis, hypovolemia, and death. Local, state, and federal health authorities should be involved in the care of people under investigation for this illness. With confirmed cases worldwide and the possibility of community spread, emergency clinicians need to be aware of the manifestations and management of this disease, both to treat those with the disease as well as to provide education to those exposed and at risk of infection.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a member of the herpesviridae family. Recognised since ancient Greek times, the virus frequently infects human beings, causing a range of diseases from mild uncomplicated mucocutaneous infection to those that are life threatening. In the past 50 years, substantial advances in our knowledge of the molecular biology of HSV have led to insights into disease pathogenesis and management. This review provides a contemporary interpretation of the biological properties, function, epidemiology, and treatment of HSV diseases.

### Oral lesions in autoimmune bullous diseases: an overview of clinical characteristics and diagnostic algorithm [^526a7f14]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Main Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of erosive oral lesions include infectious agents, due to viruses and bacteria, drug-induced reactions, inflammatory conditions, and systemic diseases (Table 1). These conditions have some specific morphological features and overlapping clinical features, therefore histology is required for the diagnosis.

Table 1
Differential diagnosis of oral blisters, ulcers, gingivitis, and stomatitis

SJS/TEN Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis

Oral lesions caused by infectious agents are usually transient. Primary infection with herpes simplex is the most common viral cause of erosions and blisters in the oral mucosa. Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis are severe, mostly drug-induced reactions with an abrupt onset of erosive stomatitis and hemorrhagic cheilitis followed by widespread skin lesions (Fig. 1 j–l). The gingiva is rarely affected in Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Other mucosal involvement is frequently seen, such as ocular and genital involvement.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis is the most frequent inflammatory condition of the oral mucosa with recurrent self-limiting ulcers affecting non keratinized mucosa. Multiple factors are involved in the etiology of recurrent aphthous stomatitis. Behçet syndrome is a chronic multi-system condition characterized by diffuse aphthous erosions and ulcers on the labial, buccal, and lateral tongue mucosa. Ocular and genital involvement is also frequently seen.

Lupus erythematosus is a systemic autoimmune disorder with a wide variety of clinical features. Oral lesions in lupus erythematosus are usually multiple, located on the buccal mucosa, hard palate, lips, and gingiva. The distribution is asymmetrical with different morphological features ranging from plaques, erythema, and ulcerations.

Oral lichen planus is a chronic immune mediated disease with highly variable clinical features ranging from subtle white reticular patterns to erosions and ulcerations (Fig. 1 m–o). Lesions are usually symmetrically distributed in the oral cavity. Affected sites of the oral cavity include the buccal mucosa, tongue, and gingiva. Histopathologic biopsies of oral lichen planus often show sub-epithelial blistering without preservation of the basal cells, in contrast to pemphigoid.

Clinical features of zoster — Acute zoster often begins with a prodrome in which headache, photophobia, and malaise might occur with fever being less common, and abnormal skin sensations and pain can precede the rash by days to weeks. The rash is typically unilateral, does not cross the mid-line, and erupts in one or two adjacent dermatomes, initially erythematous and maculopapular then progressing to coalescing clusters of clear vesicles that evolve through pustular, ulcer, and crust stages. The rash usually lasts 7–10 days, with complete healing within 2–4 weeks, though small numbers of lesions can occur outside the primary or adjacent dermatome, and streptococcal or staphylococcal superinfections might complicate the rash.

### 2024 American Heart Association and American red cross guidelines for first aid [^5a3cc280]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Burns: Cooling thermal burns — Background and referral context: Thermal burns are caused by contact with flames, hot liquids, hot surfaces, and hot gases. Burns can lead to damaging physical, functional, cosmetic, and psychosocial consequences. Superficial (first-degree) burns are characterized by skin redness and pain without blistering or other loosening or destruction of the skin surface, and the intact skin maintains its barrier function. First-degree burns generally heal without scarring, and the risk of infection is low. Partial-thickness (second-degree) burns involve destruction of the epidermis and injury to deeper layers and often require treatment beyond what can be provided in the first aid setting to speed healing, prevent infection, and reduce scarring. Large partial-thickness burns (partial-thickness burns that involve the face, hands, feet, or genitalia), all full-thickness burns, and concern for inhalation injury (sore throat around the nose or mouth, difficulty breathing) require hospital treatment. Although burn-cooling sprays have also been studied, the majority of studies involve immediate application of cool running water.

### Acyclovir (Zovirax) [^e876f390]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Only for topical use of recurrent HSV lesions on the external aspect of lips and the face. ZOVIRAX Cream should not be applied on mucous membranes including in the eye or inside the mouth or nose. (5.1)
There is a potential for irritation and contact sensitization. (5.2)

5.1 General

ZOVIRAX Cream should only be applied on the affected external aspects of the lips and face in patients with herpes labialis. Because no data are available, application to human mucous membranes is not recommended. ZOVIRAX Cream is intended for cutaneous use only and should not be used in the eye or inside the mouth or nose.

5.2 Contact Sensitization

ZOVIRAX Cream has a potential for irritation and contact sensitization [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

The effect of ZOVIRAX Cream has not been established in immunocompromised patients.

### Single-dose, patient-initiated famciclovir: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial for episodic treatment of herpes labialis [^cc262abb]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The brief period of viral replication in recurrent herpes labialis lesions suggests shorter therapeutic regimens are a logical episodic treatment strategy.

Objective

We sought to assess the efficacy and safety of single-dose and single-day famciclovir treatments.

Methods

In all, 701 randomly assigned patients self-initiated therapy with famciclovir (1500 mg once [single dose] or 750 mg twice a day for 1 day [single day]) or placebo within 1 hour of onset of the prodromal symptoms of an episode of herpes labialis. Lesion healing was monitored by diaries and frequent clinic visits.

Results

Median healing times of primary (first to appear) vesicular lesions in the famciclovir single-dose, famciclovir single-day, and placebo groups were 4.4, 4.0, and 6.2 days, respectively. There was no significant difference between the famciclovir regimens. Adverse events in the famciclovir groups were similar to placebo.

Limitations

The active arms of this trial were not directly compared to other antiviral regimens.

Conclusion

Single-dose famciclovir reduced time to healing of herpes labialis lesions by approximately 2 days compared with placebo.

### Human herpes simplex virus infections: epidemiology, pathogenesis, symptomatology, diagnosis, and management [^3941f843]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Eight of the more than 80 known herpesviruses are human pathogens. Human herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a contagious infection with a large reservoir in the general population. It has a potential for significant complications in the immunocompromised host. In addition, psychological distress caused by the negative stigma associated with genital herpes and visible facial lesions in those experiencing frequent outbreaks renders it a challenging clinical dilemma. This article reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnostic features of HSV infections, providing the clinician with an up-to-date understanding of the available management strategies for mucocutaneous HSV-induced disease.

### Is herpes simplex a systemic disease? [^d4c5228f]. Clinics in Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Orofacial herpes simplex virus infections are usually caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), and HSV-2 infections have been accepted as a sexually transmitted disease. HSV establishes a latent infection in the dorsal root ganglia of the host and remains there for the rest of life. HSV affects mainly skin and genitalia, although in immunocompromised patients it may cause local infection with vast skin involvement, chronic herpetic ulcers, or widespread mucous membrane damage, as well as systemic infections localized in the central and peripheral nervous systems, gastrointestinal tract, and ocular system. Usually, HSV infections are in the domain of dermatology, but the accumulating facts for localization of the disease in many systems of the human body give us the possibility to pose the question: Is herpes simplex a systemic disease?

### Lip ulceration in an immunocompromised patient [^88240e1f]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 2: What is the most appropriate test to determine further management?
A. Serology for HSV-1 IgM
B. Viral culture and sensitivity testing
C. Fungal culture
D. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures
E. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) microscopy
Answers:
A. Serology for HSV-1 IgM – Incorrect. Serologic antibody titers to HSV-1 IgM may indicate a recent infection but are not as clinically useful as HSV-1 polymerase chain reaction or culture in establishing an active infection or treatment resistance.
B. Viral culture and sensitivity testing – Correct. The patient had multiple positive HSV-1 polymerase chain reaction results, which established the diagnosis of herpes labialis but failed to respond to therapeutic doses of valacyclovir for 1 week. To assess for antiviral resistance, HSV isolates must be obtained by tissue viral culture. Viral culture and sensitivity testing were done, which found acyclovir resistance and prompted reconsideration of treatment.
C. Fungal culture – Incorrect. Fungal cultures may be used to diagnose other infectious causes of oral mucosal lesions and should be considered in immunosuppressed patients before administration of antimicrobial agents. Our patient had a positive Tzanck smear and lesions clinically suggestive of herpes labialis; therefore, fungal cultures would not help guide further management.
D. Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures – Incorrect. Given the patient's positive Tzanck smear and lesions clinically suggestive of herpes labialis, bacterial cultures would not help guide further management.
E. DIF microscopy – Incorrect. DIF microscopy is useful in the evaluation of mucocutaneous immunobullous disorders, such as pemphigus vulgaris, bullous pemphigoid, cicatricial pemphigoid, and PNP. These conditions present with desquamative gingivitis, painful ulcerations of the gingiva, buccal and lingual mucosa, or severe stomatitis in the case of PNP.

### Conjunctivitis, mucosal erosions, and moist cutaneous plaques [^d1386f54]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 25-year-old man with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presented to the emergency department with a fever and 2-month history of recurrent painful mouth sores. A review of systems obtained from his mother was notable for weight loss, eye irritation, and an uncharacteristically wide-based gait. The physical examination found conjunctival injection, erosions on the labial and buccal mucosa, and moist malodorous exophytic periumbilical (Fig 1, A) and inguinal (Fig 2) plaques. Comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood count were unremarkable; HIV screen was negative. The results of histopathologic examination of the periumbilical plaque are shown in Fig 1, B and C.

Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Secondary syphilis
B. Pyoderma gangrenosum
C. Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans
D. Pemphigus vegetans
E. Herpes simplex virus infection
Answers:
A. Secondary syphilis – Incorrect. Secondary syphilis is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. It typically presents 1 to 3 months after the appearance of the primary chancre and is characterized by a generalized papulosquamous rash. Condyloma lata, moist exophytic plaques containing spirochetes, may develop in the oral and anogenital regions.
B. Pyoderma gangrenosum – Incorrect. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic dermatosis associated with a variety of systemic disorders including inflammatory bowel disease, arthritis, and blood dyscrasias. The classic lesion starts as a painful papule, pustule, or nodule that ulcerates with a violaceous undermined border. A rare superficial vegetative form of pyoderma gangrenosum has been described.
C. Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans – Incorrect. Pyodermatitis-pyostomatitis vegetans, associated with inflammatory bowel disease, is characterized by sterile pustules on edematous mucosa that rupture to form "snail track" erosions. Pustules and brown annular vegetating plaques may develop on the skin, particularly overlying intertriginous areas.
D. Pemphigus vegetans – Correct. Pemphigus vegetans is the rarest variant of pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune bullous disease of the mucous membranes and skin characterized by IgG autoantibodies against the keratinocyte adhesion protein desmoglein (DSG) 3. It is clinically divided into the Neumann type, with extensive often intertriginous vegetations overlying blisters and erosions as observed in this case, and the relatively benign Hallopeau type, with grouped or annular pustules progressing to verrucous cobblestoned plaques.
E. Herpes simplex virus infection – Incorrect. Herpes simplex virus infection may be primary or recurrent. The classic presentation is umbilicated vesicles in the orolabial or anogenital regions that rupture to form painful ulcerations. The exophytic lesions of herpes simplex vegetans, a variant associated with immunodeficient states, can mimic verrucous carcinoma.

### Pustules on the back possibly triggering toxic-shock syndrome [^5f151dc0]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

We herein describe an irregular case of toxic-shock syndrome (TSS). A previously healthy 28-year-old Japanese man developed a sudden-onset high fever. The patient was suffering from conjunctival hyperaemia, gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea, and systemically diffused macular erythroderma. Further physical examination detected pustules on his back, which self-destructed over time. Laboratory revealed multiple organ failures. Subsequently, scalded skin on the face and desquamation in the limb extremities emerged by day 10, leading to the diagnosis of TSS, despite his stable circulatory dynamics through the course. Learning points for clinicians include that they should recall TSS as a possible disease concurrently causing high fever, systemic rash and multiple organ dysfunctions, even without being in a state of shock. The characteristic desquamations emerged in the limb extremities after hospitalisation were of help in diagnosing TSS.

### Nevirapine [^bee5bcb2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Skin Reactions

Severe and life-threatening skin reactions, including fatal cases, have been reported, occurring most frequently during the first 6 weeks of therapy. These have included cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash, constitutional findings, and organ dysfunction including hepatic failure. Rhabdomyolysis has been observed in some patients experiencing skin and/or liver reactions associated with nevirapine use. In controlled clinical trials, Grade 3 and 4 rashes were reported during the first 6 weeks in 2% of nevirapine recipients compared to less than 1% of placebo subjects.

Patients developing signs or symptoms of severe skin reactions or hypersensitivity reactions (including, but not limited to, severe rash or rash accompanied by fever, general malaise, fatigue, muscle or joint aches, blisters, oral lesions, conjunctivitis, facial edema, and/or hepatitis, eosinophilia, granulocytopenia, lymphadenopathy, and renal dysfunction) must permanently discontinue nevirapine and seek medical evaluation immediately. Do not restart nevirapine following severe skin rash, skin rash combined with increased transaminases or other symptoms, or hypersensitivity reaction.

The first 18 weeks of therapy with nevirapine are a critical period during which intensive clinical and laboratory monitoring of patients is required to detect potentially life-threatening skin reactions. The optimal frequency of monitoring during this time period has not been established. Some experts recommend clinical and laboratory monitoring more often than once per month, and in particular, include monitoring of liver enzyme tests at baseline, prior to dose escalation and at two weeks post-dose escalation. After the initial 18-week period, frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring should continue throughout nevirapine treatment. In addition, the 14-day lead-in period with nevirapine 200 mg daily dosing has been demonstrated to reduce the frequency of rash [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

### Recurrent orolabial ulceration in a 19-year-old man [^7ec7f800]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

A 19-year-old otherwise healthy man presented with a three-day history of painful progressive ulceration of the orolabial mucosa. These were preceded by one week of intermittent cough, malaise, cold sweats, diarrhea and nausea. He takes no medications. On examination, there were multiple erosions and tense 0.5–1.5 cm vesiculobullae along the labial, buccal and alveolar mucosae (Figs 1 and 2) and bilateral conjunctival injection, but no involvement of the anogenital mucosa or non-mucosal skin. Punch biopsies were performed (Fig 3). Direct and indirect immunofluorescence stains, tissue stains and cultures for bacterial organisms, and polymerase chain reaction testing for herpes simplex and varicella zoster viruses were all negative.

What is the most likely diagnosis?

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 4 travel-associated infections and diseases [^86e0a578]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Chikungunya — clinical features and course in travelers are described as follows: The incubation period is typically 3–7 days (range 1–12 days), with sudden onset of high fever (temperature typically 39° C [102° F]) and joint pains; fevers typically last for 1 week and can be biphasic. Joint symptoms are typically severe, debilitating, and usually bilateral and symmetric, most commonly affecting hands and feet but possibly more proximal joints. Other findings include conjunctivitis, headache, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, and a morbilliform rash that often pruritic and involves trunk and extremities and can include palms, soles, and face. Abnormal laboratory findings can include elevated creatinine and liver function tests, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia; rare but serious complications include hepatitis, myocarditis, neurologic disease, ocular disease, acute renal disease, and severe bullous skin lesions. Acute symptoms typically resolve in 7–10 days, but some patients have continuation or relapse of rheumatologic symptoms for months after acute illness, and studies report variable proportions, ranging from 5% to 80%, with persistent joint pains and prolonged fatigue for months or years. Deaths occur but are rare and are reported most commonly in older adults with comorbidities and young infants infected perinatally or by mosquito bites. In pregnancy, symptoms and outcomes are similar to others and most infections during pregnancy will not result in transmission to the fetus; however, intrapartum transmission can result in neonatal complications including hemorrhagic symptoms, myocardial disease, and neurologic disease, and rare spontaneous abortions after first-trimester maternal infection have been reported.

### Kaposi varicelliform eruption in a patient with epidermolysis bullosa simplex generalized severe [^50eb82ca]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case report

An 11-month-old child with generalized EB simplex was hospitalized for hyperthermia. The child and his family had no history of atopic dermatitis. Since birth, he presented with blisters of the oral cavity, hands, and feet followed by blisters on the whole body, thickened nails, and trumpet nails deformity. He had a family history of EB simplex generalized severe; his father also had the condition diagnosed at birth. Histopathologic examination found intraepidermal cleavage within basal keratinocytes. Immunofluorescence antigen mapping found a normal positivity for keratin 5, laminin 332, and collagen 7. Laminin 332 and collagen 7 were located on the base of the blister, and keratin 5 was expressed both on the roof and base of it, leading to the diagnosis of EB simplex generalized severe. As he grew, he usually presented with 20 to 30 blisters every 2 days on the hands, feet, and trunk, with mucosal involvement (tongue and palate) and onychodystrophy.

Fever (39°C) was present for 5 days. The patient was hypotonic. He also had diarrhea. Clinical examination excluded otitis media or any other type of ear, nose, or throat infection; pulmonary auscultation was unremarkable (Figs 1 and 2). Findings on cytobacteriologic examination of the urine were normal, and blood cultures were negative for infection. A blood test found an inflammatory reaction, with a high C-reactive protein level of 40 g/L, but no other abnormalities. Viral stool cultures were negative, and an abdominal ultrasound scan was normal. The patient was initially treated with ciprofloxacin and amoxicillin clavulanic acid for bacterial superinfection.

The depression in the center of the blisters on the left cheek and left hand suggested that a herpetic superinfection was possible. These blisters were not located exactly on the same site of EB lesions. Systemic antiviral treatment with acyclovir, 10 mg/kg every 8 hours, was started in association with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. The diagnosis was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, which indicated the presence of herpes simplex virus type 1 in the lesions on the left cheek. Local bacteriologic samples showed the presence of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus dysgalactiae. Treatment was successful and was accompanied by apyrexia within 24 hours of initiation.

Because of the child's diagnosis, the close relatives were examined, and the mother was clinically positive for HSV. She was treated with valacyclovir to prevent subsequent recurrences or other complications.

### Spatial mapping of long-term recrudescent herpes simplex labialis [^1872fa3f]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 (HSV-1) infections, both primary and reactivation, have been repeatedly studied, but only for short periods of time. The long-term (years) natural history of recrudescent (clinically apparent) outbreaks of oral-labial HSV infection is not well characterized. We have found no report that describes the long-term; (ie, > 6 months), continuous natural history of labial HSV-1 clinical expression. This case study helps to fill that knowledge gap in that it records the frequency of HSV-1 outbreaks over a span of 38 years and precise location of outbreaks over a span of 11 years.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^38da6cbb]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Nasal packing: FAQs for patients with nosebleed — packing typically "should be in place for no longer than 5 days", and "if your packing is resorbable, it may not need removal and will go away with time and the use of nasal saline sprays". Bleeding can still occur with packing; "apply pressure to the nose with pinching of the soft area, call your clinician, or go to the emergency department for further management". For nonresorbable packing, using it past the recommended time "can result in possible complications", therefore "strict adherence to follow-up directions is important". Reported risks include infection and pressure-related injury: "There is a low risk of infection spreading to the nose and sinuses or, in extremely rare cases, throughout the body", and pressure "may decrease blood flow to areas of the nose and result in injury". To reduce complications, "oral antibiotics will be used if the risk for infection is high", and "keeping the nose and packing moist with nasal saline (salt water) sprays throughout the day can reduce crusting and help resorbable packing melt away"; "strict adherence to follow-up instructions will allow for appropriate removal of packing when necessary and should make complications less frequent". Activity and medication guidance includes: "you should avoid straining, lifting over 10 pounds, bending over, and exercising", and "avoid over-the-counter pain medications that may increase bleeding, including aspirin and ibuprofen"; "Acetaminophen (Tylenol) does not increase bleeding and can be used", and "you should not try to blow your nose… If you feel the need to sneeze, sneeze with mouth open". Seek care urgently if any warning signs occur: "return of blood from nose or mouth, fever over 101°F, increasing pain, vision changes, shortness of breath or labored breathing, loss of color around the skin of the nose, swelling of the face, or a diffuse skin rash". After removal, "you may initially experience a small amount of bleeding… Keeping the nose humid with saline spray and moisturizing agents will prevent dry crusts and facilitate healing"; if nosebleeds recur, "apply pressure… and consider the use of a vasoconstrictor spray", and "if bleeding continues, call your medical provider, or go to the emergency department for further management".

### Erythema multiforme [^a42812db]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Erythema multiforme is an inflammatory skin and mucosal disease mainly related to infectious agents such as Herpes simplex virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, though it can also be "idiopathic". The characteristic skin lesions are typical or atypical acral raised target lesions. The oral mucosa can be affected, alone or in combination with other mucosal/cutaneous sites, sometimes causing extreme pain, severely impacting food intake, and warranting hospitalization. A comprehensive understanding of erythema multiforme clinical characteristics, triggering agents, and differential diagnosis including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, is crucial to conduct proper workup and management. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection should be immediately ruled out because of the need of antibiotics. The cornerstone of management is symptomatic treatment and will be detailed in this review as well as the etiologic treatment. Lastly, the management of persistent or recurrent erythema multiforme can be challenging, especially when antivirals fail to prevent a relapse, but breakthrough treatments have been reported successful in this difficult-to-treat subset of patients.
