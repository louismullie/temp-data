## Question

Does a VATS procedure involve insertion of chest tube?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a VATS procedure involves insertion of a chest tube. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "standard practice" is for chest drainage after VATS across common indications. Then, I should verify exceptions where tubes are omitted or alternatives are used. Next, I will review the strength of evidence and guidelines to gauge how universal this practice is. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded answer with caveats about patient selection and evolving protocols.

> Let me first confirm the default practice. In most VATS lung resections, surgeons place at least one chest tube to evacuate air and fluid and to monitor for leaks, and this is repeatedly documented in contemporary series and technique descriptions, including uniportal lobectomy where a 28 Fr tube is placed through the port and secured, and multiport lobectomy where a 24 Fr tube is positioned apically or through the inferior incision, which aligns with ERAS-era protocols that still include chest tube management as a core element of care [^2ef4bee6] [^54b9c792] [^f82b69b6].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale so I don't overstate it. Chest tubes are used to prevent pneumothorax, facilitate lung re-expansion, and allow quantification of air leaks and drainage; this is why even minimally invasive VATS programs continue to prioritize tube management within ERAS pathways, and why meta-analyses and systematic reviews of VATS outcomes consistently report chest tube duration as a key endpoint, underscoring its routine use in standard cases [^f82b69b6] [^2c8724cc] [^95376897].

> Hold on, I should verify exceptions before concluding. In carefully selected patients undergoing VATS wedge resection, some centers omit a chest tube entirely when no intraoperative air leak is detected, and this strategy has been reported as safe in retrospective cohorts with low rates of residual pneumothorax and no need for reintervention, though patients are monitored closely with serial radiographs and strict selection criteria are applied [^d2a450f8] [^da4a8ced].

> I need to check whether alternatives to standard large-bore tubes change the answer. Several studies and protocols explore smaller-caliber drains or even central venous catheters as less painful substitutes for conventional chest tubes after wedge resections, and while these are not "tubeless", they reflect efforts to minimize tube-related morbidity while maintaining drainage; importantly, these strategies still involve placing a drain, just a smaller or different type, and are typically reserved for selected patients and experienced teams [^ef47e63f] [^64ad92b2] [^00952bce].

> Let me consider the strength of evidence so I don't overgeneralize. The highest-quality synthesis still treats chest tube drainage as standard after VATS lung resections, with meta-analyses and systematic reviews using chest tube duration as a core outcome, and contemporary guidelines describing VATS lobectomy benefits without recommending routine omission of drains; randomized data supporting tube omission is limited to small, selected populations and specific procedures like wedge biopsy or wedge resection, not lobectomy or segmentectomy [^95376897] [^f5ab4a7d] [^bc650775].

> But wait, what if the indication is different, like empyema or trauma. I should double-check that context. In empyema, VATS is often pursued after failed tube drainage, and when VATS is used therapeutically, chest tubes are still placed postoperatively to ensure lung re-expansion and drainage; similarly, in trauma-related retained hemothorax, VATS replaces repeated tube thoracostomies but still culminates in tube placement for drainage, reinforcing that VATS itself does not negate the need for postoperative chest drainage in those scenarios [^a334b23d] [^3a6d9532].

> Putting this together, I should confirm the bottom line. Yes, VATS procedures generally involve insertion of a chest tube as standard practice for lung resections, with tube size, number, and duration tailored to the operation and patient factors; exceptions exist in highly selected wedge resections where a tubeless approach is used cautiously, and some centers employ smaller or alternative drains to reduce pain, but these are exceptions that require careful patient selection and close monitoring rather than a new universal standard [^2ef4bee6] [^d2a450f8] [^ef47e63f].

---

In most cases, **VATS requires a chest tube** [^2c8724cc] to drain air and fluid and to monitor for leaks, with typical use of one 24–28 Fr tube [^2ef4bee6] [^c8008487] and an average duration of 2–4 days [^d69f8d00]. However, in selected patients undergoing **wedge resection without air leak**, tubeless VATS is safe and feasible [^d2a450f8] [^bc650775], and smaller or alternative drains (e.g. 7–16 Fr) [^ef47e63f] [^4d34670e] can reduce pain and expedite recovery [^64ad92b2] [^0bb2d69c]. Chest tube use is individualized based on procedure, lung integrity, and patient factors, with ongoing efforts to optimize size, timing, and early removal within ERAS protocols [^f82b69b6] [^00952bce].

---

## Standard practice: chest tube placement after VATS

- **Routine placement**: Most VATS procedures include a chest tube to evacuate air and fluid and to detect air leaks [^2c8724cc]; one 24–28 Fr tube is typical [^2ef4bee6] [^c8008487].
- **Duration**: Tubes remain 2–4 days on average, longer with air leaks or high output [^d69f8d00] [^69f7fd60].
- **Technique**: The tube is placed through a separate incision or the utility port and secured to the chest wall [^2ef4bee6] [^54b9c792].

---

## Indications for chest tube placement in VATS

Chest tubes are placed for **specific clinical reasons**:

| **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Air leak prevention/management | Monitor and evacuate pneumothorax; facilitate lung re-expansion [^0bb2d69c] |
| Fluid drainage | Remove blood, serous, or chylous fluid; prevent effusion/hemothorax [^a334b23d] |
| Postoperative monitoring | Assess for bleeding, infection, or persistent air leak [^d69f8d00] |

---

## Variations in chest tube management

While standard practice favors a chest tube, **variations exist**:

- **Tubeless VATS**: In selected wedge resections without air leak, omitting the tube is safe and feasible, with low pneumothorax rates and no reinterventions in experienced series [^d2a450f8] [^da4a8ced].
- **Smaller-caliber drains**: 7–16 Fr tubes or central venous catheters reduce pain and may shorten stay without compromising safety in selected patients [^ef47e63f] [^64ad92b2] [^4d34670e].
- **Digital drainage systems**: Allow objective leak assessment and can shorten tube duration and hospital stay [^d69f8d00].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting chest tube use

Multiple studies and reviews support **routine chest tube use** after VATS:

- **Meta-analysis**: Digital systems reduce tube duration and length of stay vs traditional systems [^d69f8d00].
- **Systematic review**: Optimized chest tube management (size, timing, removal criteria) improves recovery and reduces complications [^00952bce].
- **RCT**: Early water seal strategies shorten tube duration and stay without increasing complications [^222bd655].

---

## Potential complications of chest tube placement

Chest tubes can cause **complications**, though rates are generally low:

- **Pain**: Moderate-to-severe pain is common and can impair breathing/coughing, increasing atelectasis and infection risk [^0bb2d69c] [^7f7350b7].
- **Infection**: Risk of site infection or empyema, mitigated by aseptic technique and early removal when safe [^6ebac4ed].
- **Malposition**: Improper placement can cause inadequate drainage or injury, requiring repositioning [^038a1086].

---

## Recent advancements and controversies

Recent efforts focus on **individualized tube management**:

- **ERAS protocols**: Emphasize early mobilization, multimodal analgesia, and early tube removal to enhance recovery [^f82b69b6] [^6ebac4ed].
- **Tubeless strategies**: Expanding to carefully selected patients, including uniportal wedge resections and pediatric cases [^d2a450f8] [^897ca45f].
- **Drain size debate**: Smaller tubes reduce pain but may kink or occlude; selection should balance efficacy and comfort [^f5f8ef52] [^0bb2d69c].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines and expert statements generally support **routine chest tube use** after VATS, with flexibility for selected omissions in wedge resections without air leak. NCCN notes VATS benefits include shorter tube duration and faster recovery vs thoracotomy [^f5ab4a7d], and **consensus statements** endorse standard tube placement while allowing surgeon discretion in select scenarios [^c8008487].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Aspect** | **Evidence summary** |
|-|-|
| Standard practice | Most VATS cases use a chest tube (24–28 Fr); duration 2–4 days [^2ef4bee6] [^d69f8d00] |
| Exceptions | Tubeless VATS feasible in selected wedge resections without air leak [^d2a450f8] [^bc650775] |
| Alternatives | Smaller drains (7–16 Fr) or CVCs reduce pain in selected patients [^ef47e63f] [^64ad92b2] |
| Benefits | Tubes enable safe drainage, leak detection, and lung re-expansion [^0bb2d69c] |
| Complications | Pain, infection, malposition; minimized by technique and early removal [^0bb2d69c] [^6ebac4ed] |
| Guidelines | Support routine use; allow selective omission in wedge resections [^f5ab4a7d] [^c8008487] |

---

In sum, **VATS typically requires a chest tube** for drainage and monitoring, but tubeless strategies or smaller drains are reasonable in carefully selected patients. Management should be individualized within ERAS frameworks to balance efficacy, safety, and comfort.

Introduction

Lung cancer still remains the leading cause of cancer-related death on a global scale while its incidence and mortality show geographical differences substantially due to varying patterns of well-recognized risk factors, such as tobacco smoking and air pollutants. According to the Global Cancer Statistics across 185 countries updated in 2020, lung cancer was expected to cause 11.4% of all new cancer diagnoses and 18.0% of all cancer-related deaths. According to Cancer Statistics updated by the American Cancer Society in 2023, there will be approximately 238,340 newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer and 127,070 new deaths in the United State (US). Although only age and smoking history are recommended as current lung cancer screening guidelines by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), individualized risk evaluation including environmental exposures, chronic lung disease, and family history should be constituted into lung cancer screening guidelines as recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and other society guidelines. For the vast majority of patients with early-stage lung cancer, surgical resection is still the standard of care and has revolutionized from a traditional open approach to a minimally invasive surgery technique mainly represented by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). VATS permits proven safety and feasibility, less surgical trauma, and shorter postoperative hospital days, which has become a mainstay of modern-day thoracic oncology practice for resection of early-stage lung cancers. Nevertheless, this type of minimally invasive surgery still induces surgical stress and considerable postoperative complications, making postoperative management being a clinical challenge for lung cancer patients.

### Enhanced recovery after surgery program focusing on chest tube management improves surgical recovery after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [^f82b69b6]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) refers to a multimodal, multidisciplinary approach integrating various procedures patient's initial referral through to discharge with a goal to minimize surgical stress, improve surgical outcomes, reduce postoperative complications, shorten hospital stay, and improve surgical productivity. Over the last few years, a large volume of evolving clinical evidence has successfully confirmed improved surgical outcomes with safety in major surgical specialties including VATS. Key elements to successfully implement ERAS protocols are the setting up of a dedicated team consisting of surgeons and surgical groups, preoperative counseling and nutrition, promotion of early oral intake, and early mobilization. With regard to thoracic surgery to implement ERAS protocols, in addition to the utilization of minimally invasive approaches and standard postoperative care, proper chest tube management should be added due to the fact that chest tubes can induce pain, deteriorate the ventilation capacity, and delay mobilization. Prolonged drainage and air leaks resulting from chest tube placement may lead to a substantial burden on hospitalization stay and outpatient resources, creating a critical need for a dedicated chest tube management, such as the setting up of chest tube monitoring clinic and development of a novel chest tube placement to improve postoperative care for patients after thoracic surgery. Early removal of the chest tube after VATS has been pursued to shorten length of hospital stays and most importantly, reduce postoperative morbidity without increasing the risk of complications. Although the ERAS protocols have been implemented in VATS over the few years, optimization of chest tube management to achieve early removal of the chest tube remain to be explored. The objectives of this study were to implement a standardized ERAS program for patients undergoing VATS, analyze the safety and feasibility of this program with a specific focus on chest tube management by assessing associated surgical recovery.

Discussion

Although VATS is a minimally invasive procedure that permits relatively fast recovery, the use of chest tubes for drainage of the thorax postoperatively causes moderate to severe postoperative pain, increased risk of infection, and prolonged length of hospital stay. The current issues and challenges of chest tube placement during VATS refer to (i) a suitable size and type of chest tube to prevent blockage; (ii) the appropriate number of chest tubes to achieve effective drainage effectiveness and reduced postoperative pain; (iii) utilization of a digital classification system routinely to reduce the duration of air leakage; (iv) optimized the drainage volume during the period for early chest tube removal; and (v) even without drainage-tube placement in some strictly selected patients. However, chest tube placement still remains a standard procedure during VATS in multiple medical centers, and evidence-based chest tube management need to be developed and widely adopted. This study suggests the implementation of a VATS-specific ERAS program that was modified with a specific focus on chest tube placement could improve surgical recovery and remove patient chest tube earlier to achieve reduced hospital stay compared to usual care and it did not increase readmission rates.

Preoperative consultation with a clear comprehensible explanation of what is to happen across the entire hospitalization process was one of the ERAS principles to alleviate depression, anxiety, and surgical fear of patients. A rational yet nonaggressive goal-directed fluid therapy as an intraoperative element of the ERAS protocols could reduce the incidence of postoperative complications in the intestines and prevent venous thromboembolism. Promotion of oral intake and early mobilization as two core elements of postoperative part of ERAS protocols, aiming at faster recovery of bowel function, lower rates of infectious complications, and shorter hospital stay. Our results showed that the time of first food intake and the time of out-of-bed activity were significantly shorter in the patients undergoing VATS after implementation of ERAS program compared to those before implementation of ERAS program, indicating a better surgical recovery without adding the risk of complications offered by the ERAS program in VATS.

### A comparison of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with open thoracotomy for the management of chest trauma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^b7d20e22]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This study aimed to systematically review and compare the perioperative outcomes of video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) with open thoracotomy for chest trauma patients.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized control trials and cohort studies comparing the perioperative outcomes of VATS with open thoracotomy for chest trauma patients. Clinical endpoints included postoperative complications, perioperative mortality rate, chest tube drainage volume, duration of tube drainage, duration of hospitalization, operation time, and amount of bleeding and transfusion volume in operation. A subgroup analysis was performed to explore the potential source of heterogeneity.

Results

Twenty-six studies were included. Pooled analyses showed significant reductions in the incidence of postoperative complications (risk ratio [RR] [95% confidence interval (CI)], 0.47 [0.35, 0.64]), chest tube drainage volume (mean difference [MD] [95% CI], -146.88 mL [-196.04, -97.72]), duration of tube drainage (MD, -1.71 days; 95% CI -2.16 to -1.26), duration of hospitalization (MD, -4.67 days; 95% CI -5.19 to-4.14), operation time (MD, -41.18 min; 95% CI -52.85 to -29.51), and amount of bleeding (MD, -119.10 ml; 95% CI -147.28 to -90.92) and transfusion volume (MD, -379.51 ml; 95% CI -521.24 to-237.77) in chest trauma patients treated with VATS compared with open thoracotomy. The perioperative mortality rate was not significantly different between patients received VATS and open thoracotomy (RR, 0.52; 95% CI 0.22–1.21).

Conclusions

Compared to open thoracotomy, VATS is an effective and even better treatment for improving perioperative outcomes of hemodynamically stable patients with chest trauma and reduce the complications. However, caution should also be exercised in certain clinical scenarios.

### Anesthesia for nonintubated video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [^0970c2c3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

With the growing adoption of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery protocols across all surgical groups, including thoracic surgery, coupled with improved video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) equipment and techniques, nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery has gained significant popularity in recent years. Avoiding tracheal intubation with an endotracheal or double-lumen tube and general anesthesia may reduce or eliminate the risks associated with traditional mechanical ventilation, one-lung ventilation, and general anesthesia. Studies have shown a trend toward better preservation of postoperative respiratory function and improved postoperative lengths of hospital stay, morbidity, and mortality; however, these have not been conclusively proven. This review article discusses the advantages of nonintubated VATS, the types of thoracic surgery in which this technique has been described, patient selection, appropriate anesthetic techniques, surgical concerns, potential complications relevant to the anesthesiologist during the conduct of nonintubated VATS surgery, and suggested management of these complications.

### Optimization of chest tube management to expedite rehabilitation of lung cancer patients after video-assisted thoracic surgery: a meta-analysis and systematic review [^00952bce]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this meta-analysis and systematic review of published evidence was to optimize chest tube management for fast-track rehabilitation of lung cancer patients after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS).

Methods

The PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were searched to identify all studies that addressed the issue of chest tube management after VATS for lung cancer. Finally, 35 articles were included for analysis, i.e., 29 randomized controlled trials and 6 clinical trials.

Results

After synthesis of the published evidence, the following protocol for chest tube drainage was formulated: (1) after VATS lung wedge resection, chest tube drainage can be omitted in selected cases; (2) normally, one 28Fr chest tube (or 19Fr Blake drain) is placed; (3) the use of a digital monitoring system is recommended; (4) in case of increasing pneumothorax or severe air leakage supported by digital recording system, the tube should be placed with active suction; and (5) the chest tube can be removed within 48 h postoperatively when air leakage is resolved and fluid drainage is < 400 mL/day.

Conclusions

Further multicenter studies are warranted based on the variations of body sizes among different ethnicities.

### PROSPECT guidelines for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^889c11ec]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Why was this guideline developed?

Video‐assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), although less painful than thoracotomy, is associated with significant acute and chronic postoperative pain, negatively affecting recovery. This guideline aims to provide clinicians with an evidence‐based approach to pain management after pulmonary resection under VATS, and to improve postoperative pain relief.

### Randomized controlled trial of an alternative drainage strategy vs routine chest tube insertion for postoperative pain after thoracoscopic wedge resection [^ef47e63f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Favourable pain management after thoracic surgery is of great significance to prevent chronic pain and complications. The current incidence of postoperative pain remains high, with evidence suggesting a 59–90% incidence of postoperative pain, and 11–35% of patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) develop chronic pain postoperatively. Many factors contribute to the occurrence of postoperative pain; compared with thoracotomy, postoperative pain after VATS is reduced. In addition, intercostal nerve injury, indwelling thoracic drainage tubes and psychosocial factors are also causes of postoperative pain. Among them, the importance of chest drains in postoperative pain management is often overlooked, with limited attention focused on this aspect.

In recent years, with the popularization of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS), the tubeless strategy has been increasingly favoured by surgeons and patients. Thus, seeking a safe alternative to conventional chest tubes (CTs) or even abolishing drainage tubes has become a mainstream trend for many surgeons in minimally invasive pulmonary surgery. In our previously reported study, we provided evidence demonstrating that the alternative of conventional chest drainage by a 7-Fr double-lumen central venous catheter (CVC) along with a prophylactic air-extraction strategy can be safely applied to patients under lung wedge resection through VATS without causing more postoperative complications.

Intriguingly, we speculated that the alternative conventional chest drainage strategy of 7-Fr double-lumen CVC may reduce postoperative pain after lung wedge resection through VATS in the present study. To verify this hypothesis, we designed a single-centre, prospective, and randomized controlled trial to explore the effects of different drainage methods on acute and chronic pain in patients after lung wedge resection under VATS.

### How I do it: uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy [^c8008487]. JTCVS Techniques (2024). Medium credibility.

A consensus report of U-VATS lobectomy was published in 2019 based on 3 rounds of questionaries completed by 31 international experts with the goal of defining and standardizing U-VATS lobectomy. Although a technical quorum was not achieved, it was possible to see trends in the methods used by these experienced surgeons, especially in some perioperative decisions, such as the site of the incision (anterior axillar line, middle-anterior axillar line, or posterior axillar line) and the size of the chest tube placed (24-F or 28-F). This consensus should serve as a valuable guide for surgeons who are learning U-VATS techniques. However, it is important for each surgeon to adapt these guidelines to their individual realities, considering their practice, surgical skills, and experience.

The consensus report also queried the main reasons for converting to multiportal VATS or open thoracotomy. The need for a bronchovascular sleeve resection was the primary clinical situation in which the experts queried recommended conversion to multiportal VATS with 32% agreement, followed by major bleeding and need for pneumonectomy with 13% each. The main reasons given to convert to open thoracotomy were major bleeding (36% agreement) and the need for a bronchovascular sleeve resection (23% agreement). None of the experts indicated that they consider conversion to multiportal VATS or open thoracotomy in patients with the absence of a fissure, pleural adhesions, chest wall involvement, or poor lung deflation, demonstrating that these technical issues typically do not pose notable difficulties for experienced U-VATS surgeons.

### Place of video-thoracoscopy in thoracic surgical practice [^740d7671]. World Journal of Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

The advent of video-endoscopy revolutionizes the practice of surgery. Within a short span of time, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has become an acceptable approach to a wide range of thoracic procedures. The use of VATS as a diagnostic modality is now well established. For therapeutic procedures, VATS has also been generally accepted for the treatment of such conditions as primary spontaneous pneumothorax, loculated effusions, thoracodorsal sympathectomy, and resection of simple mediastinal cysts. Its roles in more complex procedures such as thymectomy and anatemic lung resections, however, remain poorly defined at present, even though the existing intermediate-term results are encouraging. VATS is still in evolution. Miniaturization of instruments promises to reduce access-induced trauma even further. On the other hand, attention to cost-containment is essential if VATS is to be applicable to patients in developing countries. Technology will continue to change. Carefully conducted clinical trials should precede the general acceptance of any new technology, no matter how attractive it may appear initially.

### Surgery for early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review of the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery versus thoracotomy approaches to lobectomy [^95376897]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for lobectomy has been touted to provide superior outcomes, compared with thoracotomy, for patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, supporting data are limited to case series and small observational studies. We hypothesized that a systematic review of the literature would enable a more objective evaluation of the evidence in order to determine the potential superiority of the VATS approach, compared with thoracotomy, in terms of short-term morbidity and long-term survival. To identify relevant articles for inclusion in our analysis, we performed a systematic review of the MEDLINE database. We looked for randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and case series that reported outcomes after VATS or thoracotomy lobectomy for NSCLC. For statistical testing, we used a two-sided approach (alpha = 0.05) under the hypothesis that VATS lobectomy is superior to thoracotomy lobectomy. We screened 17,923 studies. After independent review of the abstracts by 2 reviewers, we included 39 studies (only one randomized controlled trial) in our analysis. In aggregate, these 39 studies involved 3256 thoracotomy and 3114 VATS patients. The characteristics of the two groups were not significantly different. Compared with thoracotomy, VATS lobectomy was associated with shorter chest tube duration, shorter length of hospital stay, and improved survival (at 4 years after resection), all statistically significant. Compared with lobectomy performed by thoracotomy, VATS lobectomy for patients with early-stage NSCLC is appears to favor lower morbidity and improved survival rates.

### How I do it: uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy [^f89eabfa]. JTCVS Techniques (2024). Medium credibility.

VATS Evolution: From Multiportal to Uniportal

Multiportal VATS procedures typically require the creation of 3 or 4 incisions, but in 2006, D'Amico and colleaguesfirst described a VATS lobectomy technique using only 2 incisions. Rocco and colleaguesintroduced uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (U-VATS) in 2004, reporting on their initial experiences using U-VATS for simple procedures, such as lung biopsy or bleb resection for primary spontaneous pneumothorax. The first uniportal lobectomy was reported in 2011, and U-VATS lobectomy has since gained popularity worldwide, primarily in Europe and Asia. A review by Tu and Hsufound that more than 9545 U-VATS procedures have been performed worldwide and reported as of late 2015, with most of the lobectomies being performed in China, Spain, or Taiwan. This highlighted the international acceptance of U-VATS and the large experience with U-VATS acquired by surgeons around the globe. When the outcomes of uniportal and multiportal VATS lobectomy are compared, the uniportal approach is associated with decreased intraoperative bleeding (P < .001), a faster surgery (P < .001), shorter duration of chest tube drainage (P = 0.001), less postoperative pneumonia (P = 0.012), and shorter hospital stay (P < .001). Despite these findings, the adoption of U-VATS lobectomy in North America has been slow.

### Video-assisted thoracic surgery: state of the art in trauma care [^f0ce0eae]. Injury (2004). Low credibility.

The majority of chest-injured patients are managed with resuscitation and placement of chest tubes. Further interventions are required for complications or missed injuries. Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has become standard in elective surgery. Our purpose was to review the use of VATS in trauma. The literature and our experience support the use of VATS for specific indications. These indications are: (1) management of retained haemothorax; (2) management of persistent pneumothorax; (3) evaluation of the diaphragm in penetrating thoraco-abdominal injuries and management; (4) management of infected pleural space collections; and (5) diagnosis and management of on-going bleeding in haemodynamically stable patients. VATS for specific indications in trauma is associated with improved outcomes and decreased length of stay. VATS provides diagnostic and therapeutic benefit and should be included in the trauma surgeon's clinical armamentarium.

### Selective lobar collapse for video-assisted thoracic surgery [^e0aa7656]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) is conventionally performed under single-lung ventilation. A small proportion of patients are often excluded from undergoing VATS because of their inability to tolerate single-lung ventilation. We describe a simple technique of selective lobar lung collapse that may help to recruit additional, selected patients for VATS.

Methods

We use a standard suction catheter placed under bronchoscopic guidance to the target lobar bronchus through a single-lumen endotracheal tube. The catheter is left open to air, or suction can be applied to facilitate lobar collapse. The remaining lobe of the same lung can be ventilated throughout surgery. Surgery is performed using standard VATS techniques.

Results

Using this technique we have successfully performed VATS on 63 chest sides in 35 patients. The procedures performed included thoracodorsal sympathectomies (n = 28), mechanical pleurodesis procedures (n = 3), mediastinal and pleural biopsies (n = 2), and lung wedge resections (n = 2). We encountered no mortality or morbidity in all cases.

Conclusions

This technique is simple and safe and requires no expensive disposable devices. Although not essential for most patients undergoing VATS, it deserves to be in the armamentarium of the thoracic surgeon. Further studies will be required to better define its application in clinical practice.

ERAS program

We developed a VATS-specific ERAS program as previously described and modified this program with a specific focus on chest tube management. All related medical staff members (thoracic surgeons, anesthesiologists, and nutritionists) and a specifically ERAS designated study nurse received specific instructions regarding the modified ERAS program. Comments and advices from all these staff and nurses were collected and integrated into the final program prior to study commencement. Table 1 itemizes the key elements of the VATS-specific ERAS program and Table 2 lists the key elements of chest tube management.

### Comparison of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and open surgery in the management of primary empyema [^85879e27]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Thoracic empyema is the accumulation of frank pus within the pleural cavity. Its cause is often multifactorial and may include direct contiguous spread of infection, penetrating chest trauma or an iatrogenic cause secondary to surgical instrumentation of the pleural space. Current management of empyema is based on local empirical practice as there is no consensus on an optimal regimen. Over the past decade, surgical management of empyema has attracted great interest, leading to specific recommendations.

Recent Findings

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has revolutionized surgical management of patients with empyema. Thoracoscopic management of empyema includes VATS debridement and decortication. VATS debridement has been employed by many centres as the primary treatment option for early-stage empyema. However, this is still contentious as some surgeons continue to advocate initial trials of chest tube drainage and antibiotic-mediated pleural space obliteration prior to any form of surgery. A more aggressive approach is to move directly to VATS decortication, which has shown great promise in the management of chronic empyema. More complex, mulitloculated empyemas would previously have been managed solely by complex open surgical procedures such as open window thoracostomy or thoracomyoplasty. However, recent studies have shown VATS decortication to produce equivalent resolution rates to the higher morbidity open approaches.

Summary

A summary of the most recent opinions and results in the thoracoscopic and open surgical management of thoracic empyema is outlined. Early VATS debridement effectively manages simple parapneumonic effusions. VATS decortication has equivalent efficacy to open decortication at managing both chronic and early-stage empyemas.

### Does morbid obesity influence perioperative outcomes after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer? Analysis of the Italian VATS group registry [^e2a8b74c]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

To conclude, our findings showed that VATS lobectomy could be safely and satisfactorily conducted even in morbidly obese patients, without an increase in conversion rate, blood loss, surgical time, hospital postoperative length of stay, and chest tube duration. Moreover, short-term technical and oncological outcomes were preserved. Nevertheless, greater care and attention must be paid to the possible development of morbidity, and in particular pulmonary ones, in the postoperative period.

### Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for retained hemothorax in blunt chest trauma [^3a6d9532]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

SURGICAL METHOD

The detailed method for performing VATS was proposed by Carillo and Richardson in 1998. To obtain a clearer view of the pleural cavity, double-lumen intubation is effective for collapsing the ipsilateral lung. A patient is placed in the full lateral position, with the ipsilateral arm abducted 90° at the shoulder; this position is identical to that used during a standard thoracotomy. If VATS fails, alternatively performing an open thoracotomy can be easy.

Standard thoracoscopic equipment includes a thoracoscope with a 0° or 30° angle and a xenon light source, as well as two high-resolution video monitors that are located at both sides of the surgical table. Thoracoports are used to position the video camera and surgical instruments. The patient would have usually received tube thoracostomy during initial diagnosis. The thoracoscope can be passed through this wound after the chest tube is removed. According to the suggestion by Carillo, one or two additional incisions can be created; the locations of these extra incisions are determined after an initial inspection of the chest cavity is performed.

After insertion of the thoracoscope, the adhesions should be released by blunt digital dissection or sharp endoscopic electrocoagulated dissection. Full lung collapse is crucial for inspecting the entire pleural cavity. Blood and clots are removed by using a standard suction instrument or a suction–irrigator system. A sample of fluid is routinely collected for microbiologic assessment. In patients with organized thoracic collections, carefully dissecting and peeling away the outer layer with sponge sticks and ring forceps typically enables the outer layer to be removed from the visceral and parietal pleurae, thus completely releasing the trapped lung. After completion of this procedure, one or two large-bore chest tubes are placed through the thoracoport incisions. The chest tubes enable continual suction until no evidence of an air leak is present or until the amount of drainage from the thoracic cavity is less than 100 ml/d.

### Clinical study on the role of modified chest drainage tube in enhanced recovery after uniportal VATS radical surgery for lung cancer [^03dfd0e5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In recent years, the global advancement of minimally invasive surgical techniques and thoracoscopic technology has driven transformative progress in thoracic surgery. Compared with traditional open thoracotomy, thoracoscopic surgery offers multiple advantages, including smaller incisions, reduced blood loss, minimized tissue trauma, and accelerated postoperative recovery, and has thus gained widespread acceptance among thoracic surgeons. As thoracoscopic techniques continue to evolve, the number of required incisions has decreased from three ports to two, and ultimately to a single port. The reduced invasiveness and expedited recovery associated with uniportal thoracoscopic approaches have led to the increasing adoption of uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for radical lung cancer resection. Concurrently, the enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) paradigm has achieved widespread adoption in thoracic surgical practice. Postoperative pain remains a primary factor hindering rapid recovery, with chest drainage tubes identified as the major source of discomfort following uniportal VATS lung cancer surgery. Addressing postoperative pain reduction and optimizing recovery timelines remain central challenges for thoracic surgeons. This study performs a retrospective analysis comparing modified versus conventional chest drainage tubes after uniportal VATS lung cancer surgery, assessing their impact on postoperative recovery to identify the most effective drainage strategy.

### Enhanced recovery after surgery program focusing on chest tube management improves surgical recovery after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [^bf4cf60f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

The study population consisted of 60 patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after implementation of ERAS program (performed 2022 and December 2022) and another group of 60 patients undergoing VATS before implementation of ERAS program (performed 2021 and December 2021). Inclusion criteria were: (i) the VATS was performed under general anesthesia with double lumen intubation; (ii) clinical stage I to IIIB NSCLC; (iii) single peripheral mass less than 4 cm, without tumor invasion of the chest wall or great vessels; (iv) the VATS was performed by the same pool of surgeons in the year; iv) no distant metastasis, confirmed by preoperative examination; and (v) aged ≥ 18 years. Exclusion criteria were (i) N2 or N3 clinical nodal involvement of disease; (ii) induction chemotherapy or neoadjuvant therapies before surgery; (iii) conversion to thoracotomy; (iv) previous history of thoracic surgery (any type) or chest trauma; or (v) severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchial asthma, or interstitial lung disease.

Surgical methods

Patients of two groups had an only difference that their postoperative management followed the ERAS program. If the patients had diabetes, their glucose levels were maintained at a mild elevation. If the patients had hypotension, their blood pressure were maintained 160/100 mmHg or below. All patients received double-lumen endotracheal intubation with single-lung ventilation in the lateral position on the healthy side and underwent uniportal VATS. An incision with a length of 3–5 cm was made, and the camera was placed on the upper edge of the incision. The intrathoracic tissues were dissociated and the lymph nodes were dissected. One chest tube was placed through the camera port after lobectomy. The chest tube was adjusted with side holes made between the diaphragm and the lung lobe to drain pleural effusion. After surgery, all patients were given multimodal analgesia.

### Video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy: state of the art and future directions [^69f7fd60]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Thoracoscopic lobectomy is performed with increasing frequency for early-stage lung cancer. Several published reports suggest thoracoscopic resection is safe, with the potential advantage of shorter hospital stay, quicker recovery, and comparable oncologic results.

Methods

Data on 180 video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) patients who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy or sublobar anatomic resection at our institution between January 2002 and December 2006 were reviewed. The conversion rate to thoracotomy, complications, length of stay, and duration of chest tube drainage were determined. Similar variables were evaluated for patients aged older than 80 years, those with a forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) that was less than 50% predicted, those who had undergone preoperative neoadjuvant therapy, and those who had undergone lung-sparing anatomic resections.

Results

Thoracoscopic anatomic lung resection was performed successfully in 166 patients. One of 180 patients (0.6%) died, and 14 patients (9.2%) underwent conversions. Overall median length of stay was 4 days (range, 1 to 98; interquartile range [IQR], 3), and median duration of chest tube drainage was 3 days (range, 0 to 35 days; IQR, 2). The median length of hospital stay and median chest tube duration for the group aged 80 years and older was 5 and 3 days; for the segmental resection group, 4 and 3 days; for the chemotherapy or radiotherapy induction group, 3.5 and 3 days; and for the FEV1 less than 50% group, 5.5 and 4 days, respectively. No patients died in any of these groups.

Conclusions

Thoracoscopic lung resection can be performed safely in selected patients aged 80 years and older, in those with marginal pulmonary function, and in those with pathologic response to neoadjuvant therapy.

### Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery without drainage-tube placement for pulmonary wedge resection: a single-center retrospective study [^d2a450f8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Over the last few decades, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with single-lung ventilation has become a well-established modality for pulmonary resection. Modifications to the conventional approach to VATS have been made to reduce surgical stress, including reducing the number of access ports, avoiding the use of an endotracheal tube during surgery, and avoiding chest-tube drainage after VATS pulmonary wedge resection. Some surgeons have adopted uniportal (single-port) VATS pulmonary resection as an alternative to multiport VATS. Pompeo et al. reported their experience with conventional VATS using intravenous anesthesia without endotracheal intubation (tubeless VATS) for pulmonary nodule resection in 2004. In the same year, Watanabe et al. reported their experience with skipping chest-tube placement after VATS for pulmonary wedge resection. Recently, tubeless uniportal VATS without drainage-tube placement has been introduced and demonstrated to be safe and feasible for selected patients.

Without a chest tube present for drainage after VATS for pulmonary wedge resection, there is a risk for residual pneumothorax or pleural effusion requiring reintervention during the index hospital stay. We therefore aimed to assess the demographic, baseline, and intraoperative factors associated with development of residual pneumothorax after uniportal VATS for pulmonary wedge resection without drainage-tube placement.

### Surgical versus non-surgical management for pleural empyema [^709ae1cd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Empyema refers to pus in the pleural space, commonly due to adjacent pneumonia, chest wall injury, or a complication of thoracic surgery. A range of therapeutic options are available for its management, ranging from percutaneous aspiration and intercostal drainage to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or thoracotomy drainage. Intrapleural fibrinolytics may also be administered following intercostal drain insertion to facilitate pleural drainage. There is currently a lack of consensus regarding optimal treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of surgical versus non-surgical treatments for complicated parapneumonic effusion or pleural empyema.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2016, Issue 9), MEDLINE (Ebscohost) (1946 to July week 3 2013, July 2015 to October 2016) and MEDLINE (Ovid) (1 May 2013 to July week 1 2015), Embase (2010 to October 2016), CINAHL (1981 to October 2016) and LILACS (1982 to October 2016) on 20 October 2016. We searched ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for ongoing studies (December 2016).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials that compared a surgical with a non-surgical method of management for all age groups with pleural empyema.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data, and checked the data for accuracy. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included eight randomised controlled trials with a total of 391 participants. Six trials focused on children and two on adults. Trials compared tube thoracostomy drainage (non-surgical), with or without intrapleural fibrinolytics, to either VATS or thoracotomy (surgical) for the management of pleural empyema. Assessment of risk of bias for the included studies was generally unclear for selection and blinding but low for attrition and reporting bias. Data analyses compared thoracotomy versus tube thoracostomy and VATS versus tube thoracostomy. We pooled data for meta-analysis where appropriate. We performed a subgroup analysis for children along with a sensitivity analysis for studies that used fibrinolysis in non-surgical treatment arms. The comparison of open thoracotomy versus thoracostomy drainage included only one study in children, which reported no deaths in either treatment arm. However, the trial showed a statistically significant reduction in mean hospital stay of 5.90 days for those treated with primary thoracotomy. It also showed a statistically significant reduction in procedural complications for those treated with thoracotomy compared to thoracostomy drainage. We downgraded the quality of the evidence for length of hospital stay and procedural complications outcomes to moderate due to the small sample size. The comparison of VATS versus thoracostomy drainage included seven studies, which we pooled in a meta-analysis. There was no statistically significant difference in mortality or procedural complications between groups. This was true for both adults and children with or without fibrinolysis. However, mortality data were limited: one study reported one death in each treatment arm, and seven studies reported no deaths. There was a statistically significant reduction in mean length of hospital stay for those treated with VATS. The subgroup analysis showed the same result in adults, but there was insufficient evidence to estimate an effect for children. We could not perform a separate analysis for fibrinolysis for this outcome because all included studies used fibrinolysis in the non-surgical arms. We downgraded the quality of the evidence to low for mortality (due to wide confidence intervals and indirectness), and moderate for other outcomes in this comparison due to either high heterogeneity or wide confidence intervals.

Authors' Conclusions

Our findings suggest there is no statistically significant difference in mortality between primary surgical and non-surgical management of pleural empyema for all age groups. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery may reduce length of hospital stay compared to thoracostomy drainage alone. There was insufficient evidence to assess the impact of fibrinolytic therapy. A number of common outcomes were reported in the included studies that were not directly examined in our primary and secondary outcomes. These included duration of chest tube drainage, duration of fever, analgesia requirement, and total cost of treatment. Future studies focusing on patient-centred outcomes, such as patient functional scores, and other clinically relevant outcomes, such as radiographic improvement, treatment failure rates, and amount of fluid drainage, are needed to inform clinical decisions.

### Modified incision and closure techniques for single-incision thoracoscopic lobectomy [^c47f2b05]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy has recently gained attention due to its various advantages. However, this technique requires direct insertion of the chest tube into the thoracic cage; thus, leakage of intrathoracic fluid or air around the tube frequently occurs. Additionally, cosmetic problems may develop due to direct fixation of the chest tube at the site of the skin incision. To solve these problems we designed new incision and closure techniques for VATS lobectomy. In our technique the skin is incised lower than an intercostal muscle incision, and the chest tube transpierces the chest wall muscle about 1 cm below the incision. Finally, nylon is used for tube fixation and is anchored through the subcutaneous suture.

### Effectiveness of thoracic wall blocks in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, a network meta-analysis [^7f7350b7]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Managing postoperative pain after thoracic surgery is a significant challenge for the perioperative physician. Inadequate pain relief has been associated with ineffective breathing, reduced cough and difficulty clearing secretions, which increases the risk of postoperative atelectasis, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism.

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has been widely used to surgically manage lung disease since its introduction in the early 1990s. Unlike traditional surgical approaches involving wide surgical access via thoracotomy, VATS performs the same procedure through small port sites in the patient's chest wall. Although VATS continues to emerge as the new standard surgical procedure for minor and major lung surgery, the pain related to port sites and chest tube placement can still be moderate to severely painful.

Regional anesthesia has gained significant popularity over the last two decades by providing adjuncts and even alternatives to general anesthesia. However, while thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) and thoracic paravertebral blocks (PVB) are well-established techniques for thoracotomy, there exists no standard of regional analgesia for the minimally invasive thoracoscopic approach. Conversely, a variety of regional anesthesia techniques have been studied in patients undergoing VATS, with varying degrees of success. The number regional anesthesia options, and the number of possible head-to-head comparison necessitates simultaneous comparisons of all interventions in order to identify the most effective analgesic option after VATS.

This network meta-analysis is therefore conducted to evaluate the efficacy of various regional anesthesia options and systemic analgesia for intraoperative and postoperative pain control for VATS. Regional anesthesia techniques examined included serratus anterior plane (SAP) block, erector spinae plane (ESP) block, intercostal nerve (ICN) block, pectoralis nerve block (PECS), thoracic PVB, and TEA; each technique was evaluated in terms of analgesic efficacy and safety.

### Enhanced recovery after surgery program focusing on chest tube management improves surgical recovery after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [^08a511bc]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chest drainage is a standard procedure in thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer. However, chest tube placement may deteriorate the ventilation capacity and increase difficulty of postoperative management of patients. The study investigated on the effects of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) program focusing on chest tube management on surgical recovery of lung cancer patients.

Methods

The study population consisted of 60 patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after implementation of ERAS program and another group of 60 patients undergoing VATS before implementation of ERAS program.

Results

The mean time of first food intake was 12.9 h required for the ERAS group, which was significantly shorter than 18.4 h required for the control group (p < 0.0001). The mean time of out-of-bed activity was 14.2 h taken for the ERAS group, which was notably shorter than 22.8 h taken for the control group (p < 0.0001). The duration of chest tube placement was 68.6 h in the ERAS group, which was remarkably shorter than 92.8 h in the control group (p < 0.0001). The rate overall postoperative complications were notably lower in the ERAS group than in the control group (p = 0.018). The visual analogue score (VAS) scores on the second postoperative day exhibited significant differences between the ERAS group and the control group (p = 0.017). The patients in the ERAS group had a shorter hospitalization stay than those in the control group (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

The study suggests the ERAS program focusing on chest tube management could improve surgical recovery, remove patient chest tube earlier, and relieve patient pain after VATS.

### Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for retained hemothorax in blunt chest trauma [^038a1086]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In the past, the primary method for treating retained hemothorax was to perform an additional tube thoracostomy or exploratory thoracotomy. However, the additional chest tubes might be positioned improperly, resulting in inadequate drainage and prolonging the hospital stay. Although an exploratory thoracotomy may afford a clear view for locating lesions, this procedure is more invasive. A thoracotomy can be performed by cutting through the muscle of the chest wall and expanding the wound by using a rib expander. These surgical procedures cause further destruction to an injured chest wall and may increase morbidity and mortality. Since the 1990s, because of the advance in techniques and instruments of VATS, VATS is now widely accepted by most trauma surgeons. VATS can provide excellent visualization of the pleural cavity that is more useful for evacuating the hemothorax than using additional tube thoracostomies. The wounds caused by VATS are much smaller than those caused by a thoracotomy. Therefore, this procedure may prevent further injury to the chest wall. In a study by Schweigert et al. this procedure was shown to be suitable for use in elderly patients. The main functions of VATS include evaluation and control of continued bleeding, early evacuation of a retained hemothorax, evacuation and decortication of posttraumatic empyemas, limited invasive treatment of suspected diaphragmatic injuries, treatment of persistent air leaks, and evaluation of mediastinal injuries. On account of smaller incisions, the cosmetic results are more acceptable. VATS is now used as an alternative method to thoracotomy in selected patients and is typically used in patients with stable vital signs. However, open thoracotomy is still performed on patients experiencing hemorrhagic shock.

### Is an intercostal chest drain necessary after video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lung biopsy? [^bc650775]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical lung biopsy is a frequently performed procedure as an integral part of the diagnostic armamentarium for parenchymal lung disease. However, there is no evidence in the literature concerning the need for an intercostal chest drain after the procedure.

Methods

A prospective randomized control trial was set up to assess the need for intercostal chest drainage after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical lung biopsy. Patients who did not have any air leak after the procedure (lung tested while patient was still under anesthetic) was randomized to either having a chest drain or not. The study was powered at 0.9 using an alpha of 0.01.

Results

Thirty patients were recruited in each group. There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of patients' age (mean age, 59 versus 54 years), sex, history of steroid use, immediate postoperative pain scores, and wound complications. No significant pneumothoraces occurred in either group. However in the immediate postoperative phase, 28% and 15% of patients with and without chest drains, respectively, had a small (clinically not significant) pneumothorax (size < 10%) on their chest radiograph. Moreover, there was significantly increased in-hospital stay in the chest drain group (median, 3 days versus 1 day; p < 0.001). At 6 weeks' follow-up, all patients had fully expanded lungs bilaterally.

Conclusions

There is no need for an intercostal chest drain in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical lung biopsy if no air leak is identified at the time of surgery. Patients without a drain are discharged home within 24 hours postoperatively, raising the possibility of this procedure being an outpatient procedure.

### Clinical study on the role of modified chest drainage tube in enhanced recovery after uniportal VATS radical surgery for lung cancer [^f7aec1c1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

According to the most recent nationwide cancer statistics published by the National Cancer Center, lung cancer remains the leading malignancy in China in terms of both incidence and mortality, with a sustained upward trend observed in recent years. Surgical intervention continues to serve as the primary therapeutic strategy for improving patient survival rates and quality of life. With the progressive advancement of minimally invasive surgical techniques, thoracoscopic surgery has experienced rapid development and is now widely adopted in the treatment of lung cancer. Compared to traditional open thoracotomy, thoracoscopic surgery offers distinct advantages, including reduced tissue trauma, accelerated postoperative recovery, enhanced visualization, decreased complication rates, improved postoperative quality of life, and superior cosmetic outcomes. This approach is extensively applied in lobectomy, esophagectomy, mediastinal tumor resection, and bullectomy. Traditional thoracoscopic procedures typically employ multi-port systems (four-port, three-port, or two-port approaches). In contrast, uniportal VATS utilizes a single incision that integrates the operating, observation, and drainage ports, thereby minimizing chest wall trauma, reducing the incidence of related complications, and achieving improved cosmetic outcomes.

In recent years, the concept of ERAS has gained rapid adoption and integration into thoracic surgical practice. By implementing evidence-based protocols during the perioperative period, ERAS aims to mitigate postoperative stress responses, alleviate pain and functional impairments, reduce complication rates, accelerate recovery, and shorten hospital stays.

Given the unique anatomical and pathophysiological features of lung cancer patients, both pulmonary and extrapulmonary postoperative complications are prevalent, often resulting in prolonged hospitalization, increased healthcare costs, and diminished quality of life. Consequently, identifying effective strategies to minimize perioperative stress responses, prevent or reduce complications, and expedite recovery has become a central focus for thoracic surgeons. Postoperative pain, one of the most significant stressors, severely limits patients' ability to perform essential respiratory functions such as coughing and expectoration, thereby increasing the risk of complications including atelectasis, pulmonary infection, empyema, and bronchopleural fistula, all of which contribute to extended hospitalization. The primary source of postoperative pain in lung cancer patients is the chest drainage tube. Minimizing drainage-tube-associated discomfort has thus emerged as a central objective for thoracic surgeons.

### Randomized controlled trial of an alternative drainage strategy vs routine chest tube insertion for postoperative pain after thoracoscopic wedge resection [^9c227dae]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Thoracoscopic surgery has greatly alleviated the postoperative pain of patients, but postsurgical acute and chronic pain still exists and needs to be addressed. Indwelling drainage tubes are one of the leading causes of postoperative pain after thoracic surgery. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the effects of alternative drainage on acute and chronic pain after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).

Methods

Ninety-two patients undergoing lung wedge resection were selected and randomly assigned to the conventional chest tube (CT) group and the 7-Fr central venous catheter (VC) group. Next, the numeric rating scale (NRS) and pain DETECT questionnaire were applied to evaluate the level and characteristics of postoperative pain.

Results

NRS scores of the VC group during hospitalization were significantly lower than those of the CT group 6h after surgery, at postoperative day 1, at postoperative day 2, and at the moment of drainage tube removal. Moreover, the number of postoperative salvage analgesics (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [(NSAIDs]) and postoperative hospitalization days were notably reduced in the VC group compared with the CT group. However, no significant difference was observed in terms of NRS pain scores between the two groups of patients during the follow-up for chronic pain at 3months and 6months.

Conclusion

In conclusion, a drainage strategy using a 7-Fr central VC can effectively relieve perioperative pain in selected patients undergoing VATS wedge resection, and this may promote the rapid recovery of such patients after surgery.

### Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for retained hemothorax in blunt chest trauma [^7aee954b]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

VATS is a well tolerated, reliable, and effective procedure that can be easily applied to manage retained hemothorax after a patient experiences blunt chest trauma with few complications. As an alternative procedure to a thoracotomy, VATS is only slightly more invasive than a tube thoracostomy. In addition to enabling efficient removal and inspection of clots, VATS can also be performed to repair lung lesions and manage rib fractures.

### Comparison of the effectiveness of two different concentrations of ropivacaine for intrapleural analgesia in reducing stimulatory pain caused by chest tubes after uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: a randomised controlled study [^0bb2d69c]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The rapid advancement of thoracoscopic surgery has led to an increased focus on minimally invasive techniques, with uniportal thoracoscopy emerging as the leading approach. This method significantly reduces patient discomfort at incision sites compared to traditional thoracotomy. However, both acute and chronic pain can persist following video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), with reported incidence rates as high as 90% for acute pain and between 40% and 60% for chronic pain. A major contributor to postoperative pain is the presence of an indwelling chest drainage tube, which has been shown to impede the process of enhanced recovery after surgery.

Postoperative indwelling chest tubes following uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (UVATS) serve a dual purpose: draining pleural effusion and facilitating lung re-expansion, thereby reducing the risk of postoperative complications. Traditionally, after a lobectomy, the standard practice has been to use two chest tubes: one positioned superiorly to evacuate air and the other inferiorly to remove fluid. However, the discomfort caused by the contact of chest tubes with the pleura often leads to patients being reluctant to engage in coughing and deep breathing exercises, which can negatively impact postoperative oxygenation. This reluctance may result in prolonged hospital stays, increased pain levels, and a higher risk of postoperative complications, such as atelectasis and lung infections.

Pain is recognized as the most prevalent direct complication associated with chest tube insertion, with an incidence rate of 4.1%, and a delayed complication incidence of 18%. Generally, smaller-caliber chest tubes (10–14 Fr) are associated with less pain compared to larger-caliber tubes (> 20 Fr). While numerous studies have focused on pain reduction following chest tube removal, there is a paucity of data addressing pain management during the period of chest tube drainage. Modifying chest tube management protocols appears to be a promising strategy for alleviating pain associated with drainage tubes. One study demonstrated that the use of a 7-Fr central venous catheter instead of a conventional chest tube significantly reduced perioperative pain in patients undergoing VATS. Additionally, another investigation revealed that employing bi-pigtail catheter drainage (two 8-Fr pigtail catheters) resulted in significantly lower Numeric Pain Rating Scale scores for patients three days post-surgery when compared to traditional chest tube drainage using a single 28-Fr chest tube.

### Scoring tool to predict need for early video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) after pediatric trauma [^e1191018]. World Journal of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 15% of children in the USA present annually to the hospital with a traumatic injury. Most pediatric patients are found to have nonsignificant injuries and are discharged home within 24 h. Of patients that have significant trauma, nearly 30% may have a thoracic injury with the most common being a lung injury.

Hemodynamically stable trauma patients with thoracic injuries requiring intervention are often managed with only tube thoracostomy. However, in 20% of cases, a thoracostomy will be insufficient and surgical intervention will be required. This may be due to on-going bleeding, persistent pneumothorax, air-leak, empyema, or diaphragmatic injury. The most common indication for thoracic surgical intervention in trauma patients with a chest tube is a retained hemothorax. In adults, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is used in over 30% of cases with retained hemothorax. VATS has also been used safely in children for a variety of conditions including empyema and pneumothorax.

Performing VATS earlier in the hospital course has been demonstrated to be associated with improved outcomes in adult trauma patients. The Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) guidelines recommends early VATS within the first 72 h after injury for patients with retained traumatic hemothorax to decrease the need for additional procedures, conversion to open thoracotomy, empyema, and to reduce hospital length of stay (LOS). A retrospective study of over 80 patients found that VATS performed ≤ 5 days post-injury in adult patients with blunt chest trauma was associated with a significantly lower thoracotomy conversion rate and shorter hospital LOS. Another study on adults with thoracic trauma found that those receiving VATS ≥ 5 days post-injury had higher rates of surgical site infection, unplanned intubation, and pneumonia. Thus, there is substantial utility in predicting the need for VATS in all trauma patients, as performing early VATS appears to be associated with a decreased rate of complications and LOS.

Given the potential benefits of early VATS in trauma patients, there is a pressing need to develop a predictive tool for determining which pediatric trauma patients may require early VATS intervention. Currently, no widely used stratification tool exists for this purpose. To address this gap in the literature and improve pediatric trauma outcomes and hospital system readiness, we sought to develop and validate a novel VATS-In-Pediatrics (VIP) score. The objective of our study is to predict the need for early VATS within 72 h of admission for pediatric trauma patients using the VIP score.

### Intraoperative chest tube removal following thoracoscopic lung biopsy results in improved outcomes [^897ca45f]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Traditionally, chest tubes are left following video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) to treat a potential air leak or significant drainage. Recognizing the potential complications, our aim was to determine if intraoperative chest tube removal in children undergoing VATS lung biopsy is safe and if outcomes differ from when a chest tube is left in place.

Methods

We identified all children who underwent VATS lung biopsies from 2009 to 2013 and performed a retrospective review of the medical records. Pulmonary resection patients were excluded as were those with an air leak present in the operating room.

Results

A total of 90 VATS lung biopsies were performed. 41 children had a postoperative chest tube left in place (Group A), and 49 children had it removed intraoperatively (Group B). Mean age was 9 ± 6.4 years. One child in Group A and 2 children in Group B required replacement of a chest tube (p = NS). Group B patients had a lower postoperative pain score on day one, fewer postoperative chest X-rays, and a shorter length of postoperative stay.

Conclusions

These data suggest that intraoperative chest tube removal is safe and may be associated with improved outcomes following lung biopsy in children.

### Video: single-incision video-assisted thoracoscopic right pneumonectomy [^f908af59]. Surgical Endoscopy (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The most common approach for Video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy is undertaken with three or four incisions, including a utility incision of about 3–5 cm. However, major pulmonary resections are amenable by using only a single utility incision. This video shows the technical procedure of a right pneumonectomy by single-incision approach with no rib spreading.

Methods

A 52-year-old woman was proposed for single-incision VATS resection of a 5-cm right lower lobe adenocarcinoma. A 4-cm incision was made in the fifth intercostal space. We placed a 30-degree, high-definition, 10-mm thoracoscope in the posterior anterior part of the incision. Digital palpation confirmed that the tumor involved the fissure and the posterior portion of the upper lobe, which indicated the need for right pneumonectomy. We inserted the instruments through the anterior part of the utility incision to start the detachment of the right upper lobe by using a harmonic scalpel. The first step was dissecting the inferior pulmonary vein. The hilar structures were exposed by using harmonic scalpel and a long dissector (Fig. 1A). The upper and middle-lobe pulmonary veins were dissected and transected, allowing visualization of truncus anterior, which was then stapled. The inferior pulmonary vein and the intermediate truncus artery were divided, allowing optimal exposure to the main bronchus, which was stapled. The lung was removed in a protective bag by adding 1 cm to the incision, and a systematic lymph node dissection was performed. A single chest tube was placed in the posterior part of the utility incision.

Results

Total surgery time was 210 min. The chest tube was removed on postoperative day 2 (Fig. 1B), and the patient was discharged home on day 4 with no complications.

Conclusions

Single-port VATS pneumonectomy for selected cases is a feasible procedure, especially when performed from a center with previous experience in double-port VATS approach.

Discussion

Recent advances in surgical and video-assisted techniques have allowed minimally invasive pneumonectomy to be undertaken safely. VATS pneumonectomy is not a new procedure and in fact was initially reported 15 years ago and was felt to result in less postoperative pain and a faster return to normal activities [1]. Despite this, there have been only a few case reports or series published of VATS pneumonectomies [2, 3].

### Video-assisted thoracic surgery in the treatment of pleural empyema [^cf9b27de]. Surgical Endoscopy (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The use of video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) in the treatment of pleural empyema has been proposed since the early 1990s, but among surgeons, its use varies considerably, and the results are discordant. This report aims to provide a retrospective assessment of the authors' experience and the literature on VATS in an effort to ascertain rational criteria for the use of this technique.

Methods

Over a period of 12 years, a total of 120 cases of pleural empyema were recorded. The patients were assessed with chest x-ray, computed tomography, ultrasound, and thoracentesis. On the basis of clearly defined clinical and radiographic parameters, 38 patients underwent VATS immediately, whereas the remaining 82 were treated initially by means of tube thoracostomy. The latter was found to be sufficient for only 10 patients. Consequently, for the remaining 72 patients, it was decided to proceed also with VATS.

Results

The procedure was performed completely by VATS in 101 patients (91.8%), whereas in 9 patients (8.2%) it was necessary to convert to thoracotomy. The postoperative course was uneventful for 98 of the 110 patients (89%), whereas the remaining 12 patients experienced complications, including one case of persistent empyema (0.9%) treated by thoracotomy. The mean chest tube duration was 6 days (range, 3–25 days). The mean postoperative hospital stay was 7.1 days (range, 5–17 days). Of the 80 patients completing a 6-month follow-up evaluation, the results were considered good for 72, moderately good for 8, and less than satisfactory for 2 patients.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the authors consider VATS to be the technique of first choice for the treatment of pleural empyema when the disease is advanced or tube thoracostomy fails. It provides excellent results with a low level of invasiveness and considerably reduces the need for thoracotomy. These results can be achieved with good videothoracoscopic experience and the use of a very precise technique.

### Enhanced recovery after surgery program focusing on chest tube management improves surgical recovery after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [^f5f8ef52]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Traditionally, placement of two chest tubes (one in the apical position and a second in the basal position) was conducted to enhance expansion of the residual lungs, whereas increasing numbers of studies reported one chest tube placement is applicable in normal clinical situations as adequate drainage was obtained with less pain and shorter hospital stay. Recently, use of thinner chest tube is investigated to achieve efficient fluid drainage and air evacuation. However, Clark et al. reported this thin and flexible tube became completely occluded resulting in life-threatening hypovolemic shock after thoracic surgery. This indicates that the use of thinner chest tube is applicable in normal clinical situations, but adding risk of postoperative bleeding and infection should be taken into account. Icard et al. examined the feasibility and safety of a single 24 F Blake drainage in 100 consecutive patients undergoing lobectomy or wedge resection and suggested it can be considered as an acceptable option due to the fact that the flexible quality of the drain improved comfort of the operated patients. Chestovich et al. tested flowrates of chest tubes among 20 F, 24 F, 28 F, 32 F, and 36 F, and found smaller tubes being slower and more variable and larger tubes showing only slightly higher flowrates. A single 28 F chest tube exhibited high and consistent velocity, keeping a good balance of reasonable size and high flowrate. Chest tube management was the postoperative core of the ERAS program in our study, which was evolved with education for chest drainage, position for bed rest, drainage observation (nature, quantity, color, and speed of drainage), skin care surrounding the tube, tube fixation, appropriate criteria of chest tube removal. Our results showed the patients undergoing VATS after implementation of ERAS program presented shorter chest tube days and hospital LOS than those before implementation of ERAS program, indicating the ERAS program modified with chest tube management could reduce chest tube days and hospital LOS without adding risk of infection.

### Optimal timing of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for primary spontaneous pneumothorax in children [^54767928]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

There is no consensus in the pediatric surgical community about when to recommend video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP). We aimed to identify factors that predict the likelihood of requiring VATS, and to compare recurrence rates and healthcare utilization among different management approaches to PSP.

Methods

A retrospective chart review and a telephone survey were conducted on all patients 12-21years who were diagnosed with PSP from 2007 to 2015. Data were extracted on patient demographics, initial management, hospital length of stay (LOS), and subsequent admissions, procedures, and recurrences.

Results

A total of 46 patients were included with a mean age of 16.1years (± 1.2). Most patients were male (41, 89%) and white (16, 44%). Initial management comprised chest tube drainage alone in 28 (61%), no intervention in 8 (17%), and VATS in 10 (22%). Total LOS was 6days (IQR 4–7) and was longer in patients who underwent VATS (p < 0.001). Recurrence occurred in 17 patients (37%). However, recurrence and healthcare utilization were not significantly associated with initial management approach. Among those who had initial chest tube drainage, 14 (50%) underwent VATS on that admission, and 8 (28%) had subsequent surgery. Significant predictors of ultimately requiring VATS were presence of an air leak and partial lung expansion.

Conclusion

Most patients with PSP currently undergo chest tube placement as initial management, although most eventually require VATS. Presence of an air leak and partial lung expansion on chest radiograph within the first 48h of management should prompt earlier surgical intervention.

Type Of Study

### Long-term outcomes of open and video-assisted thoracoscopic lung lobectomy for the treatment of early stage non-small cell lung cancer are similar: a propensity-matched study [^27e92376]. World Journal of Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Generally, in retrospective studies, favourable short- and long-term outcomes for patients after lung lobectomy for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) have been reported. However, the interpretation of lung lobectomy outcomes may be biased in retrospective settings.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent lung lobectomy for cT1-2N0M0 NSCLC from 2001 to 2010. The outcomes of patients who underwent VATS lobectomy were compared to those who underwent open lobectomy before and after performing propensity score matching. Preoperative covariates were entered when developing the propensity score-matching model.

Results

This study reviewed the outcomes of 101 VATS patients and 184 open lobectomy patients. Before propensity score matching, the VATS group had a higher mean age (p < 0.0001), smaller solid tumour size (p = 0.0042), similar whole tumour size (p = 0.2082), and larger tumour-disappearance ratio (p = 0.0007). The VATS group had a shorter mean operation time (p = 0.0002), less blood loss (p < 0.0001), shorter chest tube duration (p = 0.0002), and shorter hospital stay (p < 0.0001). As for long-term outcomes, the VATS group had higher disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival rates (p values by log-rank test: 0.0049, 0.0154, and 0.032, respectively). After propensity score matching, all differences, except operation time, blood loss, chest tube duration, and hospital stay, were no longer significant.

Conclusions

VATS lobectomy is less invasive than open lobectomy, but in terms of survival outcomes, VATS lobectomy was oncologically equivalent to open lobectomy. The oncological benefit of VATS reported by retrospective studies might be overestimated.

### Definition and assessment of high risk in patients considered for lobectomy for stage I non-small cell lung cancer: the American Association for Thoracic Surgery expert panel consensus document [^1aebc9b5]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2021). High credibility.

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy — evidence synthesis suggests benefit in compromised lung function, and decision-making should be multidisciplinary; a meta-analysis of VATS versus open lobectomy suggested that VATS lobectomy is associated with lower rates of risk for pulmonary morbidity in patients with compromised lung function. For these high-risk patients, an assessment of fitness for surgery should be thoroughly discussed in a multidisciplinary fashion that includes the patient and his or her caregivers, and the identification of patients at excessive risk if they undergo lobectomy should remain a clinical decision that should also take into consideration patient perspectives, values, preferences, and quality of life (QOL).

### Outcomes of uniportal vs multiportal video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy [^7e328fd9]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

The optimal number of incisions for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy, the standard treatment for early-stage nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is still a matter of great debate. To compare single-incision (uniportal) VATS (U-VATS) with traditional multiportal VATS (M-VATS), we retrospectively reviewed the surgical outcomes of a large cohort of patients. Our prospectively maintained institutional database was queried retrospectively. All patients from 2014 to 2017 who underwent VATS lobectomy as the primary procedure for clinical stage I or II NSCLC were identified. A univariate comparison and a propensity-matched analysis incorporating preoperative variables were performed. The incidence of postoperative complications was compared. During the study period, 722 patients underwent VATS lobectomy for early-stage NSCLC, 62% by M-VATS, and 38% by U-VATS. In the univariate analysis, U-VATS performed by an experienced surgeon was associated with decreased intraoperative bleeding and shortened duration of surgery, duration of chest tube drainage, and length of hospital stay as compared with M-VATS (P < 0.001). Mediastinal lymph node dissection and complete resection were accomplished similarly using U-VATS and M-VATS. When the 2 approaches were compared through propensity matching, U-VATS was associated with fewer pneumonias (P = 0.012), as well as decreased intraoperative bleeding (P < 0.001), faster surgery (P < 0.001), shorter duration of chest tube drainage (P = 0.001), and shorter hospital stay (P < 0.001). At our institution, in the hands of an experienced surgeon, U-VATS lobectomy is safe, feasible, and can result in similar short-term outcomes for early-stage NSCLC as compared with M-VATS.

### VALUE trial: phase 1 safety and feasibility study of same-day discharge after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lung resection [^48803e82]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective(S)

Despite enhanced recovery after surgery programs becoming more prevalent in thoracic surgery, minimal prospective research exists for same-day discharge (SDD) after lung resection. Thus, this trial aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of SDD after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).

Methods

This phase 1 registered trial (NCT05583916) enrolled patients from a single institution who were candidates for a VATS anatomic or wedge resection to treat confirmed or suspected lung malignancy. Following pre-operative education, patients were discharged home with a chest tube connected to a mini-atrium. Patients returned 1–3 days later for evaluation of chest tube removal. Quality of Life (QoL) was assessed using the FACT-L and ESAS questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were conducted for clinical outcomes, and univariant t-test analyzed QoL data.

Results

Twenty-one patients (n = 16; 76% female) were enrolled. The mean age was 65 with 12 (57%) past or current smokers. Staging was 88% (n = 15) Stage I, 12% (n = 2) Stage II, and 19% (n = 4) with metastasis to the lung. Two patients withdrew their consent, the remaining 19 patients underwent VATS lobectomy (n = 9), segmentectomy (n = 4), or wedge (n = 6). SDD was achieved in 95% of cases (n = 18). Median chest tube duration was 2 days (range of values: 1–10). One emergency room visit occurred. Two grade 2 prolonged air leaks occurred with no grade 3–5 adverse events. QoL data did not significantly differ from a standard of care cohort (n = 151).

Conclusions

Same-day discharge after VATS lung resections appears safe and feasible for carefully selected patients with planned anatomic or non-anatomic resections.

### WITHDRAWN: surgical versus non-surgical management of pleural empyema [^dfadd577]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural empyema is a collection of pus between the lungs and the chest wall. There is debate about treatment options with the advent of both fibrinolytic enzymes to facilitate tube drainage and less invasive video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).

Objectives

To determine which was more effective: surgical (using thoracoscopy or thoracotomy) or non-surgical techniques (thoracocentesis, chest tube drainage); and to establish whether there was an optimum time for intervention.

Search Strategy

In this updated review we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2005, issue 3) which contains the Acute Respiratory Infections Group's specialized register; MEDLINE (January 2002 to July Week 4, 2005); and EMBASE (January 2001 to 3rd Quarter 2005). Bibliographies, reference lists of identified studies and review articles were handsearched. Personal communication with authors is ongoing. There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical techniques versus non-surgical approaches for treatment of pus in the pleural cavity in children and adults but not neonates. Studies of empyema associated with tuberculosis or malignancy were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed using Jadad criteria (Jadad 1996). Authors were contacted for missing information. The primary outcomes were death or resolution of the empyema. Secondary outcomes addressed the length of time chest tubes were required, pain, hospital stay and any complications.

Main Results

Only one small randomised study was identified. Some methodological quality considerations cast doubt on the validity of the study with regard to patient selection, unclear allocation concealment and outcome assessor blinding and it scored 'B' overall (Jadad score 3). When compared with chest tube drainage combined with streptokinase, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) had a significantly higher primary treatment success and patients spent less time in hospital. Each treatment group suffered one mortality. The latest search revealed no further published randomised studies but communication with authors revealed two ongoing studies comparing conventional chest tube drainage plus antibiotics with and without fibrinolytics with video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS). A small unpublished study is awaiting assessment that compared chest tube drainage and antibiotics with thoracoscopy or thoracotomy plus antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

It seems that for large, loculated pleural empyemas VATS is superior to chest tube drainage in terms of duration of chest tubes in situ and length of hospital stay. However, there are questions about validity in the one study which met the inclusion criteria and the study has too few participants to draw conclusions. There are risks of complications (associated with all treatments) which may not be apparent with small numbers. Larger studies are needed.

### Late video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery versus thoracostomy tube reinsertion for retained hemothorax after penetrating trauma, a prospective randomized control study [^75afec1a]. World Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Early video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is the recommended treatment of choice for retained hemothorax (RH). A prospective single-center randomized control study was conducted to compare outcomes between VATS and thoracostomy tube (TT) reinsertion for patients with RH after penetrating trauma in a resource constrained unit. Our hypothesis was that patients with a RH receiving VATS instead of TT reinsertion would have a shorter hospital stay and lesser complications.

Materials and Methods

From January 2014 to November 2019, stable patients with thoracic penetrating trauma complicated with retained hemothoraces were randomized to either VATS or TT reinsertion. The outcomes were length of hospital stay (LOS) and complications.

Results

Out of the 77 patients assessed for eligibility, 65 patients were randomized and 62 analyzed: 30 in the VATS arm and 32 in the TT reinsertion arm. Demographics and mechanisms of injury were comparable between the two arms. Length of hospital stay was: preprocedure: VATS 6.8 (± 2.8) days and TT 6.6 (± 2.4) days (p = 0.932) and postprocedure: VATS 5.1 (± 2.3) days, TT 7.1 (± 6.3) days (p = 0.459), total LOS VATS 12 (± 3.9) days, and TT 14.4 (± 7) days (p = 0.224). The TT arm had 15 complications compared to the VATS arm of four (p = 0.004). There were two additional procedures in the VATS arm and 10 in the TT arm (p = 0.014).

Conclusion

VATS proved to be the better treatment modality for RH with fewer complications and less need of additional procedures, while the LOS between the two groups was not statistically different.

### Purposeful creation of a pneumothorax and chest tube placement to facilitate CT-guided coil localization of lung nodules before video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical wedge resection [^92d0cd5f]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of pneumothorax creation and chest tube insertion before computed tomography (CT)-guided coil localization of small peripheral lung nodules for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) wedge resection.

Materials and Methods

From May 2011 to October 2013, 21 consecutive patients (seven men; mean age, 62 y; range, 42–76 y) scheduled for VATS wedge resection required CT-guided coil localization for small, likely nonpalpable peripheral lung lesions at a single institution. Outcomes were evaluated retrospectively for technical success and complications.

Results

There were 12 nodules and nine ground-glass opacities. Mean lesion distance from the pleural surface was 15 mm (range, 5–35 mm), and average size was 13 mm (range, 7–30 mm). A pneumothorax was successfully created in all patients with a Veress needle, and a chest tube was inserted. All target lesions were marked successfully, leaving one end of the coil within/beyond the lesion and the other end of the coil in the pleural space. The inserted chest tube was used to insufflate air to widen the pleural space during coil positioning and to aspirate any residual air before transfer of the patient to the operating room holding area. Intraparenchymal hemorrhages smaller than 7 cm in diameter developed in two patients during coil placement. All lesions were successfully resected with VATS. Histologic examinaiton revealed 13 primary adenocarcinomas, four metastases, and four benign lesions.

Conclusions

Pneumothorax creation and chest tube placement before CT-guided coil localization of peripheral lung nodules for VATS wedge resection facilitates the deployment of the peripheral end of the coil in the pleural space and provides effective management of procedure-related pneumothorax until surgery.

Results

Search results and study selection

At the initiation of our systematic review and meta-analysis, a comprehensive search across several electronic databases yielded 1,161 potentially relevant articles. To streamline this initial pool, duplicates were removed using a specialized algorithm, ensuring each study was represented uniquely. Subsequently, titles and abstracts were meticulously screened based on strict inclusion and exclusion criteria that encompassed study methodology, demographic characteristics of the participants, clinical outcomes measured, and the quality of research methods. This preliminary evaluation narrowed the selection to 40 articles. Further detailed scrutiny involved multiple investigators independently reviewing the full texts of these articles to ensure an unbiased and thorough assessment. During this phase, 34 articles were excluded for various reasons: 13 were review articles, 8 were sequentially published works, 10 contained insufficient data for analysis, and 3 were clinical trials without control groups. Ultimately, only 6 articles met al.l the rigorous criteria established in our research protocol and were included in the final meta-analysis (Table 1; Fig. 1).

Results of quality assessment

In the quality assessment of the studies included in our meta-analysis, the majority demonstrated robust research methods, with most studies showing a low risk of bias across several key domains. Specifically, random sequence generation, allocation concealment, and blinding of participants and personnel were areas where studies frequently achieved a low risk of bias. However, a few studies exhibited concerns in specific areas, notably in blinding of outcome assessment and other potential sources of bias, where some studies were marked with a high risk of bias. The domain of selective reporting bias was generally well addressed across the majority of studies. The evaluations showed consistent methodological strength in the majority of the assessed criteria, with a minority displaying significant concerns that could influence the meta-analysis outcomes. Overall, the high level of methodological quality in most domains suggests a reliable foundation for the synthesis of findings in our meta-analysis (Fig. 2).

### Primary early thoracoscopy and reduction in length of hospital stay and additional procedures among children with complicated pneumonia… [^1587f9d2]. JAMA Network (2008). Excellent credibility.

Intervention Pleural fluid drainage, categorized as chest tube placement, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, or thoracotomy. Main Outcome Measures The LOS and the requirement for additional pleural fluid drainage. Results. In logistic regression analysis, patients undergoing primary VATS had an 84% reduction in the requirement for additional pleural fluid drainage procedures compared with patients undergoing primary chest tube placement. Conclusion Our large retrospective multicenter study demonstrates that, compared with primary chest tube placement, primary VATS is associated with shorter LOS and fewer additional procedural interventions. Early pleural fluid drainage is thought to improve the outcome of children with complicated pneumonia. 14–18 Drainage strategies include chest tube placement, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, and thoracotomy.

VATS allows for pleural debridement, which is not possible by chest tube placement. Furthermore, VATS is less invasive than thoracotomy. The magnitude of reduction in additional procedures associated with primary VATS compared with primary chest tube placement in our study was similar to that found in a previously published meta-analysis7, despite the fact that patients undergoing primary chest tube placement or thoracentesis were combined into a single category for meta-analytic purposes. It is likely that patients with protracted symptoms and more severe disease would be most likely to undergo surgical therapy. These differences in baseline disease characteristics would likely lead to an underestimation of the benefit of primary VATS compared with primary chest tube placement.

In contrast, the results of our study favor primary VATS, making it likely that the actual effect of primary VATS is more dramatic than that found in our study. However, this study is generalizable to tertiary care children's hospitals that are not included in the PHIS database. The strength of this multicenter study lies in the inclusion of a racially/ethnically and geographically heterogeneous population. In conclusion, our large retrospective multicenter study demonstrates that, compared with primary chest tube placement, primary VATS is associated with a shorter LOS and with fewer additional procedural interventions. Although these immediate short-term outcomes are important considerations, longitudinal studies of long-term functional outcomes of patients undergoing different initial drainage procedures are necessary to help determine the optimal management strategies.

### Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for retained hemothorax in blunt chest trauma [^b7202871]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Blunt chest trauma accounts for more than 15% of injuries in trauma patients worldwide. Falls and traffic accidents are the most frequent causes of trauma. Patients usually experience a large amount of energy transmitted to the entire chest cavity during the injury. After blunt chest injuries, patients may have chest wall destruction and lung parenchyma injuries. Further severe injury to intrathoracic organs can also be found, such as intrathoracic vascular injury, diaphragm rupture, and esophageal injury. Moreover, all these injuries may cause hemothorax or pneumothorax, the most common complication that can occur immediately after blunt chest trauma.

Appropriate management of blunt chest trauma depends on a patient's vital signs. A tube thoracostomy and emergent thoracotomy are typically performed to control bleeding in patients with hypovolemic shock. When patient vital signs are stabilized, the next step is treating posttraumatic complications. Owing to the advances in endoscopic instruments and technology, minimally invasive surgery is widely applied to manage chest trauma. The purpose of this review is to understand the complications caused by retained hemothorax and the benefits of minimally invasive surgery for patients experiencing blunt chest trauma. What follows is a summary of our current knowledge of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) used in retained hemothorax of blunt chest trauma.

### Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is a safe option for benign lung diseases requiring lobectomy [^18715838]. Surgical Endoscopy (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Lobectomy for benign lung disease is renowned to be technically complex and to be subjected to an increased complication rate. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the results obtained with video-assisted surgery (VATS) in benign disease are comparable to those obtained in oncologic surgery, where VATS has been validated.

Methods

We have reviewed the files of 246 consecutive patients who underwent VATS lobectomy from January 2012 to August 2015. The cohort was divided into two groups according to pathology (benign or malignant). Outcome parameters on scrutiny were demographics, pathology, duration of air leak, drainage and hospital stay, conversion, and perioperative complication rate. Comparisons were made with the χ² test and Student's t test; any p value ≤ 0.05 was considered as significant.

Results

Group 1 (36 patients) included patients who underwent lobectomy for benign disease and group 2 (210 patients) patients affected by lung cancer or pulmonary metastases. The two groups differed with reference to age (p < 0.001), history of cancer (p < 0.001), history of stroke (p = 0.05), and the presence of pleural adhesions (p = 0.03). There was no difference for duration of air leaks, chest tube drainage and hospital stay, conversion rate, and perioperative complication rate.

Conclusions

We conclude that pathology did not impact on outcomes after VATS lobectomy. This study suggests that VATS is as a safe option in selected patients with benign disease requiring lobectomy, despite a more complex technical context.

### The clinical effect of thoracoscopic segmentectomy in the treatment of lung malignancies less than 2CM in diameter [^88a55103]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Procedures for the lobectomy group (video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy)

Patient anesthesia

Before the operation begins, the patient is sent to the operating room, and the anesthesiologist gradually injects general anesthetic drugs into the patient to bring him into a pain-free state of consciousness. Anesthesia monitoring equipment is used to monitor vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration of patients.

Preparation for surgery

The surgeon will make a small incision in the patient's chest, usually right in front of the chest. The size of this incision is usually around 2–4 cm, which is large enough to accommodate the thoracoscope. At the incision, the surgeon inserts a balloon that expands the visible area of the chest to allow for surgery.

Locating the lesion

Once the thoracoscope is inserted, the surgeon uses a mirror to examine the conditions within the chest cavity to locate malignant tumors or other abnormal tissue within the lungs. This step involves viewing through a thoracoscope while manipulating it with specific surgical instruments.

Removal of a lobe

Once the tumor or abnormal tissue is accurately located, the surgeon proceeds to remove the entire affected lobe. Resection usually includes the lobe of the lung where the tumor is located and the tissue adjacent to it. This procedure may require the use of various surgical tools, such as electrosurgery or lasers, to ensure complete removal of the lesion.

Lymph node dissection

If lymph node involvement is suspected in or around the lesion, the surgeon will perform lymph node dissection. This involves carefully removing lymph nodes to determine if any cancer cells have spread to those lymph nodes. The removed lymph nodes are usually sent to a laboratory for pathological examination.

Drainage

After surgery, the surgeon will place a drainage tube to drain fluids, such as blood or lymph, that may have accumulated during or after surgery. A drainage tube is inserted into the chest through another small incision to direct the fluid to an external container to ensure the patient does not develop fluid accumulation and reduce the risk of infection.

### Surgical versus non-surgical management of pleural empyema [^ecb93105]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Pleural empyema is a collection of pus between the lungs and the chest wall. Approximately 50% of cases complicate pneumonia. There are a variety of treatment options ranging from intravenous antibiotics alone to open thoracotomy and debridement, depending in part on the stage of the empyema and the severity. The condition changes with time, becoming loculated and more difficult to drain. There is much debate about the most appropriate therapy particularly with the advent of new treatments such as fibrinolytic enzymes (e.g. streptokinase, urokinase) and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).

Objectives

To determine which is more effective for the management of empyema: surgical (e.g. thoracoscopy, thoracotomy) or non-surgical techniques (e.g. thoracocentesis, chest tube drainage) and to establish whether there is an optimum time for intervention.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and DARE database were searched in addition to the Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group's own register of trials. A specialised topic search with no language restrictions was used to search MEDLINE and EMBASE using Silverplatter. Bibliographies and the reference lists of identified studies and review articles were handsearched. Personal communication with authors and experts in the field is ongoing.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of surgical techniques versus non-surgical approaches for treatment of pus in the pleural cavity in children and adults but not neonates. Studies of empyema associated with tuberculosis or malignancy were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Trial quality was assessed using Jadad criteria as recommended by the ARI group (Jadad 1996). The primary outcomes were death or resolution of the empyema. Secondary outcomes addressed length of time chest tubes were required, pain, hospital stay and any complications.

Main Results

Only one small randomised study was identified which met the inclusion criteria. It was conducted in a university thoracic surgery department. There were some methodological quality considerations which cast some doubt on validity (patient selection, unclear allocation concealment and outcome assessor blinding) and it scored 'B' overall (Jadad score 3). The main results of the study were that when compared with chest tube drainage combined with streptokinase, the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) group had a significantly higher primary treatment success and spent less time in hospital. Each group suffered one mortality.

Reviewer's Conclusions

It would appear that for large, loculated pleural empyemas VATS is superior to chest tube drainage with streptokinase in terms of duration of chest tubes and hospital stay. However there are questions about validity and the study is also too small to draw conclusions. There are risks of complications (associated with all treatments) which may not apparent with small numbers. VATS is performed under general anaesthetic and one lung ventilation. Fibrinolytics are also associated with side effects. Further larger multicentre studies need to be conducted.

### Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is more favorable than thoracotomy for resection of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer [^31b0ac69]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Lobectomy for patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be performed by thoracotomy or by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). We compared the operative characteristics and postoperative course for patients with clinical stage I NSCLC who underwent lobectomy by VATS or thoracotomy.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the charts of all patients undergoing lobectomy for clinical stage I NSCLC from January 1, 1998, through June 30, 2005.

Results

We performed 147 lobectomies (88 thoracotomy, 59 VATS) in 147 patients with clinical stage I NSCLC. Patient demographics were similar between groups; however, VATS patients had more hypertension (p = 0.0114), chronic renal insufficiency (p = 0.0479), and previous malignancies (p = 0.0086). The two groups did not differ in pathologic stage, tumor size, histologic results, or number of positive nodes. More total nodes were identified in thoracotomy patients (p = 0.0001), and they had a shorter intensive care unit stay (p = 0.0224). VATS patients had significantly less postoperative pneumonia (p = 0.0023). VATS patients trended toward fewer chest tube days and a shorter hospital length of stay. The two groups did not differ in operative time, blood loss, atrial fibrillation, or number of ventilator days. Median survival between the cohorts was similar (> 7.9 years thoracotomy versus > 4.6 years VATS, log-rank p = 0.6939).

Conclusions

Patients undergoing VATS lobectomy for clinical stage I NSCLC, despite having more comorbidities, had fewer postoperative complications. The approaches are equivalent in operative time, blood loss, length of stay, and survival rate. Compared with thoracotomy, VATS lobectomy for patients with clinical stage I NSCLC appears to be a less morbid operation.

### Clinical study on the role of modified chest drainage tube in enhanced recovery after uniportal VATS radical surgery for lung cancer [^bc072be1]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study evaluates the impact of a modified chest drainage tube on postoperative recovery and its clinical application value by comparing the drainage efficacy of the modified tube with conventional chest drainage tubes after uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for lung cancer.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of clinical data from 100 patients who underwent uniportal VATS radical surgery for lung cancer in the department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at our hospital between January 2023 and January 2024 was conducted. Of these, 50 patients received the modified chest drainage tube postoperatively (experimental group), while 50 patients received the conventional chest drainage tube (control group). Postoperative outcomes, including thoracic drainage volume, duration of chest tube placement, length of hospital stay, wound healing, pain levels, and tube reinsertion rates, were compared between the two groups.

Results

The experimental group demonstrated significantly improved outcomes in terms of chest tube placement duration, length of hospital stay, wound healing, and pain levels compared to the control group, with statistically significant differences (P < 0.05). However, no statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding postoperative thoracic drainage volume and tube reinsertion rates (P > 0.05).

Conclusion

The modified chest drainage tube used after uniportal VATS radical surgery for lung cancer exhibits safety and efficacy, facilitates rapid recovery, and demonstrates potential clinical value.

### Image-guided navigation and video-assisted thoracoscopic spine surgery: the second generation [^05d6fbc2]. Neurosurgical Focus (2014). Low credibility.

Object

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has evolved for treatment of a variety of spinal disorders. Early incorporation with image-guided surgery (IGS) was challenged due to reproducibility and adaptability, limiting the procedure's acceptance. In the present study, the authors report their experience with second-generation IGS and VATS technologies for anterior thoracic minimally invasive spinal (MIS) procedures.

Methods

The surgical procedure is described in detail including operating room set-up, patient positioning (a lateral decubitus position), placement of the spinal reference frame and portal, radiographic localization, registration, surgical instruments, and the image-guided thoracoscopic discectomy.

Results

Combined IGS and VATS procedures were successfully performed and assisted in anatomical localization in 14 patients. The mean patient age was 59 years (range 32–73 years). Disc herniation pathology represented the most common indication for surgery (n = 8 patients); intrathoracic spinal tumors were present in 4 patients and the remaining patients had infection and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. All patients required chest tube drainage postoperatively, and all but 1 patient had drainage discontinued the following day. The only complication was a seroma that was presumed to be due to steroid therapy for postoperative weakness. At the final follow-up, 11 of the patients were improved neurologically, 2 patients had baseline neurological status, and the 1 patient with postoperative weakness was able to ambulate, albeit with an assistive device. The evolution of thoracoscopic surgical procedures occurring over 20 years is presented, including their limitations. The combination of VATS and IGS technologies is discussed including their safety and the importance of 3D imaging. In cases of large open thoracotomy procedures, surgeries require difficult, extensive, and invasive access through the chest cavity; using a MIS procedure can potentially eliminate many of the complications and morbidities associated with large open procedures. The authors report their experience with thoracic spinal surgeries that involved MIS procedures and the new technologies.

Conclusions

The most significant advance in IGS procedures has resulted from intraoperative CT scanning and automatic registration with the IGS workstation. Image guidance can be used in conjunction with VATS techniques for thoracic discectomy, spinal tumors, infection, and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament. The authors' initial experience has revealed this technique to be useful and potentially applicable to other MIS procedures.

### Video-assisted thoracic surgery for pleural empyema [^234749b4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Background

After we gained considerable experience with video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and became familiar with its advantages, we started to use it for the treatment of thoracic empyema.

Methods

We treated 130 patients with pleural empyema in whom chest tube drainage and antibiotic therapy had failed to produce a satisfactory result. Six months after surgery they had clinical and radiologic assessment and spirometry.

Results

Video-assisted surgery was performed in all patients. Mean operative time was 93 minutes (range, from 55 to 180 minutes), mean duration of postoperative chest tube drainage was 10 days (range, from 5 to 32 days), and mean hospital stay was 16 days (range, from 3 to 56 days). The rate of conversion to open thoracotomy was 3.1%. Complications for which reoperation was necessary occurred in 9% of patients. At follow-up after six months, the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second was 87.7% (range, from 69.5% to 105.9%), the mean postoperative vital capacity was 84.4%, (range, from 59.9% to 97.9%). There were no postoperative or procedure-related deaths.

Conclusions

Video-assisted thoracic surgery is a safe and effective treatment option for fibropurulent empyema with low morbidity and mortality. Conversion to thoracotomy should be used if necessary to remove all of the fibropurulent material and achieve complete expansion of the lung to insure a good outcome.

### Early water seal of chest tubes following video-assisted thoracic surgery pleurodesis [^222bd655]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early water seal following minimally invasive pulmonary lobectomy has been shown to reduce chest tube duration and postoperative length of stay (LOS). We evaluated chest tube duration and postoperative LOS following a standardized chest tube management protocol change (water seal on postoperative day 1) after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) pleurodesis.

Methods

We identified adult patients undergoing VATS pleurodesis from August 2013 to December 2021. The chest tube protocol was changed in January 2017 such that patients were placed to water seal on the morning of postoperative day 1. Patients were divided into two groups, before the change (Group 1: August 2013-December 2016) and after (Group 2: January 2017-December 2021). We compared demographics, clinical characteristics, operative details, postoperative chest tube duration and output, and postoperative LOS between the groups. Descriptive statistics and log-transformed multivariable linear regression models were used to identify differences in patient outcomes that were associated with the protocol change.

Results

A total of 488 patients underwent VATS pleurodesis during the study period (Group 1: 329 patients; Group 2: 159 patients). The median age was 61 y (interquartile range [IQR] 49–68), 51% were females, 69% were White, and 29% were Black. For postoperative LOS, Group 1 had an IQR of 3–7 d, while Group 2 had an IQR of 2–6 d (P < 0.001). The multivariable log-transformed linear regression models demonstrated that the practice change was associated with reduced chest tube duration (0.77 times the chest tube duration before the change; P < 0.001) and reduced LOS (0.81 times the LOS before the change; P = 0.006). There was an associated reduction in patients needing to return to the operating room (P = 0.048) and needing postoperative extended ventilatory support (P = 0.035).

Conclusions

Development of a standardized protocol to water seal chest tubes on postoperative day 1 following VATS pleurodesis is associated with reduced chest tube duration and LOS without an increase in postoperative complication rates.

### Videothoracoscopic surgical approach for spontaneous pneumothorax: review of the pertinent literature [^ef361a29]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

With advances in videothoracoscopic equipment, most operations for spontaneous pneumothorax are usually performed with a minimally invasive technique that involves video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Additionally, VATS has the advantage that inspection of the pleura and lung is more complete than when carried out through limited thoracotomy. This VATS procedure is generally done in the full lateral decubitus position under general anesthesia. Many researchers have reported a variety of techniques for the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax via VATS. In this report we review the literature on the VATS approach for spontaneous pneumothorax.

### Development of a video-assisted thoracoscopic lobectomy program in a single institution: results before and after completion of the learning curve [^b89a69af]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Our policy for chest tube removal (no air leak; < 200 ml/24 h) is quite common. The incidence of prolonged air leak is low, about 3%, and so does not influence the mean hospital stay. However our chest drain duration and hospitalization is longer than another VATS-L series both, during learning curve and after its completion. These data reflect more the presence of different cultural backgrounds in our surgical team than a careful chest tube management policy. Our team is heterogeneous and consists of surgeons who have embraced the "minimally invasive philosophy" and other "traditional" surgeons for which is not possible and unthinkable an early chest tube removal and patients discharge before the fourth post-operative day.

Data from literature showed conversion rates to thoracotomic lobectomy in a range between 2 and 10–12%. Causes of conversion are various and reported as technical problems (e.g. poor visualization, instrumentation malfunction), anatomical problems (calcified peri-arterial lymph nodes, absent fissure, adhesions), intra-operative complications (massive bleeding from vascular injury) and oncological situation (invasion of chest wall, invasion of vascular structures, intra-operative unexpected N2 status, centrally located tumor, sleeve resection). Some of these factors are absolutely random and stochastic and surgeon can only prevent these problems with an accurate pre-operative study including patients' characteristics, radiological and endoscopic findings that could anticipate intra-operative critical technical aspects. A relative contraindication to VMPRs is considered the presence of hilar and perivascular calcification, since it may lead to a technical demanding vascular dissection with an increased risk of major bleedings; we faced this condition in 1.1% of cases in Group B. In a large recent series Villamizar et al. reported an overall conversion rate of 4% (36/916), caused in 21 patients (2%) by an intra-operative bleeding; they also found a significant relation with the presence of positive lymph node stations (n = 11 conversions in 153 clinical N+ patients/7.2% vs n = 25 in 763 clinical N0 patients/3.3%). In our series, in Group A we observed three conversions (6%) due to "bleeding not safely manageable by VATS"; in our opinion this datum reflects a low experience in bleeding management by VATS and is influenced also by an attitude to an immediate conversion rather than an attempt of repair (quite normal during the LC period). However, our series demonstrated that an emergency conversion is not a frequent event (1/146, 0.7%), even in the early LC (1/50, 2%). Actually, we consider the wrong transection of the main pulmonary artery, performed during a left upper lobe lobectomy, as the worst complication of the whole series. Obviously, with the increased proficiency, we believe it is ethically correct to propose VMPRs even in patients with co-morbid disease (e.g. low pulmonary reserve), previously treated with neo-adjuvant chemotherapy or with surgically treatable advanced disease (T3 or T4). In our experience we started to "extend" indications after the conclusion of the LC, when the acquired skills and results made us more confident in our technical skills: in Group B we performed 6.3% of VMPRs after induction chemotherapy and we pushed the indications beyond the limit of a standard lobectomy (pneumonectomy 1.1%, bilobectomy 1.1%, chest wall resection 1.1%), without increasing procedure-related complications or decreasing oncological adequacy.

### Does morbid obesity influence perioperative outcomes after video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy for non-small cell lung cancer? Analysis of the Italian VATS group registry [^6c72edeb]. Surgical Endoscopy (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Obesity in Europe, and worldwide, has been an increasing epidemic during the past decades. Moreover, obesity has important implications regarding technical issues and the risks associated with surgical interventions. Nevertheless, there is a lack of evidence assessing the influence of obesity on video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy results. Our study aimed to assess the impact of morbid obesity on perioperative clinical and oncological outcomes after VATS lobectomy using a prospectively maintained nationwide registry.

Methods

The Italian VATS lobectomy Registry was used to collect all consecutive cases from 55 Institutions. Explored outcome parameters were conversion to thoracotomy rates, complication rates, intra-operative blood loss, surgical time, hospital postoperative length of stay, chest tube duration, number of harvested lymph-node, and surgical margin positivity.

Results

From 2016 to 2019, a total of 4412 patients were collected. 74 patients present morbid obesity (1.7%). Multivariable-adjusted analysis showed that morbid obesity was associated with a higher rate of complications (32.8% vs 20.3%), but it was not associated with a higher rate of conversion, and surgical margin positivity rates. Moreover, morbid obesity patients benefit from an equivalent surgical time, lymph-node retrieval, intraoperative blood loss, hospital postoperative length of stay, and chest tube duration than non-morbid obese patients. The most frequent postoperative complications in morbidly obese patients were pulmonary-related (35%).

Conclusion

Our results showed that VATS lobectomy could be safely and satisfactorily conducted even in morbidly obese patients, without an increase in conversion rate, blood loss, surgical time, hospital postoperative length of stay, and chest tube duration. Moreover, short-term oncological outcomes were preserved.

### Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery following neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally-advanced lung cancer [^bbc7ba80]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

U-VATS is a newly developed technology based on VATS. Since Rocco et al first reported the use of lung wedge resection via U-VATS, the indications of U-VATS in diagnosis and treatment of lung disease have been extended. Very recently, Gonzalez-Rivas et al used U-VATS to complete various complex and highly difficult procedures, including segmentectomy, bronchial sleeve lobectomy and double-sleeve (vascular and bronchial) lobectomy. Furthermore, Gonzalez-Rivas et al and Fan et al confirmed the safety and feasibility of U-VATS for advanced NSCLC patients. However, the use of U-VATS in treating advanced NSCLC following neoadjuvant chemotherapy, is still a challenge for most thoracic surgeons.

The mean operation time was 160 ± 38.5 min, the operative blood loss was 167.8 ± 78.4 mL and the number of lymph nodes dissected was 21.9 ± 3.7, which are all consistent with those reported by previously published studies. However, the mean postoperative drainage time (5.6 ± 1.9 d) and postoperative hospital stay (7.7 ± 1.9 d) were longer than those reported by previously published studies. The cause of the longer times may be related to the standard for removing the chest tube. In our current study, the chest tube was removed when the drainage was less than 100 ml/24 h. However, Zhang et al compared the safety and feasibility of early chest tube removal (removal of chest tube when drainage is less than 300 ml/24 h) to the traditional management method (The chest tube was removed when the drainage is less than 100 ml/24 h), and they confirmed that early removal of the chest tube after lobectomy is feasible and safe. Additionally, the early removal of the chest tube could lead to a shorter hospital stay and reduce morbidity without increasing the risk of complications. Hence, we hypothesized that the traditional standard for chest tube removal may have contributed to the longer postoperative drainage time and hospital stay.

### Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery left upper lobectomy in 9 steps [^2ef4bee6]. JTCVS Techniques (2021). Medium credibility.

A specimen bag was inserted into the pleural cavity, with the tip pointing away from the hilum to avoid injuring it.
9 Chest tube placement and wound closure (Video 9)

The pleural space was irrigated with warm, sterile water, and air leak testing was conducted under water. Meticulous hemostasis was achieved, and a 28Fr chest tube was inserted via the uniport and anchored at the anterior side of the incision, where the intercostal space is usually wider. The wound was then closed in layers around the chest tube.

### 16F vs 24F chest drain after minimally invasive lobectomy and / or… [^4d34670e]. ClinicalTrials (2025). Medium credibility.

16F vs 24F Chest Drain After Minimally Invasive Lobectomy and/or SegmentectomyClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and surgical resection remains the treatment of choice for patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer, particularly in early stages of the disease. Anatomical lung resections such as lobectomy and segmentectomy are commonly performed, increasingly through minimally invasive techniques like video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and robotic-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Compared to traditional thoracotomy, VATS and RATS has been associated with better postoperative outcomes, including less pain, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery, and improved quality of life.

After lung resections, the standard postoperative management involves the insertion of a chest drain to remove air and fluid from the pleural space and monitor for complications such as air leaks or bleeding. Traditionally, most thoracic surgery centres use a single large-bore chest tube, typically 24F in size, which remains in place at least until the first postoperative day. However, this practice is not based on strong evidence, and there is currently no consensus on the optimal size of the chest drain. In fact, removal of the chest tube has been shown to significantly improve ventilatory function and reduce pain, particularly in the early postoperative period. The Chest Drain 16F vs 24F Study investigates whether the use of a smaller-bore chest drain leads to less postoperative pain compared to the standard large-bore 24F drain in patients undergoing minimally invasive pulmonary lobectomy and/or segmentectomy.

In addition to comparing the tube sizes, the trial explores the safety and feasibility of early chest drain removal, defined as removal within 2 to 6 hours after surgery, provided that specific clinical criteria are met.
- Minimally invasive anatomical lung resections under general anaesthesia: lobectomy, lobectomy with wedge resection, lobectomy combined with segmentectomy, segmentectomy with wedge resection, bilobectomy Exclusion Criteria:

- Patients with neuralgia
- Chest pain without taking painkillers, measured by VAS while coughing > 10 mm
- Rib fractures on the side of surgical procedure
- Open anatomical lung resection, including pneumonectomy
- Insertion of 2 or more chest tubes.

### Technical tricks to facilitate totally endoscopic major pulmonary resections [^b43aa932]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Lobectomies using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) are becoming more and more accepted since several recent studies have demonstrated their safety and efficacy for stage I lung cancer. However, "video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy" usually means that a utility incision or a mini-thoracotomy is used for insertion of conventional instruments. We use a totally endoscopic approach in which only endoscopic instruments and video display are used. On the basis of our preliminary experience of 81 cases with this approach, we present some technical details that are important for a successful endoscopic procedure.

### Lobectomy by video-assisted thoracic surgery vs muscle-sparing thoracotomy for stage I lung cancer: a critical evaluation of short-and long-term outcomes [^1165e29a]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Propensity-matched studies have shown lobectomy by VATS to be superior to thoracotomy. However, these studies do not control for institution or surgeon expertise and do not compare VATS strictly with muscle-sparing thoracotomy (MST).

Study Design

From a single surgeon experienced in both VATS and MST, patients undergoing lobectomy for clinical stage I non-small cell cancer were evaluated. Video-assisted thoracic surgery was chosen if the patient requested this approach, otherwise MST was used. Short-term and long-term outcomes were compared.

Results

From 2007 to 2012, two hundred and ninety-eight patients were evaluated, 74 (25%) VATS and 224 (75%) MST. There were no statistically significant differences in demographics, chest tube days, and postoperative complications between the 2 surgical groups. Operative time was longer for VATS (median 130 minutes for VATS vs 90 minutes for MST; p < 0.001). Hospital length of stay was longer for MST (median 4.5 days for VATS vs 5 days for MST; p = 0.007). There was no difference in disease-free survival (5-year: 76% for VATS vs 78% for MST; p = 0.446) and overall survival (5-year: 80% for VATS vs 79% for MST; p = 0.840) for clinical stage I disease. Results were unchanged using propensity score matching of 60 VATS and 60 MST patients for postoperative complications, disease-free survival, and overall survival between the 2 matched groups.

Conclusions

Our current comparison of VATS vs MST, from a single surgeon experienced with both approaches, found operative time (favoring MST) and hospital days (favoring VATS) to be the only difference between the 2 groups; and major outcomes, such as postoperative complications, disease-free survival, and overall survival, were not different. A multi-institution randomized trial should be considered before deeming any one approach to be superior.

### One-port (uniportal) video-assisted thoracic surgical resections – a clear advance [^646d4581]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

One-port (uniportal) video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) consists of approaching an intrathoracic target lesion through a sagittal, craniocaudal plane through 1 single-port incision. The use of articulating instruments inserted parallel to the videothoracoscope enables the surgeon to mimic inside the chest the maneuvers that are usually performed during open surgery. Through this VATS approach, several thoracic conditions can be addressed, including lung cancer in selected patients. Unlike conventional, 3-port VATS, the uniportal VATS technique enables the surgeon to bring the operative fulcrum inside the chest when the target lunge lesion is approached through a sagittal plan, thanks to articulating instruments. Uniportal wedge VATS resections of peripheral nodules can help in solving diagnostic dilemmas, be of therapeutic benefit, and provide tissue for biomolecular studies.

### Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery without drainage-tube placement for pulmonary wedge resection: a single-center retrospective study [^da4a8ced]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery without drainage-tube placement has been demonstrated to be safe and feasible for select situations. The purpose of this study is to assess the demographic, baseline, and intraoperative characteristics of patients who developed residual pneumothorax after thoracic surgery without drainage-tube placement.

Methods

We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent pulmonary wedge resection via uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery without drainage-tube placement between May 2019 and May 2022. The decision to omit chest-tube drainage was originally made on a case-by-case basis, using internal criteria. Postoperative chest radiography was performed on the day of surgery, on postoperative day 1, at the first outpatient visit, and at 1 month after surgery.

Results

A total of 134 patients met the selection criteria; 23 (17.2%) had residual pneumothorax on chest radiography on postoperative day 1, and 5 (3.7%) had residual pneumothorax at the first outpatient visit. Only 1 patient (0.7%) had residual pneumothorax on chest radiography at 1 month after surgery; this patient did not require chest-tube insertion or any other intervention. The presence of partial pleural adhesions independently increased the risk for postoperative residual pneumothorax on chest radiography, whereas older patient age reduced the risk.

Conclusions

Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for pulmonary wedge resection without drainage-tube placement is both safe and feasible for carefully selected patients. Most patients with residual pneumothorax in our study experienced spontaneous resolution, and none required reintervention.

### Video-assisted thoracic surgical treatment of initial spontaneous pneumothorax in young patients [^99b3b0fe]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

The treatment of primary spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults has been controversial. Conventional treatment consisting of chest tube thoracostomy may be associated with morbidity at the time of tube insertion, prolonged hospitalization, and interval operation in many patients. As spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults is usually associated with apical blebs, we hypothesized that video-assisted thoracic surgical (VATS) resection of the blebs at the time of the first pneumothorax may be an effective treatment associated with low morbidity and short hospital stays.

Methods

From July 1992 to February 2001, 156 young adults were treated for spontaneous pneumothorax. Within 12 hours of presentation to the emergency department patients underwent semielective VATS with bleb resection and pleuradesis. During follow-up patients were observed for recurrent pneumothorax.

Results

There were 69 men (44%) and 87 women (56%). The median age was 19 years old (range 14 to 38 years old). Patients were predominantly tall and thin. Patients were mildly symptomatic at the time of presentation. Apical blebs were seen in all patients and the presence of blebs was confirmed in the pathologic specimen. In 23 patients bleeding was associated with bleb rupture. There were no postoperative air leaks. The mean hospital stay was 2.4 ± 0.5 days. Follow-up ranged from 2 to 96 months (median 62 months). There were no recurrences on the index side.

Conclusions

VATS resection of apical blebs is associated with low morbidity and short hospitalization and provides an attractive alternative to the conventional treatment of initial tube thoracostomy and possible interval repeat thoracostomy or operation. VATS may be an effective first line treatment for spontaneous pneumothorax in young adults. Due to the pathophysiology of this disease, patients should be closely followed for the occurrence of pneumothorax on the contralateral side.

### Uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic anatomical resection of the right anterior pulmonary segment in a 10-year-old child with congenital pulmonary airway malformation [^5cb15264]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM), previously known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM), is a very rare developmental anomaly of the lower respiratory tract. Its presentation is variable, although diagnosis during second trimester is customary, based on routine prenatal ultrasound examination. Most neonates with prenatally determined CPAMs are asymptomatic at birth; although they may later develop symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, or fever) or related conditions (pneumothorax, pneumonia, recurrent pulmonary infections, or malignancy).

At present, there are controversies about the optimal timing and extent of the resection in patients with asymptomatic CPAM. When performing surgery on these patients, the lesions were resected early, within the first six months of life. There are advantages to surgical resection in these patients, as infection rates increase over time, making the operation more difficult and eliminating the risk of malignant transformation. Congenital lung anomalies typically have been resected via open thoracotomy. However, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has grown in popularity, helping to shorten hospitalization stays and durations of chest tube placement. On the other hand, the thoracotomy group had shorter operative time than VATS. Modifications of conventional VATS approach, particularly use of fewer access ports and avoidance of postoperative chest-tube drainage, have also reduced the stress of pulmonary resection. Still, the extent of surgery is currently under debate, deciding if full lobectomy is required, or whether segmental resection (to preserve lung tissue) will suffice. Herein, we describe a 10-year-old child undergoing uniportal (single-port) VATS S3 anterior segmentectomy, without drainage tube placement, for asymptomatic CPAM.

Effects of the ERAS program on postoperative complications of patients

No case of 30-day mortality occurred in the ERAS group and control group. The ERAS group had no patient requiring a readmission. The control group had 1 patient (1.6%) requiring a readmission to redo VATS. There were 2 cases of pneumonia, 1 cases of air leak > 7 days, 1 case of atrial fibrillation, 1 cases of urinary retention, and 1 cases of pneumothorax in the ERAS group, with a postoperative morbidity of 10.0%. There were 5 cases of pneumonia, 3 cases of air leak > 7 days, 2 cases of atelectasis, 2 case of atrial fibrillation, 2 cases of urinary retention, 1 case of chylothorax, and 1 cases of pneumothorax in the control group, with a postoperative morbidity of 26.7%. The rates overall postoperative morbidity and minor complications were notably lower in the ERAS group than in the control group (Table 5, p = 0.018 and p = 0.024). These data suggest that the implementation of the ERAS program could prevent the incidence of postoperative complications for patients undergoing VATS.

Effects of the ERAS program on postoperative complications of patients

Effects of the ERAS program on LOS of patients undergoing VATS

The median LOS of patients undergoing VATS was 3 d (range: 2–5 d) in the ERAS group and 5 days (range: 4–6 d) in the control group. The patients in the ERAS group had a shorter LOS than those in the control group (p < 0.0001). These data suggest that the implementation of the ERAS program could shorten the LOS of patients undergoing VATS.

### Surgery for lung cancer: postoperative changes and complications-what the radiologist needs to know [^2c8724cc]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Role of minimally invasive resections

Although most of lung resections involve open surgery techniques (posterolateral thoracotomy, anterolateral thoracotomy, rarely median sternotomy), minimally invasive techniques (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery) have recently emerged as an alternative for selected patients.

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is a safe and less morbid alternative to open resection, but doubt remains about its oncological equivalence. When compared to thoracotomy, it is associated with a lower incidence of post-operative complications, a shorter hospital stay, shorter duration of chest tube drainage and comparable or lower rates of post-operative mortality.

Robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery has the theoretical advantages of three-dimensional visualisation and increased rotational capabilities compared to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. There are no differences in short-term outcomes between these two minimally invasive techniques. Improvements in immediate outcomes, such as length of stay, bleeding, duration of chest tube drainage and perioperative mortality were demonstrated when robot-assisted thoracoscopic surgery was compared to open resection. However, the increased associated costs represent a significant deterrent of this technique.

### Randomized controlled trial of an alternative drainage strategy vs routine chest tube insertion for postoperative pain after thoracoscopic wedge resection [^cfe415d8]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Thoracotomy has been reported to cause trauma and severe pain, while surgical trauma has been considerably reduced due to the development of VATS. Moreover, with the popularization of ERAS, more precise management is required for the perioperative period. In addition to minimally invasive surgery and multi-modal analgesia, optimizing the management of various tubes, or even abolishing urethral catheters, postoperative drainage tubes in certain types of surgery could be of great value in promoting rapid recovery after surgery.

The population baseline of the two groups were balanced and same was for surgical procedure, while the postoperative NRS score and hospital stay were decreased in the VC group. This is mainly due to the fact that patients in the alternative drainage group received a 7-Fr central VC, which is small in diameter, greatly reduces the discomfort associated with chest tube. Patients in the VC group undergoing lung wedge resection could even get out of bed on the day of the operation. On the other hand, the VC group patients did not need to carry a chest drainage bottle after surgery, promoting early postoperative activity, which in turn was beneficial for wound healing. In terms of length of stay, chest intubation and pain caused by the CT may have been one of the factors resulting in a prolonged hospital stay in the CT group, together with pneumothorax, pleural effusion, subcutaneous emphysema and other complications. In addition, one patient in the CT group was hospitalized for more than 13 days, and another six patients in the CT group experienced poor wound healing, which may be part of the reason for the significant difference in hospital stay.

This leads to effective mass effect on intrathoracic structures, such as the lung itself; mediastinal structures, such as the venae cavae; and cardiac chambers, resulting in hemodynamic compromise from restricted venous return and cardiac output. This is a medical emergency and should initially be managed with immediate needle thoracentesis to decompress trapped and expanding pleural air before the placement of a formal chest tube. A Cochrane review from 201710 compared the surgical option of video-assisted thoracic surgery with chest tube drainage of pleural empyema and found no difference in mortality or complications between the groups, but early VATS reduced the hospital length of stay.

Given the effectiveness of treating early-phase empyema with a chest tube and intrapleural use of t-PA and DNase, as well as the use of VATS to reduce length of hospital stay, the authors developed a multidisciplinary protocol with general thoracic surgery and interventional pulmonary medicine for the algorithmic care of patients presenting with empyema, starting with a small-bore chest tube placement followed by intrapleural use of t-PA and DNase. If this initial step is unsuccessful, the next stage of the pathway is thoracic surgical consultation for VATS decortication. The 3 ways to insert a chest tube are dissective, Seldinger, and the trocar technique, again often ultrasonography guided. 13, 14, 19, 20 Ultrasonography can be an invaluable tool to safely identify internal landmarks for chest tube placement.

Figure 3 presents a representative sonographic image demonstrating the target abnormal collection of pleural fluid, in the right chest, for chest tube drainage, and adjacent structures of atelectatic lung, diaphragm and liver. For dissective insertion, a 1- to 2-cm incision is made overlying the rib of choice, a Schnidt tonsil clamp is used to bluntly dissect through the subcutaneous tissue, the 3 muscular layers of the intercostal space, transthoracic fascia, and the parietal pleural until the clamp enters the pleural cavity. After successful spreading into the pleura space, a finger is used to confirm entry into the pleural space and the presence of adhesions.

### The efficacy and safety of uniportal video-assisted thoracic surgery on the treatment for stage II-III tuberculous empyema: a single-arm clinical retrospective study from 2016 to 2021 in a thoracic surgery center in China [^5798148c]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most important causes of pleural infection worldwide, especially in TB endemic areas. Tuberculous empyema(TE) is a chronic active pleural mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)infection with neutrophil infiltration and purulent effusion, culminating in extensive pleural thickening and calcification, which could have a lasting influence on lung function. Treatment on TE has still been challenging due to its clinical complexity, which often requires multidisciplinary collaboration, including thoracic surgery.

During the fibrin purulent stage (stage II), fibrin deposition may lead to thoracic dissection and fluid separation, further limiting lung expansion. Therefore, a simple closed thoracic drainage may not be sufficient, making local infection difficult to be controlled. Without aggressive intervention, empyema could progress to the tissue package stage (stage III), the stage is characterized by significant pleural thickening resulting from collagen fiber deposition, which further limits the movement of the lungs, chest wall and diaphragm. On the other hand, the inadequate permeability of anti-tuberculous drugs into the thick fibrous calcified wall of empyema may further result in poor treatment efficacy. The goals of surgical interventions include controlling the source of infection through complete pleural debridement and lung re-expansion. Current guidelines from the American Association of Thoracic Surgeons and the British Society of Thoracic Surgeons recommended that video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) or thoracotomy should be the first-line treatment for empyema if chest tube drainage fails. Traditionally, open thoracotomy (removal of thickened viscera and parietal pleura) was once the choice of intervention, especially for cases in tissue stage (stage III) TE. Despite the high success rate of surgical interventions, mortality from thoracotomy surgery is also concerned, especially in the elderly and patients with complications. Minimally invasive surgeries are developing in recent years, which had been proven to be safe and effective in the adjuvant treatment for TE. VATS provides a minimally invasive approach with one to three lateral openings, requiring fewer hospital stays and complications than thoracotomy. Recent data had demonstrated the positive effects of VATS decortication on TE. If necessary, the surgeon can immediately switch to open thoracotomy to achieve the same goal. Uniportal-VATS(Uni-VATS)has been considered to be the least invasive thoracic surgical procedure, prompting its worldwide adoption. The application of the Uni-VATS for the treatment of pleural infection has not been well identified, but it could be useful to minimize surgical trauma. Recent literature suggests that early and aggressive minimally invasive approaches to stage II empyema can rapidly relieve infection and ensure lower morbidity, shorter hospital stay and lower costs. However, VATS in advanced tissue stage(stage III)empyema still remains controversial. In the present study, we retrospectively enrolled the patients with TE at stage II-III receiving Uni-VATS during the recent five years, and evaluated the efficacy and safety of the surgery, thus try to provide guidance for optimal surgical treatment for TE patients in high TB burden areas.

### Effectiveness of single chest tube vs double chest tube application postdecortication: prospective randomized controlled study [^93bccf7a]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Statement of the problem

A review of the recent literature on treatment modalities of adult thoracic empyema was conducted to expose the controversies and verify where consensus exists. The roles of surgical drainage, lavage techniques, and debridement via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, decortication, thoracoplasty, and open window thoracostomy were considered using the Oxford Center of Evidence Based Medicine criteria. The lack of a single ideal treatment modality or policy reflects the complexity of the diagnosis and staging of this heterogeneous disease. The basic elements of intervention — drainage, different evacuation techniques, decortication, thoracoplasty, and open window thoracostomy — are well established technical modalities; however, neither a universally acceptable primary modality nor the gold standard of their sequence is available.

Additionally, there is no established standard of practice guideline, as provided by research and meta-analysis or expert opinion, for the use of single chest tube vs double chest tube insertion after decortication. Thoracic centers in Ethiopia employed either single or double chest tubes based on the surgeon's preference and sometimes on the intraoperative findings or the success of the decortication.

As a result of the lack of a guideline or consensus agreement on the use of chest tubes after decortication, there is a knowledge gap in the understanding of the effectiveness of draining the chest using either single or double chest tubes after decortication. Hence, this research was conducted to address such gap and set a platform for further large-scale study that would influence recommendations on standard of practice using chest tube drainage to facilitate adequate re-expansion of the lung and improve postoperative complication after decortication.

No bubbling is seen and the air-leak check is negative. The fluid is then removed. A 24-Fr chest tube can be placed through the inferior incision to the right thoracic apex running anterior to the hilum or a new chest tube insertion site can be made as seen in the video for Step 1. Although the air-leak check is negative in this procedure, if it were positive, sutures could be placed to reinforce closure and a second stump check would be performed.

### Thoracoscopic ipsilateral approach to contralateral bullous lesion in patients with bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax [^b4d76540]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has gained a prominent role in routine thoracic surgical practice. This study describes a novel ipsilateral approach to a contralateral bullous lesion using VATS to achieve simultaneous bilateral bleb excision and pleurodesis.

Methods

From 2001 to 2003, 6 patients underwent our ipsilateral approach with VATS for bilateral pneumothorax. The clinical features, surgical indications, and patient outcomes were reviewed.

Results

All the patients were men between 18 and 35 years old (mean age, 25.8 years). The ipsilateral-approach VATS procedure for bilateral pneumothorax was performed successfully in 4 patients. Two patients were switched to a one-stage sequential bilateral VATS procedure. The bullous lesions were at the apex or confined to the upper lobe in 5 patients; multiple lobes were involved in 1 patient. The bullae were resected with an Endo-GIA stapler or ligated with a homemade endoloop. The mean duration of operation was 54.8 minutes. The mean time of chest tube removal was 4.7 days after insertion, and the mean postoperative stay was 5.7 days. There was no recurrence of pneumothorax during the follow-up period.

Conclusions

The thoracoscopic ipsilateral approach is technically feasible for treating patients with bilateral pneumothorax.

### Comparison between electronic and traditional chest drainage systems: a multicenter randomized study [^d69f8d00]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Air leak is the major factor that influences the permanence of the chest tube and the in-hospital length of stay (LOS) among patients undergoing lung resections. The aim of this study was to determine whether the use of digital chest drain systems, compared with traditional ones, reduced the duration of chest drainage and postoperative in-hospital LOS in patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) lobectomy.

Methods

The study was a prospective, randomized, multicenter trial. Patients undergoing VATS lobectomy were randomized in 2 groups, receiving a digital drain system or a traditional one and managed accordingly to the protocol.

Results

Among 503 patients who fulfilled inclusion criteria and were randomized, 38 dropped out after randomization. Finally, 465 patients were analyzed, of whom 204 used the digital device and 261 the traditional one. In the digital group, there was a significantly shorter median chest tube duration of 3 postoperative days (interquartile range [IQR], 2–4 days) vs 4 postoperative days (IQR, 3–4 days; P = 0.001) and postoperative in-hospital LOS of 4 days (IQR, 3–6 days) vs 5 days (IQR, 4–6 days; P = 0.035). Analysis of predictors for increased duration of air leaks showed a relationship with male sex (P = 0.039), forced expiratory volume in 1 second percentage (P = 0.004), forced vital capacity percentage (P = 0.03), and presence of air leaks at the end of surgery (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

In patients undergoing VATS lobectomy, the use of a digital drainage system allows an earlier removal of the chest drain compared with the traditional system, leading to a shorter in-hospital LOS.

### Effect of lidocaine cream analgesia for chest drain tube removal after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for lung cancer: a randomized clinical trial [^8538a294]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Pain management makes an important contribution to good respiratory care and early recovery after thoracic surgery. Although the development of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has led to improved patient outcomes, chest tube removal could be distressful experience for many patients. The aim of this trial was to test whether the addition of lidocaine cream would have a signiﬁcant impact on the pain treatment during chest tube removal from patients who had undergone VATS for lung cancer.

Methods

This clinical trial was a double-blind randomized study. Forty patients with histologically confirmed lung cancer amenable to lobectomy/segmentectomy were enrolled. All patients had standard perioperative care. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either epidural anesthesia plus placebo cream (placebo, Group P) or epidural anesthesia plus 7% lidocaine cream cutaneously around the chest tube insertion site and on the skin over the tube's course 20 min (Group L) before chest drain removal.

Results

Visual analog scale (VAS) scores were higher in Group P (median 5, IQR, 3.25–8) than in Group L (median 2, IQR, 1–3). Pain intensities measured using a PainVision system were also higher in Group P (median 296.7, IQR, 216.9–563.5) than Group L (median 41.2, IQR, 11.8–97.0). VAS scores and the pain intensity associated with chest drain removal were significantly lower in Group L than Group P (p = 0.0002 vs p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

Analgesia using lidocaine cream is a very simple way to reduce the pain of chest tube removal after VATS.

### Therapeutic evaluation of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery versus open thoracotomy for pediatric pulmonary hydatid disease [^3020017a]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization published an excellent overview of treatment guidelines for echinococcal disease in 1996, which stated that immediate surgery may be required in patients with impending cyst rupture, compromised vital organs, hemoptysis, infected cysts, infection due to obstruction and unmanageable pain. In recent years, with the rapid development of VATS, traditional thoracotomy has been gradually replaced by VATS as the primary surgical technique employed to treat this disease. VATS, a minimally invasive surgical approach, is characterized by less trauma, a quick recovery period and few complications, resulting in the popularity of using this method to treat lung disease.

In our work, VATS is typically employed in combination with hybrid VATS (H-VATS) in which a small incision is made first and is then gradually expanded to complete VATS (C-VATS). For the successful treatment of pulmonary hydatid disease in children, the VATS techniques should include the following measures: the implementation of strict guidelines involving the conversion to thoracotomy; the preservation of lung tissue around the cyst during thoracic cavity planting; the prevention of airway obstruction during the hypertonic saline injection; and the suturing of the bronchial communication. Current treatment regimens include a complete resection of the cyst with maximum preservation of lung parenchyma, especially in children, whose residual lung parenchyma possesses a large expansion capacity. Conservative procedures include cyst removal after needle aspiration and partial pericystectomy or cystotomy, and enucleation of intact cysts. Occasionally, an enclosed residual cavity can cause partial atelectasis. Therefore, in cyst cavity management, the bronchial communication should be sutured with care and the grey-white pericystic layer should be respected. The residual cavity is opened to form a bowel shape and to prevent the occurrence of fusion and pneumatosis, which can result in serious complications such as empyema and bronchopleural fistula. The anatomical features of the lung and the negative pressure of the pleural cavity facilitate hydatid cyst growth into the peripheral lung and emergence of at least part of the cyst on the lung surface. During the operation, indwelling of a catheter in the residual cavity is often necessary. In this study, our cyst removal techniques often involved conservative procedures rather than radical procedures such as wedge resection, segmentectomy, lobectomy, and pneumonectomy. In addition, when the cyst is located in the periphery, wedge resection can efficiently and safely remove the cyst. Segmental resection is preferable if the cyst occupies the entirety of the involved segment, and lobectomies are chosen when large cysts cover greater than 60% of the lobe. Pneumonectomy is rarely necessary and should only be used when the entire lung is affected and no salvageable pulmonary parenchyma remains.

### Total video-assisted thoracoscopic (VATS) resection of a left-sided sulcus superior tumor after induction radiochemotherapy: video and review [^39bdc91b]. Surgical Endoscopy (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) has gained increasing acceptance for surgical therapy of early stage non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Even for extended pulmonary resections in advanced tumor stages, increasing evidence suggests feasibility and safety of the VATS approach. However, so far very little experience has been reported on VATS management of sulcus superior tumors.

Methods

We report on a 56-year-old female patient with a left-sided anterior sulcus superior adenocarcinoma (cT3 cN1 cM0), which was completely resected by VATS after induction radiochemotherapy.

Results

The surgical procedure was performed completely minimally invasively via a three-incision anterior thoracoscopic approach. The total operating time was 285 min (composed of 116 min for hilar lobectomy, 103 min for sulcus superior preparation and chest wall resection, and 26 min for systematic en-bloc lymph node dissection). The single chest tube was removed on postoperative day two and the patient was discharged on postoperative day six. No intraoperative and no postoperative complications were observed. Histopathology confirmed a complete (R0) resection of an ypT2aN0M0 bronchogenic adenocarcinoma.

Conclusion

With increasing experience even extended pulmonary resections are safe and feasible by a video-assisted thoracoscopic approach. We propose that in sulcus superior tumors without tumor invasion of vascular structures VATS can be considered.

### Short-term outcome of three-dimensional versus two-dimensional video-assisted thoracic surgery for benign pulmonary diseases [^4bbc144f]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

It is unclear whether three-dimensional (3D) video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) pulmonary resections are comparable to two-dimensional (2D) VATS pulmonary resections in patients with potentially operable benign pulmonary diseases.

Methods

We analyzed the clinical data of patients who underwent 2D and 3D VATS pulmonary resections for benign diseases in our hospital from November 2013 to August 2014. Perioperative factors (estimated blood loss and operative time) and postoperative factors (postoperative hospital length of stay, postoperative complications, and duration of chest tube drainage) were evaluated.

Results

VATS was performed in 278 patients during the 10-month study period. The 2D VATS system was used in 142 patients (51.08%), and the 3D VATS system was used in 136 (48.92%). Operative time was significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.007). However, no significant differences were found in estimated blood loss (p = 0.75), chest drainage tube placement time (p = 0.852), rate of postoperative complications (p = 0.566), or postoperative hospital length of stay (p = 0.951).

Conclusions

The use of 3D VATS appears to facilitate precise execution of surgical techniques in specific operative tasks and, as a result, reduces lung resection performance time in patients with benign pulmonary diseases.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: non-small cell lung cancer, version 7.2025 [^f5ab4a7d]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Thoracoscopic lobectomy (video-assisted thoracic surgery [VATS]) — comparative benefits and outcomes are summarized: VATS "is a minimally invasive surgical treatment" and published studies "suggest that thoracoscopic lobectomy has several advantages over lobectomy by thoracotomy". Reported benefits include that "Acute and chronic pain associated with thoracoscopic lobectomy is minimal; thus, this procedure requires a shorter length of hospitalization", and it is "associated with low postoperative morbidity and mortality, minimal risk of intraoperative bleeding, or minimal locoregional recurrence". Compared with thoracotomy, thoracoscopic lobectomy "is associated with less morbidity, fewer complications, and more rapid return to function", and in stage I NSCLC with lymph node dissection, "the 5-year survival rate, long-term survival, and local recurrence rate were comparable to those achieved by routine open lung resection".

### Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery vs thoracotomy for non-small cell lung cancer greater than 5 CM: is VATS a feasible approach for large tumors? [^de75ffd3]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

VATS lobectomy is a recommended surgical approach for patients with early-stage lung cancer. However, it is still controversial in locally advance disease. This study was conducted to compare intraoperative and postoperative results of VATS and thoracotomy in patients with tumors greater than 5 cm.

Methods

From January 2014 to December 2018, 849 patients underwent lobectomy or pneumonectomy for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer at our center. The inclusion criterion of this study was patients who underwent anatomic lung resection for lung cancer with tumors larger than 5 cm((≥ T3). The patients were divided into two groups: those who underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (n = 24) and those who underwent thoracotomy (n = 36). Patient characteristics, intraoperative and postoperative results were evaluated by review of the hospital records.

Results

In the VATS group, mean drainage time and postoperative length of hospital stay were significantly shorter than the thoracotomy group. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that overall and recurrence-free survival was longer in the VATS group and this result was statistically significant.

Conclusions

According to the results of this study, we emphasize that VATS is a feasible surgical procedure for tumors larger than 5 cm.

### Identifying patients at high risk of chronic pain after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery using thermal quantitative sensory testing [^6314f3d1]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To examine whether perioperative thermal quantitative sensory testing could be used to identify patients at high risk of chronic pain after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS).

Design

A single-center, prospective, observational study.

Setting

At the Peking University People's Hospital.

Participants

A total of 111 patients scheduled to undergo VATS were enrolled.

Interventions

Quantitative sensory testing was conducted at the anterior intercostal incision prior to surgery and after chest tube removal.

Measurements and Main Results

The patient's chronic pain was assessed at 3 months after surgery using a questionnaire. The incidence of chronic pain was 35 out of 107 evaluable patients (32.7%). Among the 35 patients with chronic pain, 26 had features characteristic of neuropathic pain (74.3%). Compared to the patients without chronic pain, subjects with chronic pain had a significantly greater perioperative change in cold pain threshold (CPT; p = 0.032), but not cold detection threshold, warm detection threshold, and hot pain threshold. In the multivariate regression, perioperative CPT change was associated with chronic pain after VATS (odds ratio = 1.043, p = 0.026).

Conclusions

Chronic pain after VATS is typically neuropathic. The change in perioperative CPT at the incision site may help to identify patients at higher risk of chronic pain after VATS.

### State of the art: pleuroscopy [^04d87d80]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

The terms pleuroscopy, thoracoscopy, medical thoracoscopy, and video-assisted thoracic surgery are often used interchangeably to describe a minimally invasive procedure that provides access to the pleural space, parietal pleura, lung, and other structures within the thoracic cavity. Pleuroscopy is a more exact term for describing visualization of the pleura and contents of the pleural cavity using an endoscope. This procedure provides physicians a window into the pleural space, to perform biopsy of the parietal pleura under direct visual guidance, particularly for biopsies in cases of exudative effusions with unclear origin, chest tube placement, and pleurodesis to prevent recurrent pleural effusion or pneumothorax in selected patients. In this state-of-the-art review, we discuss the indications, contraindications, and complications of pleuroscopy, and its role in thoracic oncology.

### Postoperative pain and quality of life after lobectomy via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or anterolateral thoracotomy for early stage lung cancer: a randomised controlled trial [^732d8493]. The Lancet: Oncology (2016). Medium credibility.

Background

Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is used increasingly as an alternative to thoracotomy for lobectomy in the treatment of early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer, but remains controversial and worldwide adoption rates are low. Non-randomised studies have suggested that VATS reduces postoperative morbidity, but there is little high-quality evidence to show its superiority over open surgery. We aimed to investigate postoperative pain and quality of life in a randomised trial of patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer undergoing VATS versus open surgery.

Methods

We did a randomised controlled patient and observer blinded trial at a public university-based cardiothoracic surgery department in Denmark. We enrolled patients who were scheduled for lobectomy for stage I non-small-cell lung cancer. By use of a web-based randomisation system, we assigned patients (1:1) to lobectomy via four-port VATS or anterolateral thoracotomy. After surgery, we applied identical surgical dressings to ensure masking of patients and staff. Postoperative pain was measured with a numeric rating scale (NRS) six times per day during hospital stay and once at 2, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks, and self-reported quality of life was assessed with the EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ5D) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 30 item Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) during hospital stay and 2, 4, 8, 12, 26, and 52 weeks after discharge. The primary outcomes were the proportion of patients with clinically relevant moderate-to-severe pain (NRS ≥ 3) and mean quality of life scores. These outcomes were assessed longitudinally by logistic regression across all timepoints. Data for the primary analysis were analysed by modified intention to treat (ie, all randomised patients with pathologically confirmed non-small-cell lung cancer). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01278888.

Findings

Between Oct 1, 2008, and Aug 20, 2014, we screened 772 patients, of whom 361 were eligible for inclusion and 206 were enrolled. We randomly assigned 103 patients to VATS and 103 to anterolateral thoracotomy. 102 patients in the VATS group and 99 in the thoracotomy group were included in the final analysis. The proportion of patients with clinically relevant pain (NRS ≥ 3) was significantly lower during the first 24 h after VATS than after anterolateral thoracotomy (VATS 38%, 95% CI 0·28–0·48 vs thoracotomy 63%, 95% CI 0·52–0·72, p = 0·0012). During 52 weeks of follow-up, episodes of moderate-to-severe pain were significantly less frequent after VATS than after anterolateral thoracotomy (p < 0·0001) and self-reported quality of life according to EQ5D was significantly better after VATS (p = 0·014). By contrast, for the whole study period, quality of life according to QLQ-C30 was not significantly different between groups (p = 0·13). Postoperative surgical complications (grade 3–4 adverse events) were similar between the two groups, consisting of prolonged air leakage over 4 days (14 patients in the VATS group vs nine patients in the thoracotomy group), re-operation for bleeding (two vs none), twisted middle lobe (one vs three) or prolonged air leakage over 7 days (five vs six), arrhythmia (one vs one), or neurological events (one vs two). Nine (4%) patients died during the follow-up period (three in the VATS group and six in the thoracotomy group).

Interpretation

VATS is associated with less postoperative pain and better quality of life than is anterolateral thoracotomy for the first year after surgery, suggesting that VATS should be the preferred surgical approach for lobectomy in stage I non-small-cell lung cancer.

### Thoracoscopy in the management of pneumothorax [^3cdccbe1]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Spontaneous pneumothorax is a common condition that impacts significantly on healthcare expenditure. However, optimal management of spontaneous pneumothorax remains a subject of considerable controversy. A thoracic surgeon's perspective on the use of thoracoscopy and video-assisted thoracic surgery with a focus on surgical techniques in the current management of this condition is presented.

### Video-assisted thoracic surgery sleeve lobectomy: a case series [^5be5af34]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

As thoracic surgery moves towards more minimally invasive procedures, such as video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) lobectomy, conversion from a VATS to open thoracotomy has been required for a sleeve resection. This article reports a large experience of VATS sleeve lobectomy.

Methods

We reviewed our thoracic surgery database of more than 1500 VATS lobectomies for VATS sleeve resections. Preoperative, operative, and perioperative outcome variables, including morbidity and mortality were examined.

Results

Identified were 13 patients (median age, 59 years; range, 16 to 82 years) who underwent VATS sleeve lobectomy. There were no conversions to thoracotomy. Diagnoses included non-small cell lung cancer in 8 patients, typical carcinoid in 4, and metastatic sarcoma in 1 patient. Median tumor size was 2.1 cm (range, 0 to 6.6 cm). Median data were operative time, 167 minutes (range, 90 to 300 minutes); blood loss, 250 mL (range, 75 to 800 mL); chest tube drainage, 692 mL (range, 459 to 1590 mL); and chest tube duration, 3 days (range, 2 to 6 days). Median intensive care unit stay was 0 days (range, 0 to 4 days), and median hospital stay was 3 days (range, 2 to 8 days). No complications occurred in 9 patients (69%). Morbidity in the remaining 4 patients included 1 patient each with atrial fibrillation, anastomotic stricture, reintubation, and bronchial tear requiring repair. There were no deaths at 30 days.

Conclusions

In experienced centers, VATS sleeve lobectomy is possible with acceptable morbidity and mortality as well as short length of stay.

### Video-assisted thoracic bronchial sleeve lobectomy with bronchoplasty for treatment of lung cancer confined to a single lung lobe: a case series of Chinese patients [^5371c3ee]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The evidence-based clinical practice guidelines of the American College of Chest Physicians recently suggested that "In patients with stage I NSCLC who are considered appropriate candidates for thoracoscopic anatomic lung resection (lobectomy or segmentectomy), the use of VATS by surgeons experienced in these techniques is an acceptable alternative to open thoracotomy", consistent with our current recommendations. While operator experience is a key factor to surgical success of VATS and VABSL, guidelines for junior surgeons (< 100 surgeries performed) have been recently proposed in Korea and indicate that the VATS lobectomy technique can be dramatically improved over the course of only 6 months. Thereafter, junior surgeons reported similar conversions to open surgery and outcomes as experienced surgeons. Similarly, European VATS training programs have been designed, and showed that prolonged air leak, chest tube duration, operation time and length of stay were reduced by training, most likely due to superior patient selection by trained operators. As VATS and VABSL are technically challenging procedures that have been demonstrated to be more successful when performed by specially-trained thoracic surgeons, it has been suggested that training for these procedures should be coordinated at a national level as they become more widely implemented. It may be beneficial to consider implementing similar national training and patient eligibility determination in China, though further research will be required to determine the optimal parameters in Chinese clinical practice settings.

It is important to consider that the present results were obtained from a relatively small and non-diverse patient population of only 9 predominantly male cases. Thus, these findings may not be typical of the general population of Chinese lung cancer patients. Similarly, the surgeons in the present study were both trained and experienced, and less qualified surgeons may experience poorer results and a greater need for intraoperative conversion to open surgery, further highlighting the need for additional standardization and regulation of training in VATS techniques in China. Additionally, VABSL may be less effective for more advanced cancer stages where lymph nodes infiltration has occurred. Further research should be conducted to validate these findings in larger clinical populations with more diverse presentations of lung cancer.

### Position paper on video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery as treatment of pediatric empyema [^17e3df46]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Pediatric empyema can be managed with a variety of modalities, and the evidence for an ideal management strategy is limited. Early or simple effusions can be treated with antibiotics alone or with drainage when respiratory distress occurs. Once fibrinopurulent empyema has developed, therapy may involve either chest tube placement with instillation of fibrinolytics or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with pleural decortication. In late or fibrotic empyema, an assumption persists that the fibrotic peel must be managed by decortication that can be done either thoracoscopically or through a minithoracotomy incision. This position paper is coauthored by the New Technology Committee of the American Pediatric Surgery Association. The goal is to discuss the ongoing controversies and summarize, in an evidence-based manner, the various treatment options and to suggest a reasonable therapeutic algorithm for the care of children with empyema.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^7a4cdbf5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Cavitary coccidioidal pneumonia — surgical approach selection (video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery [VATS] vs open thoracotomy): We recommend that a VATS approach be attempted if the surgeon has significant expertise in VATS (strong, low). From a technical standpoint, starting with a VATS approach on any thoracic procedure poses very limited risks, but the surgeon must understand the special implications of coccidioidal lung infections and convert the VATS procedure to a thoracotomy in a controlled fashion to reduce the risk of a major vascular injury when hilar lymph nodes are densely adherent. Wedge resection can be technically difficult due to the thickness of the lung surrounding the cavity, fibrosis and scarring may mandate anatomic resection (lobectomy), and large cavities or those with extensive surrounding inflammation are likely too bulky for a small VATS incision, in which case it may be more appropriate to start with a thoracotomy.
