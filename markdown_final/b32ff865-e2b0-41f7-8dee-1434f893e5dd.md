## Question

Is flecainide indicated for torsades de pointes prophylaxis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether flecainide is indicated for torsades de pointes (TdP) prophylaxis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the major guidelines actually recommend for TdP prevention and whether flecainide appears there. Then, I should verify flecainide's electrophysiologic effects on QRS, QT, and JT and its documented association with TdP on the FDA label. Next, I will review human evidence of flecainide-associated TdP and broader proarrhythmic risk, including CAST. After that, I should confirm flecainide's FDA-approved indications to see if TdP prophylaxis is included. Finally, I will consider edge cases and emerging experimental data, and synthesize a risk–benefit conclusion with practical guidance.

> Let me first confirm the standard of care for TdP prevention and recurrence suppression because if flecainide were useful here, it should be reflected in guidelines. The AHA/ACC/HRS guidance for acquired long-QT–mediated TdP emphasizes intravenous magnesium sulfate, aggressive potassium and magnesium repletion, increasing the heart rate with isoproterenol or overdrive pacing for recurrent TdP, and strict avoidance of QT-prolonging drugs, and none of these documents include flecainide as a prophylactic strategy for TdP, either acutely or chronically [^1128xX2W] [^112nxdEK] [^1157JkZz] [^115FpE1U] [^114qgj7Y] [^111RsD5z] [^114X6utR].

> Wait, let me verify flecainide's electrophysiology before jumping to conclusions about risk. My first instinct is to say flecainide substantially prolongs QT, but hold on, I should double-check the label data. The FDA labeling shows that flecainide primarily slows conduction with dose-related PR and QRS widening, and while QT increases by about 8%, most of that comes from QRS widening, with only a small average increase in JT of about 4%, though rare cases of TdP have been reported, so minimal JT change does not equal zero TdP risk [^113vPR5k]. I should also confirm that clinical reviews note minimal effect on repolarization relative to depolarization slowing while acknowledging case reports of QT prolongation and TdP and the need for ECG monitoring in at-risk contexts, which they do [^111vnxaR].

> Hold on, I should verify real-world proarrhythmic signals, not just mechanistic expectations. The FDA safety information warns about prolonged QT, ventricular arrhythmias, and TdP and urges correction of serum potassium and vigilance for proarrhythmia, which argues against its use in patients with unstable substrates for TdP [^1136XqAd]. I need to check whether flecainide has been implicated in human TdP clusters; indeed, an antiarrhythmic-induced TdP series identified flecainide as the culprit drug in 2 of 16 cases, and genetic susceptibility was present in a subset, underscoring that normal baseline QT does not eliminate risk [^113dkSxV]. Let me also remember the CAST data demonstrating increased mortality in post-MI patients on class IC agents, consistent with potent proarrhythmic potential in vulnerable ventricles, reinforcing caution rather than any prophylactic role for TdP [^114eMchw] [^114PreTA].

> I should confirm labeled indications next, because if TdP prophylaxis were intended, it would be explicit. FDA labeling restricts flecainide to prevention of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter with disabling symptoms, and life‑threatening sustained ventricular tachycardia, with no indication for TdP prophylaxis or treatment, and use is generally reserved for patients without recent MI or significant structural heart disease due to proarrhythmic risk [^111FaFFR] [^114rMwGE].

> Let me consider contraindications and precautions that intersect with TdP risk, because these often reveal the intended safety profile. The label advises extreme caution in conduction disease and sick sinus syndrome, notes increases in pacing thresholds, and emphasizes correcting electrolytes, especially potassium, before therapy, all of which are the opposite of a drug you would choose to stabilize TdP-prone repolarization physiology and bradycardia‑dependent triggers [^111jQ6mb] [^1136XqAd] [^113zH5Hb]. I should also verify drug–drug interactions that raise flecainide levels, for example with amiodarone, which can further heighten proarrhythmic risk in susceptible patients, again arguing against any prophylactic use in a TdP-prone milieu [^113zH5Hb].

> Next, I will examine the experimental reports suggesting flecainide might reduce ibutilide‑related TdP risk, because this could be a tempting but misleading signal. Preclinical canine preparations have shown that adding flecainide to ibutilide may reduce an experimental TdP score, possibly via late sodium current inhibition, but these are isolated organ models, not human clinical practice, and ibutilide itself carries a known clinical TdP risk that persists even when combined with background class IC therapy in observational human data, so this does not translate into a guideline-endorsed or evidence-based TdP prophylaxis strategy with flecainide in people [^112wMFmB] [^1166HQHM] [^111NCWHg]. I should confirm that no major guideline incorporates this combination to prevent TdP, which they do not [^1128xX2W].

> But wait, what about contexts where flecainide is beneficial against ventricular arrhythmias, like catecholaminergic polymorphic VT or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy; could that imply a TdP role. Let me be precise: flecainide is recommended or considered in CPVT and in some ARVC contexts as an adjunct to beta‑blockers to suppress catecholamine‑triggered ventricular arrhythmias, which are mechanistically distinct from pause‑dependent, repolarization‑instability TdP, so these data do not support prophylaxis for TdP or acquired long QT phenotypes [^116drKqU] [^116Y8638] [^112BaK2v].

> Synthesizing this, I need to ensure my conclusion aligns with guidelines, labeling, and risk signals. Standard prophylaxis and recurrence prevention for TdP focuses on intravenous magnesium, correction of potassium and magnesium, accelerating heart rate with isoproterenol or pacing when needed, and meticulous avoidance of QT‑prolonging agents, whereas flecainide is not recommended for TdP prophylaxis and carries warnings for proarrhythmia including rare TdP and heightened risk in structural heart disease, bradycardia, and electrolyte disturbances, so using flecainide for TdP prevention would be contrary to evidence and guideline consensus [^1128xX2W] [^112nxdEK] [^1157JkZz] [^1136XqAd].

> Final conclusion: No, flecainide is not indicated for torsades de pointes prophylaxis, and given its proarrhythmic potential and documented association with rare TdP, particularly in susceptible substrates, it may increase risk rather than mitigate it; guideline‑based prevention should rely on magnesium, electrolyte optimization, heart‑rate augmentation when appropriate, and avoidance of QT‑prolonging agents, not flecainide [^1128xX2W] [^112nxdEK] [^1157JkZz] [^111FaFFR] [^1136XqAd].

---

Flecainide is not recommended for preventing torsades de pointes (TdP) because it can **prolong the QT interval** [^113vPR5k] and has been associated with rare cases of TdP [^1136XqAd]. Guidelines do not support its use for TdP prevention; instead, use **IV magnesium, potassium repletion, and pacing or isoproterenol** when indicated [^1128xX2W] [^112nxdEK] [^1157JkZz]. Flecainide is contraindicated in patients with structural heart disease or prior myocardial infarction due to increased proarrhythmic risk.

---

## Electrophysiological effects of flecainide relevant to TdP

Flecainide is a **class IC antiarrhythmic** that blocks fast sodium channels [^111GVjd1], slowing conduction and widening the QRS; it also **modestly prolongs the QT**, primarily via QRS widening, with minimal JT prolongation [^113vPR5k]. However, rare TdP cases have been reported [^113vPR5k] [^1136XqAd].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding flecainide and TdP

Clinical data **do not support flecainide for TdP prevention** and link it to proarrhythmic events, including rare TdP, especially in patients with structural heart disease or prior MI [^113dkSxV] [^114eMchw]. The CAST trial showed **increased mortality and cardiac arrest** with flecainide in post-MI patients, underscoring its proarrhythmic risk [^114eMchw] [^114PreTA].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend flecainide** for TdP prevention; instead, they endorse:

- **IV magnesium sulfate**: first-line for TdP suppression [^1128xX2W] [^114X6utR].
- **Potassium repletion**: maintain ≥ 4.0 mmol/L [^112nxdEK] [^114X6utR].
- **Pacing or isoproterenol**: for bradycardia-associated TdP unresponsive to magnesium [^1157JkZz] [^115FpE1U].

Flecainide is **contraindicated in structural heart disease** or prior MI due to proarrhythmic risk.

---

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

Flecainide is **not recommended for TdP prevention** in any population. It is indicated for paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter, and select life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias in patients without structural heart disease [^111FaFFR] [^114rMwGE].

---

## Risks and adverse effects associated with flecainide

Flecainide carries **significant proarrhythmic risks**, including:

- **QT prolongation and TdP**: rare but serious [^113vPR5k] [^1136XqAd].
- **Ventricular arrhythmias**: new or worsened, especially in structural heart disease [^114eMchw] [^114PreTA].
- **Conduction disturbances**: AV block, sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest [^111jQ6mb].
- **Heart failure exacerbation**: use caution in cardiomyopathy or severe HF [^1136XqAd].

---

## Comparison with other antiarrhythmic medications

Compared with other antiarrhythmics, flecainide is **less effective** for TdP prevention and carries a higher proarrhythmic risk. Amiodarone and sotalol are preferred for ventricular arrhythmias [^115gncmd], while magnesium [^1128xX2W] and potassium repletion [^112nxdEK] are **first-line for TdP**.

---

## Monitoring and safety considerations

If flecainide is used, **careful monitoring is essential**:

- **ECG monitoring**: track PR, QRS, and QT intervals [^113vPR5k].
- **Electrolyte monitoring**: maintain normal potassium and magnesium [^1136XqAd] [^112nxdEK].
- **Clinical monitoring**: watch for proarrhythmia, conduction disturbances [^111jQ6mb], and HF exacerbation [^1136XqAd].

---

Flecainide is **not recommended for TdP prevention** due to its proarrhythmic potential [^114eMchw] and lack of supporting evidence. Use guideline-supported therapies such as **magnesium** [^1128xX2W], **potassium repletion** [^112nxdEK], and **pacing or isoproterenol** [^1157JkZz] when indicated.

Mortality: Flecainide acetate was included in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST), a long-term, multicenter, randomized, double-blind study in patients with asymptomatic, non-life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who had experienced a myocardial infarction more than six days but less than two years previously. An excessive mortality or non-fatal cardiac arrest rate was observed in patients treated with flecainide acetate compared with those assigned to a carefully matched placebo-treated group. This rate was 16/315 (5.1%) for flecainide acetate and 7/309 (2.3%) for the matched placebo. The average duration of treatment with flecainide acetate in this study was ten months.

The applicability of the CAST results to other populations (e.g. those without recent myocardial infarction) is uncertain; however, at present, it is prudent to consider the risks of Class IC agents (including flecainide acetate), coupled with the lack of any evidence of improved survival, generally unacceptable in patients without life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, even if the patients are experiencing unpleasant, but not life-threatening, symptoms or signs.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of flecainide acetate PO (also known as Tambocor):

- **Decreased serum potassium, increased serum potassium**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as flecainide has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events. Correct serum potassium levels before initiating flecainide.

- **Exacerbation of heart failure (HF)**: Use caution in patients with cardiomyopathy and severe HF.

- **Prolonged QT interval, ventricular arrhythmia, supraventricular arrhythmia, torsade de pointes**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as flecainide has been associated with an increased risk for these adverse events.

- **Sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest**: Use extreme caution in patients with sick sinus syndrome.

### Flecainide acetate [^113vPR5k]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Flecainide acetate slows cardiac conduction in most patients and produces dose-related increases in PR, QRS, and QT intervals. The PR interval typically increases by an average of about 25% (0.04 seconds) and can increase up to 118% in some patients. Approximately one-third of patients may develop a new first-degree AV heart block (PR interval ≥ 0.2 seconds). The QRS complex increases by an average of about 25% (0.02 seconds) and can increase up to 150% in some patients, with many patients developing QRS complexes that have a duration of 0.12 seconds or more. In one study, 4% of patients developed a new bundle branch block while on flecainide acetate.

The degree of lengthening of PR and QRS intervals does not predict efficacy or the development of cardiac adverse effects. In clinical trials, it is unusual for PR intervals to reach 0.3 seconds or more, or for QRS intervals to reach 0.18 seconds or more. Therefore, caution should be used when such intervals occur, and dose reductions may be considered. The QT interval widens by about 8%, but most of this widening (approximately 60% to 90%) results from the widening of the QRS duration. The JT interval (QT minus QRS) widens by only about 4% on average. Significant JT prolongation occurs in less than 2% of patients. Rare cases of Torsade de Pointes-type arrhythmia have been associated with flecainide acetate therapy.

### Use of preclinical assays to predict risk of drug-induced torsades de pointes [^1171LFeo]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Numerous medications, including drugs prescribed for noncardiac indications, can induce electrophysiologic changes that trigger the rare, malignant polymorphic ventricular tachyarrhythmia known as torsades de pointes (TdP). Although the exact relationship between electrophysiologic events and the development of TdP is not defined, prolongation of the QT interval and inhibition of the rapidly activating potassium I(Kr) by drugs may be associated with an increased risk of TdP. The ability of a drug to reduce I(Kr) and prolong the QT interval often is considered to predict the likelihood that the drug will cause TdP in humans. However, these surrogate measures of the drug-induced risk of causing TdP, and therefore of drug safety, now are recognized to be imperfect predictors of drug safety.

New preclinical models should be used to assess drug risk, including preparations, conditions, and measurements used by basic research scientists to produce ventricular polymorphic arrhythmias in the laboratory. In this review, we discuss the task of assessing the arrhythmogenic potential of a drug. Assays of drug effect to induce early afterdepolarizations and ectopic beats and/or to increase the dispersion of ventricular repolarization when "repolarization reserve" is reduced appear to be the best predictors of the drug-induced risk of TdP. Experimental models and protocols, especially those using conditions wherein the net repolarizing is reduced, can detect the potential for a drug to induce TdP, even when the potential is extremely low.

### Flecainide is associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmic events in a large cohort of patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [^116Y8638]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a rare and potentially lethal inherited cardiac arrhythmia syndrome caused by abnormal intracellular calcium homeostasis of cardiac cells. Characteristically, polymorphic or bidirectional ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) occur under circumstances of high sympathetic tone, potentially inducing syncope, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), and sudden cardiac death (SCD).

Since the earliest clinical reports, beta-blockers have been the cornerstone of therapy for preventing arrhythmic events (AEs) in CPVT, and guidelines advocate treating every clinically diagnosed patient with CPVT with a beta-blocker, preferably a nonselective beta-blocker. However, some patients are insufficiently protected by beta-blockers alone, and severe VAs or breakthrough AEs on beta-blocker therapy occur. In addition, beta-blockers may cause side effects in some patients, leading to nonadherence or discontinuation of therapy.

Flecainide is a class IC antiarrhythmic drug that is effective in suppressing VAs in patients with CPVT, and guidelines state that flecainide should be considered as the first addition to beta-blockers when control of VAs or AEs is incomplete. However, evidence for the efficacy of flecainide in reducing AEs in patients with CPVT relies on relatively small cohorts with short-term follow-up. The purpose of this study was to assess the association of flecainide with the incidence of AEs in a large cohort of patients with CPVT from two international CPVT registries with long-term follow-up.

### Long QT syndrome: reduced repolarization reserve and the genetic link [^112twYsf]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Marked QT prolongation and torsades de pointes can occur not only in the congenital long QT syndromes (LQTSs) but also as a consequence of environmental stimuli, notably the administration of certain drugs. A key feature of this 'acquired' form of the LQTS is its unpredictable nature. Although risk factors have been identified in series of patients, they have not been terribly useful in addressing the risk in an individual patient. Normal cardiac repolarization critically depends on the interplay of multiple ion currents, providing some redundancy, or 'reserve', to protect against excessive QT prolongation by drugs.

We have proposed that lesions in these repolarizing mechanisms can remain subclinical but nevertheless increase risk upon drug exposure, termed 'reduced repolarization reserve'. The evidence in support of this concept is presented, and the known and potential contributions of genetic variants to risk are examined. Assessing variability in susceptibility to acquired LQTS provides a framework for analyzing other complex gene-environment interactions.

### SPL drug information for droperidol [^1117o7ap]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (Year not specified). High credibility.

A boxed warning exists regarding the use of droperidol intravenously due to its association with prolonged QT interval and torsade de pointes. It is advised not to use droperidol in patients with known or suspected QT prolongation, including those with congenital long QT syndrome.

- **Risk factors**: Use extreme caution in patients at risk of QT prolongation. This includes individuals with congestive heart failure, bradycardia, cardiac hypertrophy, or significant cardiac disease. Patients with hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, or those receiving diuretics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or other drugs known to increase the QT interval, should also be considered at high risk.

### Mexiletine effectively prevented refractory Torsades de Pointes and ventricular fibrillation in a patient with congenital type 2 long QT syndrome [^114a4AJ6]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2022). Low credibility.

We report a 28-year-old female patient with congenital type 2 long QT syndrome (LQTS) in which mexiletine shortened the corrected QT interval (QTc) and effectively prevented refractory Torsade de Pointes (TdP) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). She developed TdP and VF and was subsequently diagnosed with congenital type 2 LQTS. Despite medical therapy, including β-blocker, she experienced refractory TdP and VF every day; however, these were completely suppressed following the initiation of mexiletine, which resulted in the shortening of the QTc interval.

### Long QT syndrome and anaesthesia [^112utRaR]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2002). Low credibility.

Long QT syndrome is a disorder of myocardial electrical conduction that leaves the heart vulnerable to the ventricular tachydysrhythmia torsade de pointes. Clinically, this results in syncope or sudden death. Long QT syndrome may be congenital, caused by abnormal myocardial potassium or sodium ion channels, or acquired, due to drugs, electrolyte abnormalities, or metabolic conditions. Triggers for the development of torsade de pointes include both anaesthesia and surgery. Some anaesthetic agents prolong the QT interval. The condition is reviewed, and suggestions are made for the anaesthetic management of affected patients.

### Efficacy of flecainide in the treatment of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia: A randomized clinical trial [^116drKqU]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). High credibility.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a potentially lethal genetic arrhythmia syndrome characterized by polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with physical or emotional stress, for which therapy with β-blockers is incompletely effective. Flecainide acetate directly suppresses sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release — the cellular mechanism responsible for triggering ventricular arrhythmias in CPVT — yet has never been assessed prospectively.

The objective of this study was to determine whether flecainide, dosed to therapeutic levels and added to β-blocker therapy, is superior to β-blocker therapy alone for the prevention of exercise-induced arrhythmias in CPVT.

This investigator-initiated, multicenter, single-blind, placebo-controlled crossover clinical trial was conducted from December 19, 2011, through December 29, 2015, with a midtrial protocol change at 10 US sites. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of CPVT and an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator underwent a baseline exercise test while receiving maximally tolerated β-blocker therapy that was continued throughout the trial. Patients were then randomized to treatment A (flecainide or placebo) for three months, followed by exercise testing. After a one-week washout period, patients crossed over to treatment B (placebo or flecainide) for three months, followed by exercise testing.

Patients received oral flecainide or placebo twice daily, with the dosage guided by trough serum levels.

### Effect of flecainide and ibutilide alone and in combination to terminate and prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation [^1166HQHM]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). Low credibility.

In previous studies, flecainide caused atrial selective prolongation of the effective refractory period (ERP) and depression of excitability in healthy canine cardiac preparations, comparable to those caused by ranolazine. The combination of flecainide and ibutilide produced more impressive atrial selective alteration of these sodium channel-mediated parameters (Figures 2 and 3). Our previous experience indicates that I Na blockers, causing atrial-selective depression of sodium channel–mediated parameters (such as ranolazine and amiodarone), have minimal or no risk of ventricular proarrhythmia, even in the presence of structural heart disease. This is likely due to the relatively mild effects of atrial-selective agents on ventricular sodium channel-mediated parameters.

Propafenone is less atrial-selective, causing significant depression of sodium channel–mediated parameters in the ventricles, and is known to induce ventricular proarrhythmia in structurally compromised hearts. Flecainide can cause ventricular proarrhythmia in patients with ischemic and structural heart disease, despite causing atrial selective depression of sodium channel-mediated parameters (Figures 2 and 3). Class IC agent-induced proarrhythmia remains poorly understood. The risk of induction of ventricular proarrhythmia by class IC agents may be related to the superimposition of acute ischemia on structural heart disease.

- **Limitations**: Our experiments were conducted in isolated, non-remodeled canine cardiac preparations perfused with Tyrode or Krebs-Henseleit solution.

### Thorough QT/QTc not so thorough: Removes torsadogenic predictors from the T-wave, incriminates safe drugs, and misses profibrillatory drugs [^114U2kBV]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

Drug-induced QT prolongation has such a strong correlation with torsade de pointes (TdP) that it comes to serve as a surrogate for TdP. As a result, drugs that prolong QT by as little as a few milliseconds, even without any evidence of TdP, may be dropped from development or blocked from approval. However, measurement of QT with millisecond accuracy may be impossible to achieve. Worse, some drugs that lengthen the QT interval are not only not proarrhythmic, but they may also even be antiarrhythmic, while some that shorten the QT can be strongly proarrhythmic.

Proarrhythmia related to repolarization disturbances is caused by triangulation, reverse-use dependence, instability, and dispersion (TRIaD). When TRIaD is present with QT prolongation, it commonly yields TdP, but when TRIaD is combined with QT shortening, it preferentially leads to ventricular fibrillation (VF) instead. While TdP is lethal in fewer than 20% of instances, VF is much more morbid. Available evidence suggests that there are more deaths from drug-induced fibrillation than TdP. Therefore, QT prolongation alone is not very useful. Instead, the T-wave should be used in alternate ways: extraction of TRIaD.

### Flecainide acetate [^111jQ6mb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinically significant conduction changes have been observed at these rates: sinus node dysfunction, such as sinus pause, sinus arrest, and symptomatic bradycardia (1.2%); second-degree AV block (0.5%); and third-degree AV block (0.4%). An attempt should be made to manage the patient on the lowest effective dose to minimize these effects. If second- or third-degree AV block or right bundle branch block associated with a left hemiblock occurs, flecainide acetate therapy should be discontinued unless a temporary or implanted ventricular pacemaker is in place to ensure an adequate ventricular rate.

- **Sick sinus syndrome (bradycardia-tachycardia syndrome)**: Flecainide acetate should be used only with extreme caution in patients with sick sinus syndrome because it may cause sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest.

- **Effects on pacemaker thresholds**: Flecainide acetate is known to increase endocardial pacing thresholds and may suppress ventricular escape rhythms. These effects are reversible if flecainide is discontinued. It should be used with caution in patients with permanent pacemakers or temporary pacing electrodes and should not be administered to patients with existing poor thresholds or nonprogrammable pacemakers unless suitable pacing rescue is available.

The pacing threshold in patients with pacemakers should be determined prior to instituting therapy with flecainide acetate, again after one week of administration, and at regular intervals thereafter. Generally, threshold changes are within the range of multiprogrammable parameters.

### Droperidol [^115HZ8aA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Cases of QT prolongation and/or torsade de pointes have been reported in patients receiving droperidol at doses at or below recommended levels. Some cases have occurred in patients with no known risk factors for QT prolongation, and some cases have been fatal.

Due to its potential for serious proarrhythmic effects and death, droperidol should be reserved for use in treating patients who fail to show an acceptable response to other adequate treatments, either because of insufficient effectiveness or the inability to achieve an effective dose due to intolerable adverse effects from those drugs (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Cases of QT prolongation and serious arrhythmias, such as torsade de pointes, have been reported in patients treated with droperidol. Based on these reports, all patients should undergo a 12-lead ECG prior to the administration of droperidol to determine if a prolonged QT interval (i.e. QTc greater than 440 msec for males or 450 msec for females) is present. If there is a prolonged QT interval, droperidol should NOT be administered. For patients in whom the potential benefit of droperidol treatment is judged to outweigh the risks of potentially serious arrhythmias, ECG monitoring should be performed prior to treatment and continued for 2–3 hours after completing treatment to monitor for arrhythmias.

Droperidol is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected QT prolongation, including patients with congenital long QT syndrome.

### Antipsychotic drugs: Prolonged QTc interval, torsade de pointes, and sudden death [^116yD1HJ]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The authors review the mechanisms and establish the risk of torsade de pointes and sudden death with antipsychotic drugs. They present a review of original concepts, the distinction between familial and drug-induced cases of torsade de pointes, and the recognition of the role of noncardiac drugs in torsade de pointes and sudden death. Furthermore, they review the evidence linking QTc interval prolongation and potassium channels to torsade de pointes from both long QT syndrome and drugs. They examine the risk of torsade de pointes from antipsychotic drugs and estimate the frequency of sudden death based on epidemiological data in normal and schizophrenic populations.

All drugs that cause torsade de pointes prolong the QTc interval and bind to the potassium rectifier channel, but the relationships are not precise. Prediction of torsade de pointes and sudden death can be improved by examining dose dependency, the percent of QTc intervals higher than 500 milliseconds, and the risk of drug-drug interactions. Although sudden unexpected death occurs almost twice as often in populations treated with antipsychotics as in normal populations, there are still only 10–15 such events in 10,000 person-years of observation.

Although pimozide, sertindole, droperidol, and haloperidol have been documented to cause torsade de pointes and sudden death, the most marked risk is with thioridazine. There is no association with olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone. Ziprasidone does prolong the QT interval, but there is no evidence to suggest that this leads to torsade de pointes and sudden death.

### Drug-induced proarrhythmia and use of QTc-prolonging agents: Clues for clinicians [^115SpkAn]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Use of drugs with the potential for prolongation of the QTc interval and proarrhythmia is a growing challenge facing clinicians. Many pharmaceutical agents have been denied approval for human use, approved with restrictions and warnings regarding proarrhythmia, or withdrawn from the market based on arrhythmic risk. Despite known risk factors for QTc prolongation and drug-induced arrhythmia, precise prediction of the risk of torsades de pointes (TdP) in an individual patient remains difficult. The mechanism of drug-induced TdP typically involves the use of an agent that blocks the I(Kr) cardiac potassium current, often in combination with risk-amplifying factors such as high drug levels, reduced drug metabolism, polypharmacy, and patient-specific factors such as gender, age, and genetic polymorphism. For the clinician, an integrated approach involving appreciation of the risk factors for proarrhythmia combined with computer-based risk assessment is the best method for reducing the risk of drug-induced proarrhythmia in clinical practice.

### Flecainide in structural heart diseases: A contemporary reappraisal beyond the CAST [^116TEFsr]. Heart Rhythm (2025). Low credibility.

Flecainide has been contraindicated in patients with structural heart disease (SHD) since the 1991 Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) showed increased mortality in post-myocardial infarction patients. This review argues that the CAST findings were overgeneralized, resulting in the underutilization of a valuable antiarrhythmic medication. Emerging observational evidence suggests that flecainide may be safe and effective in specific SHD populations, including those with stable coronary artery disease without active ischemia and preserved ventricular function. Its use also shows promise in various cardiomyopathies such as arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and premature ventricular complex-induced cardiomyopathy, supporting a nuanced, patient-specific approach that challenges existing flecainide safety dogma and moves beyond outdated misconceptions. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the recent observational findings and redefine the role of flecainide in contemporary cardiology.

### Flecainide acetate [^115dnopn]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

From age 20 to 80, plasma levels are only slightly higher with advancing age; flecainide elimination from plasma is somewhat slower in elderly subjects than in younger subjects. Patients up to age 80+ have been safely treated with usual dosages.

The extent of flecainide binding to human plasma proteins is about 40% and is independent of plasma drug level over the range of 0.015 to about 3.4 mcg/mL. Thus, clinically significant drug interactions based on protein binding effects would not be expected.

Hemodialysis removes only about 1% of an oral dose as unchanged flecainide.

Small increases in plasma digoxin levels are seen during coadministration of flecainide acetate with digoxin. Small increases in both flecainide and propranolol plasma levels are seen during coadministration of these two drugs. (See PRECAUTIONS, Drug Interactions.)

Clinical trials:

- **Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT)**: In two randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 16 weeks double-blind duration, 79% of patients receiving flecainide were attack free, whereas 15% of patients receiving placebo remained attack free. The median time-before-recurrence of PSVT in patients receiving placebo was 11 to 12 days, whereas over 85% of patients receiving flecainide had no recurrence at 60 days.

- **Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF)**: In two randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trials of 16 weeks double-blind duration, 31% of patients receiving flecainide were attack-free, whereas 8% receiving placebo remained attack free.

### Predicting the unpredictable: Drug-induced QT prolongation and torsades de pointes [^1119NUeF]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome (diLQTS) and congenital LQTS (cLQTS) share many features, and both syndromes can result in life-threatening torsades de pointes (TdP). Our understanding of their mechanistic and genetic similarities has led to their improved clinical management. However, our inability to prevent diLQTS has resulted in the removal of many medicines from the market and from development. Genetic and clinical risk factors for diLQTS and TdP are well known and raise the possibility of TdP prevention. Clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can scan the patient's electronic health records for clinical risk factors predictive of diLQTS and warn when a drug that can cause TdP is prescribed. CDSS have reduced prescriptions of QT-prolonging drugs, but these relatively small changes lack the power to reduce TdP. The growing genetic evidence linking diLQTS to cLQTS suggests that prevention of TdP in the future may require inclusion of both genetic and clinical predictors into CDSS.

There is a boxed warning regarding the use of droperidol administered intramuscularly (IM) and the risk of prolonged QT interval and torsade de pointes. It is advised not to use droperidol in patients with known or suspected QT prolongation, including those with congenital long QT syndrome. Extreme caution should be exercised in patients at risk of QT prolongation, such as those with congestive heart failure (HF), bradycardia, cardiac hypertrophy, significant cardiac disease, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, or those receiving diuretics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or other drugs known to increase the QT interval.

### Use of flecainide for the treatment of atrial fibrillation [^111GVjd1]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained arrhythmia and is associated with substantial morbidity and impairment of quality of life. Restoration and maintenance of normal sinus rhythm are desirable goals for many patients with AF; however, this strategy is limited by the relatively small number of antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) available for AF rhythm control. Although it is recommended in medical guidelines as first-line therapy for patients without structural heart disease, the use of flecainide has been curtailed since the completion of the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial.

In clinical trials and real-world use, flecainide has proven to be more effective than other AADs for the acute termination of recent onset AF. Flecainide is also moderately effective and, with the exception of amiodarone, equivalent to other AADs for the chronic suppression of paroxysmal and persistent AF. In patients without structural heart disease, flecainide has been demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated relative to other AADs. Despite this favorable profile, flecainide is underutilized, likely due to a perceived risk of ventricular proarrhythmia, a concern that has not been borne out in patients without underlying structural heart disease. Guidelines for the administration and use of flecainide are summarized in this review.

Circulation (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for long QT syndrome, more specifically with respect to beta-blockers, the ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend initiating additional medications, guided by consideration of the particular long QT syndrome type, for intensification of therapy in high-risk patients with symptomatic long QT syndrome if β-blocker therapy is ineffective or not tolerated.

Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Drug-induced long QT syndrome (diLQTS) is a clinical entity in which the administration of a drug produces marked prolongation of the QT interval on the ECG. DiLQTS places a patient at risk of developing torsades de pointes (TdP), a malignant polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with arrhythmic sudden cardiac death (SCD). In addition to diLQTS, other clinical risk factors for TdP include female gender, bradycardia, electrolyte disturbances, recent conversion to normal (sinus) rhythm, and congenital LQTS.

### Tachycardia due to atrial flutter with rapid 1:1 conduction following treatment of atrial fibrillation with flecainide [^113n9PNH]. BMJ (2010). Low credibility.

Flecainide can "organise" atrial fibrillation into atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction, leading to cardiovascular compromise. The treatment of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department is often complex and depends on several factors, including the time of onset of atrial fibrillation and previously known cardiac disease. Guidelines include flecainide as a possible treatment for chemical cardioversion and maintaining sinus rhythm in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. An important, under-recognised complication of flecainide is the transformation of rhythm from atrial fibrillation to atrial flutter. We present four such cases.

### Drug-induced torsades de pointes and implications for drug development [^116aCX9D]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2004). Low credibility.

Torsades de pointes is a potentially lethal arrhythmia that occasionally appears as an adverse effect of pharmacotherapy. Recently developed understanding of the underlying electrophysiology allows better estimation of the drug-induced risks and explains the failures of older approaches through the surface ECG. This article expresses a consensus reached by an independent academic task force on the physiologic understanding of drug-induced repolarization changes, their preclinical and clinical evaluation, and the risk-to-benefit interpretation of drug-induced torsades de pointes. The consensus of the task force includes suggestions on how to evaluate the risk of torsades within drug development programs.

- **Techniques and limitations**: Individual sections of the text discuss the techniques and limitations of methods directed at drug-related ion channel phenomena.
- **Investigations and preclinical studies**: Investigations aimed at action potential changes, preclinical studies of phenomena seen only in the whole (or nearly whole) heart, and interpretation of human ECGs obtained in clinical studies.

The final section of the text discusses drug-induced torsades within the larger evaluation of drug-related risks and benefits.

Regarding specific circumstances for ventricular arrhythmias, and more specifically with respect to patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy (management of reVA), the ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of amiodarone or sotalol in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and an ICD experiencing spontaneous VA or appropriate shocks despite optimal device programming and treatment with a β-blocker.

### Mechanistic model-informed proarrhythmic risk assessment of drugs: Review of the "CiPA" initiative and design of a prospective clinical validation study [^111CyD7L]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

- **Effect of predominant hERG potassium channel block vs. balanced ion channel block on QT prolongation and generation of torsade de pointes**: Illustration of predominant hERG block leading to torsade de pointes vs. balanced ion channel block causing QT prolongation without torsade de pointes. Predominant hERG block reduces the hERG potassium channel current, which delays repolarization and prolongs the action potential duration of cardiomyocytes and the QT interval on the ECG. Prolonged repolarization can result in early afterdepolarizations, which are caused by inward currents through sodium and calcium channels and can trigger torsade de pointes. In addition to causing hERG block, balanced ion channel-blocking drugs block the L-type calcium and/or late sodium currents.

- **Antiarrhythmic effects**: While balanced ion channel block can prolong both the action potential duration of cardiomyocytes and the QT interval on the ECG, the block of inward currents (calcium, late sodium) prevents the occurrence of early afterdepolarizations and has antiarrhythmic effects. In addition, balanced ion channel block causes different morphology changes in the action potential and the ECG than predominant hERG block.

The goal of the CiPA phase I ECG validation study described in this article is outlined above.

### Vanflyta [^113Tq9tS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warning**: QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and cardiac arrest - Vanflyta prolongs the QT interval in a dose- and concentration-related manner [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Prior to Vanflyta administration and periodically, monitor for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and correct deficiencies. Perform ECGs to monitor the QTc at baseline, weekly during induction and consolidation therapy, weekly for at least the first month of maintenance, and periodically thereafter [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest have occurred in patients receiving Vanflyta. Do not administer Vanflyta to patients with severe hypokalemia, severe hypomagnesemia, or long QT syndrome [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Do not initiate treatment with Vanflyta or escalate the Vanflyta dose if the QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) is greater than 450 ms [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Monitor ECGs more frequently if concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval is required [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Reduce the Vanflyta dose when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A inhibitors, as they may increase quizartinib exposure [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Because of the risk of QT prolongation, Vanflyta is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Vanflyta REMS [see Warnings].

### SPL drug information for flecainide acetate [^114qE2xa]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Regarding the use of flecainide acetate PO (also known as Tambocor) in pregnant patients for all trimesters, the drug should only be used if the benefits outweigh the potential risks. There is evidence of fetal harm in animals. Flecainide acetate PO is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorization system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age without an increase in the frequency of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Recorlev [^111ePKG5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Recorlev is associated with dose-related QT interval prolongation, which may lead to life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. During Studies 1 and 2, patients with a baseline QTcF interval greater than 470 msec were excluded. However, 4 (2.4%) patients experienced QTcF > 500 msec, and 23 (14.7%) patients experienced a change-from-baseline QTcF > 60 msec. Resolution typically occurred following a dosage interruption and, in some cases, correction of electrolyte abnormalities.

Recorlev may also elevate plasma concentrations of certain drugs known to prolong QT intervals. Prolongation of the QT interval from these drugs can result in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

Recorlev is contraindicated in patients taking other drugs known to cause QT interval prolongation associated with ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes. It is also contraindicated in patients with a prolonged QTcF interval of greater than 470 msec at baseline, a history of torsades de pointes, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or long QT syndrome (including a first-degree family history) [see Contraindications (4), Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

Use Recorlev with caution in patients with other risk factors for QT prolongation, such as congestive heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, and uncorrected electrolyte abnormalities, with more frequent ECG monitoring considered.

Obtain a baseline QT interval measurement and regularly monitor ECG for an effect on the QT interval.

### Torsades de pointes caused by mibefradil [^117RcX1C]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2001). Low credibility.

We report a case of symptomatic torsades de pointes due to QTc prolongation caused by mibefradil, which potentially explains unexpected deaths related to this drug. Multiple episodes of torsades de pointes were documented in a 76-year-old woman with significant QTc prolongation of 0.53 seconds. After discontinuation of mibefradil, QTc intervals normalized and no further ventricular tachyarrhythmias were observed. We conclude that mibefradil can cause QTc prolongation and life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias.

### Effect of flecainide and ibutilide alone and in combination to terminate and prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation [^112wMFmB]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). High credibility.

Our experimental results demonstrate that a combination of flecainide and ibutilide possesses an additive or synergistic effect to terminate and prevent the recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF). Moreover, the drug combination has a low probability of causing long-QT–mediated ventricular arrhythmias in our experimental setting. In the clinic, ibutilide and flecainide, when used separately, convert paroxysmal AF to sinus rhythm in 30% to 50% of patients versus placebo. Ibutilide has been reported to induce torsades de pointes (TdP) in up to 8.3% of patients. We postulate that the combination of flecainide and ibutilide may additively or synergistically cardiovert AF and prevent its recurrence compared with monotherapy, with little to no risk of TdP in patients with AF.

### Long-term outcomes in patients treated with flecainide for atrial fibrillation with stable coronary artery disease [^115ZZiFn]. American Heart Journal (2022). Low credibility.

Class 1C antiarrhythmic drugs (AAD) have been associated with harm in patients treated for ventricular arrhythmias with a prior myocardial infarction. Consensus guidelines have advocated that these drugs not be used in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). However, long-term data are lacking to know if unique risks exist when these drugs are used for atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with CAD without a prior myocardial infarction.

- **Methods**: In 24,315 patients treated with the initiation of AADs, two populations were evaluated: (1) propensity-matched AF patients with CAD were created based upon AAD class (flecainide, n = 1,114, vs class-3 AAD, n = 1,114) and (2) AF patients who had undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft (flecainide, n = 150, and class-3 AAD, n = 1,453). Outcomes at 3 years for mortality, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, ventricular tachycardia (VT), and MACE were compared between the groups.

- **Results**: At 3 years, mortality (9.1% vs. 19.3%, P < .0001), HF hospitalization (12.5% vs. 18.3%, P < .0001), MACE (22.9% vs. 36.6%, P < .0001), and VT (5.8% vs. 8.5%, P = .02) rates were significantly lower in the flecainide group for population 1. In population 2, adverse event rates were also lower, although not significantly, in the flecainide compared to the class-3 AAD group for mortality (20.9% vs. 25.8%, P = .26), HF hospitalization (24.5% vs. 26.1%, P = .73), VT (10.9% vs. 14.7%, P = .28) and MACE (44.5% vs. 49.5%, P = .32).

- **Conclusions**: Flecainide in select patients with stable CAD for AF has a favorable outcome profile compared to class-3 AADs.

### Flecainide therapy reduces exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [^11554z1k]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of flecainide in addition to conventional drug therapy in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT). CPVT is an inherited arrhythmia syndrome caused by gene mutations that destabilize cardiac ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release channels. Sudden cardiac death is incompletely prevented by conventional drug therapy with β-blockers with or without Ca(2+) channel blockers. The antiarrhythmic agent flecainide directly targets the molecular defect in CPVT by inhibiting premature Ca(2+) release and triggered beats in vitro.

Data were collected from every consecutive genotype-positive CPVT patient started on flecainide at 8 international centers before December 2009. The primary outcome measure was the reduction of ventricular arrhythmias during exercise testing. Thirty-three patients received flecainide because of exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias despite conventional (for different reasons, not always optimal) therapy (median age 25 years; range 7 to 68 years; 73% female). Exercise tests comparing flecainide in addition to conventional therapy with conventional therapy alone were available for 29 patients.

Twenty-two patients (76%) had either partial (n = 8) or complete (n = 14) suppression of exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias with flecainide (p < 0.001). No patient experienced worsening of exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias. The median daily flecainide dose in responders was 150 mg (range 100 to 300 mg). During a median follow-up of 20 months, significant improvements were observed.

### Effect of flecainide and ibutilide alone and in combination to terminate and prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation [^111NCWHg]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). Low credibility.

Clinical data on the combination of class IC and III antiarrhythmic agents for cardioversion and prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF) are limited. Hongo et al. reported the efficacy and safety of intravenous ibutilide to acutely cardiovert AF and atrial flutter in 71 non-responder patients receiving class IC agents long-term (oral flecainide or propafenone; daily for more than three months). Ibutilide was shown to cardiovert AF/atrial flutter in 48% of these patients within one hour, which is within the range of AF/atrial flutter cardioversion reported with ibutilide alone.

However, one patient developed sustained torsades de pointes (TdP) and another had non-sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) following ibutilide administration and AF cardioversion. In these two patients, ibutilide caused a significant QT prolongation to QT values ≥ 500 ms, versus an average of 437 ± 62 ms in all patients. The incidence of adverse effects with the use of ibutilide on top of class IC agents was similar to that with ibutilide alone.

It is noteworthy that the administration of class I agents was chronic (daily pills) and not simultaneous with intravenous ibutilide. Considering these factors and a much briefer Tmax for intravenous ibutilide (minutes) versus oral flecainide/propafenone (hours), ibutilide plasma concentration is expected to be relatively high compared with that of the class I agent soon after ibutilide administration. This results in an increased risk of ventricular proarrhythmia. It seems that for optimal efficacy and safety in the clinic, the application of the ibutilide and flecainide combination should be designed to significantly overlap the concentration levels of the drugs in blood.

- **Warning on QT prolongation, torsades de pointes, and cardiac arrest**: See full prescribing information for the complete boxed warning. Vanflyta prolongs the QT interval. Prior to Vanflyta administration and periodically, perform electrocardiograms (ECGs), monitor for hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, and correct deficiencies.

- **Patient restrictions**: Torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest have occurred in patients receiving Vanflyta. Do not administer Vanflyta to patients with severe hypokalemia, severe hypomagnesemia, or long QT syndrome. Do not initiate treatment with Vanflyta or escalate the Vanflyta dose if the QT interval corrected by Fridericia's formula (QTcF) is greater than 450 ms.

- **Drug interactions and monitoring**: Monitor ECGs more frequently if concomitant use of drugs known to prolong the QT interval is required. Reduce the Vanflyta dose when used concomitantly with strong CYP3A inhibitors, as they may increase quizartinib exposure.

- **Restricted availability**: Vanflyta is available only through a restricted program called the Vanflyta Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).

### The use of isoproterenol and phenytoin to reverse torsade de pointes [^1178iBS1]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Torsade de pointes is a form of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that differs from other forms of ventricular tachycardia in its morphology, precipitating factors, and therapeutic approach. Its recognition is of utmost importance, as the standard anti-arrhythmic drugs might not only be ineffective in its termination but also may aggravate it. Herein, we report a case of antipsychotic-induced torsade de pointes and describe the use of magnesium sulfate, isoproterenol, and phenytoin and their proposed mechanism of action.

### Guidance on short-term management of atrial fibrillation in coronavirus disease 2019 [^111vnxaR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Low credibility.

Flecainide is a use‐dependent I Na blocker with a moderate negative inotropic effect. Because of the specific blocking effect on I Na, unlike class IA, flecainide delays depolarization (prolonging QRS duration) with minimal effect on ventricular repolarization (QT interval). However, there are several case reports stating that flecainide can lead to prolonged QT and torsade de pointes. Flecainide is predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6. Flecainide is reasonable for pharmacological cardioversion in the short‐term setting and can be used to maintain sinus rhythm in patients without coronary artery disease or structural heart disease. Because of possible increases in plasma concentration of flecainide when administered with hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (CYP2D6 inhibitors), we recommend sequential electrocardiographic monitoring before and after drug initiation.

Propafenone is an I Na blocker with mild β‐blocking effect (negative inotropic and chronotropic effect) and is predominantly metabolized by CYP2D6. Similar to flecainide, propafenone has minimal effect on repolarization. We recommend monitoring for QRS/QT prolongation when administered with hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir (CYP2D6 inhibitors). Given documented prolonged QT from I Kr blockade by azithromycin, we also recommend ECG monitoring when azithromycin is used with class IC AADs.

Because myocarditis and CHF are common clinical manifestations in critically ill COVID‐19 patients, the use of class IC AADs in this population needs to be exercised with caution.

### Further evidence of inherited long QT syndrome gene mutations in antiarrhythmic drug-associated torsades de pointes [^113dkSxV]. Heart Rhythm (2007). High credibility.

Pathophysiologically significant ion-channel mutations have been detected in only a minority of cases of acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS).

- **Objective**: The aim of this study was to clarify the putative role of subclinical inherited LQTS in drug-associated torsades de pointes (TdP) and to assess the concomitant proarrhythmic factors.

- **Methods**: We evaluated 16 consecutive cases with documented antiarrhythmic drug-induced TdP who were referred to the Laboratory of Molecular Medicine at Helsinki University for LQTS genetic testing between September 2000 and August 2005.

- **Results**: A prolonged QTc interval was observed in 56% of the patients before administration of the drug. TdP was associated with amiodarone in seven, sotalol in six, flecainide in two, and propafenone in one of the cases. Except for the culprit drug, one or more risk factors such as female sex, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation were present in each drug-associated TdP case. DNA samples were screened for the four common Finnish founder mutations (KCNQ1 G589D and IVS7–2A→G, HERG L552S, and R176W), which are known to account for the majority of inherited LQTS in Finland. A total of three (19%) individuals carried one of these four mutations.

- **Conclusions**: Our data show that previously unsuspected LQTS mutations may be present in patients with antiarrhythmic drug-associated TdPs. A normal QTc interval does not exclude the risk of proarrhythmia.

### Perioperative torsade de pointes: A systematic review of published case reports [^113XW4Mt]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2013). Low credibility.

Torsade de pointes is a rare but potentially fatal arrhythmia. More than 40 cases of perioperative torsade de pointes have been reported in the literature; however, the evidence regarding this complication is very limited. To improve our understanding, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published case reports of perioperative torsade de pointes.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE was systematically searched for cases of perioperative torsade de pointes. We included patients of all age groups and cases that occurred from the immediate preoperative period to the third postoperative day. Patient and case characteristics, as well as QT interval data, were extracted.

- **Results**: Forty-six cases of perioperative torsade de pointes were identified; 29 occurred in women (67%), and 2 episodes were fatal (case fatality rate: 4%). Craniotomies and cardiac surgery accounted for 40% of all cases. Preceding events identified by the authors were hypokalemia (12/46, 26%; 99% confidence interval, 9%-43%) and bradycardia (7/46, 15%; 99% CI, 2%-28%). Drugs were implicated in approximately one third of the events (14/46, 30%; 99% CI, 13%-48%). The mean corrected QT (QTc) at baseline was 457 ± 67 milliseconds (minimum 320 milliseconds; maximum 647 milliseconds; data available in 27/46 patients). At the time of the event, the mean QTc increased to 575 ± 77 milliseconds (minimum 413 milliseconds; maximum 766 milliseconds; data available in 33/46 patients). On average, QTc increased by +118 milliseconds (99% CI, 70–166 milliseconds; P < 0.001) between baseline and after.

### Amiodarone — avoid the danger of torsade de pointes [^113sussL]. Resuscitation (2008). Low credibility.

We present two patients who experienced life-threatening arrhythmias highly likely secondary to amiodarone. This class III anti-arrhythmic is commonly prescribed for the acute presentation of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. However, its use can occasionally transform arrhythmias from benign to dangerous. These cases highlight the need for careful attention to the indications, cautions, and contraindications of amiodarone, as well as the need for vigilance following the initiation of anti-arrhythmic therapy.

### Effect of flecainide and ibutilide alone and in combination to terminate and prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation [^116NQiJL]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). Low credibility.

There is a need for improved approaches to rhythm control therapy of atrial fibrillation (AF). Here, we examine the efficacy and safety of a combination of two commonly used antiarrhythmics. Flecainide and ibutilide are antiarrhythmic drugs that belong to class I and class III, respectively. They are commonly used for cardioversion and prevention of AF. Their efficacy to acutely cardiovert paroxysmal AF ranges between 30% and 50% compared with placebo.

A critical side effect of ibutilide is the risk for the development of acquired long QT and related ventricular proarrhythmia, such as Torsades de Pointes (TdP). Previous studies have shown that such risk can be reduced or eliminated by concomitant inhibition of the late component of the sodium channel current (late I Na). Flecainide has also been shown to inhibit late I Na.

The principal aim of the study was to investigate the effects of flecainide and ibutilide, alone and in combination, on atrial and ventricular electrophysiological parameters, as well as their effects in preventing the induction of AF and the ability to terminate AF in canine-isolated coronary-perfused cardiac preparations. A secondary aim was to assess the safety of the drug combination with respect to the development of long-QT-mediated TdP in canine left ventricular (LV) preparations.

### Tikosyn [^114GjcnQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Use in women**: Female patients constituted 32% of the participants in the placebo-controlled trials of Tikosyn. As with other drugs that cause Torsade de Pointes, Tikosyn was associated with a greater risk of Torsade de Pointes in female patients than in male patients. During the Tikosyn clinical development program, the risk of Torsade de Pointes in females was approximately three times the risk in males. Unlike Torsade de Pointes, the incidence of other ventricular arrhythmias was similar in female patients receiving Tikosyn and those receiving placebo. Although no study specifically investigated this risk, post-hoc analyses revealed no increased mortality in females on Tikosyn compared to females on placebo.

- **Pediatric use**: The safety and effectiveness of Tikosyn in children (< 18 years old) has not been established.

### Flecainide is associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmic events in a large cohort of patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [^114s6YXn]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

The study observed the incidence of arrhythmic events before diagnosis, during the pre-flecainide period, and in the on-flecainide period among patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT).

- **Flowchart analysis**: The flowchart illustrated the study cohort, presenting the number of patients with arrhythmic events throughout these periods.
- **AE distribution analysis**: The distribution of arrhythmic events per patient-year was noted during the study. Before initiation of flecainide treatment, and once it was initiated, each patient's arrhythmic event rate was recorded, which is depicted per patient-year.

- **Study findings**: The median duration of follow-up for patients on flecainide was 2.9 years (IQR, 1.0–6.0). During this period, 23 patients (9%) experienced a total of 38 AEs, which included: 1 (3%) sudden cardiac death (SCD), 5 (13%) sudden cardiac arrests (SCA), 16 (42%) appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks, and 16 syncopes (42%), corresponding to an event rate of 4.0 per 100 patient-years. Of these, 13 patients (57%) were on a nonselective beta-blocker, and 2 (9%) had undergone left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD). The median dose of flecainide given during the AEs in the on-flecainide period was 2.5 mg/kg per day (IQR, 1.9–4.0), though this was unknown in 5 patients.

- **Multiple AE cases**: In the post-flecainide phase, 5 patients experienced multiple AEs: 1 patient had 2 AEs, 2 patients had 3 AEs, 1 patient had 4 AEs, and another had 8 AEs. Importantly, the rate of AEs decreased in the post-flecainide period compared to the pre-flecainide period in 2 out of these 5 patients.

### Flecainide acetate [^115htfhs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When urinary pH is very alkaline (8 or higher), as may occur in rare conditions (e.g. renal tubular acidosis, strict vegetarian diet), flecainide elimination from plasma is much slower.

The elimination of flecainide from the body depends on renal function (i.e. 10 to 50% appears in urine as unchanged drug). With increasing renal impairment, the extent of unchanged drug excretion in urine is reduced and the plasma half-life of flecainide is prolonged. Since flecainide is also extensively metabolized, there is no simple relationship between creatinine clearance and the rate of flecainide elimination from plasma.

In patients with NYHA class III congestive heart failure (CHF), the rate of flecainide elimination from plasma (mean half-life, 19 hours) is moderately slower than for healthy subjects (mean half-life, 14 hours), but similar to the rate for patients with PVCs without CHF. The extent of excretion of unchanged drug in urine is also similar.

For children under one year of age, currently available data are limited but suggest that the half-life at birth may be as long as 29 hours, decreasing to 11 to 12 hours by three months of age and 6 hours by one year of age. The pharmacokinetics in hydropic infants have not been studied, but case reports suggest prolonged elimination. In children aged 1 year to 12 years, the half-life is approximately 8 hours. In adolescents (age 12 to 15), the plasma elimination half-life is approximately 11 to 12 hours. Since milk may inhibit absorption in infants, a reduction in flecainide absorption may occur.

### Flecainide is associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmic events in a large cohort of patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [^111bLZnZ]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

In severely affected patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, beta-blockers often provide insufficient protection. This study aimed to evaluate whether flecainide is associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmic events (AEs) when added to beta-blockers in a large cohort of these patients.

From two international registries, this multicenter case cross-over study included patients with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia who received added flecainide to their beta-blocker therapy. The study period was defined by unchanged background therapy within individual patients, including beta-blocker type (beta1-selective or nonselective), left cardiac sympathetic denervation, and implantable cardioverter defibrillator treatment status. This period was divided into pre-flecainide and on-flecainide phases. The primary endpoint was the number of AEs, defined as sudden cardiac death, sudden cardiac arrest, appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator shock, and arrhythmic syncope. The association between flecainide and AE rates was assessed through a generalized linear mixed model, assuming a negative binomial distribution and random effects for patients.

A total of 247 patients (123 females, 50%) with a median age of 18 years at the start of flecainide (interquartile range, 14–29) and a median flecainide dose of 2.2 mg/kg per day (interquartile range, 1.7–3.1) were included. At baseline, all patients were using a beta-blocker, and 70 patients (28%) had an…

### The mechanism of flecainide action in CPVT does not involve a direct effect on RyR2 [^114DzfgM]. Circulation Research (2015). Low credibility.

Flecainide, a class 1c antiarrhythmic, has emerged as an effective therapy in preventing arrhythmias in patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) refractory to β-adrenergic receptor blockade. It has been proposed that the clinical efficacy of flecainide in CPVT is due to the combined actions of direct blockade of ryanodine receptors (RyR2) and Na(+) channel inhibition. However, there is presently no direct evidence to support the notion that flecainide blocks RyR2 Ca(2+) flux in the physiologically relevant (luminal-to-cytoplasmic) direction. The mechanism of flecainide action remains controversial.

- **Objective**: To examine, in detail, the effect of flecainide on the human RyR2 channel and to establish whether the direct blockade of physiologically relevant RyR2 ion flow by the drug contributes to its therapeutic efficacy in the clinical management of CPVT.

- **Methods and results**: Using single-channel analysis, we show that, even at supraphysiological concentrations, flecainide did not inhibit the physiologically relevant, luminal-to-cytosolic flux of cations through the channel. Moreover, flecainide did not alter RyR2 channel gating and had negligible effect on the mechanisms responsible for the sarcoplasmic reticulum charge-compensating counter current. Using permeabilized cardiac myocytes to eliminate any contribution of plasmalemmal Na(+) channels to the observed actions of the drug at the cellular level, flecainide did not inhibit RyR2-dependent sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) release.

- **Conclusions**: The principal action of flecainide does not involve a direct effect on RyR2-dependent mechanisms.

### Flecainide acetate [^113zH5Hb]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

When amiodarone is added to flecainide therapy, plasma flecainide levels may increase two-fold or more in some patients if flecainide dosage is not reduced. See dosage and administration. Drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450IID6, such as quinidine, might increase the plasma concentrations of flecainide in patients that are on chronic flecainide therapy, especially if these patients are extensive metabolizers.

There has been little experience with the coadministration of flecainide acetate and either disopyramide or verapamil. Because both of these drugs have negative inotropic properties and the effects of coadministration with flecainide acetate are unknown, neither disopyramide nor verapamil should be administered concurrently with flecainide acetate unless, in the judgment of the physician, the benefits of this combination outweigh the risks. There has been too little experience with the coadministration of flecainide acetate with nifedipine or diltiazem to recommend concomitant use.

- **Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility**: Long-term studies with flecainide in rats and mice at doses up to 60 mg/kg/day have not revealed any compound-related carcinogenic effects. Mutagenicity studies (Ames test, mouse lymphoma, and in vivo cytogenetics) did not reveal any mutagenic effects. A rat reproduction study at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day (seven times the usual human dose) did not reveal any adverse effect on male or female fertility.

- **Pregnancy**: Pregnancy category C. Flecainide has been shown to have teratogenic effects (club paws, sternebrae, and vertebrae abnormal…).

### Flecainide acetate [^114PreTA]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

In post-myocardial infarction patients with asymptomatic PVCs and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, flecainide acetate therapy was associated with a 5.1% rate of death and non-fatal cardiac arrest, compared with a 2.3% rate in a matched placebo group. See warnings for more details.

Adverse effects reported for flecainide acetate, described in detail in the warnings section, include new or worsened arrhythmias which occurred in 1% of 108 patients with PSVT and in 7% of 117 patients with PAF, and new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias which occurred in 7% of 1330 patients with PVCs, non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia. In patients treated with flecainide for sustained ventricular tachycardia, 80% (51/64) of proarrhythmic events occurred within 14 days of the onset of therapy. For 198 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia, there was a 13% incidence of new or exacerbated ventricular arrhythmias when the dosage was initiated at 200 mg/day with slow upward titration, not exceeding 300 mg/day in most patients. Flecainide acetate treatment has been associated with episodes of unresuscitatable ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation (cardiac arrest). See warnings for further information.

New or worsened congestive heart failure (CHF) occurred in 6.3% of 1046 patients with PVCs, non-sustained or sustained ventricular tachycardia. Out of 297 patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia, 9.1% experienced new or worsened CHF. In patients with supraventricular arrhythmias, new or worsened CHF was reported in 0.4% of 225 cases. There have also been instances of second-degree (0.5%) or third-degree (0.4%) AV block. Patients have developed sinus bradycardia, sinus pause, or sinus arrest in about 1.2% of cases.

### Drug-induced torsades de pointes: The evolving role of pharmacogenetics [^116ptepX]. Heart Rhythm (2005). Low credibility.

Drug-induced torsades de pointes (TdP) is a rare but potentially lethal side effect of drugs, including many commonly prescribed noncardiac medications. Despite its low frequency, drug-induced TdP has generated considerable concern among physicians and pharmaceutical companies, and has at times led to rare but significant tragedies among patients. Even though many patients who have died suddenly due to drug-induced TdP had identifiable risk factors, predicting individual cases remains challenging.

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in understanding the fundamental pathogenic mechanisms that underpin drug-induced TdP. The majority of drugs associated with "QT liability" and potential for drug-induced TdP, including those removed from the market for this side effect, are "HERG (human ether-á-go-go-related gene) blockers". These drugs inhibit the KCNH2-encoded HERG potassium channel, a critical factor in the heart's action potential repolarization. As a result, myocyte repolarization may be delayed, evidenced by the prolongation of the QT interval, thereby providing a substrate for drug-induced TdP.

Rare mutations in KCNH2 provide the pathogenic substrate for type 2 congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS), placing this cardiac potassium channel at the intersection between congenital LQTS (considered the "Rosetta stone" of heritable channelopathies) and acquired LQTS (drug-induced TdP). Furthermore, common polymorphisms in LQTS-causing channel genes may also play a role in susceptibility.

### Flecainide is associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmic events in a large cohort of patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [^113pmMZC]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

The outcomes of patients on flecainide according to arrhythmic events (AEs) before diagnosis and during the pre-flecainide period are summarized in Figure 2. In the overall cohort, comprising the first group of 247 patients, the median duration of the pre-flecainide follow-up was 2.1 years (IQR, 0.4–7.2). During the pre-flecainide period, 41 patients on beta-blocker monotherapy (17%) experienced a total of 58 AEs. This included 4 instances of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) (7%), 34 appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks (59%), and 20 episodes of syncope (34%), corresponding to an annual event rate of 5.6 per 100 patient-years (Figure 3).

- **Beta-blocker use**: Of these patients, 21 (51%) used a nonselective beta-blocker, and 5 (12%) had undergone left cardiac sympathetic denervation (LCSD).

Nine patients experienced multiple AEs during the pre-flecainide period: 5 patients had 2 AEs, 1 patient had 3 AEs, 2 patients had 4 AEs, and 1 patient had 5 AEs. The AE rate was higher in the pre-flecainide period compared to the post-flecainide period in all 9 patients.

### Flecainide is associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmic events in a large cohort of patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia [^112LBeuj]. Circulation (2023). High credibility.

In severely affected patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, beta-blockers are often insufficiently protective. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether flecainide is associated with a lower incidence of arrhythmic events (AEs) when added to beta-blockers in a large cohort of these patients.

- **Methods**: From two international registries, this multicenter case cross-over study included patients with a clinical or genetic diagnosis of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in whom flecainide was added to beta-blocker therapy. The study period was defined as the interval in which background therapy (i.e. beta-blocker type [beta1-selective or nonselective]), left cardiac sympathetic denervation, and implantable cardioverter defibrillator treatment status remained unchanged within individual patients. The period was divided into pre-flecainide and on-flecainide phases. The primary endpoint was AEs, defined as sudden cardiac death, sudden cardiac arrest, appropriate implantable cardioverter defibrillator shock, and arrhythmic syncope. The association of flecainide with AE rates was assessed using a generalized linear mixed model assuming a negative binomial distribution and random effects for patients.

- **Results**: A total of 247 patients (123 [50%] females; median age at the start of flecainide, 18 years [interquartile range, 14–29]; median flecainide dose, 2.2 mg/kg per day [interquartile range, 1.7–3.1]) were included. At baseline, all patients used a beta-blocker, and 70 (28%) had additional treatments.

### Effect of flecainide and ibutilide alone and in combination to terminate and prevent recurrence of atrial fibrillation [^1167Gqsd]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2024). Low credibility.

The safety of anti-AF agents is critical in the clinical management of patients with AF. The safety and efficacy of both flecainide and ibutilide for acute cardioversion of episodes of AF have been extensively reported, and the recommendations for their use and respective contraindications have been reviewed in medical guidelines. For example, there is a known risk of flecainide inducing ventricular proarrhythmia in patients with myocardial ischemia and structural heart disease, yet flecainide is generally safe in patients without significant structural heart disease. More recently, the safety of flecainide in patients with nonobstructive and stable coronary artery disease has been reported.

- **Use of ibutilide**: The use of ibutilide is associated with a substantial risk of acquired long-QT syndrome and associated life-threatening tachyarrhythmias. In our experiments, the TdP score increased from 0 in control to 4 in the presence of ibutilide and dropped to 1 following the addition of flecainide, denoting no or low risk for the development of TdP with the drug combination. The electrophysiological protection mechanism of the drug combination against TdP is most likely due to the action of flecainide to inhibit late I_Na. Inhibition of late I_Na under conditions of reduced repolarization reserve (i.e. due to reduction of I_Kr and augmentation of late I_Na) acts to protect against the risk of excessive prolongation of QT and induction of TdP.
