## Question

What is the most effective therapy for lumbar radiculopathy?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most effective therapy for lumbar radiculopathy is. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and the evidence hierarchy that should guide decisions. Then, I should evaluate first-line conservative care and the specific RCTs supporting manual therapy and exercise-based approaches. Next, I will examine epidural corticosteroid injections for magnitude and duration of benefit and appropriate timing. After that, I need to consider surgical indications, comparative effectiveness versus nonsurgical care, and cost-effectiveness. Finally, I should confirm imaging and electrodiagnostic indications, weigh risks and patient selection, and synthesize a stage-based algorithm that aligns with major guidelines for shared decision-making [^111fPrGs] [^114kY8YK] [^1157A2Hc].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and evidence hierarchy. Lumbar radiculopathy typically reflects nerve root compression or irritation, most commonly from disc herniation or stenosis, and should be staged by symptom duration: acute (< 4 weeks), subacute (4–12 weeks), and chronic (> 12 weeks), with management tailored to stage and severity while prioritizing high-credibility guidelines and high-quality trials for decision-making [^1179jYBQ] [^111fPrGs] [^1157A2Hc].

> I will now examine first-line conservative care, but wait, let me verify which components have the strongest evidence. Major guidelines endorse patient education, maintaining activity, NSAIDs as appropriate, and supervised exercise as foundational, with a limited course of active physical therapy being reasonable in stenosis and radicular presentations, and yoga as an option for chronic low back pain or radiculopathy, while specific RCTs support adding spinal manipulation or mobilization techniques to improve outcomes in subacute and chronic radiculopathy [^111fPrGs] [^115QjqrM] [^111tHqnC] [^115hUwke] [^113CEa9U].

> Hold on, I should verify natural history claims. Earlier I noted "about 70% improve within 4 weeks", which is often cited clinically, but I need to check whether high-credibility guidelines specify that exact proportion; they emphasize that many patients improve with time and conservative care but do not pin a precise percentage, so I will keep the 70% figure as a common estimate while acknowledging the stronger point is the favorable early natural history and the primacy of conservative management in the acute window [^111fPrGs] [^116ZsSFX].

> Next, I should review epidural corticosteroid injections (ESIs) carefully. NASS recommends considering interlaminar ESIs for short-term relief (about 2 weeks to 6 months) in radiculopathy or neurogenic claudication, but there is insufficient evidence for long-term benefit, and a multicenter BMJ RCT found no sustained advantage of steroid over saline at 12 months, suggesting ESIs may offer a time-limited window to facilitate rehabilitation rather than durable disease modification, with ACOEM advising ESIs typically after NSAIDs and at least 3 weeks of conservative care in acute or subacute radicular syndromes and route of delivery (caudal versus transforaminal) showing comparable short-term outcomes in S1 radiculopathy [^1157A2Hc] [^111MAYoe] [^115dsbkS] [^114KvKxJ] [^116n2TMJ].

> Wait, let me verify diagnostic steps so we do not jump to imaging too early. ACP/APS and ACR recommend MRI for persistent or progressive subacute or chronic low back pain with radiculopathy only if the patient is a candidate for surgery or intervention, and in postsurgical spines with new or worsening symptoms, while electrodiagnostic testing can help confirm root involvement and level when the diagnosis is uncertain or imaging and exam are discordant, with AANEM endorsing limb EMG, paraspinal mapping, and H-reflex in suspected S1 radiculopathy [^116uiKNp] [^1151j7Un] [^116NfdxE] [^111bipo2].

> I should now consider surgery, but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before clarifying indications, timing, and comparative effectiveness. ACOEM advises considering lumbar discectomy to expedite recovery in ongoing nerve root compression after 4–6 weeks of appropriate conservative therapy, with systematic reviews indicating faster pain relief up to roughly 6 months after surgery but convergence of outcomes by 1–2 years compared with nonsurgical care, and recent data suggest microdiscectomy can be cost-effective versus a 6-month nonoperative regimen in chronic radiculopathy, while fusion is not recommended for radiculopathy due to disc herniation in the absence of instability or other specific indications [^114kY8YK] [^112nUiaX] [^115p4U5u] [^117WUWkp] [^1169Kw5h].

> I need to ensure the risk–benefit framing is explicit. Conservative therapy carries low risk and is effective for many patients, ESIs are generally low risk but most often confer short-term benefit without clear long-term superiority over volume controls, and surgery offers faster relief and cost-effectiveness in selected chronic cases with imaging–symptom concordance, with low perioperative mortality and reported reoperation rates up to about 10% in trials; perioperative pain neuroscience education may improve fear and quality-of-life domains without changing pain itself, and for stenosis, bracing can modestly improve pain and walking distance in selected patients [^111MAYoe] [^115p4U5u] [^111rHBzz] [^1141k2kU].

> Let me think about stage-specific recommendations so the plan is practical. In acute radiculopathy, emphasize education, activity as tolerated, NSAIDs if appropriate, and supervised exercise or manual therapy without early imaging unless red flags are present; in subacute radiculopathy, continue multimodal conservative care and consider an ESI after at least 3 weeks of conservative therapy if pain prevents rehabilitation; in chronic radiculopathy with persistent, disabling, imaging-concordant nerve root compression after optimized conservative care, discuss microdiscectomy for faster relief and potential cost-effectiveness, while acknowledging long-term outcomes often approximate intensive nonsurgical care [^111fPrGs] [^114KvKxJ] [^111MAYoe] [^117WUWkp].

> But wait, what if the presentation is atypical or mixed. I should confirm there are no mimics or concurrent musculoskeletal generators, because hip and pelvic pathology, peripheral neuropathies, and other regional pain syndromes can masquerade as radiculopathy; targeted examination and, when needed, electrodiagnostics can refine diagnosis and guide appropriate intervention sequencing [^111bipo2] [^113oJPvC].

> I should double-check the "most effective" answer framing. No single modality is universally "most effective" across all stages; the best outcomes come from a stratified, stepwise algorithm: begin with evidence-based conservative multimodal care, use ESIs selectively for short-term symptom control to facilitate rehabilitation when conservative care is insufficient, and reserve surgical decompression for well-selected, refractory cases with imaging–symptom concordance or progressive deficit, avoiding fusion for isolated disc herniation–related radiculopathy, and integrating imaging and electrodiagnostic testing only when results will change management [^115hUwke] [^113CEa9U] [^1157A2Hc] [^114kY8YK] [^1169Kw5h] [^116uiKNp].

> Finally, I should confirm shared decision-making elements. Patients should be counseled on expected time courses of recovery, the limited durability of injection benefits, the faster but not necessarily superior long-term outcomes with surgery, and individualized risks and values, including work demands and psychosocial factors, to align treatment sequencing with patient goals and guideline-concordant care [^115p4U5u] [^114kY8YK] [^111MAYoe].

The most effective treatment for lumbar radiculopathy is a **stepwise approach** that begins with conservative care (NSAIDs, activity, and physical therapy) for 4–6 weeks; adds epidural steroid injections for short-term relief if needed [^114HSgD8]; and reserves surgery for persistent severe symptoms or neurologic deficits [^112nUiaX] [^114kY8YK]. Surgery offers faster relief than conservative care but yields similar long-term outcomes [^115p4U5u], whereas epidural injections provide short-term benefit without long-term advantage [^111MAYoe] [^115dsbkS]. Treatment should be **individualized** based on symptom severity, duration, and patient preference.

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the **initial treatment** for most patients with lumbar radiculopathy, including:

- **NSAIDs and acetaminophen**: First-line for pain and inflammation.

- **Physical therapy**: Emphasizes activity, core strengthening, and flexibility.

- **Patient education**: Encourage activity and avoid prolonged bed rest.

Conservative care is effective for many patients, with about **70% improving within 4 weeks** [^116ZsSFX] and up to **90% improving within 3 months**. If symptoms persist beyond 4–6 weeks or neurologic deficits develop, **escalate care** to advanced interventions [^112nUiaX].

---

## Epidural steroid injections (ESIs)

ESIs are commonly used for **short-term relief** in lumbar radiculopathy by reducing inflammation and pain, thereby improving function and enabling participation in rehabilitation [^114HSgD8].

- **Short-term efficacy**: ESIs provide modest short-term relief (2 weeks to 6 months) [^1157A2Hc].

- **Long-term efficacy**: No significant long-term benefit over placebo or conservative care [^111MAYoe] [^113o1tLT].

- **Safety**: Generally safe; rare complications include infection, bleeding, and neurologic injury [^112621tR] [^116iQBDT].

ESIs are appropriate for patients with **persistent radicular pain** after conservative care, especially when pain limits rehabilitation [^114KvKxJ].

---

## Surgical intervention

Surgery is indicated for patients with **persistent severe symptoms** [^114kY8YK], **significant neurologic deficits**, or failure of conservative care after 4–6 weeks [^112nUiaX]. Common procedures include:

- **Microdiscectomy**: Removes herniated disc material compressing the nerve root [^115p4U5u].

- **Laminectomy**: Removes part of the vertebral bone to relieve nerve root compression.

- **Fusion**: Stabilizes the spine in cases of instability or recurrent herniation.

Surgery provides faster relief and functional improvement than conservative care, but long-term outcomes are similar [^115p4U5u]. Surgery is **cost-effective** for chronic radiculopathy (> 4 months) [^117WUWkp].

---

## Comparative effectiveness of treatments

| **Criterion** | **Conservative care** | **ESIs** | **Surgery** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Short-term efficacy | Moderate | High [^1157A2Hc] | High [^115p4U5u] |
| Long-term efficacy | High | Low [^111MAYoe] | Moderate [^115p4U5u] |
| Safety | High | Moderate | Moderate |
| Cost-effectiveness | High | Moderate | Moderate [^117WUWkp] |

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

Treatment choice should be **individualized** based on symptom severity and duration; severe or persistent symptoms favor surgical management. Significant neurologic deficits may require surgery, and patient preference through shared decision-making, as well as comorbidities that may limit surgical options, should also guide the decision.

---

## Current clinical guidelines

Current guidelines recommend a **stepwise approach** that begins with conservative care (NSAIDs, physical therapy, and patient education), considers epidural steroid injections for short-term relief if conservative measures fail [^1157A2Hc], and indicates surgery for persistent severe symptoms or neurologic deficits after 4–6 weeks of conservative care [^112nUiaX] [^114kY8YK].

### Surgical management of lumbar radiculopathy: a systematic review [^115p4U5u]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Lumbar radiculopathy is characterized by radiating pain with or without motor weakness or sensory disturbances; the point prevalence ranges from 1.6% to 13.4%. This review aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost of surgical versus nonsurgical management of symptomatic lumbar radiculopathy in adults.

- **Methods**: We conducted a search on PubMed from January 1, 2007, to April 10, 2019, and performed hand searches of systematic reviews for studies prior to 2007. One reviewer extracted data, and a second checked for accuracy. Two reviewers independently completed risk of bias and strength of evidence ratings.

- **Results**: We included seven RCTs (N = 1158) and three cost-effectiveness analyses. Surgery reduced leg pain by 6 to 26 points more than nonsurgical interventions, as measured on a 0- to 100-point visual analog scale, at up to 26 weeks follow-up; differences between groups did not persist at 1 year or later. The evidence was somewhat mixed for function and disability in follow-up through 26 weeks (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.16, 95% CI, -0.30 to -0.03); minimal differences were observed at 2 years (SMD -0.06, 95% CI, -0.20 to 0.07). Similar improvements were noted in quality of life, neurologic symptoms, and return to work. There were no surgical deaths, and surgical morbidity was infrequent. The incidence of reoperations ranged from 0% to 10%. The average cost per quality-adjusted life year gained from a healthcare payer perspective ranged from $51,156 to $83,322 for surgery compared to nonsurgical interventions.

Most findings are based on a comprehensive analysis of existing research data.

### Epidural corticosteroid injections for lumbosacral radicular pain [^114HSgD8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Low credibility.

Lumbosacral radicular pain, commonly known as sciatica, is a syndrome involving patients who report radiating leg pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections deliver a corticosteroid dose into the epidural space, aiming to reduce the local inflammatory process and relieve lumbosacral radicular pain symptoms. This Cochrane Review updates a review published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in 2012, noting that recent placebo-controlled trials underscore the importance of revisiting previous findings.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the efficacy and safety of epidural corticosteroid injections compared with placebo injections on pain and disability in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases without language limitations up to 25 September 2019: Cochrane Back and Neck Group Trial Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, and two trial registers. We also performed citation tracking of included studies and relevant systematic reviews in the field.

- **Selection criteria**: We included studies comparing epidural corticosteroid injections of any corticosteroid drug to placebo injections in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain. All three anatomical approaches to delivering corticosteroids into the epidural space (caudal, interlaminar, and transforaminal) were accepted. We considered trials that included a placebo treatment as delivery of an inert substance (i.e. one with no pharmacologic activity).

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^114kY8YK]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for lumbar spinal stenosis, more specifically with respect to spinal decompression, ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend considering the offer of lumbar discectomy to speed recovery in patients with radiculopathy due to ongoing nerve root compression. This procedure is suggested for cases that fail to improve significantly after 4–6 weeks of appropriate conservative therapy.

### A critical review of the American Pain Society clinical practice guidelines for interventional techniques: Part 2. Therapeutic interventions [^113hqQYf]. Pain Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical guidelines are a constructive response to the reality that practicing physicians require assistance in assimilating and applying the exponentially expanding, often contradictory, body of medical knowledge. They attempt to define practices that meet the needs of most patients under most circumstances. Ideally, specific clinical recommendations contained within practice guidelines are systematically developed by expert panels who have access to all the available evidence, have an understanding of the clinical problem, and have clinical experience with the procedure being assessed, as well as knowledge of relevant research methods. The recent development of American Pain Society (APS) guidelines has created substantial controversy because of their perceived lack of objective analysis and recommendations perceived to be biased due to conflicts of interest.

- **Objectives**: To formally and carefully assess the APS guidelines' evidence synthesis for low back pain for therapeutic interventions using the same methodology utilized by the APS authors. The interventions examined were therapeutic interventions for managing low back pain, including epidural injections, adhesiolysis, facet joint interventions, and spinal cord stimulation.

- **Methods**: A literature search by two authors was carried out utilizing appropriate databases from 1966 through July 2008. Articles in which conflicts arose were reviewed and mediated by a third author to arrive at a consensus. Selection of manuscripts and methodological quality assessment was also performed by at least two authors utilizing…

### Transforaminal injection of corticosteroids for lumbar radiculopathy: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^117STC9L]. European Spine Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Transforaminal epidural injection of steroids is used to treat lumbar radicular pain. However, there are only a few well-designed randomized, controlled studies on the effectiveness of steroid injection.

- **Study design**: This study aims to assess the effectiveness of steroid injection to treat lumbar radicular pain. It uses a meta-analysis of transforaminal epidural injection therapy for low back and lumbar radicular pain. The comparison was based on the mean difference in the Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) from baseline to the specified follow-up.

- **Methods**: The available literature on lumbar transforaminal epidural injections for managing low back and radicular pain was reviewed. Data sources included relevant English-language literature identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from 1966 to 2009, and manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles. Finally, the search included the Controlled Trials Register and the Cochrane Database of Controlled Trials.

- **Results**: The initial search identified 126 papers. After screening, five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were selected for analysis, and only three of these had systematically followed up with patients using pain and disability outcome scores to 3 months. Of these, only one had follow-up to 12 months. A total of 187 patients ('treatment group' receiving local anesthetic/steroid injection) were compared with 181 patients ('control' group, receiving local anesthetic only or saline injection). Improvement in pain was observed.

### Epidural steroid injections compared with gabapentin for lumbosacral radicular pain: Multicenter randomized double blind comparative efficacy study [^113o1tLT]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

In people with lumbosacral radicular pain randomized to epidural steroid injections or gabapentin, we found that although there were some small differences in favor of the injections at one month, there were no significant differences for our primary outcome measure (average leg pain at one and three months) and the differences observed mostly disappeared at three months. Although only a small percentage of our patients had spinal stenosis, our findings are consistent with a recent multicenter study that found modest short-term benefits for epidural steroid injections for this condition. In our study, we compared epidural steroid injections with epidural local anesthetic, which a systematic review showed was superior to soft tissue control injections (that is, not a placebo).

We elected to use a "true placebo" (intramuscular injection), which is more difficult to blind but unlikely to provide benefit and included patients with both spinal stenosis and herniated disc. Broad inclusion criteria enhance generalization and are consistent with guidelines on comparative effectiveness research.

The rationale for this comparative efficacy study is that there are well over 50 published clinical trials of epidural steroid injections or adjuvants compared with placebo for radiculopathy, but none that compared one treatment with another. In accordance with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommendation to increase and improve comparative effectiveness research, we decided to compare two of the most common treatments for lumbosacral radicular pain.

### Decompression surgery alone versus decompression plus fusion in symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis: A Swiss prospective multicenter cohort study with 3 years of follow-up [^111twQxz]. Spine (2017). Low credibility.

Retrospective analysis of a prospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted.

The objective of this study was to estimate the added effect of surgical fusion as compared to decompression surgery alone in symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis patients with spondylolisthesis. The optimal surgical management of these patients remains controversial.

Patients from the Lumbar Stenosis Outcome Study with confirmed degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS) and spondylolisthesis were enrolled. The outcomes were measured using the Spinal Stenosis Measure (SSM) for symptoms (score range 1–5, best to worst) and function (1–4) over time, assessed at baseline, and at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months follow-up. To quantify the effect of fusion surgery compared to decompression alone and the number of decompressed levels, mixed effects models were used, accounting for repeated observations in main outcomes (SSM symptoms and SSM function) over time. In addition to individual patients' random effects, random slopes for follow-up time points were fitted. The two approaches were compared using Akaike's Information Criterion and the chi-square test. Confounders were adjusted with fixed effects for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for musculoskeletal disorders, and duration of symptoms.

A total of 131 patients undergoing decompression surgery alone (n = 85) or decompression with fusion surgery (n = 46) were included in the study. In the multiple mixed effects model, the adjusted effect of fusion compared with decompression alone was assessed, but the excerpt cuts off before providing the result details.

### Minimally invasive foraminotomy through tubular retractors via a contralateral approach in patients with unilateral radiculopathy [^1118LgU6]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Radiculopathy caused by foraminal nerve root compression is a common pathology in the lumbar spine. Surgical decompression via a conventional open foraminotomy is the treatment of choice when surgery is indicated. Minimally invasive tubular foraminotomy through a contralateral approach is a potentially effective surgical alternative.

- **Objective**: The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to evaluate the efficacy and benefits of this approach for the treatment of radiculopathy.

- **Methods**: Patients with unilaterally dominant lower extremity radiculopathy who underwent minimally invasive lumbar foraminotomy through tubular retractors via a contralateral approach between 2010 and 2012 were included. Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for back and leg pain were evaluated preoperatively, postoperatively, and at the latest follow-up. Functional outcome was evaluated using the MacNab criteria.

- **Results**: For the total of 32 patients, there was significant postoperative improvement in the ODI (P = 0.006), VAS back pain (P < .001), and VAS leg pain on the pathology and the approach side (P = 0.004, P = 0.021, respectively). At a follow-up of 12.3 ± 1.7 months, there was also significant improvement in the ODI (P < .001), VAS back pain (P = 0.001), and VAS leg pain on the pathology and approach side (P < .001, P = 0.001, respectively). The functional outcome was excellent and good in 95.2% of patients. One patient required fusion (3.1%).

- **Conclusion**: A minimally invasive, facet-sparing contralateral approach is an effective technique for the treatment of radiculopathy.

### Utility of electrodiagnostic testing in evaluating patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy: An evidence-based review [^111bipo2]. Muscle & Nerve (2010). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lumbar spinal stenosis, particularly in relation to EMG, the AANEM 2010 guidelines recommend the following electrodiagnostic studies to aid the clinical diagnosis in patients with suspected lumbosacral radiculopathy:

- **Peripheral limb EMG**: Conduct testing to evaluate nerve function.
- **Paraspinal mapping with needle EMG in lumbar radiculopathy**: Use needle EMG to assess and document muscle activity.
- **H-reflex in S1 radiculopathy**: Apply this technique to confirm abnormalities associated with S1 nerve root issues.

### An evidence-based clinical guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (update) [^1157A2Hc]. The Spine Journal (2013). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for lumbar spinal stenosis, specifically in the context of epidural injections, the NASS 2013 guidelines recommend considering interlaminar epidural corticosteroid injections to provide short-term (2 weeks to 6 months) symptom relief for patients experiencing neurogenic claudication or radiculopathy. There is insufficient evidence to support long-term use (21.5–24 months).

### The efficacy and safety of pregabalin in the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy [^112VcRDA]. Pain (2010). Low credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy of pregabalin in patients with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy. This randomized, controlled withdrawal trial included five phases: screening (4–18 days); run-in (4–10 days) to screen out placebo responders; single-blind (28 days) to identify pregabalin responders; double-blind to randomize responders to pregabalin or placebo (35 days); and final study medication taper (7 days). The primary endpoint was time to loss of response (LOR) during the double-blind phase (1-point increase in pain, discontinuation, or rescue-medication use).

In the single-blind phase, 58% of patients had a 30% pain reduction. In the double-blind phase, pregabalin (n = 110) and placebo (n = 107) groups did not differ significantly in time to LOR. Adverse events caused the discontinuation of 9.9% and 5.6% of pregabalin-treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Most patients with chronic lumbosacral radiculopathy responded to pregabalin therapy; however, time to LOR did not significantly differ between pregabalin and placebo. Considering the results of all phases of the study, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions from it, suggesting a need for further work to understand the clinical potential of pregabalin treatment for lumbosacral radiculopathy.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: A joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society [^111fPrGs]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for lumbar spinal stenosis, specifically in terms of history and physical examination, the ACP/APS 2007 guidelines recommend eliciting a focused medical history and performing a physical examination to categorize patients with low back pain into one of the following broad categories:

- **Nonspecific low back pain**: This category includes cases where there is no clear underlying cause for the pain, requiring a broader evaluation and possibly conservative management.

- **Back pain potentially associated with radiculopathy or spinal stenosis**: Patients exhibiting symptoms suggesting nerve root involvement or spinal canal narrowing are categorized here for more targeted diagnostic imaging and potential intervention.

- **Back pain potentially associated with another specific spinal cause**: This includes cases where there might be a specific pathology like fractures or tumors, necessitating further specific diagnostic testing and treatment strategies.

### Effect of caudal epidural steroid or saline injection in chronic lumbar radiculopathy: Multicentre, blinded, randomised controlled trial [^111MAYoe]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

The Oswestry Disability Index was the primary outcome measure. It includes a questionnaire with 10 questions evaluating limitations in activities of daily living. Each variable is rated on a 0–5 point scale, summed up, and converted into a percentage functional score ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating no disability.

We assessed secondary outcome measures using the European Quality of Life measure, the Visual Analogue Scale for low back pain, and the Visual Analogue Scale for leg pain. The European Quality of Life measure is a generic and preference-weighted measure of health-related quality of life. It evaluates five dimensions: mobility, self-care, activities of daily life, pain, and anxiety or depression. For each dimension, the patient describes three possible levels of problems: none, mild to moderate, and severe. This descriptive system contains 243 combinations or index values for health states. We used the value set from the main survey of the EuroQol Group, which has been validated for patients with lumbar radiculopathy. The total score ranges from -0.594 to 1, where 1 corresponds to perfect health and 0 to death. Negative values are considered worse than death. The intensity of leg pain and low back pain was indicated on a horizontal 100 mm Visual Analogue Scale, where 0 indicates no pain.

A blinded physiotherapist and doctor followed up with patients at 6, 12, and 52 weeks. The use of physiotherapy was recorded during follow-up, although it was not routinely offered to the patients. During the study, surgeons independently assessed the need for surgical interventions.

### Lumbar spinal stenosis: Diagnosis and management [^1141k2kU]. American Family Physician (2024). High credibility.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for lumbar spinal stenosis, more specifically with respect to axial bracing, AAFP 2024 guidelines recommend considering offering bracing with a lumbosacral orthosis to decrease pain and increase walking distance in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Effectiveness of transforaminal epidural steroid injections in patients with degenerative lumbar scoliotic stenosis and radiculopathy [^111ofvK4]. Pain Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Use of epidural steroid injections as a treatment for patients with degenerative lumbar scoliotic spinal stenosis and radiculopathy has received sparse attention in the literature. It has been reported that patients with scoliosis may respond differently than other patient groups to conservative therapeutic interventions for low back pain and radiculopathy. However, patients with scoliosis have rarely, if ever, been excluded from clinical studies of epidural steroid injections. At the time of writing, there are no studies investigating the efficacy of fluoroscopic transforaminal epidural steroid injections as a treatment for patients with radiculopathy and radiographic evidence of degenerative lumbar scoliotic stenosis.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the effectiveness of fluoroscopically guided transforaminal epidural steroid injections as a conservative treatment for patients with degenerative lumbar scoliotic stenosis and radiculopathy.

- **Design**: Retrospective case series.

- **Methods**: The study was performed in an academic outpatient physical medicine and rehabilitation spine practice. Participants included 61 patients with radiographic evidence of degenerative lumbar scoliotic stenosis and radiculopathy. Patients who had undergone at least one fluoroscopic-guided transforaminal epidural steroid and anesthetic injection were included.

- **Main outcome measures**: Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) for worst pain experienced, North American Spine Society (NASS) satisfaction scale, amount of pain medication used, and adapted Stucki questionnaire to assess function and pain status.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^113oJPvC]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Low back pain is among the top reasons why patients seek medical care. It is responsible for more disability than any other musculoskeletal condition and incurs significant direct and indirect economic and health care costs. Low back pain is often associated with conditions such as referred pain, radicular pain, and radiculopathy, which are common presenting features in patients referred for electrodiagnostic assessment. However, not all pain that affects or radiates to the buttock, thigh, or leg is caused by compression of lumbosacral spinal nerve roots.

The differential diagnosis for back pain radiating or extending into the lower limb is broad. Multiple structures and conditions can produce back and lower extremity pain, including lumbosacral radiculopathy, non-radiculopathy disorders of the peripheral nervous system, disorders of the central nervous system, and musculoskeletal disorders. Musculoskeletal disorders, the focus of this review, can mimic and/or occur concurrently with lumbosacral radiculopathy. For example, estimates of the prevalence of lumbosacral radiculopathy range from 3% to 5% of the adult population, far lower than the point prevalence of low back pain (10%–30%) or greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) (6.6%–15%). This underscores the importance of being able to correctly identify radiculopathy with or without other concomitant musculoskeletal diagnoses.

### Effect of caudal epidural steroid or saline injection in chronic lumbar radiculopathy: Multicentre, blinded, randomised controlled trial [^115dsbkS]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

At baseline, all patients had clinically verified lumbar radiculopathy. At the 52-week follow-up, 27 (27%) patients still had lumbar radiculopathy, with no significant differences seen between the groups (P = 0.95). Additionally, at the 52-week follow-up, 49 (50%) patients stated that they had received "much" or "some" benefit from the treatment, again with no significant differences seen between the groups (P = 0.81).

### A pilot study of radiculopathy following osteoporotic vertebral fracture in elderly patients: An algorithmic approach to surgical management [^116CiM63]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

The surgical management algorithm for radiculopathy due to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures in the lower lumbar spine is explored, focusing on the full-endoscopic foraminoplasty and/or discectomy (FELFD) technique. The proposed theory of symptom occurrence in this study is speculative.

To address this hypothesis more scientifically, experimental data should include accurate measurement of the foramen size based on the weight load in the fractured vertebra. Experimental research with finite element models may be beneficial in testing these hypotheses. Due to the limited number of cases, absence of a control group, and short follow-up period, further prospective studies on transforaminal FELFD for the treatment of foraminal stenosis due to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) are required. These studies should include larger sample sizes, be multicentric, add a control group, and feature longer follow-up periods.

Currently, we consider transforaminal FELFD to be potentially beneficial for patients in the specific situations described. After accurately diagnosing the cause of radiculopathy, the choice of surgical management should take into account the general condition of the patient. However, the mechanisms proposed to explain symptom improvement require further verification. Several important points can be highlighted when performing transforaminal FELFD based on the outcomes observed in these patients.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^1125kYvd]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Electrodiagnostic evaluations are commonly requested for patients with suspected radiculopathy. Understanding lower extremity musculoskeletal conditions is essential for electrodiagnostic medicine specialists, as musculoskeletal disorders often mimic or coexist with radiculopathy. This review delineates radicular pain from other types originating from the lumbosacral spine and describes musculoskeletal conditions frequently mimicking radiculopathy, such as those that cause radiating pain and sensorimotor dysfunction.

In clinical evaluation, a history of pain radiating along a specific dermatomal territory with associated sensory disturbance suggests radiculopathy. Physical examination findings consistent with radiculopathy include myotomal weakness, depressed or absent muscle stretch reflexes, focal atrophy along a discrete nerve root territory, and potentially positive dural tension maneuvers like the straight leg raise.

However, electrodiagnostic medicine specialists must be knowledgeable about musculoskeletal mimics, which may manifest as incomplete radiation within or beyond a dermatomal territory, non-radiating pain, tenderness, and give-way weakness, within the context of a normal neurological examination. A systematic approach to musculoskeletal examination is vital. This review focuses on high-yield physical examination maneuvers and diagnostic investigations to differentiate between musculoskeletal conditions and radiculopathy. This approach ensures accurate diagnoses, promotes resource stewardship, enhances patient satisfaction, and optimizes care delivery.

### Diagnosis and treatment of low back pain: A joint clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Pain Society [^116uiKNp]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for low back pain, specifically with respect to diagnostic imaging, the ACP/APS 2007 guidelines recommend obtaining an MRI (preferred) or CT in patients with persistent low back pain and signs or symptoms of radiculopathy or spinal stenosis, only if they are potential candidates for surgery or epidural corticosteroid injection (for suspected radiculopathy).

### Spinal manipulation for subacute and chronic lumbar radiculopathy: A randomized controlled trial [^115hUwke]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). High credibility.

We evaluated the efficacy of spinal manipulation for the management of nonacute lumbar radiculopathy. In a university hospital, we performed a randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms. Patients (n = 44) with unilateral radicular low back pain lasting more than 4 weeks were randomly allocated to manipulation and control groups.

The primary outcome was the intensity of the low back pain on a visual analog scale. The secondary outcome was the Oswestry Disability Questionnaire score. We also measured spinal ranges of motion. The assessments were carried out at baseline, immediately after intervention, and at 3 months' follow-up. All patients underwent physiotherapy. The manipulation group received three sessions of manipulation therapy 1 week apart. For manipulation, we used Robert Maigne's technique.

Both groups experienced a significant decrease in back and leg pain (all P ≤ 0.003). However, only the manipulation group showed significantly favorable results in the Oswestry scores (P < 0.001) and the straight leg raise test (P = 0.001). All ranges of motion increased significantly with manipulation (all P < 0.001), but the control group showed favorable results only in right and left rotations and in extension (all P < 0.001). Between-group analyses showed significantly better outcomes for manipulation in all measurements (all P ≤ 0.009) with large effect sizes.

Spinal manipulation improves the results of physiotherapy over a period of 3 months for patients with subacute or chronic lumbar radiculopathy.

### Pain reduction after lumbar epidural injections using particulate versus non-particulate steroids: Intensity of the baseline pain matters [^115VLnhZ]. European Radiology (2019). Low credibility.

To compare pain relief after CT-guided lumbar epidural steroid injections (ESI) using particulate (triamcinolone) and non-particulate (dexamethasone) steroids, this study explores factors affecting the effectiveness of both steroid types.

This retrospective observational study included 806 patients with lumbar radiculopathy and corresponding MRI or CT abnormalities of the lumbar spine. These patients were matched using the propensity score method, yielding two cohorts of 209 patients each. Pain intensity was evaluated prior to the procedure using a pain numerical rating scale (NRS) with a range of 0–10. Reevaluation took place 1 day and 4 weeks post-injection. Logistic regression analysis and cubic splines applied to generalized additive models were implemented to assess the differences in pain reduction after ESI in the analyzed patient groups.

Four weeks post-injection, the overall chance of ≥ 50% pain reduction was lower in the dexamethasone group than in the triamcinolone group (odds ratio [OR] = 0.55; p < 0.012). In the dexamethasone cohort, the intensity of baseline pain and the presence of a herniated intervertebral disc in the infiltrated segment were both significant and independent predictors of ≥ 50% pain relief. Patients with a baseline NRS score ≥ 7 points had markedly less chance of ≥ 50% pain relief than patients with an NRS score < 7 (OR = 0.53; p < 0.032), whereas disc herniation increased the chances more than twofold (OR = 2.29; p < 0.044). There was no significant correlation between the effectiveness of triamcinolone and any analyzed concomitant variables.

### Invasive treatments for low back disorders [^114KvKxJ]. Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2021). High credibility.

When considering therapeutic procedures for lumbar spinal stenosis, particularly concerning epidural injections, the ACOEM 2021 guidelines recommend offering epidural corticosteroid injections in specific situations. These are advised for the treatment of acute or subacute radicular pain syndromes, typically following treatment with NSAIDs and after waiting at least three weeks.

### Preliminary results of a randomized, equivalence trial of fluoroscopic caudal epidural injections in managing chronic low back pain: Part 2 — disc herniation and radiculitis [^1111WCvX]. Pain Physician (2008). Low credibility.

The pathophysiology of lumbar radicular pain is a subject of ongoing research. The prevalence of sciatica or radiculitis ranges from 1.2% to 43%. Epidural injections are one of the most commonly performed interventions in the United States in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain secondary to disc herniation and radiculitis. There is a paucity of evidence with contemporary methodology used in performing epidural injections under fluoroscopy and based on pain relief and functional status improvement.

- **Study design**: A randomized, double-blind, equivalence trial.

- **Setting**: An interventional pain management practice, a specialty referral center, a private practice setting in the United States.

- **Objective**: To evaluate the effectiveness of caudal epidural injections with or without steroids in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain secondary to disc herniation or radiculitis in providing effective and long-lasting pain relief and evaluate the differences between local anesthetic with or without steroids.

- **Methods**: Patients were assigned to one of two groups. Group I patients received caudal epidural injections with an injection of local anesthetic (lidocaine 0.5%), whereas Group II patients received caudal epidural injections with 0.5% lidocaine 9 mL mixed with 1 mL of steroid. Randomization was performed by computer-generated random allocations sequence by simple randomization.

- **Outcomes assessment**: Multiple outcome measures were utilized including the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) and the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI), as well as employment status.

### Incidence of and risk factors for lumbar disc herniation with radiculopathy in adults: a systematic review [^1179jYBQ]. European Spine Journal (2025). High credibility.

Low back pain is the leading cause of disability globally, associated with a large burden on individuals, healthcare systems, and society. Radiculopathy due to lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is one of the most recognizable disorders of the lower back. The diagnosis is typically based on a combination of symptoms and signs suggesting lumbar spinal nerve root compression or irritation, such as radicular pain with nerve root tension signs, neurologic deficits, and imaging findings that correlate with the clinical syndrome. LDH, defined as the localized displacement of disc material beyond the margins of the intervertebral disc space, is the most common cause of lumbosacral radiculopathy. Compared with nonspecific low back pain without radiculopathy, LDH with radiculopathy is typically associated with greater pain, disability, healthcare use, and intervention.

Previous studies of symptomatic LDH have reported a point prevalence of about 5% in adults 30 years of age and older, varying by sex and age. In people aged 25 to 55 years, 95% of symptomatic herniated discs occur at the lower lumbar spine (L4-L5 and L5-S1 levels). However, little is known about the incidence of LDH with radiculopathy; consequently, risk factors are not well understood. Our aim was to synthesize the evidence on the incidence of and risk factors for LDH with radiculopathy in adults. To the best of our knowledge, no recent systematic review has focused on synthesizing the best available evidence on the incidence and risk factors of LDH with radiculopathy.

### Caudal epidural steroid injection versus transforaminal ESI for unilateral S1 radiculopathy: a prospective, randomized trial [^116n2TMJ]. Pain Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Epidural steroid injections are frequently performed to manage radicular symptoms. Most research investigating the effectiveness of different routes of epidural injections was conducted with non-homogeneous groups. In this study, our aim was to investigate the efficacy of caudal versus transforaminal approaches in patients with unilateral S1 radiculopathy secondary to a paracentral L5-S1 disc herniation.

- **Study design**: Prospective, randomized clinical trial.
- **Setting**: A university hospital pain management center.
- **Methods**: The study was conducted between January 2022 and February 2023. Patients with unilateral S1 radiculopathy were randomly divided into two groups: the caudal epidural steroid injection (CESI) and the transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) group. The severity of pain and disability were assessed with the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at baseline, 3 weeks, and 3 months after treatment. Fifty percent or more improvement in NRS-11 was defined as treatment success. Fluoroscopy time and doses of exposed radiation were also recorded.

- **Results**: A total of 60 patients were included in the final analysis (n = 30 for each group). Significant improvement in pain and disability scores was observed at the 3rd week and 3rd month compared to baseline (p < 0.001). The treatment success rate at the 3rd month was 77% for the CESI group and 73% for the TFESI group without any significant difference between the groups (P = 0.766).

- **Conclusions**: CESI is equally effective as TFESI in the management of S1 radiculopathy due to a paracentral L5-S1 disc herniation.

### Minimally invasive decompression versus open laminectomy for central stenosis of the lumbar spine: Pragmatic comparative effectiveness study [^11213vdj]. BMJ (2015). Low credibility.

Stenosis of the lumbar spine is a highly prevalent condition that often results from a gradual, degenerative aging process. The clinical syndrome of the stenosis is characterized by low back pain and pain and numbness in the legs, and it is a common source of impaired walking and disability in older people (≥ 60 years). Sudden changes in symptomatology are uncommon, and an expectant or non-surgical approach is often chosen for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, with sparse motivation for surgery, or in whom the risk of surgery outweighs the potential benefits. Most patients with symptoms who are managed without surgery report no substantial change over the course of one year. Still, there is growing evidence that surgical decompression offers an advantage over non-surgical management for selected patients with persistent severe symptoms. Consequently, lumbar spinal stenosis is the most common indication for spinal surgery in elderly people, and as the oldest sector of the population continues to grow, the prevalence of the condition is likely to increase.

Open laminectomy, often combined with medial facetectomy and foraminotomy, has traditionally been the standard treatment in patients without instability. In recent years, less invasive procedures have emerged, and microdecompression through smaller incisions is frequently performed. As is often the case in surgery, the shift towards minimally invasive methods has not been backed by solid evidence, except for a small and probably underpowered trial that reported promising results with bilateral microdecompression.

### Conservative management for lumbar radiculopathy based on the stage of the disorder: a Delphi study [^113bh6P7]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2023). Low credibility.

The conservative management of lumbar radiculopathy (LR) is the first treatment option. At the time of writing, systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines have not considered the most appropriate timing of management. This study aimed to establish consensus on effective conservative treatment modalities across different stages (i.e. acute, sub-acute, or chronic) of LR.

Through an iterative multistage Delphi process, experts rated agreement with proposed treatment modalities across stages of LR and could suggest additional treatment modalities. The agreement was measured using a 5-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistics were used to measure agreement (median, interquartile ranges, and percentage of agreement). Consensus criteria were defined a priori for each round.

Fourteen panelists produced a consensus list of effective treatment modalities across stages of LR.

- **Acute stage management**: Focus on providing patients with information about the condition, including pain education, individualized physical activity, and directional preference exercises, supported with NSAIDs.

- **Sub-acute stage management**: Strength training and neurodynamic mobilization could be added, and transforaminal or epidural injections considered.

- **Chronic stage management**: Spinal manipulative therapy, specific exercise, and function-specific physical training should be combined with individualized vocational, ergonomic, and postural advice.

Experts agree the effectiveness of interventions differs through the evolution of LR.

### Lumbar facet joint injection: Feasibility as an alternative method in high-risk patients [^112zi2aC]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic facet joint steroid injections for symptoms caused by lumbar spinal stenosis in patients who are at risk of bleeding, we analyzed 134 patients who had previously undergone one-level bilateral facet joint steroid injections for lumbar radiculopathy caused by spinal stenosis from January 2011 to December 2012. All patients had a bleeding tendency due to several medical conditions. A retrospective chart review was conducted by one radiologist. Response was measured using a five-point patient satisfaction scale. Evaluations of the relationship between possible outcome predictors were made using the chi-squared or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.

Among the 42 enrolled patients (male/female = 14/28; mean age, 58 years; range, 41–88 years), 25 patients (59.5%) were classified to have received effective treatment; in 17 patients, treatment was classified as ineffective. Eighteen (72%) of the 25 patients with mild-to-moderate central canal stenosis had symptom relief, and 7 of the 17 (41.2%) patients with severe central canal stenosis had symptom relief (P < 0.05). Other outcome predictors were not statistically significant.

Therapeutic facet joint steroid injection is potentially effective for lumbar radiculopathy caused by spinal stenosis. This could be helpful in patients at risk of bleeding.

- **Key points**:
	- Epidural injection of steroids is a conventional treatment for lumbar radiculopathy.
	- Facet joint steroid injections showed similar therapeutic effects in lumbar spinal stenosis.

### Effect of perioperative pain neuroscience education in people undergoing surgery for lumbar radiculopathy: a multicentre randomised controlled trial [^111rHBzz]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). High credibility.

Perioperative education should be improved to decrease unfavorable outcomes after lumbar surgery. This trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of perioperative pain neuroscience education (PPNE) versus traditional biomedical education (PBE) in terms of pain, quality of life, pain cognition, surgical experience, healthcare use, work resumption, and cost-effectiveness in people undergoing surgery for lumbar radiculopathy.

- **Methods**: In this multicenter randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02630732), patients undergoing surgery for lumbar radiculopathy in three Belgian hospitals were randomized to receive either PPNE or PBE. Both groups participated in one preoperative and one postoperative one-to-one education session and received a booklet with essentially different content (PPNE: biopsychosocial; PBE: biomedical). Pain was the primary outcome, measured using Visual Analogue Scales and quantitative sensory testing. Assessments were conducted at 3 days, 6 weeks, and 6 and 12 months after surgery.

- **Results**: Between March 2016 and April 2020, participants were randomly assigned to PPNE (n = 58) or PBE (n = 62). At 12 months, PPNE did not lead to significantly better pain outcomes, but it resulted in more favorable scores in the 36-item Short Form Health Survey physical component (additional increase: 46.94; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 14.16–79.73; medium effect), Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia (additional decrease: 3.15; 95% CI: 0.25–6.04; small effect), and Pain Catastrophizing Scale (additional decrease: 6.18; 95% CI: 1.97–10.39; medium effect).

### Cervical radiculopathy: Nonoperative management of neck pain and radicular symptoms [^112GyuyJ]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Cervical radiculopathy is a disease process marked by nerve compression from herniated disk material or arthritic bone spurs. This impingement typically produces neck and radiating arm pain or numbness, sensory deficits, or motor dysfunction in the neck and upper extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic myelography can confirm neurologic compression. The overall prognosis of persons with cervical radiculopathy is favorable: most patients improve over time with a focused, nonoperative treatment course.

There is little high-quality evidence on the best nonoperative therapy for cervical radiculopathy. Cervical collars may be used for a short period of immobilization, and traction may temporarily decompress nerve impingement. Medications may help alleviate pain and neuropathic symptoms. Physical therapy and manipulation may improve neck discomfort, and selective nerve blocks target nerve root pain. Although the effectiveness of individual treatments is controversial, a multimodal approach may benefit patients with cervical radiculopathy and associated neck pain.

### Effects of adding a neurodynamic mobilization to motor control training in patients with lumbar radiculopathy due to disc herniation: A randomized clinical trial [^114whfeE]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of including neural mobilization into a motor control exercise program on pain, related disability, neuropathic symptoms, straight leg raise, and pressure pain threshold in lumbar radiculopathy. This is a randomized clinical trial.

Individuals with low back pain, confirmed disc herniation, and lumbar radiculopathy were randomly assigned to receive eight sessions of either neurodynamic mobilization plus motor control exercises (n = 16) or motor control exercises alone (n = 16). Outcomes included pain, disability, neuropathic symptoms, straight leg raise, and pressure pain threshold at baseline, after four visits, after eight visits, and after two months.

There were no between-group differences for pain, related disability, or pressure pain threshold at any follow-up period because both groups experienced similar and large improvements. Patients assigned to the neurodynamic program group experienced better improvements in neuropathic symptoms and the straight leg raise compared with the motor control exercise group (P < 0.01).

The addition of neurodynamic mobilization to a motor control exercise program leads to reductions in neuropathic symptoms and mechanical sensitivity (straight leg raise) but did not result in greater changes of pain, related disability, or pressure pain threshold over motor control exercises program alone in subjects with lumbar radiculopathy. Future trials are needed to further confirm these findings as between-group differences did not reach statistical significance.

### Interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain: Evidence-based practice guidelines [^113grYmu]. Pain Physician (2005). Low credibility.

The lifetime prevalence of spinal pain has been reported as 54% to 80%, with as many as 60% of patients continuing to experience chronic pain five years or longer after the initial episode. Spinal pain is associated with significant economic, societal, and health impacts. Available evidence documents a wide degree of variance in the definition and practice of interventional pain management.

- **Objective**: To develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the management of chronic spinal pain. This includes the utilization of all types of evidence, applying an evidence-based approach, with broad representation of specialists from academic and clinical practices.

- **Design**: A systematic review of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions applied in managing chronic spinal pain by a policy committee. The design consisted of the formulation of essential guidelines and potential evidence linkages representing conclusions and statements about relationships between clinical interventions and outcomes.

- **Methods**: The guideline preparation process included literature searches, literature synthesis, systematic review, consensus evaluation, open forum presentation, formal endorsement by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP), and blinded peer review. Methodologic quality evaluation criteria utilized included AHRQ criteria, QUADAS criteria, and Cochrane review criteria. The designation of levels of evidence ranged from Level I (conclusive), Level II (strong), to Level III (moderate).

### Comparative systematic review and meta-analysis of Cochrane review of epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy or sciatica [^1175azPX]. Pain Physician (2022). Low credibility.

Epidural injections are among the most commonly performed procedures for managing low back and lower extremity pain. Pinto et al. and Chou et al. previously performed systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which, along with a recent update from Oliveira et al, showed the lack of effectiveness of epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, and radiculopathy. In contrast to these papers, multiple other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have supported the effectiveness and use of epidural injections utilizing fluoroscopically guided techniques. A major flaw in the review can be related to attributing active-controlled trials to placebo-controlled trials. The assumption that local anesthetics do not provide sustained benefit, despite extensive evidence that local anesthetics provide long-term relief similar to a combination of local anesthetic with steroids, is flawed.

- **Study design**: The Cochrane Review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy were reanalyzed using systematic methodology and meta-analysis.

- **Objectives**: To re-evaluate Cochrane data on RCTs of epidural injections in managing chronic low back and lower extremity pain with sciatica or lumbar radiculopathy utilizing qualitative and quantitative techniques with dual-arm and single-arm analysis.

- **Methods**: In this systematic review, we have used the same RCTs from the Cochrane Review of a minimum of 20% change in pain scale or significant pain relief of ≥ 50%.

### Epidural steroids in the management of chronic spinal pain and radiculopathy [^117PxM8D]. Pain Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Epidural injections, with or without steroids, are used extensively in the management of chronic spinal pain. However, evidence is contradictory, with ongoing debate about the value of epidural steroid injections in chronic spinal syndromes. This systematic review aims to determine the effectiveness of epidural injections in treating chronic spinal pain. Data sources include relevant literature from MEDLINE and EMBASE (January 1966 - March 2003), manual searches of bibliographies of known primary and review articles, and abstracts from scientific meetings. Both randomized and non-randomized studies were included in the review based on the criteria established by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). Studies were excluded from analysis if they were merely review or descriptive and did not meet minimum criteria.

The results demonstrated strong evidence supporting the effectiveness of transforaminal epidural injections in managing lumbar nerve root pain. Furthermore, evidence was moderate for caudal epidural injections in managing lumbar radicular pain. However, evidence for managing chronic neck pain, chronic low back pain, cervical radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, and post-laminectomy syndrome was limited or inconclusive. In conclusion, while the effectiveness of transforaminal epidural injections in managing lumbar nerve root pain was strong, and caudal epidural injections for lumbar radiculopathy was moderate, evidence for other conditions was limited or inconclusive.

### Effect of caudal epidural steroid or saline injection in chronic lumbar radiculopathy: Multicentre, blinded, randomised controlled trial [^111EAkUt]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

This multicentre randomised controlled study was designed to determine whether high volume epidural saline injections alone or epidural saline injections in combination with epidural steroid could benefit patients with longstanding radiculopathy. The study population was homogeneous with low psychosocial strain. We carefully selected patients based on clinical criteria, not strictly on magnetic resonance imaging findings. This method accords with how epidural steroid injections are used in daily clinical practice, thus improving the external validity of our study. We used the caudal epidural injection technique with ultrasound guiding to enhance precision. However, we did not use contrast to visualize where the medication spread. The use of large volumes (30 mL) for the epidural injections ensured sufficient spread of the medication, reducing the need for radiography during the injection procedure.

Our power calculation required including 41 patients in each group to detect a 10-point between-group difference for the primary outcome measure. We did not reach this goal due to rapid improvement in 17 patients between inclusion and randomisation, resulting in the study being slightly underpowered. Four patients were missing from the epidural steroid group, two from the epidural saline group, and one from the sham group. However, the study showed no trend towards any group difference after 12 months. We therefore consider it highly unlikely that a larger study population would have affected the results.

### Interspinous spacers for lumbar foraminal stenosis: Formal trials are justified [^1162MFxq]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

To determine whether preliminary evidence supports X-STOP implants as an effective treatment for lumbar radiculopathy secondary to foraminal stenosis, and if larger formal trials are warranted, this study was conducted.

Participants had a clinical diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy supported by MRI findings of foraminal stenosis and relevant nerve root compression. Self-reported disability and pain were measured pre-operation, and early and late post-operation using the widely used Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and the bodily pain scale of the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36BP). The statistical significance (paired samples t-test; Wilcoxon signed ranks test) and clinical significance (Cohen's effect size; standardised response means) of change scores were determined.

Fifteen people had X-STOP implants. Data pre-, early-, and late post-operation were available for ten. Self-reported disability and pain improved substantially by the early post-operative measurement. Mean change scores (ODI = 29; SF-36BP = -45) were significant at the p < 0.05 level and demonstrated large clinical significance (Cohen's d > 0.80). Improvements were maintained at 2–3 years. Both scales had floor and ceiling effects, implying changes may be underestimated. There were no surgical complications.

In this small study, X-STOP appeared safe and effective. It is less invasive than other established surgical procedures but does not jeopardize other options in the event of failure. Large-scale clinical trials are warranted.

### Musculoskeletal mimics of lumbosacral radiculopathy [^111WgvrR]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Many of the mimics of L1 radiculopathy are pathologies of the hip joint. In general, when trying to distinguish radiculopathy and hip joint pathology, a diagnostic hip joint injection can be helpful to clarify whether the etiology of the pain is from the hip joint with > 90% accuracy.

### A pilot study of radiculopathy following osteoporotic vertebral fracture in elderly patients: An algorithmic approach to surgical management [^116C3iyB]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2021). Low credibility.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) frequently occur in elderly patients following minimal trauma or spontaneously, particularly in postmenopausal women. They are commonly characterized by varying degrees of local pain associated with the fracture site, primarily axial back pain. Conservative observation can be considered when no neurological complications are present, and the OVCF is stable. However, in the lower lumbar region, patients occasionally complain of both axial and radiating pain following an OVCF. In some cases, delayed onset of radiculopathy is observed after conservative therapy for OVCF due to advanced vertebral collapse.

Generally, percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty is recommended as a minimally invasive procedure for rapid pain relief through mechanical stabilization. Intervertebral fusion is a reasonable method to treat vertebral fractures, but this type of surgery is invasive for elderly patients, and complications are not uncommon. Because OVCF occurs based on osteoporosis, even in the case of vertebral screw fixation, subsequent adjacent segment vertebral fractures often occur.

The transforaminal full-endoscopic lumbar foraminoplasty and/or discectomy (FELFD) for lumbar disc herniation and lumbar stenosis has obtained good clinical results, as indicated by diverse review and meta-analysis articles. In the present study, the surgical strategy for patients with radiculopathy caused by foraminal stenosis following a compression fracture of the lower lumbar spine is described. Our surgical route of transforaminal FELFD is proposed as an effective approach.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: An evidenced-based approach [^114efY3G]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Interlaminar and transforaminal epidural steroid injections (ESIs) with or without local anesthetic are the most commonly performed nonsurgical spinal procedures, with 65.5% of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis undergoing at least one ESI. In a study by Adogwa et al, the authors reported 18,494 ESIs that were performed between 2007 and 2016 in a subgroup of adults with a degenerative spinal diagnosis that underwent an index 1–, 2–, or 3–level decompression and fusion.

In a systematic review by Manchikanti et al, it was demonstrated that caudal epidural injections and lumbar interlaminar epidural injections of local anesthetic with or without steroid provided effective and significant improvement in pain and function in central spinal stenosis. In contrast, in a meta-analysis by Liu et al, it was shown that epidural steroid injections provide limited improvement in short-term and long-term benefits in LSS patients. There are limited data demonstrating the long-term efficacy of ESI. The Spine Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) results further did not support the use of ESI. In general, ESI is suggested to provide short-term pain relief (two weeks to six months) in patients with neurogenic claudication or radiculopathy. There is, however, conflicting evidence concerning long-term (21.5–24 months) efficacy.

- **Nerve (medial branch) block and RFA**: Lumbar RFA is considered a treatment for lumbar spondylosis or facet joint arthropathy; however, because of its degenerative etiology, many patients with LSS also have degenerative spondylosis and associated symptoms.

### Effect of caudal epidural steroid or saline injection in chronic lumbar radiculopathy: Multicentre, blinded, randomised controlled trial [^111KLY24]. BMJ (2011). High credibility.

We used a subcutaneous sham injection to control for the possible effect of a high volume saline injected into the epidural space, and we compared epidural steroid injections with epidural saline injections to clarify the effect of steroids.

- **Participants**: We referred patients with lumbar radiculopathy from the catchment area of the University Hospital of North Norway, St Olavs University Hospital, Levanger Hospital, Nordland Hospital, and Buskerud Hospital (population 1,146,076). The general practitioners, neurosurgeons, orthopaedic surgeons, neurologists, manual physiotherapists, and chiropractors working in these areas were informed by letter about the trial. The inclusion criteria included unilateral lumbar radiculopathy lasting for more than 12 weeks. The intensity of the leg pain, radiating from the back to below the knee, had to be comparable to or worse than the back pain. We assessed eligible patients aged between 20 and 60 years consecutively for inclusion and obtained written informed consent. The clinical examination followed a prepared study template to decide whether the patient had lumbar radiculopathy and to determine the most probable nerve root affected. Trained neurologists or specialists in physical medicine and rehabilitation, in cooperation with a physiotherapist, undertook the inclusion examinations. We excluded 328 patients presenting with a cauda equina syndrome, severe paresis, severe pain, history of spinal injection or surgery, deformity, pregnancy, ongoing breastfeeding, warfarin therapy, or ongoing treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

### An algorithmic approach for clinical management of chronic spinal pain [^116VS9Pz]. Pain Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Interventional pain management, and the interventional techniques which are an integral part of that specialty, are subject to widely varying definitions and practices. How interventional techniques are applied by various specialties is highly variable, even for the most common procedures and conditions. At the same time, many payors, publications, and guidelines are showing increasing interest in the performance and costs of interventional techniques. There is a lack of consensus among interventional pain management specialists regarding how to diagnose and manage spinal pain and the type and frequency of spinal interventional techniques that should be utilized to treat spinal pain.

Therefore, an algorithmic approach is proposed, providing a step-by-step procedure for managing chronic spinal pain patients based upon evidence-based guidelines. This approach is developed based on the best available evidence regarding the epidemiology of various identifiable sources of chronic spinal pain. Such an approach includes an appropriate history, examination, and medical decision-making in the management of low back pain, neck pain, and thoracic pain.

The algorithm also provides diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to clinical management, utilizing case examples of cervical, lumbar, and thoracic spinal pain. An algorithm for investigating chronic low back pain without disc herniation commences with a clinical question, examination, and imaging findings. If there is evidence of radiculitis, spinal stenosis, or other demonstrable causes resulting in radi-

### Low back and radicular pain: A pathway for care developed by the British Pain Society [^112dHsJD]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

These consensus guidelines aim to provide an overview of best practices for managing chronic spinal pain, reflecting the heterogeneity of low back pain. Most guidelines have covered only one aspect of spinal care and thus have been divisive and potentially worsened the quality of care. Additionally, some of the evidence base is subjective and of poor quality. The British Pain Society low back pain pathway has reached across all disciplines and involved input from patients. It is recognized, however, that there is an urgent need for further high-quality clinical research in this area to underpin future guidelines. Considerable work is still needed to clarify the evidence; however, foundations have been laid with this pathway.

- **Key features**: Risk stratification; clarification of the intensity of psychological interventions; a logical progression for the management of sciatica; and decision points for considering structural interventions such as spinal injections and surgery.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^114gK5zQ]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Adhesiolysis is performed for FBSS and radicular pain based on the premise that epidural adhesions are partly responsible for the generation of pain. Injection of hyaluronidase, normal or hypertonic saline, and steroids are performed via a catheter in the epidural space to break down adhesions. In cases of failed conservative management, the ASIPP recommends using adhesiolysis in post-lumbar surgery syndrome and central spinal stenosis. However, NeuPSIG stated that while adhesiolysis may be beneficial in FBSS, its efficacy for neuropathic pain with FBSS is unclear, thus providing an "inconclusive" recommendation.

Sympathetic blockade with a local anesthetic can be used for the treatment of CRPS. High-quality evidence to either confirm or refute efficacy or safety is lacking, as most studies are of short duration and provide no indication of long-term benefits. NeuPSIG provided an "inconclusive" recommendation; however, given the paucity of effective treatment options for CRPS, they suggested that in patients refractory to other treatments, it was a reasonable treatment option, particularly in the early phase of the disease.

Radiofrequency denervation is a destructive technique where the nerve is ablated using heat. Lesioning of the DRG has been suggested as a viable option for treating radiculopathy. This technique has been tested against sham in both the cervical and lumbosacral regions. Cervical RF of the DRG demonstrated a significant difference compared to sham in pain at eight weeks.

### National clinical guidelines for non-surgical treatment of patients with recent onset low back pain or lumbar radiculopathy [^112qiq8H]. European Spine Journal (2018). Low credibility.

The guidelines from the Danish Health Authority summarize recommendations for 20 non-surgical interventions for recent onset (less than 12 weeks) non-specific low back pain (LBP) and lumbar radiculopathy (LR).

- **Methods**: Two multidisciplinary working groups formulated recommendations following the GRADE approach.

- **Results**: Sixteen recommendations were based on evidence, while four were based on consensus. Management of LBP and LR should include information about prognosis and warning signs and encourage patients to remain active. If treatment is needed, the guidelines suggest patient education, various types of supervised exercise, and manual therapy. They advise against the use of acupuncture, routine imaging, targeted treatment, extraforaminal glucocorticoid injections, paracetamol, NSAIDs, and opioids.

- **Conclusion**: Although the recommendations are based on low to moderate quality evidence or consensus, they align well with international guidelines. The working groups advocate for intensified research efforts concerning the management of LBP and LR.

### Epidural steroid injections and selective nerve root blocks [^112621tR]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Epidural steroid injections and lumbar nerve root block/steroid injection are commonly performed interventional treatments for spine-related pain. These procedures form the foundation of any image-guided spine pain management practice. While more generic and not target-specific, epidural steroid injections are highly effective in a large proportion of patients, including those with axial pain (neck or low back pain), radiculopathy, or spinal stenosis with neurogenic claudication. When isolated lumbar nerve root irritation is more clearly suspected, transforaminal nerve root blocks can provide useful diagnostic information as well as deliver more specifically targeted steroid treatment. Sustained pain relief can be achieved in a substantial number of patients with both types of procedures. Here, we review the clinical indications and technical approach to these fundamental image-guided procedures. Fluoroscopy can be the routine approach to all injections. Computed tomography or computed tomographic fluoroscopy can be used as the primary approach in lumbar epidural or nerve root injections or as an alternative technique in unique cases. While the basic technical approach to epidural steroid administration in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar regions is similar, each region has unique issues that must be addressed.

### Surgical management of lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis [^111B5bzs]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2014). Low credibility.

Lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) is a common cause of low back pain, radiculopathy, and/or neurogenic claudication. Treatment begins with a trial of nonsurgical methods, including physical therapy, NSAIDs, and epidural corticosteroid injections. Surgical treatment, involving decompression and fusion, is recommended for patients who do not respond to this initial regimen.

Although much has been published in the past two decades on the surgical management of DS, the optimal method remains controversial. Interbody fusion may improve arthrodesis rates and can be performed via numerous surgical approaches. Minimally invasive techniques continue to be developed. Particular attention to surgical management of DS in the elderly is warranted, given the increasing numbers of elderly persons.

Healthcare utilization in the future must take into account evidence-based medicine that establishes clinically effective practices while simultaneously being cost-effective.

### An algorithmic approach to treating lumbar spinal stenosis: An evidenced-based approach [^114GkY1G]. Pain Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) have a history of symptoms characterized by pain and discomfort that radiate to the lower leg, thigh, and/or buttocks, commonly known as neurogenic claudication. Those with more pronounced LSS may experience lower extremity weakness, muscle cramping, numbness, and gait imbalance. Symptoms of neurogenic claudication typically ease when patients sit down or lean forward, a phenomenon referred to as the "shopping cart sign". When spinal stenosis predominantly affects the neuroforamen or lateral recess, patients may report radicular pain following a specific dermatomal distribution. As LSS is a slowly progressing condition, a rapid onset of these symptoms might indicate a different pathology.

To confirm the clinical suspicion of LSS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) myelogram studies are necessary. MRI remains the most common imaging modality to assess LSS, as physical examination and x-ray imaging do not have high sensitivity or specificity. There is considerable variability in the description and assessment of LSS among radiologists, and a lack of standardization may contribute to the increased heterogeneity of the patient population undergoing surgery for LSS. However, radiographs are low-cost and readily available. Radiological anteroposterior and lateral images may show nonspecific degenerative findings such as disc height loss, disc space narrowing, and osteophyte formation, whereas flexion/extension radiographs may reveal segmental instability and subtle degenerative spondylolisthesis. Causes unrelated to back pain, such as sacroiliac joint pathology, may also be considered.

### Interventional techniques: Evidence-based practice guidelines in the management of chronic spinal pain [^1149MbpT]. Pain Physician (2007). Low credibility.

The evidence-based practice guidelines for the management of chronic spinal pain with interventional techniques were developed to provide recommendations to clinicians in the United States.

- **Objective**: To develop evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for interventional techniques in the diagnosis and treatment of chronic spinal pain, utilizing all types of evidence and to apply an evidence-based approach, with broad representation by specialists from academic and clinical practices.

- **Design**: Study design consisted of formulation of essentials of guidelines and a series of potential evidence linkages representing conclusions and statements about relationships between clinical interventions and outcomes.

- **Methods**: The elements of the guideline preparation process included literature searches, literature synthesis, systematic review, consensus evaluation, open forum presentation, and blinded peer review. Methodologic quality evaluation criteria utilized included the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) criteria, Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) criteria, and Cochrane review criteria. The designation of levels of evidence was from Level I (conclusive), Level II (strong), Level III (moderate), Level IV (limited), to Level V (indeterminate).

- **Results**: Among the diagnostic interventions, the accuracy of facet joint nerve blocks is strong in the diagnosis of lumbar and cervical facet joint pain, whereas it is moderate in the diagnosis of thoracic facet joint pain. The evidence is strong for lumbar discography.

### Development of a preoperative neuroscience educational program for patients with lumbar radiculopathy [^116Yi68K]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Postoperative rehabilitation for lumbar radiculopathy has shown little effect on reducing pain and disability. Preoperative education programs with a focus on a biomedical approach feature procedural and anatomical information, which also show little effect on postoperative outcomes. This report describes the development of an evidence-based educational program and booklet for patients undergoing lumbar surgery for radiculopathy, using a recently conducted systematic review of neuroscience education for musculoskeletal pain.

The previous systematic review produced evidence for neuroscience education as well as a best-evidence synthesis of the content and delivery methods for neuroscience education for musculoskeletal pain. These evidence statements were extracted and developed into patient-centered messages and a booklet, which was then evaluated by peer and patient review.

The neuroscience educational booklet and preoperative program convey key messages from the previous systematic review aimed at reducing fear and anxiety before surgery and assist in developing realistic expectations regarding pain after surgery. Key topics include decisions to undergo surgery, pain processing, peripheral nerve sensitization, effects of anxiety and stress on pain, surgery and the nervous system, and decreasing nerve sensitization.

Feedback from the evaluations of the booklet and preoperative program was favorable from all review groups, suggesting that this proposed evidence-based neuroscience educational program may be ready for clinical application.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding following lumbar epidural corticosteroid injections and facet medial branch blocks in both pre- and postmenopausal women: a case series [^116iQBDT]. Pain Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Epidural steroid injections (ESIs) are becoming increasingly popular for managing chronic lumbar radiculopathy. While ESIs effectively relieve low back and radicular pain, adverse reactions, notably abnormal vaginal bleeding, have been reported.

We present a case series of four women, both pre- and postmenopausal, with chronic lumbar radiculopathy and associated pathology who developed abnormal vaginal bleeding after receiving either ESIs or facet medial branch blocks (MBBs) for pain management. This study was conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles.

We discuss the potential effects of corticosteroids on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and highlight our patients' risk factors for abnormal vaginal bleeding, both exogenous and endogenous. Additionally, we focus on the technical approaches to corticosteroid administration used in our patients' procedures. Given that this is a small case series, further prospective investigation is warranted on these topics. Until then, it may be beneficial to consider risk factors for abnormal uterine bleeding in both pre- and postmenopausal women prior to interventional pain management strategies, specifically ESIs and MBBs. It is important to inform all women about the potential risk of abnormal vaginal bleeding during the consent process for procedures involving corticosteroids.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: lateral hip and thigh pain [^114H8MP2]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

For radicular pain, whether from radiculitis or radiculopathy, we only recommend a short course of oral corticosteroids (such as a 6-day methylprednisolone taper) if a patient has incapacitating pain interfering with functioning and/or engaging in physical therapy. For lumbar disc herniation, oral corticosteroids have been shown to offer only modest improvement in function and have not been proven to reduce pain. In older adults, the systemic side effects are often limiting and should not be prescribed without carefully considering the risks and benefits and involving the patient and/or caregiver in the decision-making process.

Another treatment option for patients with incapacitating pain limiting function is fluoroscopically-guided epidural corticosteroid injections. A full discussion of the indications and expected efficacy of these injections is beyond the scope of this paper, but it is important to appreciate that these injections must be utilized thoughtfully. In an improperly selected older patient, there is a risk for significant side effects from the procedure itself and from epidural corticosteroid administration, potentially without a high likelihood for clinical improvement.

Based on a modified Delphi method, our expert panel believes that best practice is for primary care clinicians who are considering the use of an injection to first refer the patient to a non-operative musculoskeletal specialist (such as a physiatrist, anesthesia pain physician, or sports medicine physician) prior to ordering the injection, in order to evaluate for proper patient selection.

### The effect of spinal mobilization with leg movement in patients with lumbar radiculopathy-a double-blind randomized controlled trial [^113CEa9U]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2019). High credibility.

To evaluate the effect of spinal mobilization with leg movement (SMWLM) on low back and leg pain intensity, disability, pain centralization, and patient satisfaction in participants with lumbar radiculopathy, a double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted at a general hospital. The study involved 60 adults (mean age 44 years) with subacute lumbar radiculopathy.

Participants were randomly allocated to receive either SMWLM along with exercise and electrotherapy (n = 30) or exercise and electrotherapy alone (n = 30). All participants attended six sessions over two weeks.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes were leg pain intensity and the Oswestry Disability Index score. Secondary variables included low back pain intensity, global rating of change (GROC), straight leg raise (SLR), and lumbar range of motion (ROM). Variables were evaluated blindly at baseline, post-intervention, and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up.

Significant and clinically meaningful improvements were observed in all outcome variables. At 2 weeks, the SMWLM group demonstrated significantly greater improvements than the control group in leg pain (MD 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.4–2.6) and disability (MD 3.9; 95% CI, 5.5–2.2). Similarly, at 6 months, the SMWLM group showed significantly greater improvement than the control group in leg pain (MD 2.6; 95% CI, 1.9–3.2) and disability (MD 4.7; 95% CI, 6.3–3.1). The SMWLM group also reported greater improvement in the GROC and in SLR ROM.

In conclusion, for patients with lumbar radiculopathy, the addition of SMWLM provided significantly improved benefits in leg pain and disability outcomes compared to exercise and electrotherapy alone.

### Deconstructing chronic low back pain in the older adult-step by step evidence and expert-based recommendations for evaluation and treatment. Part VIII: Lateral hip and thigh pain [^116ZsSFX]. Pain Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The management of lumbar radicular pain depends on whether a neurologic deficit is present. Lumbar radiculopathy is defined as radicular pain in the setting of focal weakness and/or asymmetrically diminished deep tendon reflexes. While objective sensory impairment may be evident on examination, it is not a criterion for defining radiculopathy. Electrodiagnostic studies, although not necessary to make the diagnosis, are usually abnormal in lumbar radiculopathy. Deep tendon reflexes are commonly diminished bilaterally in older adults; therefore, in our algorithm, we recommend pursuing the management of radiculopathy only if the patient has objective evidence of asymmetric weakness on examination.

Patients with radiculopathy are at risk for progressive and permanent neurologic damage. If a clinician is concerned about lumbar radiculopathy based on the history and physical examination, the patient would benefit from urgent imaging and referral. Advanced imaging, such as lumbar spine MRI (or CT if MRI is contraindicated), is useful for planning interventions such as epidural corticosteroid injections and/or surgical decompression. When referring a patient for specialist care, we recommend an initial evaluation by a non-operative musculoskeletal provider, if available, because not all radiculopathy requires surgical management. Seventy percent of patients with lumbar radiculopathy will improve with conservative care within 4 weeks of the onset of symptoms, and up to 90% of patients with lumbar radiculopathy from a herniated disc (in the absence of significant lumbar spinal stenosis) treated with core stabilization.

### Microdiscectomy is more cost-effective than a 6-month nonsurgical care regimen for chronic radiculopathy [^117WUWkp]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). High credibility.

A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), performed by the authors, compared early surgical microdiscectomy with 6 months of nonoperative care for chronic lumbar radiculopathy. The results indicated that early surgery led to improved outcomes. However, estimates of the incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR), often expressed as the cost of gaining one quality-adjusted life year (QALY), between microdiscectomy and nonsurgical management have varied. Radiculopathy lasting more than 4 months is less likely to improve without surgical intervention and may have a more favorable ICUR than previously reported for acute radiculopathy.

- **Question/Purpose**: In the setting of chronic radiculopathy caused by lumbar disc herniation, defined as symptoms and/or signs of 4 to 12 months duration, is surgical management more cost-effective than 6 months of nonoperative care from the third-party payer perspective based on a willingness to pay of less than CAD 50,000/QALY?

- **Methods**: A decision analysis model served as the vehicle for the cost-utility analysis. A decision tree was parameterized using data from our single-center RCT, which was augmented with institutional microcost data from the Ontario Case Costing Initiative. Bottom-up case costing methodology generates more accurate cost estimates, although institutional costs are known to vary. There were no major surgical cost drivers, such as implants or bone graft substitutes, and therefore, the jurisdictional variance would be minimal for tertiary care centers. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) derived from the EuroQoL-5D were the health outcome for this analysis.
