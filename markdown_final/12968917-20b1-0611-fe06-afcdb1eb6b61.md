## Question

What if it's happened occasionally like once every couple months

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what to do about occasional nosebleeds that happen about once every couple of months. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to classify the frequency and severity of these episodes. Then, I should verify red flags that would push me toward urgent evaluation. Next, I will review common risk factors and when to screen for bleeding disorders or medication effects. After that, I need to outline evidence-based home management and prevention. Finally, I will define when to escalate to office-based care, what interventions are reasonable, and how to follow up and monitor over time.

> Let me first confirm the classification. Epistaxis occurring roughly once every couple of months is intermittent and, if each episode is brief, self-limited, and not associated with large blood loss or systemic symptoms, it fits a mild, recurrent pattern rather than severe or persistent bleeding. Importantly, guidelines emphasize that severity is gauged by duration, volume, and impact on quality of life, so brief, infrequent episodes without functional impairment are generally low severity even if recurrent [^fb84088c] [^6f110e1d].

> Wait, let me verify the red flags that would change urgency. I should confirm whether any episode lasts longer than 30 minutes, requires emergency care, involves bleeding from both nares or from the mouth, causes dizziness or syncope, or is accompanied by easy bruising, petechiae, or gum bleeding. These features suggest more significant bleeding or an underlying disorder and warrant prompt evaluation rather than watchful waiting [^fb84088c] [^99a3dfea].

> Next, I should review risk factors that increase frequency or severity. I need to check for anticoagulant or antiplatelet use, including warfarin, DOACs, aspirin, clopidogrel, or NSAIDs, because these increase epistaxis risk and can change management thresholds. I should also ask about personal or family history of bleeding disorders, intranasal drug use, and chronic nasal trauma from picking or blowing, and I should document these clearly because they influence both evaluation and treatment choices [^c62fbd28] [^21c3b4f9] [^884fd1e7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about testing. For infrequent, mild nosebleeds without red flags or bleeding disorder history, routine labs are not indicated. But if there are concerning features or a suggestive history, I should consider CBC, PT/INR, and PTT, and in the right context evaluate for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with a careful exam for nasal and oral telangiectasias, especially with recurrent bilateral epistaxis or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds [^c62fbd28] [^227f156e].

> I will now examine home management, since most intermittent cases are managed successfully without urgent care. Firm, sustained compression of the lower third of the nose for at least 5 minutes is first-line. If bleeding persists, repeating compression for another 5–10 minutes is reasonable. I should confirm that the patient is leaning forward, breathing through the mouth, and avoiding nose blowing or picking during healing. Topical vasoconstrictors such as oxymetazoline on a cotton pledget can be used as an adjunct for active bleeding, and humidification with saline sprays or gels helps prevent recurrences by keeping the mucosa moist and reducing crusting [^b0dc83a1] [^38da6cbb].

> Let me consider prevention next. I need to ensure the patient understands to keep the nasal lining moist with saline sprays or ointments, especially in dry climates or during winter heating, and to avoid digital trauma, forceful nose blowing, and irritants like tobacco smoke. If using intranasal corticosteroids, I should counsel on proper spray technique to minimize mucosal trauma and epistaxis risk, and I should confirm that any new topical medications are reviewed for bleeding risk [^38da6cbb] [^bdfd8099].

> But wait, what if episodes become more frequent or harder to control. I should double-check the threshold for office evaluation. If nosebleeds increase to weekly or monthly, fail home measures, or begin to affect quality of life, then anterior rhinoscopy and consideration of cautery or topical therapies are appropriate. For recurrent unilateral bleeding or failure of standard measures, nasal endoscopy can identify a specific bleeding site or underlying pathology and guide targeted therapy [^7a] [^227f156e].

> I need to ensure I address anticoagulation appropriately. In patients on anticoagulants, first-line local measures remain the initial approach. Reversal or withdrawal of anticoagulation is generally reserved for life-threatening bleeding or when bleeding is refractory despite optimal local therapy, given the thrombotic risks of reversal. If packing is needed, resorbable materials are preferred in patients with bleeding disorders or anticoagulation to reduce mucosal injury on removal [^884fd1e7] [^403b3082].

> Let me reconsider the follow-up cadence. For occasional, mild epistaxis controlled with home measures, no routine follow-up is needed, but I should advise return precautions for prolonged bleeding, recurrent episodes despite compression, new bruising or gum bleeding, or any signs of anemia. If office-based interventions are performed, follow-up within 2–4 weeks to assess healing and recurrence risk is reasonable, and I should document outcomes within 30 days when packing or procedures are used [^fbcbb420].

> In summary, occasional nosebleeds about once every couple of months are common and usually benign. I should confirm there are no red flags, screen for modifiable risk factors like anticoagulant use or nasal trauma, teach effective compression and humidification strategies, and reserve further evaluation for increasing frequency, severity, or refractory cases. This approach aligns with guideline-based care and balances safety with avoidance of unnecessary testing or interventions [^6f110e1d] [^b0dc83a1] [^fb84088c].

---

Occasional nosebleeds (about once every couple of months) are **usually benign** and often due to dry air, minor trauma, or nasal irritation [^9472ae1b]. They are **not alarming** if they stop with simple pressure, are not accompanied by other bleeding, and do not interfere with daily life [^fb84088c]. Persistent or frequent nosebleeds may signal an underlying issue, such as **hypertension**, a bleeding disorder, or medication effects (e.g. anticoagulants) [^c62fbd28] [^884fd1e7]. Home management includes humidifying the air, using nasal saline or ointments, and avoiding nose picking or forceful blowing [^38da6cbb]. Seek care if bleeding lasts > 20 minutes, recurs weekly, or is accompanied by other bleeding, bruising, or new medications [^fb84088c].

---

## Common causes of occasional nosebleeds

Occasional nosebleeds are **typically caused by benign factors**, including:

- **Dry air**: Low humidity, especially in winter or with indoor heating, dries the nasal mucosa and predisposes to bleeding [^notfound].

- **Minor trauma**: Nose picking, forceful nose blowing, or minor bumps can injure the delicate nasal vessels [^f3de1059].

- **Nasal irritation**: Allergies, colds, or irritants (smoke, strong odors) can inflame the nasal lining and cause bleeding [^notfound].

- **Medications**: Over-the-counter nasal sprays (e.g. decongestants) or topical corticosteroids can irritate the mucosa and increase bleeding risk [^bdfd8099].

---

## When occasional nosebleeds are a cause for concern

While occasional nosebleeds are usually harmless, certain features warrant **further evaluation**:

- **Frequency**: More than once a month or recurring despite preventive measures.

- **Duration**: Bleeding lasting longer than 20 minutes despite proper compression [^notfound].

- **Volume**: Large-volume bleeding, especially if it interferes with daily activities or causes anxiety [^fb84088c].

- **Associated symptoms**: Easy bruising, gum bleeding, petechiae, or unexplained fatigue, which may suggest a bleeding disorder [^c62fbd28].

- **Medications**: Use of anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin, DOACs) or antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) increases bleeding risk and may require adjustment or closer monitoring [^884fd1e7].

---

## Recommended home management strategies

For occasional nosebleeds, **effective home management** includes:

- **Humidification**: Use a humidifier, especially in dry environments, to keep nasal mucosa moist [^notfound].

- **Nasal hydration**: Apply saline sprays or nasal gels/ointments (e.g. petroleum jelly) to the anterior nasal septum to prevent drying and cracking [^38da6cbb].

- **Avoidance**: Refrain from nose picking, forceful nose blowing, or using irritating nasal sprays [^38da6cbb].

- **Compression**: Pinch the soft part of the nose for 5–10 minutes, lean forward, and breathe through the mouth to control bleeding [^b0dc83a1].

---

## When to seek medical evaluation

Medical evaluation is **recommended** if any of the following occur:

- **Persistent bleeding**: Episodes lasting longer than 20 minutes despite proper compression [^notfound].

- **Frequent recurrence**: More than once a month or increasing frequency [^fb84088c].

- **Associated symptoms**: Easy bruising, gum bleeding, petechiae, fatigue, or signs of anemia [^c62fbd28].

- **Medication use**: Anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy that may contribute to bleeding [^884fd1e7].

- **Trauma**: Recent head injury or significant nasal trauma [^27f62619].

---

## Potential underlying medical conditions

Occasional nosebleeds can occasionally signal **underlying medical conditions**, including:

- **Hypertension**: Elevated blood pressure can exacerbate nasal bleeding, though it is rarely the sole cause [^d9e2f007].

- **Bleeding disorders**: von Willebrand disease, hemophilia, or platelet disorders may present with recurrent epistaxis [^d9e2f007].

- **Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)**: Recurrent, sometimes severe nosebleeds with telangiectasias on nasal or oral mucosa [^227f156e].

- **Nasal structural abnormalities**: Deviated septum, nasal polyps, or chronic sinus disease can predispose to bleeding [^d9e2f007].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

If evaluation is warranted, **typical steps include**:

- **History**: Detailed review of frequency, duration, volume, associated symptoms, medication use, and family history of bleeding disorders [^c62fbd28].

- **Physical examination**: Anterior rhinoscopy to identify visible bleeding sites, telangiectasias, or structural abnormalities [^b0dc83a1].

- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, and platelet count if a bleeding disorder is suspected [^notfound].

- **Nasal endoscopy**: For recurrent or refractory cases to identify posterior bleeding sources or pathology [^7a].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment depends on the **underlying cause and severity**:

- **Conservative measures**: Humidification, nasal hydration, and avoidance of trauma [^38da6cbb].

- **Topical therapies**: Vasoconstrictive agents (e.g. oxymetazoline) or topical antibiotics for irritated mucosa [^227f156e].

- **Cautery**: Chemical (silver nitrate) or electrical cauterization for identifiable bleeding sites [^227f156e].

- **Nasal packing**: For refractory bleeding, using resorbable materials when possible [^9f5054b9].

- **Medication adjustment**: Coordination with prescribing clinicians to adjust anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy if indicated [^884fd1e7].

---

Occasional nosebleeds (about once every couple of months) are **usually benign** and manageable with home measures. Persistent, frequent, or complicated episodes warrant evaluation for underlying causes such as hypertension, bleeding disorders, or medication effects.

Epistaxis — severity of bleeding can be gauged by duration and episode frequency, noting that a standard definition of severe epistaxis does not exist. Bleeding duration > 30 minutes over a 24-hour period was considered severe, and a history of hospitalization for nosebleed, prior blood transfusion for nosebleeds, or > 3 recent episodes of nasal bleeding may indicate the need for prompt evaluation. When evaluating, evidence of or suspicion for prolonged or large volume bleeding, bleeding from both sides of the nose or from the mouth, or any signs of acute hypovolemia should warrant prompt management.

Clinicians should evaluate patients following treatment for epistaxis if (1) bleeding has not resolved, (2) invasive treatments were performed, or (3) additional evaluation and testing suggest a potential underlying condition that predisposes to more nosebleeds. Recurrence rates vary by technique and patient factors, ranging from an estimated < 10% after surgical artery ligation or arterial embolization to as much as a 50% recurrence for nasal packing, and many treated patients become lost to follow-up over time, complicating assessment of persistent or recurrent bleeding.

Epistaxis — prompt management (Statement 1) directs that at the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not, and this is a Recommendation based on observational studies and a preponderance of benefit over harm. The quality improvement opportunity is to identify those patients who need immediate diagnosis and treatment, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C, a Level of confidence in evidence: Medium, and policy level Recommendation. Benefits include prevention of morbidity and in rare cases mortality, increased likelihood of timely treatment, more efficient allocation of resources to patients in greatest need of treatment, reduction of patient and family stress, and avoidance of unnecessary interventions in patients who are not actively bleeding, while risks and harms include delayed treatment of patients who may actually need intervention, overtreatment of patients who are not actively bleeding, and increased patient anxiety; no costs are associated with this recommendation, and the benefit-harm assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm. Intentional vagueness is noted in that the actual appropriate timing for "prompt" management is not specified and assessment of bleeding severity may occur during telephone/electronic communications or during face-to-face patient encounter, and the purpose is to assist clinicians in determining the severity of a nosebleed as well as the appropriate clinical setting where the patient should be seen for management.

Objective

Nosebleed, also known as epistaxis, is a common problem that occurs at some point in at least 60% of people in the United States. While the majority of nosebleeds are limited in severity and duration, about 6% of people who experience nosebleeds will seek medical attention. For the purposes of this guideline, we define the target patient with a nosebleed as a patient with bleeding from the nostril, nasal cavity, or nasopharynx that is sufficient to warrant medical advice or care. This includes bleeding that is severe, persistent, and/or recurrent, as well as bleeding that impacts a patient's quality of life. Interventions for nosebleeds range from self-treatment and home remedies to more intensive procedural interventions in medical offices, emergency departments, hospitals, and operating rooms. Epistaxis has been estimated to account for 0.5% of all emergency department visits and up to one-third of all otolaryngology-related emergency department encounters. Inpatient hospitalization for aggressive treatment of severe nosebleeds has been reported in 0.2% of patients with nosebleeds.

Purpose

The primary purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in the management of nosebleeds and to create clear and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specific goals of this guideline are to promote best practices, reduce unjustified variations in care of patients with nosebleeds, improve health outcomes, and minimize the potential harms of nosebleeds or interventions to treat nosebleeds. The target patient for the guideline is any individual aged ≥ 3 years with a nosebleed or history of nosebleed who needs medical treatment or seeks medical advice. The target audience of this guideline is clinicians who evaluate and treat patients with nosebleed. This includes primary care providers such as family medicine physicians, internists, pediatricians, physician assistants, and nurse practitioners. It also includes specialists such as emergency medicine providers, otolaryngologists, interventional radiologists/neuroradiologists and neurointerventionalists, hematologists, and cardiologists. The setting for this guideline includes any site of evaluation and treatment for a patient with nosebleed, including ambulatory medical sites, the emergency department, the inpatient hospital, and even remote outpatient encounters with phone calls and telemedicine. Outcomes to be considered for patients with nosebleed include control of acute bleeding, prevention of recurrent episodes of nasal bleeding, complications of treatment modalities, and accuracy of diagnostic measures. This guideline addresses the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of nosebleed. It focuses on nosebleeds that commonly present to clinicians via phone calls, office visits, and emergency room encounters. This guideline discusses first-line treatments such as nasal compression, application of vasoconstrictors, nasal packing, and nasal cautery. It also addresses more complex epistaxis management, which includes the use of endoscopic arterial ligation and interventional radiology procedures. Management options for 2 special groups of patients-patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome and patients taking medications that inhibit coagulation and/or platelet function-are included in this guideline. This guideline is intended to focus on evidence-based quality improvement opportunities judged most important by the guideline development group. It is not intended to be a comprehensive, general guide for managing patients with nosebleed. In this context, the purpose is to define useful actions for clinicians, generalists, and specialists from a variety of disciplines to improve quality of care. Conversely, the statements in this guideline are not intended to limit or restrict care provided by clinicians based on their experience and assessment of individual patients.

Action Statements

The guideline development group made recommendations for the following key action statements: (1) At the time of initial contact, the clinician should distinguish the nosebleed patient who requires prompt management from the patient who does not. (2) The clinician should treat active bleeding for patients in need of prompt management with firm sustained compression to the lower third of the nose, with or without the assistance of the patient or caregiver, for 5 minutes or longer. (3a) For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. (3b) The clinician should use resorbable packing for patients with a suspected bleeding disorder or for patients who are using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications. (4) The clinician should educate the patient who undergoes nasal packing about the type of packing placed, timing of and plan for removal of packing (if not resorbable), postprocedure care, and any signs or symptoms that would warrant prompt reassessment. (5) The clinician should document factors that increase the frequency or severity of bleeding for any patient with a nosebleed, including personal or family history of bleeding disorders, use of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, or intranasal drug use. (6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include one or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome. (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation, about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy, was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

(6) The clinician should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present) for patients with nosebleeds. (7a) The clinician should perform, or should refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to identify the site of bleeding and guide further management in patients with recurrent nasal bleeding, despite prior treatment with packing or cautery, or with recurrent unilateral nasal bleeding. (8) The clinician should treat patients with an identified site of bleeding with an appropriate intervention, which may include 1 or more of the following: topical vasoconstrictors, nasal cautery, and moisturizing or lubricating agents. (9) When nasal cautery is chosen for treatment, the clinician should anesthetize the bleeding site and restrict application of cautery only to the active or suspected site(s) of bleeding. (10) The clinician should evaluate, or refer to a clinician who can evaluate, candidacy for surgical arterial ligation or endovascular embolization for patients with persistent or recurrent bleeding not controlled by packing or nasal cauterization. (11) In the absence of life-threatening bleeding, the clinician should initiate first-line treatments prior to transfusion, reversal of anticoagulation, or withdrawal of anticoagulation/antiplatelet medications for patients using these medications. (12) The clinician should assess, or refer to a specialist who can assess, the presence of nasal telangiectasias and/or oral mucosal telangiectasias in patients who have a history of recurrent bilateral nosebleeds or a family history of recurrent nosebleeds to diagnose hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome (HHT). (13) The clinician should educate patients with nosebleeds and their caregivers about preventive measures for nosebleeds, home treatment for nosebleeds, and indications to seek additional medical care. (14) The clinician or designee should document the outcome of intervention within 30 days or document transition of care in patients who had a nosebleed treated with nonresorbable packing, surgery, or arterial ligation/embolization. The policy level for the following recommendation about examination of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx using nasal endoscopy was an option: (7b) The clinician may perform, or may refer to a clinician who can perform, nasal endoscopy to examine the nasal cavity and nasopharynx in patients with epistaxis that is difficult to control or when there is concern for unrecognized pathology contributing to epistaxis.

### Clinical practice guideline: nosebleed (epistaxis) [^b0dc83a1]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2020). High credibility.

Epistaxis guideline — initial assessment and first-line measures: At initial contact, clinicians should distinguish patients needing urgent care, and for those with active bleeding requiring prompt management they should use firm sustained compression of the lower third of the nose for 5 minutes or longer. If bleeding obscures site identification despite compression, clinicians should treat ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing and should use resorbable packing for suspected bleeding disorders or anticoagulation/antiplatelet use. Clinicians should educate packed patients about the type of packing, timing and plan for removal if not resorbable, postprocedure care, and symptoms warranting prompt reassessment; should document factors that increase frequency or severity of bleeding, including bleeding history, anticoagulant or antiplatelet use, or intranasal drug use; and should perform anterior rhinoscopy to identify a source of bleeding after removal of any blood clot (if present).

Statement 3a — Nasal packing: For patients in whom bleeding precludes identification of a bleeding site despite nasal compression, the clinician should start ongoing active bleeding with nasal packing. Level of confidence in evidence is Medium, with aggregate evidence quality Grade C, based on observational studies and 2 randomized controlled trials. Benefits include effective and prompt control of nasal bleeding, reduce morbidity, protect airway, reduce need for blood products, allow for additional assessment and management to control bleeding, while risks, harm, and cost include failure to control bleeding, delay in care, can make subsequent examination more difficult, patient discomfort, mucosal damage from packing insertion/removal, damage to intranasal structures, possible infection, possible antibiotic exposure, adverse respiratory effects of nasal obstruction, and cost of packing materials and procedure. Benefit-harm assessment is Preponderance of benefit over harm, policy level is Recommendation, intentional vagueness notes the duration of packing is not specified but that long durations should be avoided, and the role of patient preferences is Small to moderate. Quality improvement opportunity is to promote effective treatment for nosebleed patients.

Nasal packing: FAQs for patients with nosebleed — packing typically "should be in place for no longer than 5 days", and "if your packing is resorbable, it may not need removal and will go away with time and the use of nasal saline sprays". Bleeding can still occur with packing; "apply pressure to the nose with pinching of the soft area, call your clinician, or go to the emergency department for further management". For nonresorbable packing, using it past the recommended time "can result in possible complications", therefore "strict adherence to follow-up directions is important". Reported risks include infection and pressure-related injury: "There is a low risk of infection spreading to the nose and sinuses or, in extremely rare cases, throughout the body", and pressure "may decrease blood flow to areas of the nose and result in injury". To reduce complications, "oral antibiotics will be used if the risk for infection is high", and "keeping the nose and packing moist with nasal saline (salt water) sprays throughout the day can reduce crusting and help resorbable packing melt away"; "strict adherence to follow-up instructions will allow for appropriate removal of packing when necessary and should make complications less frequent". Activity and medication guidance includes: "you should avoid straining, lifting over 10 pounds, bending over, and exercising", and "avoid over-the-counter pain medications that may increase bleeding, including aspirin and ibuprofen"; "Acetaminophen (Tylenol) does not increase bleeding and can be used", and "you should not try to blow your nose… If you feel the need to sneeze, sneeze with mouth open". Seek care urgently if any warning signs occur: "return of blood from nose or mouth, fever over 101°F, increasing pain, vision changes, shortness of breath or labored breathing, loss of color around the skin of the nose, swelling of the face, or a diffuse skin rash". After removal, "you may initially experience a small amount of bleeding… Keeping the nose humid with saline spray and moisturizing agents will prevent dry crusts and facilitate healing"; if nosebleeds recur, "apply pressure… and consider the use of a vasoconstrictor spray", and "if bleeding continues, call your medical provider, or go to the emergency department for further management".

Epistaxis management in patients using anticoagulation or antiplatelet medications — The statement addresses "patients using anticoagulation medications… and antiplatelet medications" and notes they may "have a large volume of blood loss (> 250 mL)" and "require blood transfusion for treatment". Even for vitamin K antagonist (VKA) or heparin users, "the first step… is the use of 'first-line' treatments, including nasal compression, vasoconstrictors, moisturizing or lubricating agents, nasal cautery, and/or nasal packing". Reversal carries risks: "overcorrection of a patient's INR can increase risk of thromboembolic events" and "4-factor prothrombin complex concentrates or recombinant activated factor VII… may also induce hypercoagulability". For VKAs, "reversal strategy should be driven by the patient's clinical condition and bleeding severity as well as INR", and "Patients with an INR > 4.5 are more likely to require hospital admission and have prolonged hospital stays". For direct oral anticoagulants, "clotting assays such as prothrombin time/INR and partial thromboplastin time do not reliably reflect the degree of anticoagulation". Regarding antiplatelet therapy, the PATCH trial found transfusion recipients were "more likely to have an in-hospital adverse event and a higher 90-day mortality rate", and "Clinicians should balance the chance for benefit against the risk for harm when considering platelet transfusion". Adjunctive agents "do not specifically reverse… but they do improve hemostasis and are effective in treating mucocutaneous bleeding"; in a small randomized trial of antiplatelet users, topical tranexamic acid (TXA) achieved cessation within "10 minutes" with "73% vs 29%, respectively; P < .001" compared with standard anterior nasal packing.

### Quality of clinical aspects of call handling at Dutch out of hours centres: cross sectional national study [^ba84e25c]. BMJ (2008). Excellent credibility.

Research shows that triagists often ask few questions and do not use or follow protocols. The safety of any care process is likely to be improved by following protocols, but little is known about what extent of improvement might occur. In our study the analysis of variance for obligatory questions asked compared with the standard showed that the overall mean significantly and substantially differed from 100%. Although agreed standards are seldom met, we conclude that the number of obligatory questions asked at the different out of hours centres was far too low to determine clinical urgency.

Triagists at out of hours centre number 5 asked significantly more obligatory questions for all cases than did those at any other centre. However, this did not result in a higher number of appropriate outcomes than at the other centres. Determining the reason for this would need further investigation.

An example of misinterpretation of an answer took place on a Friday evening when the triagist of an out of hours centre said to the telephone incognito standardised patient with nosebleed (case 3): "You'd better see your doctor next week because you said you have a bleeding nose and several bruises, so there might be something wrong with your blood". Our findings on (mis)interpretation of answers by triagists and general practitioners confirm that in addition to asking the right questions, understanding the relevance of the answers is equally important.

Triagists gave a small amount of home management and safety net advice relevant to the nature of the clinical problem presented. Further research is needed to investigate whether triagists are aware of the importance of this advice, especially if self care advice is given.

Conclusion

Triagists seemed to carry out a rapid clinical scan before they came to a conclusion, without considering in sufficient detail different causes for a symptom or its possible consequences. Even when the triagist gave the required self care advice, for nearly all calls this choice could be considered to be the correct choice only by means of an educated guess as so few obligatory questions were asked. This study also shows that triagists should ideally recommend a low urgency level of care only after thorough history taking. The quality of information on home management and safety net advice varied to a large extent and was consistently low for each case and each out of hours centre.

### Effect of bevacizumab nasal spray on epistaxis duration in hereditary hemorrhagic telangectasia: a randomized clinical trial [^de235749]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Background

Epistaxis is the most frequent and disabling manifestation of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). The efficacy of intravenous bevacizumab (an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody) for epistaxis has been shown. However, the efficacy of intranasal bevacizumab has yet to be evaluated.

Objective

To evaluate the efficacy of 3 different doses of bevacizumab administered as a nasal spray in a repeated manner for the duration of nosebleeds in patients with HHT.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 clinical trial with dose selection at an intermediate analysis and prespecified stopping rules (nonbinding stopping for futility). Patients aged 18 years or older with a diagnosis of HHT were recruited from 5 French centers from April 2014 to January 2015 with a 6-month follow-up after the end of treatment. Participants had a history of self-reported nosebleeds with a monthly duration of more than 20 minutes in at least the 3 months prior to inclusion corroborated by epistaxis grids completed during the same preinclusion period.

Interventions

Eighty consecutive HHT patients were randomized and treated in the phase 2 study, with 4 parallel groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. One group received placebo (n = 21); the other 3 received bevacizumab nasal spray. Each bevacizumab group received a different dose of the drug (25 mg [n = 20], 50 mg [n = 20], or 75 mg [n = 19] per treatment) in 3 doses 14 days apart for a total treatment duration of 4 weeks, resulting in a total dose of 75 mg, 150 mg, and 225 mg in each treatment group.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mean monthly epistaxis duration for 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of the treatment.

Results

Of the 80 patients who were randomized (mean age, 60.47 [SD, 10.61] years; 37 women [46.25%]), 75 completed the study. Mean monthly epistaxis duration measured at 3 months was not significantly different in the 59 patients receiving bevacizumab in comparison with the placebo group (P = 0.57) or between the bevacizumab groups. The mean monthly epistaxis duration was 259.2 minutes (95% CI, 82.1–436.3 minutes) in the 25-mg group, 244.0 minutes (95% CI, 81.8–406.2 minutes) in the 50-mg group, 215.0 minutes (95% CI, 102.8–327.2 minutes) in the 75-mg group, and 200.4 minutes (95% CI, 109.3–291.5 minutes) in the placebo group. Toxicity was low and no severe adverse events were reported. This study was terminated prior to phase 3 for treatment futility after interim analysis on the recommendations of an independent data monitoring committee.

Conclusions and Relevance

In patients with HHT, a bevacizumab nasal spray treatment of 3 administrations at 14-day intervals with doses of 25 mg, 50 mg, or 75 mg per spray, compared with a placebo, did not reduce monthly epistaxis duration in the 3 consecutive months immediately after the end of treatment.

### Nasal foreign body, an unanticipated complication of COVID-19 care: a case report [^860a7105]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has changed the way we practice medicine. Standards of care are evolving in an effort to diagnose, manage, and treat the cause of this global pandemic, as well as to protect the health care workforce. These practices can have unexpected and potentially dangerous consequences, particularly for patient populations with confounding factors that put them at increased risk for complications and poor outcomes.

Case Report

A 52-year-old previously healthy woman presented with 4 days of nasal pain and discharge after using a home collection kit in an attempt to obtain a nasopharyngeal viral sample for COVID-19 testing. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? With treatments, policies, and procedures that are rapidly evolving and often deviating from established, evidence-based, usual care in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency physicians must be cognizant of and monitor for poor outcomes and potential downstream complications, especially in underserved patient populations.

### Management of recurrent epistaxis in an anticoagulated patient by temporarily closing the nares with sutures [^f3de1059]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2008). Low credibility.

We describe an unusual case of recurrent, refractory anterior epistaxis in an 86-year-old man with two mechanical heart valves who was on permanent warfarin therapy. His numerous episodes of epistaxis were incited by chronic nose-picking and strong nose-blowing, practices that he continued to engage in despite repeated medical advice to stop. Stopping his anticoagulation therapy was not considered as a management option because of an unacceptably high risk that this would lead to a thromboembolic event. Eventually, we temporarily sutured his nares closed, and his nosebleeds ceased. The suturing was performed in the ward with local anesthesia. This procedure was simple to perform, fairly well tolerated, easily reversible, and highly effective.

### Nasal bleeding and non-accidental injury in an infant [^5e166a5a]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2010). Low credibility.

Bleeding from the nose has been a point of controversy in the field of child protection in the UK in recent years. Epistaxis in childhood is common but is unusual in the first year of life. Oronasal blood in infancy has been proposed as a marker of child abuse in this age group, but despite this widely held belief, there is a lack of published evidence in this area. The case is reported of an infant who presented at one month of age with serious inflicted injuries, who had been seen in the emergency department only 13 days previously with a "spontaneous" self-limiting nose bleed.

### Tranexamic acid for patients with nasal haemorrhage (epistaxis) [^87a4c677]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Epistaxis (nosebleed) most commonly affects children and the elderly. The majority of episodes are managed at home with simple measures. In more severe cases medical intervention is required to either cauterise the bleeding vessel, or to pack the nose with various materials. Tranexamic acid is used in a number of clinical settings to stop bleeding by preventing clot breakdown (fibrinolysis). It may have a role in the management of epistaxis as an adjunct to standard treatments, reducing the need for further intervention.

Objectives

To determine the effects of tranexamic acid (oral, intravenous or topical) compared with placebo, no additional intervention or any other haemostatic agent in the management of patients with epistaxis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register (via CRS Web); Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (via CRS Web); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 October 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of tranexamic acid (in addition to usual care) compared with usual care plus placebo, usual care alone or usual care plus any other haemostatic agent, to control epistaxis in adults or children.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were control of epistaxis: re-bleeding (as measured by the proportion of patients re-bleeding within a period of up to 10 days) and significant adverse effects (seizures, thromboembolic events). Secondary outcomes were control of epistaxis as measured by the time to stop initial bleeding (the proportion of patients whose bleeding is controlled within a period of up to 30 minutes); severity of re-bleeding (as measured by (a) the proportion of patients requiring any further intervention and (b) the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion); length of hospital stay and other adverse effects. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included six RCTs (692 participants). The overall risk of bias in the studies was low. Two studies assessed oral administration of tranexamic acid, given regularly over several days, and compared it to placebo. In the other four studies, a single application of topical tranexamic acid was compared with placebo (one study) and a combination of epinephrine and lidocaine or phenylephrine (three studies). All participants were adults. Tranexamic acid versus placeboFor our primary outcome, control of epistaxis: re-bleeding (proportion re-bleeding within 10 days), we were able to pool data from three studies. The pooled result demonstrated a benefit of tranexamic acid compared to placebo, the risk of re-bleeding reducing from 67% to 47% (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 0.90; three studies; 225 participants; moderate-quality evidence). When we compared the effects of oral and topical tranexamic acid separately the risk of re-bleeding with oral tranexamic acid reduced from 69% to 49%, RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.96; two studies, 157 participants; moderate-quality evidence) and with topical tranexamic acid it reduced from 66% to 43%, RR 0.66 (95% CI 0.41 to 1.05; single study, 68 participants). We rated the quality of evidence provided by the single study as low, therefore it is uncertain whether topical tranexamic acid is effective in stopping bleeding in the 10-day period after a single application. No study specifically sought to identify and report our primary outcome: significant adverse effects (i.e. seizures, thromboembolic events). The secondary outcome time to stop initial bleeding (proportion with bleeding controlled within 30 minutes) was measured in one study using topical tranexamic acid and there was no evidence of a difference at 30 minutes (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.11; 68 participants; low-quality evidence). No studies reported the proportion of patients requiring any further intervention (e.g. repacking, surgery, embolisation). One study of oral tranexamic acid reported the proportion of patients requiring blood transfusion and found no difference between groups: 5/45 (11%) versus 6/44 (14%) (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.48; 89 participants; low-quality evidence). Two studies reported hospital length of stay. One study reported a significantly shorter stay in the oral tranexamic acid group (mean difference (MD) -1.60 days, 95% CI -2.49 to -0.71; 68 participants). The other study found no evidence of a difference between the groups. Tranexamic acid versus other haemostatic agentsWhen we pooled the data from three studies the proportion of patients whose bleeding stopped within 10 minutes was significantly higher in the topical tranexamic acid group compared to the group receiving another haemostatic agent (70% versus 30%: RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.90 to 2.92; 460 participants) (moderate-quality evidence). Adverse effects across all studiesFive studies recorded 'adverse effects' in a general way. None found any difference between the groups in the occurrence of minor adverse effects (e.g. mild nausea and diarrhoea, 'bad taste' of gel). In one study a patient developed a superficial thrombophlebitis of both legs following discharge, however it is not reported in which group this occurred. No "other serious adverse effect" was reported in any study.

Authors' Conclusions

We found moderate-quality evidence that there is probably a reduction in the risk of re-bleeding with the use of either oral or topical tranexamic acid in addition to usual care in adult patients with epistaxis, compared to placebo with usual care. However, the quality of evidence relating solely to topical tranexamic acid was low (one study only), so we are uncertain whether or not topical tranexamic acid is effective in stopping bleeding in the 10-day period after a single application. We found moderate-quality evidence that topical tranexamic acid is probably better than other topical agents in stopping bleeding in the first 10 minutes. There have been only three RCTs on this subject since 1995. Since then there have been significant changes in nasal cauterisation and packing techniques (for example, techniques including nasal endoscopy and more invasive approaches such as endoscopic sphenopalatine artery ligation). New trials would inform us about the effectiveness of tranexamic acid in light of these developments.

### Multi-symptom asthma is closely related to nasal blockage, rhinorrhea and symptoms of chronic rhinosinusitis-evidence from the west Sweden asthma study [^ecdfe25d]. Respiratory Research (2010). Low credibility.

Definitions

The definitions in this manuscript are based on the following questions:

Physician-diagnosed asthma: "Have you been diagnosed as having asthma by a doctor?"; Asthma medication: "Do you currently use asthma medicine (continuously or as needed)?"; Attacks of shortness of breath: "Do you presently have, or have you had in the last 10 years, asthma symptoms (intermittent breathlessness or attacks of shortness of breath; the symptoms may exist simultaneously with or without cough or wheezing)?" and "Have you had these symptoms within the last year?"; Any wheeze: "Have you had whistling or wheezing in the chest at any occasion during the last 12 months?"; Recurrent wheeze: "Do you usually have wheezing or whistling in your chest when breathing?"; Dyspnea: "Do you get breathless when you walk on level ground with people of your own age?"; Breathlessness-exertion: "Do you usually have breathlessness, wheeze or severe cough on exertion?"; Breathlessness-cold: "Do you usually have breathlessness, wheeze or severe cough in cold weather?"; Breathlessness-exertion in cold: "Do you usually have breathlessness, wheeze or severe cough on exertion in cold weather?"; Allergic rhinitis: "Have you now, or have you ever had, allergic rhinitis (hay-fever) or allergic eye catarrh?"; Nasal blockage: "Do you have nasal blockage more or less constantly?"; Rhinorrhea: "Do you have a runny nose more or less constantly?"; Family history of asthma: " Do any of your parents or sibling have, or have had, asthma?"; Family history of allergy: " Do any of your parents or sibling have, or have had, allergic rhinitis or allergic eye catarrh?"; Occupational exposure: "Have you been heavily exposed to gas, dust or fumes at work?"; Waking-cough: "Have you been woken by an attack of coughing at any time in the last 12 months?"; Waking-up with shortness of breath: "Have you been woken by an attack of shortness of breath at any time in the last 12 months?"; Waking-tight chest: "Have you woken up with tightness in your chest at any time during the last 12 months?"; Physician diagnosed chronic sinusitis: " Has a doctor ever told you that you have chronic sinusitis?"; Nasal blockage, at least 12 weeks; "Has your nose been blocked for more than 12 weeks during the last 12 months?".

### "A year-long, fortnightly, observational survey in three European countries of patients with respiratory allergies induced by house dust mites: methodology, demographics and clinical characteristics" [^4b7d3233]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The screening questionnaire

In March and April 2012, potentially eligible people were screened with a 9-question Internet questionnaire (Additional file 1: Table S1). This questionnaire and the other survey questionnaires had been drafted in English, translated into local languages (Italian, French and Spanish) and then translated back into English for validation. The inclusion criteria were as follows: age 18 or over; moderate to very severe symptoms of HDM allergy; at least three of the following symptoms: blocked nose, runny nose, itchy nose, difficulty breathing, cough, wheezing, sneezing, chest tightening, itchy eyes and tearing; physician-diagnosed HDM allergy (and potentially other allergies); a positive skin prick test or IgE assay for HDM allergens; more severe allergic symptoms in September, October, November or December; no previous or current AIT; use of at least one antihistamine or corticosteroid medication; symptoms not sufficiently controlled by current medication; a moderate to very strong impact of HDM allergy on QoL. In view of the descriptive nature of the study, a statistical calculation of the sample size was not performed and the number of participants was conditioned by financial and logistic parameters. The goal was to have approximately 100 participants per country (i.e. 315 in total) at the start of the 12-month assessment period and 80 per country at the end of the period). All questionnaire data were anonymous. No directly or indirectly nominative information was recorded. Included patients were modestly remunerated for their participation.

The post-inclusion questionnaire

In April and May 2012, all included participants completed a 28-question post-inclusion questionnaire in an approximately 35-min telephone interview (Additional file 2: Table S2). The questionnaire was designed to probe the participant's disease history and establish a baseline so as to compare at the end of the survey, the behaviour. The collected data included the first symptoms of HDM allergy, the types and frequencies of physician consultations, the time interval between the first symptoms and the first consultation, the presence of any other physician-diagnosed allergies, the types of symptoms experienced and their duration, frequency, seasonality and impact on health and life activities, the presence of any comorbidities, the use of allergen eviction measures, the types of allergy medications and their regimens, financial aspects (reimbursement, and costs linked to changes in the home or work environment) and, lastly, awareness and opinion of AIT. Again, all questionnaire data were anonymized. No directly or indirectly nominative information was recorded.

### Epidemiology of oronasal hemorrhage in the first 2 years of life: implications for child protection [^36397546]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Epistaxis in childhood is common but unusual in the first years of life. Oronasal blood has been proposed as a marker of child abuse.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all hospital notes of children in the Lothian region of Scotland who were < 2 years of age and in whom facial blood had been recorded over a 10-year period.

Results

There were 77,173 accident and emergency department attendances with 58,059 admissions during the 10-year study period in children < 2 years of age; 16 cases of nose bleed and 3 cases of hemoptysis were recorded. All cases of hemoptysis were associated with significant bouts of coughing and respiratory infections. Epistaxis in 8 cases was associated with visible trauma and in 4 cases with thrombocytopenia (secondary to malignancy in 3). In 2 cases, an associated apparent life-threatening event was described, and in 2 cases there was a coincident upper respiratory tract infection. Review of previous and subsequent history suggested 7 cases of "accidental" injury that might have been caused by abuse. These cases are described here. All children who presented with this problem to the accident and emergency department had been admitted for observation or management.

Conclusions

Epistaxis is rare in the accident and emergency department and hospital in the first 2 years of life and is often associated with injury or serious illness. The investigation of all cases should involve a pediatrician with expertise in child protection.

### Abscess on the nasal tip of a young woman [^28a8c62a]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Answers:
A. Direct skin-to-skin contact – Incorrect. While some Streptococcus species can be transmitted through skin contact, GBS is more often spread via mucosal or genital contact. Skin-to-skin transmission is less likely in this case, given the microbiologic findings and the patient's sexual history.
B. Sexual transmission – Correct. The patient has a localized abscess caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS). GBS is commonly associated with genital and gastrointestinal tract colonization. Sexual transmission explains the chronicity of the nasal lesion, with a "ping-pong" effect due to reinfection between the patient and her partner. The partner's confirmed GBS colonization supports this mode of transmission.
C. Infected arthropod bite – Incorrect. Arthropod bites can become infected by pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. However, GBS is primarily associated with mucosal colonization and is not commonly linked to insect bites, making this explanation unlikely.
D. Fomite transmission – Incorrect. Although fomites can transmit certain infections, this is not a typical mode for GBS. The patient's lesion and sexual history strongly suggest direct, intimate contact, not indirect exposure through inanimate objects.
E. Autoinoculation from asymptomatic colonization – Incorrect. Airborne transmission is characteristic of respiratory pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae, not GBS. GBS is primarily spread through direct contact, particularly in the genital or mucosal regions, making this mode of transmission highly improbable. Oro-genital sexual transmission aligns with the patient's history, microbiologic findings, and the chronicity of the lesion.

Question 2: During the sexual health history, the clinician asks, "Do you have any current partners? What genders are your partners?" The patient becomes hesitant and expresses concern about how the information will be used. What is the most appropriate response by the clinician to maintain an affirming approach?
A. Reassure the patient that their information is needed solely to determine sexually transmitted infection (STI) risk
B. Apologize and move on, avoiding further discussion about their sexual history to preserve trust
C. Acknowledge the patient's concern, explain the purpose of the questions in understanding health risks, and invite them to share as much as they feel comfortable
D. Ask if the patient has ever been tested for STIs and skip further details about their sexual practices
E. Validate the patient's feelings, clarify that their responses will remain confidential, and recommend you discuss this at her next visit

### Bleeding after hospital discharge following acute coronary syndrome: incidence, types, timing, and predictors [^601bfc76]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Predictors

We identified potential predictors of bleeding by reviewing previously published risk scores for in‐hospital and postdischarge bleeding events, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 19, 20, 21 as well as studies that had reported on characteristics associated with bleeding after ACS. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 Nineteen potential predictors were selected for inclusion in the study on the basis of clinical judgement. These predictors included sociodemographic characteristics, cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities (recorded in the previous 2 years before the index date, except body mass index, which was defined as last measurement until 30 days after index date to capture the most recent body mass index for a patient), in‐hospital procedures, and pharmacological characteristics (recorded in the previous 6 months before the index date in the case of NSAIDs and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or within 90 days after hospital discharge in the case of antithrombotic drugs). See Table S1 for the full list of potential predictors and their baseline definitions.

Bleeding End Point

The outcome of bleeding was defined as having a diagnostic record for bleeding in a patient primary care record or a death record in Office for National Statistics mortality data, with bleeding as the underlying cause within 12 months after the index date. Bleeding events included gastrointestinal bleeding, hematemesis, melena, gastrointestinal ulcers with bleeding, intracranial bleeding, hemoptysis, epistaxis, hemarthrosis, hemopericardium, hematuria, vaginal bleeding, retinal bleeding, anemia caused by blood loss, spontaneous bruising, petechiae, spontaneous ecchymoses, and bleeding not elsewhere classified. Bleeding events were further classified based on site into bruising; respiratory/ears, nose, and throat; gastrointestinal; genitourinary; intraocular; and intracranial. Read codes used to define and classify bleeding events are available at. Where the date of the bleeding event was the same as the index date, these bleeding events were regarded as in‐hospital bleeds and, therefore, excluded.

Follow‐Up

For all analyses, patients who were discharged alive were longitudinally followed up for a maximum of 12 months for records of bleeding consultations after hospital discharge for ACS. Follow‐up started from the index date (date of hospital discharge) until earliest of first bleeding event or date patient ceased contributing to CPRD because of death or transfer out of practice or practice leaving CPRD or the end of 12 months from the index date of hospital discharge or the date of last data collection at the time of data request.

### Clinical practice guideline: improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty executive summary [^281f8272]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Objective Rhinoplasty, a surgical procedure that alters the shape or appearance of the nose while preserving or enhancing the nasal airway, ranks among the most commonly performed cosmetic procedures in the United States, with > 200,000 procedures reported in 2014. While it is difficult to calculate the exact economic burden incurred by rhinoplasty patients following surgery with or without complications, the average rhinoplasty procedure typically exceeds $4000. The costs incurred due to complications, infections, or revision surgery may include the cost of long-term antibiotics, hospitalization, or lost revenue from hours/days of missed work. The resultant psychological impact of rhinoplasty can also be significant. Furthermore, the health care burden from psychological pressures of nasal deformities/aesthetic shortcomings, surgical infections, surgical pain, side effects from antibiotics, and nasal packing materials must also be considered for these patients. Prior to this guideline, limited literature existed on standard care considerations for pre- and postsurgical management and for standard surgical practice to ensure optimal outcomes for patients undergoing rhinoplasty. The impetus for this guideline is to utilize current evidence-based medicine practices and data to build unanimity regarding the peri- and postoperative strategies to maximize patient safety and to optimize surgical results for patients. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline executive summary is to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians who either perform rhinoplasty or are involved in the care of a rhinoplasty candidate, as well as to optimize patient care, promote effective diagnosis and therapy, and reduce harmful or unnecessary variations in care. The target audience is any clinician or individual, in any setting, involved in the management of these patients. The target patient population is all patients aged ≥ 15 years. The guideline is intended to focus on knowledge gaps, practice variations, and clinical concerns associated with this surgical procedure; it is not intended to be a comprehensive reference for improving nasal form and function after rhinoplasty. Recommendations in this guideline concerning education and counseling to the patient are intended to include the caregiver if the patient is < 18 years of age. Action Statements The Guideline Development Group made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should ask all patients seeking rhinoplasty about their motivations for surgery and their expectations for outcomes, should provide feedback on whether those expectations are a realistic goal of surgery, and should document this discussion in the medical record. (2) Clinicians should assess rhinoplasty candidates for comorbid conditions that could modify or contraindicate surgery, including obstructive sleep apnea, body dysmorphic disorder, bleeding disorders, or chronic use of topical vasoconstrictive intranasal drugs. (3) The surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should evaluate the rhinoplasty candidate for nasal airway obstruction during the preoperative assessment. (4) The surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should educate rhinoplasty candidates regarding what to expect after surgery, how surgery might affect the ability to breathe through the nose, potential complications of surgery, and the possible need for future nasal surgery. (5) The clinician, or the clinician's designee, should counsel rhinoplasty candidates with documented obstructive sleep apnea about the impact of surgery on nasal airway obstruction and how obstructive sleep apnea might affect perioperative management. (6) The surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, should educate rhinoplasty patients before surgery about strategies to manage discomfort after surgery. (7) Clinicians should document patient satisfaction with their nasal appearance and with their nasal function at a minimum of 12 months after rhinoplasty. The guideline development group made recommendations against certain actions: (1) When a surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, chooses to administer perioperative antibiotics for rhinoplasty, he or she should not routinely prescribe antibiotic therapy for a duration > 24 hours after surgery. (2) Surgeons should not routinely place packing in the nasal cavity of rhinoplasty patients (with or without septoplasty) at the conclusion of surgery. The panel group made the following statement an option: (1) The surgeon, or the surgeon's designee, may administer perioperative systemic steroids to the rhinoplasty patient.

### Risk of cancer in patients with epistaxis and haemoptysis [^7fb31ff6]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Setting

This study was conducted using Danish national registries, covering a cumulative population of 7.2 million inhabitants during the 1995–2013 period. Danish registries record individual-level data on healthcare utilisation and vital status. All registries can be linked accurately and unambiguously using the unique personal identification number assigned by law to all Danish residents at birth or upon immigration.

Denmark's universal health care system provides free tax-supported access to primary and secondary health care. General practitioners function as gatekeepers to the secondary health care system, referring patients for inpatient and outpatient hospital treatment.

The Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) has recorded all Danish non-psychiatric inpatient hospitalisations since 1977, and all outpatient visits, emergency room visits, and hospital-based outpatient clinic visits since 1995. Diseases are classified according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Eighth Revision through 1993 and Tenth Revision thereafter. Diagnosis codes used in the study are provided in the online data Supplementary Table E1.

Patient population

We used the DNPR to identify patients with a first-time primary or secondary hospital-based diagnosis of epistaxis or haemoptysis between 1 January 1995 and 31 December 2013. Patients were classified according to the first recorded bleeding event as either epistaxis or haemoptysis. There were 50 patients diagnosed with both epistaxis and haemoptysis during the same hospital visit. We included all inpatient, outpatient clinic, and emergency room diagnoses. The discharge date for epistaxis or haemoptysis defined the index date. Patients diagnosed with any cancer, benign tumours before or on the index date were not included in the study.

Cancer diagnoses

We used the Danish Cancer Registry (DCR) to identify all incident cancers diagnosed after the index date. The DCR has recorded all incident cancer cases in Denmark since 1943, including information on morphology, histology, and stage at diagnosis. Diagnoses are coded according to the ICD-10. We categorised cancers as haematological, immune-related, smoking and alcohol related, and cancers at all other sites, as shown in detail in the online data Supplementary Table E1.

Follow-up

We computed the number of person-years of observation as the time between the index diagnosis date of epistaxis or haemoptysis and date of incident cancer diagnosis, death, emigration, or 31 December 2013, whichever came first. These dates were determined through linkage to the DCR and to the Danish Civil Registration System, which updates information on vital status and emigration on a daily basis for the entire Danish population.

### Female subfertility [^16127186]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

With an average monthly fecundity rate of only 20%, human beings are not fertile mammals. 10–15% of couples have difficulties conceiving, or conceiving the number of children they want, and seek specialist fertility care at least once during their reproductive lifetime. Dependent on the two main factors that determine subfertility, duration of childlessness and age of the woman, three questions need to be addressed before treatment is offered. Is it time to start the routine fertility investigation? — ie, has sufficient exposure to the chance of conception taken place? Are cost-effective, safe, and reliable treatments available for the disorder diagnosed? And, should the couple be referred straightaway for assisted reproduction?

Scuba diving barotrauma — ear/sinus and pulmonary overpressure — details mechanisms, risk factors, symptoms, and urgent actions. In the ear, the eardrum being pushed into the middle ear space can cause "pain, bleeding, and possibly rupture and even injury to the inner ear", and "Forceful equalization under these conditions can increase the pressure differential… resulting in round window rupture with perilymph leakage and inner ear damage"; "Healthcare professionals can coach this effort by observing movement of the tympanic membrane using simple otoscopy". For sinuses, "Paranasal sinuses… are especially susceptible to barotrauma, generally on descent", with risk factors including "Use of solid earplugs", "Medication (e.g., overuse or prolonged use of decongestants leading to rebound congestion)", "Ear or sinus surgery", "Nasal deformity or polyps", and "Chronic nasal and sinus disease that interferes with equilibration during the large barometric pressure changes encountered while diving". Divers who suspect ear or sinus barotrauma "should discontinue diving and seek medical attention". Symptoms of ear barotrauma include "Decreased hearing", "Pain", "Sensation of fullness", "Sensation of "water in the ear" (serous fluid/ blood accumulation in the middle ear)", "Tinnitus (ringing in the ears)", and "Vertigo (dizziness or sensation of spinning)". For pulmonary injury, "Scuba divers can reduce the risk for lung overpressure problems by breathing normally and ascending slowly when breathing compressed gas", because "Overexpansion of the lungs can result if a scuba diver ascends toward the surface without exhaling". During ascent, bubbles can escape into "3 possible locations: the pleural space, mediastinum, or pulmonary vasculature", with pleural entry causing "lung collapse or pneumothorax", mediastinal entry causing "mediastinal emphysema" that can track subcutaneously or to the larynx with "a change in voice characteristics", and alveolar rupture leading to "arterial gas embolism (AGE)". "Mediastinal or subcutaneous emphysema might resolve spontaneously, but pneumothorax generally requires specific treatment to remove the air and reinflate the lung", and "AGE is a medical emergency, requiring urgent intervention with hyperbaric oxygen therapy (recompression treatment)".

### Antibiotics for clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^2d0778f3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

In primary care settings, the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms. Technical investigations are not routinely performed, nor recommended. Individual trials show a trend in favour of antibiotics, but the balance of benefit versus harm is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012) and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012).

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information. We collected information on adverse effects from the trials.

Main Results

We included 10 trials involving 2450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure, but only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB)) 18 (95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics (odds ratio (OR) 1.58 (95% CI 1.13 to 2.22)), (NNTB 11, 95% CI 6 to 51, I(2) statistic 0%, three trials). However, 27% of the participants who received antibiotics and 15% of those who received placebo experienced adverse events (OR 2.10, 95% CI 1.60 to 2.77) (number needed to treat to harm (NNTH)) 8 (95% CI 6 to 13, I(2) statistic 13%, seven trials). More participants in the placebo group needed to start antibiotic therapy because of an abnormal course of rhinosinusitis (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.66), NNTH 20 (95% CI 14 to 35, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Only one disease-related complication (brain abscess) occurred in a patient treated with antibiotics.

Authors' Conclusions

The potential benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis needs to be seen in the context of a high prevalence of adverse events. Taking into account antibiotic resistance and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude that there is no place for antibiotics for the patient with clinically diagnosed, uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. This review cannot make recommendations for children, patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with severe disease, as these populations were not included in the available trials.

### Global estimation of the bleeding episodes treatable with desmopressin in von Willebrand disease and hemophilia a… [^6bc8f897]. Haematologica (2025). Medium credibility.

Desmopressin increases plasma factor VIII and von Willebrand factor in non-severe hemophilia A (Hem A) and type 1 von Willebrand disease (VWD), following intravenous infusions, subcutaneous injections, or nasal spray. This medication, with almost 50 years of clinical experience and proven safety and efficacy, is often unavailable. Thus, there is a need to establish how many patients can benefit from it and how many bleeding episodes can be treated. We reviewed the literature to estimate the global prevalence of symptomatic patients with VWD type 1 and non-severe Hem A, the incidence of bleeds, and the rate of responsiveness to desmopressin. Real-world data indicate that 1.7 patients with VWD per 100,000 seek care in specialized centers. Of them, 1.15 per 100,000 have type 1 VWD and 80% are reported to respond to desmopressin. In type 1 VWD, the estimated frequency of bleeds treatable with desmopressin are 2.5 events per patient year. Non-severe cases are 45% of all Hem A cases, with a much lower incidence of bleeds than in severe disease (0.4 events / patient / year). Based on epidemiology, data on the rates of bleeding, and desmopressin responsiveness, we estimated that 84,000 people with VWD type 1 would benefit from desmopressin to treat 210,000 yearly bleeds, and that 81,000 people with non-severe Hem A can be treated yearly for 13,000 bleeds. Desmopressin is an essential therapeutic tool in non-severe Hem A and type 1 VWD that can treat more than 220,000 bleeding episodes successfully, safely, and economically, also in low-income settings with poor access to costly replacement therapies.

### Supporting the grieving child and family [^43ad78c2]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Grief triggers and anniversary reactions in bereaved children are described, noting that grief triggers evoke sudden reminders that can cause powerful emotional responses and are most common in the first few months after the death but may happen months or years later, with the strength of emotions generally lessening with time. Parents can work with teachers to minimize likely triggers in school and create a safety plan so students know they can leave the classroom if necessary; if children know they can leave if they need to, they are less likely to feel overwhelmed and will rarely need to exit and are more able to remain engaged in classwork. Anniversaries of the death, birthdays, holidays, special events, and major transitions are also times when a loved one's absence will be acutely felt; pediatricians can help the family find ways to meaningfully honor these events, and the medical home is uniquely well suited to provide ongoing periodic bereavement support. Pediatricians should invite children and their families to reach out for assistance and advice as children adjust to the loss over time, and pediatricians can, instead, schedule follow-up appointments to coincide with such timed events (eg, just before the start of a new school year; just before the first-year anniversary of the death), when modest changes in the timing make it practical, or can call, write, or e-mail a patient/family periodically to check in and let the child and family know of their continued availability and interest; when the pediatrician communicates continued concern and availability, it increases the chances that the child or family will seek advice and assistance when needed.

### How many HIV infections may be averted by targeting primary infection in men who have sex with men? Quantification of changes in transmission-risk behavior, using an individual-based model [^6f9bb815]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

RESULTS

In the baseline scenario, in which we examined what would have happened if the modeled MSM had not received a diagnosis of HIV infection and their pattern of behavior reported in the prediagnosis period had continued unchanged throughout the 3 months after infection, then the predicted number of HIV transmission events occurring from the cohort of 98 MSM would have been 31 (95% CI, 14–55) and 33 (95% CI, 17–56), using the parameter values from Scott et al and assuming PHI lasts 3 months or 1.25 months, respectively; corresponding estimates using the values from Patel et al were 45 (95% CI, 22–80) and 48 (95% CI, 25–82), respectively. In the scenario in which all of the modeled MSM received a diagnosis of HIV infection immediately and their postdiagnosis behavior pattern had occurred throughout the 3 months after infection, there would have been a reduction of 65% (using the estimates from Scott et al) or 64% (using the estimates from Patel et al) in the number of transmission events (Figure 2), compared with the respective baseline scenarios. Since immediate diagnosis could not be practicably achieved, we examined the effect of testing twice per month, once per month, twice every 3 months, and once every 2 months (Figure 2). An important cause of uncertainty in the numbers of infections averted is uncertainty in the transmission probabilities associated with anal sex, with the estimates of Patel et al leading to a greater number of infections occurring and therefore a greater number averted by postdiagnosis behavior change. As the frequency of testing declines, so does the number of infections averted. If PHI lasts for 3 months, then testing every month could avert a substantial number of infections. Importantly, if the duration of PHI is as short as 1.25 months, then it is necessary to have very frequent testing — twice per month — to avert a substantial number of infections; otherwise, infection will be undiagnosed for the majority of the period of PHI. Note that our analysis considers the 3-month period after HIV infection, and therefore if diagnosis occurs toward the end of this period then there is little impact in terms of calculated numbers of infections averted; however, the actual number of infections averted would be greater than this because the behavior change associated with the 3-month period after diagnosis would extend beyond the period considered in our analysis.

### Intranasal corticosteroids for non-allergic rhinitis [^bdfd8099]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Non-allergic rhinitis is defined as dysfunction and non-infectious inflammation of the nasal mucosa that is caused by provoking agents other than allergens or microbes. It is common, with an estimated prevalence of around 10% to 20%. Patients experience symptoms of nasal obstruction, anterior rhinorrhoea/post-nasal drip and sneezing. Several subgroups of non-allergic rhinitis can be distinguished, depending on the trigger responsible for symptoms; these include occupation, cigarette smoke, hormones, medication, food and age. On a cellular molecular level different disease mechanisms can also be identified. People with non-allergic rhinitis often lack an effective treatment as a result of poor understanding and lack of recognition of the underlying disease mechanism. Intranasal corticosteroids are one of the most common types of medication prescribed in patients with rhinitis or rhinosinusitis symptoms, including those with non-allergic rhinitis. However, it is unclear whether intranasal corticosteroids are truly effective in these patients.

Objectives

To assess the effects of intranasal corticosteroids in the management of non-allergic rhinitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL 2019, Issue 7); PubMed; Ovid Embase; CINAHL; Web of Science; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 1 July 2019.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intranasal corticosteroids, delivered by any means and in any volume, with (a) placebo/no intervention or (b) other active treatments in adults and children (aged ≥ 12 years).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were patient-reported disease severity and a significant adverse effect - epistaxis. Secondary outcomes were (disease-specific) health-related quality of life, objective measurements of airflow and other adverse events. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome.

Main Results

We included 34 studies (4452 participants); however, only 13 studies provided data for our main comparison, intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo. The participants were mainly defined as patients with perennial rhinitis symptoms and negative allergy tests. No distinction between different pheno- and endotypes could be made, although a few studies only included a specific phenotype such as pregnancy rhinitis, vasomotor rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa or senile rhinitis. Most studies were conducted in a secondary or tertiary healthcare setting. No studies reported outcomes beyond three months follow-up. Intranasal corticosteroid dosage in the review ranged from 50 µg to 2000 µg daily. Intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo Thirteen studies (2045 participants) provided data for this comparison. These studies used different scoring systems for patient-reported disease severity, so we pooled the data in each analysis using the standardised mean difference (SMD). Intranasal corticosteroid treatment may improve patient-reported disease severity as measured by total nasal symptom score compared with placebo at up to four weeks (SMD -0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.15 to -0.33; 4 studies; 131 participants; I² = 22%) (low-certainty evidence). However, between four weeks and three months the evidence is very uncertain (SMD -0.24, 95% CI -0.67 to 0.20; 3 studies; 85 participants; I² = 0%) (very low-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroid treatment may slightly improve patient-reported disease severity as measured by total nasal symptom score change from baseline when compared with placebo at up to four weeks (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.25 to -0.05; 4 studies; 1465 participants; I² = 35%) (low-certainty evidence). All four studies evaluating the risk of epistaxis showed that there is probably a higher risk in the intranasal corticosteroids group (65 per 1000) compared to placebo (31 per 1000) (risk ratio (RR) 2.10, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.57; 4 studies; 1174 participants; I² = 0%) (moderate-certainty evidence). The absolute risk difference (RD) was 0.04 with a number needed to treat for an additional harmful outcome (NNTH) of 25 (95% CI 16.7 to 100). Only one study reported numerical data for quality of life. It did report a higher quality of life score in the intranasal corticosteroids group (152.3 versus 145.6; SF-12v2 range 0 to 800); however, this disappeared at longer-term follow-up (148.4 versus 145.6) (low-certainty evidence). Only two studies provided data for the outcome objective measurements of airflow. These data could not be pooled because they used different methods of outcome measurement. Neither found a significant difference between the intranasal corticosteroids and placebo group (rhinomanometry SMD -0.46, 95% CI -1.06 to 0.14; 44 participants; peak expiratory flow rate SMD 0.78, 95% CI -0.47 to 2.03; 11 participants) (very low-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroids probably resulted in little or no difference in the risk of other adverse events compared to placebo (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.12; 3 studies; 1130 participants; I² = 0%) (moderate-certainty evidence). Intranasal corticosteroids versus other treatments Only one or a few studies assessed each of the other comparisons (intranasal corticosteroids versus saline irrigation, intranasal antihistamine, capsaicin, cromoglycate sodium, ipratropium bromide, intranasal corticosteroids combined with intranasal antihistamine, intranasal corticosteroids combined with intranasal antihistamine and intranasal corticosteroids with saline compared to saline alone). It is therefore uncertain whether there are differences between intranasal corticosteroids and other active treatments for any of the outcomes reported.

Authors' Conclusions

Overall, the certainty of the evidence for most outcomes in this review was low or very low. It is unclear whether intranasal corticosteroids reduce patient-reported disease severity in non-allergic rhinitis patients compared with placebo when measured at up to three months. However, intranasal corticosteroids probably have a higher risk of the adverse effect epistaxis. There are very few studies comparing intranasal corticosteroids to other treatment modalities making it difficult to draw conclusions.

### Azelastine hydrochloride and fluticasone propionate [^d8f62242]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of azelastine / fluticasone IN:
- **Adrenal suppression**: use caution with concomitant use of intranasal corticosteroids with other ICSs and those with risk factors for adrenal insufficiency. Careful monitoring of patients with concomitant use of intranasal and ICSs and those at risk for adrenal insufficiency is essential. Appropriate adjustments in corticosteroid dosages and medical evaluation for adrenal insufficiency should be undertaken.
- Exacerbation of tuberculosis, fungal infections, bacterial infections, viral infections: use caution in patients with an active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract; untreated local or systemic fungal infection or bacterial infections; systemic viral infection or parasitic infections; or ocular herpes simplex. Patients should be thoroughly evaluated for tuberculosis and other infections before starting Azelastine/fluticasone hydrochloride. Appropriate medical treatment for the specific infection should be initiated immediately under healthcare supervision.
- **Nasal septal abscess**: use caution when using azelastine; fluticasone intranasally over several months or longer. Patients should ensure proper administration of Azelastine/fluticasone hydrochloride, avoiding excessive force when spraying, and maintaining good nasal hygiene. Patients should immediately seek medical attention for appropriate treatment, which may include antibiotics.
- **Sedation**: use caution in patients with excessive alcohol consumption. Patients should use Azelastine/fluticasone hydrochloride at the recommended dosage and avoid operating heavy machinery or driving if they experience sedation. Patients should avoid activities that require alertness, and consult their healthcare provider to assess the need for adjusting the dosage.

MEDICATION GUIDE

Valproic Acid (val-proé-ik-as íd) Capsules

Read this Medication Guide before you start taking Valproic Acid Capsules and each time you get a refill. There may be new information.

This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment.

What is the most important information I should know about Valproic Acid Capsules? Do not stop taking Valproic Acid Capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping valproic acid suddenly can cause serious problems.

Valproic Acid Capsules can cause serious side effects, including:

1. Serious liver damage that can cause death, especially in children younger than 2 years old. The risk of getting this serious liver damage is more likely to happen within the first 6 months of treatment. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following symptoms:

nausea or vomiting that does not go away
loss of appetite
pain on the right side of your stomach (abdomen)
dark urine
swelling of your face
yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes

In some cases, liver damage may continue despite stopping the drug.

2. Valproic Acid Capsules may harm your unborn baby.

If you take Valproic Acid Capsules during pregnancy for any medical condition, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects that affect the brain and spinal cord and are called spina bifida or neural tube defects. These defects occur in 1 to 2 out of every 100 babies born to mothers who use this medicine during pregnancy. These defects can begin in the first month, even before you know you are pregnant. Other birth defects that affect the structures of the heart, head, arms, legs, and the opening where the urine comes out (urethra) on the bottom of the penis can also happen. Decreased hearing or hearing loss can also happen.

### Impact of galcanezumab on total pain burden: a post hoc analysis of a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with episodic cluster headache [^747cddd5]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Episodic cluster headache (CH) is a debilitating disease characterized by daily attacks of intense unilateral headache with autonomic symptoms such as lacrimation, nasal congestion, forehead and facial sweating, restlessness, and agitation. The headache attacks occur over periods lasting from 7 days to 1 year and are separated by pain-free periods of at least 3 months. Patients with episodic CH can experience multiple, sometimes excruciatingly painful, headache attacks each day, lasting from 15 minutes to 3 hours. The pain associated with CH has been described as one of the most severe types of pain experienced by humans; consequently, the disease has a significant negative impact on patients' health-related quality of life. The periods of CH attack can increase the risk of self-injurious behaviorand suicidal ideation.CH also poses a significant economic burden due to absenteeism and presenteeism.

The realistic goal of treatment for episodic CH is to shorten the cluster period and to reduce the frequency and/or severity of CH attacks. Guidelines recognize the need for both acute (abortive) treatment (treatment taken at the start of a headache attack to shorten the attack duration and reduce its severity) and preventive treatment (prophylaxis; treatment to reduce the frequency of headache attacks, starting as early as possible after the start of a new cluster period). For acute treatment, subcutaneous or intranasal sumatriptan and high-flow oxygen are recommended. For preventive treatment, verapamil and lithium are among the treatment options used. Some preventive treatments (such as suboccipital corticosteroid injections or oral steroids), known as transitional treatments, are reserved for short-term use or for "bridge" therapy to provide rapid relief, while another preventive treatment (such as verapamil) takes effect.

### Norethindrone acetate and ethinyl estradiol and ferrous fumarate (finzala) [^b617d0db]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

If you have breast cancer now, or have had it in the past, do not use hormonal birth control because some breast cancers are sensitive to hormones.

Women who use birth control pills may have a slightly higher chance of getting cervical cancer. However, this may be due to other reasons such as having more sexual partners.

What should I know about my period when taking Finzala?

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking Finzala. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your tablets on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle, is unusually heavy, or lasts for more than a few days, call your healthcare provider.

Some women may not have a menstrual period but this should not be cause for alarm as long as you have taken the tablets according to direction.

What if I miss my scheduled period when taking Finzala?

It is not uncommon to miss your period. However, if you go two or more months in a row without a period, or you miss your period after a month where you did not take all your tablets correctly, call your healthcare provider because you may be pregnant. Also notify your healthcare provider if you have symptoms of pregnancy such as morning sickness or unusual breast tenderness. Stop taking Finzala if you are pregnant.

What if I want to become pregnant?

You may stop taking the tablets whenever you wish. Consider a visit with your healthcare provider for a pre-pregnancy checkup before you stop taking the tablets.

General Advice about Finzala

Your healthcare provider prescribed Finzala for you. Please do not share Finzala with anyone else. Keep Finzala out of the reach of children.

If you have concerns or questions, ask your healthcare provider. You may also ask your pharmacist for a more detailed label written for healthcare professionals.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^74142e95]. Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) occur in as many as 5% of infants, making them the most common benign tumor of infancy. Most IHs are small, innocuous, self-resolving, and require no treatment. However, because of their size or location, a significant minority of IHs are potentially problematic. These include IHs that may cause permanent scarring and disfigurement (eg, facial IHs), hepatic or airway IHs, and IHs with the potential for functional impairment (eg, periorbital IHs), ulceration (that may cause pain or scarring), and associated underlying abnormalities (eg, intracranial and aortic arch vascular abnormalities accompanying a large facial IH). This clinical practice guideline for the management of IHs emphasizes several key concepts. It defines those IHs that are potentially higher risk and should prompt concern, and emphasizes increased vigilance, consideration of active treatment and, when appropriate, specialty consultation. It discusses the specific growth characteristics of IHs, that is, that the most rapid and significant growth occurs between 1 and 3 months of age and that growth is completed by 5 months of age in most cases. Because many IHs leave behind permanent skin changes, there is a window of opportunity to treat higher-risk IHs and optimize outcomes. Early intervention and/or referral (ideally by 1 month of age) is recommended for infants who have potentially problematic IHs. When systemic treatment is indicated, propranolol is the drug of choice at a dose of 2 to 3 mg/kg per day. Treatment typically is continued for at least 6 months and often is maintained until 12 months of age (occasionally longer). Topical timolol may be used to treat select small, thin, superficial IHs. Surgery and/or laser treatment are most useful for the treatment of residual skin changes after involution and, less commonly, may be considered earlier to treat some IHs.

### The impact of REM-sleep behavior disorder on people with Parkinson's disease and their partners [^d9da47fa]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

Theme 2: sleep related complaints

Nighttime behaviors in people with RBD varied widely, both among and within individuals. Manifestations included talking, counting, singing, screaming, cursing, sitting up, scratching, petting, grabbing, hitting, kicking, squeezing, and rarely walking or falling out of bed. Partners often noticed powerful movements, possibly overlooking subtler movements when sleeping. If injuries occurred, partners were most often affected. Many couples experienced periods with worsening of RBD symptoms, some related this to stress, and expressed their concerns about symptom progression.

Dreams with RBD behaviors ranged from everyday scenarios to improbable situations. Although themes were often random, some repetitive patterns emerged, with dreams sometimes reflecting recent experiences. Dreams were vivid, realistic, and emotionally charged, with fear, anger, and frustration playing prominent roles. Partners occasionally doubted whether to wake PwP from these dreams, and many couples made agreements on this based on what worked best.

"Those are often not the pleasantest dreams, often involving violence. I do not have the feeling that I am experiencing or processing trauma; it is quite bizarre sometimes. [Interviewer: so quite random?] Quite random indeed, what the subject is and whether I [for example] hit children. That is a little bit traumatic because you should not do that, of course. Or I grab my wife, I have also dreamt of that sometimes, and then it actually happened, once. But yes, that is part of it, of course". [PwP 1]

Most PwP did not consider RBD highly disabling as it did not significantly affect their sleep quality. Nonetheless, many struggled with the idea of keeping their partner awake. Partners experienced RBD symptoms of PwP more intensely, leading them to stay awake, sometimes anxiously, and needing time to recover after severe episodes. They were vigilant about RBD behaviors, which disrupted their sleep or caused trouble falling asleep, though they became well-equipped to predict quiet or active nights. Over time, partners often grew accustomed to RBD, reducing their concerns and allowing them to fall asleep more quickly.

### Are respiratory disorders risk factors for troublesome low-back pain? A study of a general population cohort in Sweden [^658b9271]. European Spine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

A multi-morbidity perspective of troublesome low back pain (LBP) has been highlighted for example in relation to respiratory disorders. Our purpose was to investigate whether respiratory disorders are risk factors for reporting troublesome LBP in people with no or occasional LBP at baseline.

Methods

This prospective cohort study was based on the Stockholm Public Health Cohort 2006/2010. We included adults reporting no or occasional LBP the last 6 months at baseline (n = 17,177). Exposures were self-reported asthma and/or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Outcome was troublesome LBP defined as reporting LBP a couple of days per week or more often that restricted work capacity or hindered daily activities to some or to a high degree, the last 6 months. Binomial regression models were used to calculate risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).

Results

Adjusted results indicate that those suffering from asthma had a risk of troublesome LBP at follow-up (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.92–1.81) as do those suffering from COPD (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.13–3.56). If suffering from asthma and concurrent COPD the RR was 3.55 (95% CI 1.58–7.98).

Conclusion

Our findings indicate that suffering from asthma and/or COPD increases the risk of developing troublesome LBP, which highlights the importance to consider the overall health of people at risk of troublesome LBP and to take the multi-morbidity perspective into consideration. Future longitudinal studies are needed to confirm our findings. These slides can be retrieved under Electronic Supplementary Material.

### Bacillus calmette-Guérin vaccination for protection against recurrent herpes labialis: a nested randomised controlled trial [^aa4c351c]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Outcome measures

Questionnaires were completed by participants at baseline and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-months of follow-up. In the baseline questionnaire, participants were asked demographic questions (including sex) and details about their previous history of cold sores, including age at first episode, number of cold sore episodes (overall and in the last year), use of treatment for cold sores, and impact of cold sores on quality of life. In the follow-up questionnaires, participants were asked whether they had had a cold sore recurrence since their last completed questionnaire, the frequency of episodes, when the first recurrence began, any treatment used for cold sores, and whether they noticed a change in cold sore recurrences in terms of frequency, duration, severity, and impact on quality of life.

The primary outcome for this nested study was the time from randomisation to first self-reported cold sore recurrence in the subset of participants with frequent recurrent herpes labialis, defined as reporting four or more cold sore recurrences in the preceding year at the baseline questionnaire. Secondary outcomes included the number of cold sore recurrences, proportion of participants with a cold sore recurrence, and proportion of participants with a perceived change in duration, severity, frequency, or impact on quality of life of cold sore recurrences (see Appendix).

### Outpatient management of COVID-19: rapid evidence review [^473eb769]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

New COVID-19 variants of concern continue to develop. Incubation period, transmissibility, immune escape, and treatment effectiveness differ by variants of concern. Physicians should be aware that the characteristics of the predominant variants of concern determine aspects of diagnosis and treatment. Multiple testing modalities exist; the most appropriate testing strategy varies depending on the clinical scenario, with factors of test sensitivity, turnaround time, and the expertise required for specimen collection. Three types of vaccines are available in the United States, and all people six months and older should be encouraged to receive one because vaccination is effective in reducing the incidence of and hospitalizations and deaths associated with COVID-19. Vaccination may also reduce the incidence of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (i.e., long COVID). Consider medications, such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, as first-line treatment for eligible patients diagnosed with COVID-19 unless logistical or supply constraints occur. National Institutes of Health guidelines and local health care partner resources can be used to determine eligibility. Long-term health effects of having COVID-19 are under investigation.

### Levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol and ferrous fumarate (joyeaux) [^df63efe2]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

0.1 mg/0.02 mg

for oral administration

Important Information about taking Joyeaux

Take 1 pill every day at the same time. Take the pills in the order directed on your blister pack.

Both the white pills and the brown pills should be swallowed whole.
Do not skip your pills, even if you do not have sex often. If you miss pills (including starting the pack late) you could get pregnant. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant.
If you have trouble remembering to take Joyeaux, talk to your healthcare provider. When you first start taking Joyeaux, spotting or light bleeding in between your periods may occur. Contact your healthcare provider if this does not go away after a few months.
You may feel sick to your stomach (nauseous), especially during the first few months of taking Joyeaux. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking the pill. The problem will usually go away. If your nausea does not go away, call your healthcare provider.
Missing pills can also cause spotting or light bleeding, even when you take the missed pills later. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills (see below), you could also feel a little sick to your stomach.
Some women miss periods on hormonal birth control, even when they are not pregnant. However, if you miss a period and have not taken Joyeaux according to directions, or miss 2 periods in a row, or feel like you may be pregnant, call your healthcare provider. If you have a positive pregnancy test, you should stop taking Joyeaux.
If you have vomiting or diarrhea within 3 to 4 hours of taking your pill, take another pill of the same color from your extra blister pack. If you do not have an extra blister pack, take the next pill in your blister pack.
Continue taking all your remaining pills in order. Start the first pill of your next blister pack the day after finishing your current blister pack. This will be 1 day earlier than originally scheduled. Continue on your new schedule.
If you have vomiting or diarrhea for more than 1 day, your birth control pills may not work as well. Use an additional birth control method, like condoms or a spermicide, until you check with your healthcare provider.
Stop taking Joyeaux at least 4 weeks before you have major surgery and do not restart it until at least 2 weeks after your surgery. Be sure to use other forms of contraception (like condoms or spermicide) during this time period.

Adverse Events will be recorded and analysed to confirm if they are related to the intervention being trialled by a safety committee. If deemed more than 40% are due to the intervention, the trial will be terminated.

Safety concerns include:
If data or results indicate patient safety is at risk, the trial will be terminated.
If the severity or number of adverse events related to the intervention occur [> 40%], the trial will be terminated. An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that results in hospitalisation or prolongation of hospitalisation, or is life-threatening, or results in death or disability, including birth defects.

Recruitment:
Insufficient accrual of participants (less than 30 people) within an 18-month time frame.

It is unlikely that this research project would be stopped unexpectedly unless due to unforeseen circumstances. This trial is being monitored by UTS HREC and Endeavour HREC. In addition, this is a TGA approved product and is already available for retail purchase in Australia and the United States of America. All safety data pertaining to the product is available, however, safety is still being monitored in this trial.

Confidentiality

Participant raw data will be collected on paper case report forms with a de-identified study code. Identification of the participant is through a single password-protected electronic file which matches name with study code. The Study code is only used on all data collection forms (paper and electronic). Data will all be analysed in summarised form. The electronic file which contains the identities of the participants is stored on restricted drive in the Endeavour College which is only accessible by the researchers. Only de-identified data analysed in summary form will be used in presentation or publication. Data (electronic and hard copy) will be stored for 7 years and then permanently destroyed.

### Pain assessment and treatment in children with significant impairment of the central nervous system [^8db7c39f]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Children with significant impairment of the central nervous system — chronic pain treatment and recurrent episodes — An empirical analgesic trial can be considered when pain behaviors continue, and there is no absolute "tipping point" when the severity, frequency, and duration of episodes with pain behaviors warrant an empirical medication trial versus further diagnostic testing. Consideration of central sources of symptoms with parents can minimize the assumption that testing will eventually identify the source to be treated, and initiating an empirical medication trial while considering invasive tests, such as endoscopy or impedance study, can avoid the need for such tests when symptoms improve; an empirical trial can also be considered before surgical interventions for GERD and spasticity with associated pain behaviors. For recurrent episodes, guiding principles include frequency and duration: infrequent episodes may be adequately managed with a medication used as needed along with nonpharmacologic strategies, whereas when episodes occur weekly, a scheduled medication can be considered to minimize the frequency, duration, and severity of episodes; occasionally, a child may have a monthly cycle of pain, with a case described as having daily severe symptoms for 7 to 10 days each month for at least 4 years with significant benefit after several medication trials directed at neuropathic pain. Setting realistic goals can better prepare families, acknowledging the inability to "fix" the sources of chronic pain from the impaired nervous system and recognizing that the hoped-for benefit might not always be achieved.

### Continuous versus on-demand pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis: evidence and practice [^fee0a335]. Respiratory Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

This review aims to compare continuous with on-demand pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis by focusing on pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, safety, effectiveness, cost and cost-effectiveness considerations. A working party of experts reviewed and discussed the literature and guidelines, and conducted a qualitative analysis of the Summary of Product Characteristics of specific medicines. With respect to medicines, the working party limited itself to antihistamines, nasal corticosteroids and leukotriene antagonists. Based on a review of the evidence from a multidisciplinary perspective, this article makes pharmacotherapeutic recommendations that are easy, functional and applicable to daily practice in primary care. The pharmacotherapeutic evidence for continuous versus on-demand treatment of allergic rhinitis was limited. Clearly, for corticosteroids, their mechanism of action in allergic rhinitis of reducing allergic inflammation requires continuous therapy at least for the duration of symptoms. For H(1)-antihistamines, some trials suggest that continuous treatment is preferable but more studies are needed to confirm this conclusion. For both H(1)-antihistamines and nasal corticosteroids safety data indicate that continuous treatment may be given without fears of adverse consequences, although a distinction can be made between the first and the second generation antihistamines. With regard to the cost and cost-effectiveness implications of continuous therapy versus on-demand therapy, more studies are necessary before definitive conclusions may be made.

### Confirmatory factor analysis of adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) among a community-based sample of parents and adolescents [^e565edef]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Peer victimization

Parents were asked two questions about peer victimization: 1) Sometimes kids get hassled or picked on by other kids who say hurtful or mean things to them. Before the age of 16, how many times did this happen to you? and 2) Sometimes kids get physically pushed around, hit or beaten up by other kids or a group of kids. Before the age of 16, how many times did this happen to you? Both items were dichotomized, with the first item coded as yes if the participant indicated that this occurred more than 10 times and the second item coded yes if it occurred 3 to 5 times or more. Adolescents were asked about seven forms of peer victimization in the past 12 months, including: 1) bullied, picked on you, or said means things about you, or threatened you through texting or the Internet (e.g. posted something on Facebook or other social media, or sent texts or emails); 2) made fun of you, called you names or insulted you in person or behind your back, but excluding texting, email, social media, or online posting or communications; 3) spread rumors about you in person or behind your back, but excluding texting, email, social media, or online posting or communications; 4) pushed you, shoved you, tripped you, or spit on you; 5) said something bad about your race, culture, or religion in person or behind your back, but excluding texting, email, social media, or online posting or communications; 6) said something bad about your sexual orientation or gender identity in person or behind your back, but excluding texting, email social media, or online posting or communications; and 7) said something bad about your body shape, size, or appearance in person or behind your back, but excluding texting, email, social media, or online posting or communications. Response options were: never, 1 or 2 times a year, 3 to 6 times a year, 7 to 11 times a year, once a month, a couple times a month, once a week, a couple times a week, and every day. A single indicator for peer victimization was coded according to whether the participant reported experiencing any of these items once a month or more often.

### Sexual functioning in 4, 418 postmenopausal women participating in UKCTOCS: a qualitative free-text analysis [^27dd7d68]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Psychological concerns were mentioned by very few women (44/2,883; 1.5%), and included traumatic experiences, phobias, low self-esteem, or problems related to physical appearance, body image, or self-perception: "I had breast cancer and feel less feminine with the scars and deformity" (57 y; inactive).

A few comments referred exclusively to positive sexual experiences or age-related changes (85/2,883; 3.0%). Some of these women noted reduced frequency or loss of spontaneity, but highlighted that other aspects, such as nonpenetrative sex, had become more important. Others highlighted their satisfaction with their sex life and relationship: "We are in our 60s so quality rather than quantity matters. I have a problem with vaginal dryness so we have to be very imaginative! I am married to a lovely man" (59 y; active).

Few reported that their sexual activity was as good as it had ever been in their relationship, or mentioned that a new partner positively influenced their sexual well-being: "As I have a new partner since one year, I find my sexual life has never been better and it is certainly very frequent. It is very much the reason for my happiness, contentment and wellbeing" (59 y; active).

Interpersonal and relationship themes

Table 3 shows the interpersonal themes, including lack of interest (self, partner), and age-related or logistical relationship problems. Approximately 16% of women (452/2,883) and 7% of partners (198/2,883) lacked interest in sex. Sometimes couples made a mutual decision to stop activities but not always: "I would still welcome an active sex-life, but my partner who is 57 years old does not seem to have the same sex drive as he did before his fifties. So sex only happens once every 3–4 months" (55 y; active).

Occasionally, women indicated that sex was central to a committed relationship. Some perceived sex as an act toward benefiting their spouse rather than themselves engaging in activity despite pain or lack of pleasure: "I indulge in sexual activity to please my husband. I do not feel any sexual satisfaction from the activity. I do however enjoy the closeness and I am pleased that my husband enjoys the activity" (67 y; active).

### Patients' and their caregivers' experiences with regular, low-dose, sustained-release morphine for chronic breathlessness associated with COPD: a qualitative study [^a6390f8a]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2022). High credibility.

Theme 2: Function as a priority

Some patients described symptomatic benefit with the study medication, including not only an improvement in breathlessness but also in other symptoms (eg, pain and cough), as well as better sleep. Some patients found it difficult to pinpoint specific improvements, but explained they improved overall. All patients who described symptomatic improvement were taking sustained-release morphine 8–24 mg.

Well, when you wake up gasping… It's not a great way of waking up, I can tell you! It happens occasionally now, but not much anymore. While before it was quite frequent, once or twice every week. I get one of those, every couple of months now. I don't know how morphine does this but I am not arguing because it works (laughing)! (Patient 3 – maximum morphine dose 8 mg)

Oh, (I felt) generally better in myself you know? My breathing was perhaps a little better, but I felt more alive I suppose you could say… Yeah, just felt better in myself. (Patient 8 – maximum morphine dose 8 mg)

In most cases, caregivers' perceptions of improvement/non-improvement matched patients' descriptions. However, caregivers attributed more importance to practical outcomes that had more impact on their own lives. For example, one caregiver reported that despite no symptomatic improvement in breathlessness with the study medication, the patient had stopped having breathlessness exacerbations resulting in hospital admissions. For this caregiver, this was the main advantage of taking morphine, which was not reported by the patient.

We were on the morphine, I believe. That's only a suggestion, but she sort of didn't go backwards all the time for the 6 months… Everyone commented… she has better colour. I am confident she will hold her own now. (Caregiver 1 – maximum morphine dose 16 mg)

### Best practices guidelines for trauma center recognition of child abuse, elder abuse, and intimate partner violence [^33c953c7]. ACS (2019). High credibility.

Elder abuse — history and observation guidance includes the following actions and cues: "Caregiver appears to lack knowledge of the patient's care needs" and "Evidence that the caregiver and/or older adult may be abusing alcohol or illicit drugs". "Empower all members of the clinical team (e.g., radiology technologists, clerks, and patient escorts) to raise concerns about worrisome observations". "Make an effort to collect the medical history without caregivers or other family members present". "Use a professional translator if a language barrier exists". "Do not use family members as translators, even if they are not suspected perpetrators". "Be mindful of reasons patients are reluctant to report abuse or neglect, including shame, guilt, fear of retaliation, or fear of nursing home placement". "When obtaining the history, explore in detail how traumatic injuries occurred". "Consider asking the patient directly about physical abuse if suspicion exists". "Ask patients if any issues have occurred in the past 6 months using the suggested questions about types of elder abuse included in Table 9". "Explore any positive answers in more detail (see Comprehensive Evaluation questions in Appendix B-2)". "Additionally, explore the patient's care needs, functional status, cognition, and safety of the home environment".

### Consensus on women's health aspects of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): the amsterdam ESHRE / ASRM-sponsored 3rd PCOS consensus workshop group [^504dee90]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Hirsutism/acne/alopecia — clinical markers and management in PCOS are described: Hirsutism is a good marker for hyperandrogenism and is present in approximately 70% of women with PCOS, and hyperandrogenemia should be evaluated biochemically in all women suspected of having PCOS; by comparison, acne and alopecia are not commonly associated with hyperandrogenemia and therefore should not be regarded as evidence of hyperandrogenemia; for women with PCOS in whom hirsutism is a major concern, treatment is focused on reduction of androgen production, decreasing the fraction of circulating free testosterone (T), and limiting androgen bioactivity to hair follicles; in those women with PCOS who have acne vulgaris, clinical benefit may be derived from many systemic therapeutic modalities; and because terminal hair turnover occurs slowly, at least 6 months of treatment is generally considered the minimal interval to see a response.

### Suicide numbers during the first 9–15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with pre-existing trends: an interrupted time series analysis in 33 countries [^6f4af847]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Aggregating monthly data to the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods may have meant that we missed small, short term rises (or falls) in suicides. We used suicide numbers, not rates, which may have implications in countries/areas-within-countries where the population changed during the pandemic (e.g. the differential Australian state results may be partially explained by 2021 population increases in Queensland not seen elsewhere).

Although we considered the findings in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and accounted for underlying trends, we cannot attribute causality; some of the observed changes may have happened anyway, for unrelated reasons (e.g. economic/political changes, highly-publicised celebrity suicides).

Although there are some countries/areas-within-countries where overall suicide numbers and numbers for certain sex- and age-based groups are greater than would have expected had the pandemic not occurred, these countries/areas-within-countries are in the minority. Any upward movement in suicide numbers in any place or group is concerning, and we need to remain alert to and respond to changes as the pandemic and its mental health and economic consequences continue to evolve. International efforts should be complemented by local ones that allow for closer consideration of context.

### Management of bedwetting in children [^7f42d9d3]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis) is common among school-aged children, with around one in six 5-year-olds, and at least one in fifty 7-year-old boys and one in a hundred 7-year-old girls, wetting the bed more than once a week. Moreover, in some children, the problem can persist, with around 0.8% of girls and 1.6% of boys aged 15–16 years wetting at least once every 3 months. The condition can affect the child's self-esteem, and may lead to teasing or bullying, reduced social interactions and behavioural problems. The frequent changing and washing of bedding and night-clothes can place an additional workload and financial burden on the family. Parents may become intolerant of the situation, and this may even lead to physical punishment of the child. Here we review the primary-care management of children with bedwetting.

Table 5 — Practical considerations for desmopressin trial/challenge and administration outline route, dosing, laboratory timing, responsiveness, and precautions. Desmopressin trials may be performed with either IV or intranasal desmopressin, but intranasal desmopressin trials may not be successful because of issues with administration and/or absorption; subcutaneous administration has also been used. IV desmopressin is given as 0.3 μg/kg, with a maximum dose of 20 μg, and the desmopressin nasal spray (150 μg per spray) is given as 1 spray for individuals weighing < 50 kg and 2 sprays for individuals weighing ≥ 50 kg. Von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen, VWF activity, and factor VIII (FVIII) activity levels should be determined immediately before administration of desmopressin, ∼30–60 min after administration of desmopressin, and ∼4 h postadministration. The panel considered that an increase of at least 2 times the baseline VWF level and the ability to achieve both VWF and FVIII levels of > 0.50 IU/mL were required to consider the patient responsive to desmopressin. Because of the risk of hyponatremia, desmopressin should not be given on > 3 concurrent days and is generally not administered to children age < 2 y; tachyphylaxis occurs after repeated infusions, caution is advised when used in active cardiovascular disease, and desmopressin trials should be avoided in pregnancy.

### Optimizing natural fertility: a committee opinion [^098c7f49]. Fertility and Sterility (2013). Medium credibility.

Natural fertility — intercourse frequency: Cycle fecundity was similar with intercourse that occurred daily, every other day, and even every 3 days in the fertile window, but was lowest when intercourse occurred only once in the fertile window. Couples should be informed that reproductive efficiency increases with the frequency of intercourse and is highest when intercourse occurs every 1 to 2 days during the fertile window. Intercourse more frequently than every 1 to 2 days is not associated with lower fecundity, and couples should not be advised to limit the frequency of intercourse when trying to achieve pregnancy.

### Can elimination of epinephrine in rhinoplasty reduce the side effects: introduction of a new technique [^ff45c3bd]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Methods

Design and Procedure

This was a randomized control pilot study conducted in Punzdahe Khordad Hospital, a plastic surgery center affiliated with Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. Patients were recruited to the study by posting study flyers in the surgery center from May 2008 to May 2009. Interested patients who called in were screened by the study coordinator. If eligible and still interested, an initial appointment for the informed consent procedure, further screening, and collection of baseline information and measurements was scheduled. To be eligible for the study, male and female patients had to meet all the following inclusion criteria: (1) be 18 years old or older, (2) scheduled for a primary open or closed rhinoplasty operation, (3) have no history of or current cardiovascular diseases and disorders, (4) have normal values for all the preoperation laboratory test results (PT, PTT, and INR), and (5) willing to sign an informed consent form. Patients who were participating in another study and/or could not meet the aforementioned criteria were excluded from the study. The rest of the study procedures were conducted in three stages.

First Stage: Screening

During a scheduled initial visit, the following procedures were conducted to find out if the subjects met all the study requirements and if it was safe for them to be involved in the study. To do so, the study coordinator once more screened potential subjects for participation eligibility and explained the research protocol and all its details to them. Patients were given ample amount of time to review the informed consent form and were given an opportunity to ask questions of the coordinator and/or physicians who were involved in the trial. Only after all of the patients' questions and concerns were answered did they sign and date a written informed consent form. Only patients who met all the study eligibility requirements and signed he informed consent form were entered into the study and were scheduled for the baseline assessment. The principle of the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences.

Second Stage: Baseline

During the baseline visit, all enrolled patients received a physical examination, and preoperation tests and subsequent information were recorded. They also filled out a baseline patient information sheet, including their contact information; number of physician-diagnosed diseases, specifically cardiovascular diseases; past operations; allergies; and medication history, including number and types of any over-the-counter or physician-prescribed medications. Again, all patients with any indication of cardiovascular diseases were removed from the study.

### Budesonide (Pulmicort respules) [^3883701f]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for a list of these medicines, if you are not sure.

Know the medicines your child takes. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when your child gets a new medicine.

How should I use PULMICORT RESPULES?

Use PULMICORT RESPULES exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. Your child must use PULMICORT RESPULES regularly for it to work.
PULMICORT RESPULES comes in three strengths. Your healthcare provider has prescribed the strength that is best for your child.
Do not stop using PULMICORT RESPULES, and do not change your child's dose of PULMICORT RESPULES without talking to your healthcare provider.
PULMICORT RESPULES is for inhaled use only. Use PULMICORT RESPULES with a jet nebulizer connected to an air compressor set up with a mouthpiece or face mask. Do not use an ultrasonic nebulizer to give PULMICORT RESPULES.
Do not mix PULMICORT RESPULES with other nebulizer medicines. If your child uses another medicine by inhalation to treat asthma, talk with your healthcare provider for instructions on when to use the other medicine.
If your child misses a dose, just give the next regularly scheduled dose when it is due. Do not use PULMICORT RESPULES more often than has been prescribed.
Improvement in the control of asthma symptoms with PULMICORT RESPULES can occur within 2–8 days. It may take up to 4–6 weeks before maximum improvement is seen.
Make sure your child always has a short-acting beta2-agonist medicine with him or her. Your child should use the short-acting beta2-agonist medicine for breathing problems between doses of PULMICORT RESPULES or if a sudden asthma attack happens. Call your healthcare provider right away if:
the short-acting rescue medicine does not work as well for relieving asthma symptoms.
your child needs to use the short-acting rescue medicines more often than usual.
your child's breathing problems worsen with PULMICORT RESPULES
Rinse your child's mouth with water and have him or her spit the water out after each PULMICORT RESPULES treatment. Do not swallow the water. This will lessen the chance of getting a fungal infection (thrush) in the mouth.
If your child has used long-term corticosteroids and the dose is now being lowered or stopped, a warning card should be carried stating that your child may need corticosteroids during times of stress or during an asthma attack that does not get better with bronchodilator medicines.
Your healthcare provider may check your child's blood, breathing and do eye exams while using PULMICORT RESPULES.
Read the Patient Information and Instructions for Use at the end of this leaflet for detailed instructions about how to use PULMICORT RESPULES.

### Silent loss and the clinical encounter: parents' and physicians' experiences of stillbirth-a qualitative analysis [^7875ae42]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Results

Results are organized according to dominant discourse themes. In each section, in order to preserve the discussion context within each participant group, we present supporting quotations from the parent focus groups first, followed by quotations from the physician groups. Supporting quotations are followed by the focus group code (Table 1). When more than one participant is quoted in a particular exchange, P1-3 are assigned to indicate distinct speakers. An overarching comparison of themes across parents and physicians, keyed to major clinical practice domains, is offered as part of the discussion and summary conclusions.

Stillbirth is an unexpected event: "You never consider stillbirth as a possibility, until it happens to you"

Stillbirth is not something a pregnant woman or couple expects or prepares for. As one mother said, "There was a 'stillbirth' chapter in one of my pregnancy books. I skipped it". Many participants had believed that stillbirth is a very rare event. Several parents reported being surprised to learn the actual rates of stillbirth worldwide, or that stillbirth occurs much at all in high-income countries like the U.S. As one mother commented, "You think this is something that only happens in third world countries, but not to us with our health care resources". (FG 5)

For all parents in this study, the shared sense was that stillbirth was something that happened to other people. Some couples in the study were pregnant for the first time and they were not considered "high risk". Others had had other healthy children and did not expect anything to go wrong with this pregnancy. Those who were considered to have high-risk pregnancies were concerned about delivering prematurely, not about stillbirth. As one participant commented, "I was extremely high risk with all my pregnancies — and [stillbirth] was never something that came up. Nobody ever said anything". (FG 3)

### Quantifying non-adherence to anti-tuberculosis treatment due to early discontinuation: a systematic literature review of timings to loss to follow-up [^98026c88]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2024). High credibility.

Data analysis

Due to extensive variability in the settings in which studies occurred and heterogeneity in the timings of when LFU occurred, a narrative synthesis was conducted. First, studies were grouped on the basis of when LFU occurred in their patient populations. We sought to determine if losses were even throughout treatment or uneven. If they were even, we would have expected a third of LFUs to have happened by the end of the second month of treatment, as 2 months is a third of the way through the 6-month treatment regimen. Thus, papers were categorised into three groups: (1) those for which roughly a third of LFUs occurred in the first two months (allowable range ≥ 28.3– < 38.3%), (2) papers where more than a third occurred in the first 2 months (≥ 38.3%), and (3) papers where less than a third occurred in the first 2 months (< 28.3%).

In addition, the proportion of dose-months missed due to early discontinuation (ie, the cessation of treatment before 6 months were completed) was calculated for each study among (a) all individuals who became LFU; and (b) all patients in the study, data permitting.

For the purpose of the dose-months missed calculations, a dose-month was considered as 28 days (4 weeks) as this is consistent with how anti-TB medication is prescribed. Calculations were performed using the percentage of patients LFU by 2 months into treatment (ie, during the intensive phase), as this was the most common measure reported among included studies. It was assumed that patients LFU in first 2 months of treatment (ie, during the intensive phase) missed 5 months of treatment (ie, the average time point of loss was halfway through the 2-month intensive phase, the end of treatment month one. Therefore, 6 months minus 1 month equals 5 months). It was also assumed that patients LFU during the continuation phase (ie, the last 4 months of treatment) missed 2 months of treatment (ie, the average time point of loss was halfway through the 4-month continuation phase — the end of treatment month four. Therefore, 6 months minus 4 months equals 2 months).

### Buspirone hydrochloride [^56432f55]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Other Events Observed During the Entire Premarketing Evaluation of Buspirone Hydrochloride Tablets

During its premarketing assessment, buspirone hydrochloride tablets were evaluated in over 3,500 subjects. This section reports event frequencies for adverse events occurring in approximately 3,000 subjects from this group who took multiple doses of buspirone hydrochloride tablets in the dose range for which buspirone is being recommended (i.e., the modal daily dose of buspirone hydrochloride tablets fell between 10 mg and 30 mg for 70% of the patients studied) and for whom safety data were systematically collected. The conditions and duration of exposure to buspirone hydrochloride tablets varied greatly, involving well-controlled studies as well as experience in open and uncontrolled clinical settings. As part of the total experience gained in clinical studies, various adverse events were reported. In the absence of appropriate controls in some of the studies, a causal relationship to buspirone hydrochloride treatment cannot be determined. The list includes all undesirable events reasonably associated with the use of the drug.

The following enumeration by organ system describes events in terms of their relative frequency of reporting in this data base. Events of major clinical importance are also described in the PRECAUTIONS section.

The following definitions of frequency are used: Frequent adverse events are defined as those occurring in at least 1/100 patients. Infrequent adverse events are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients, while rare events are those occurring in less than 1/1,000 patients.

Cardiovascular

Frequent was nonspecific chest pain; infrequent were syncope, hypotension, and hypertension; rare were cerebrovascular accident, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cardiomyopathy, and bradycardia.

Central Nervous System

Frequent were dream disturbances; infrequent were depersonalization, dysphoria, noise intolerance, euphoria, akathisia, fearfulness, loss of interest, dissociative reaction, hallucinations, involuntary movements, slowed reaction time, suicidal ideation, and seizures; rare were feelings of claustrophobia, cold intolerance, stupor, and slurred speech and psychosis.

EENT

Frequent were tinnitus, sore throat, and nasal congestion; infrequent were redness and itching of the eyes, altered taste, altered smell, and conjunctivitis; rare were inner ear abnormality, eye pain, photophobia, and pressure on eyes.

Gastrointestinal

Infrequent were flatulence, anorexia, increased appetite, salivation, irritable colon, and rectal bleeding; rare was burning of the tongue.

### Use of prenatal exome sequencing: opinion statement of the French federation of human genetics working group [^760542f7]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

3.1.2.1 Should We Set a Gestational Week Time Limit for pES?

pES results should be delivered as quickly as possible to limit the women's or couples' anxiety. The process is considered relatively urgent. A recent French study showed that the median turnaround time from sample reception to molecular report is 28 days. Worldwide, some genetic departments set a limit of pES at 32 GW because of the risk of birth occurring before pES report, and others do not set any limit.

Late pregnancy pES may exacerbate an already stressful and time‐sensitive situation. In general, about half of would‐be parents describe significant anxiety and stress after a fetal anomaly diagnosis, often feeling overwhelmed by an unexpected diagnosis. The turnaround time of a pES is an additional matter of concern for women or couples. We consider that, if there is clear information that birth can occur before the pES report is delivered, no pES limit should be imposed during pregnancy.

We also argue that the absence of a strict limit of pES respects equity between women or couples for whom fetal congenital anomalies were identified at 22 versus 32 GW because the latter is related to late identifiable fetal anomalies or suboptimal care providing and counseling.

### Alarms in the intensive care unit: how can the number of false alarms be reduced? [^e402495c]. Critical Care (2001). Low credibility.

Many alarms, as they now exist in most monitoring systems, are not usually perceived as helpful by the medical staff because of the high incidence of false alarms. This paper gives an overview of the problems related to their current design and the objectives of monitoring. The current approaches used to improve the situation are then presented from two main standpoints: organizational and behavioural on the one hand, and technical on the other.

### Clinical guideline for the evaluation, management and long-term care of obstructive sleep apnea in adults [^0b189c00]. Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine (2009). Medium credibility.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) adjunctive therapies — pharmacologic and oxygen guidance: Corticosteroids may improve the apnea–hypopnea index in OSA with concurrent rhinitis and "may be a useful adjunct to primary treatment for OSA (Guideline)". Oxygen supplementation "is not recommended as a primary treatment for OSA (Option)". If used with other primary therapies to treat hypoxemia, "follow-up must include documentation of resolution of the hypoxemia (Consensus)", and oxygen alone "may also prolong apneas and may potentially worsen nocturnal hypercapnia in patients with comorbid respiratory disease". For residual excessive daytime sleepiness despite effective positive airway pressure (PAP), "Modafinil is recommended" when no other cause is identifiable, and "Modafinil should be used in addition to PAP therapy" after other causes "must be ruled out including: suboptimal objective adherence with PAP; ill-fitting PAP masks; insufficient sleep; poor sleep hygiene; other sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or restless legs syndrome/ periodic limb movements of sleep; and depression".

### Enuresis in children: common questions and answers [^577d7cb2]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on enuresis:

- **Definition**: Enuresis is the involuntary or intentional discharge of urine after the age at which bladder control is expected, typically beyond 5 years of age.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of enuresis is multifactorial and not fully understood. However, it is believed to involve a delay in the maturation of the mechanisms controlling urination during sleep. This includes a maturational deficit in motor performance, particularly for repetitive hand and finger movements, and a possible maturational deficit of the motor cortex circuitry and related cortical areas. Disturbances in the circadian rhythm of arginine-vasopressin, leading to excess urine production during sleep, are also common in children with enuresis. Additionally, immaturity of the brainstem may be involved in the pathogenesis of enuresis.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of nocturnal enuresis is estimated at 6–10% at age 7, decreasing to 2% by age 15, and further to 0.5–2% in adulthood. Boys are twice as affected as girls.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for enuresis include a family history of the condition, constipation, UTIs, and psychological stress. Secondary nocturnal enuresis can develop after traumatic events such as traffic accidents. Additionally, conditions like attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder can be associated with enuresis.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, enuresis presents with bedwetting that is inappropriate for the child's developmental age, typically occurring at least twice a week for 3 consecutive months. It often occurs early at night, primarily in sleep stage 2 and deep sleep.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of enuresis is generally good, as the condition often resolves with time. However, the persistence of enuresis can lead to psychological distress and impaired QoL.

### Committee opinion no. 681: disclosure and discussion of adverse events [^758a6e34]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussions with patients on adverse events — Disclosure should occur in a quiet and confidential setting that will be most comfortable to the patient, and patient dignity must always be respected; a disclosure conversation should include empathy for what patients and their families have experienced. Expressions of sympathy are always appropriate, but the appropriateness of an apology will vary from case to case, and when considering whether an apology is appropriate, the physician should seek advice from the hospital's risk manager and the physician's liability carrier. If possible, before the disclosure, the facts of the error should be gathered and investigated so that the most accurate information can be shared with the patient, and disclosure, especially if the event is serious, should be done as soon as possible with a promise to return when these facts are known. Confidentiality must be preserved, and the meeting with the patient should take place in a private setting, determining whether a support person or guardian should be present with the patient. The disclosure itself should be done by the treating physician or someone with whom the patient has developed a relationship and trust, and depending on your facility's policy, the risk manager or facility's attorney, the nurse manager, and others may be present during disclosure. The focus should be on the patient's condition, concerns, and treatment plan, and the patient should be told that her treatment and care are the utmost concern. Try to convey the information in terms that are understandable to the patient and that minimizes the patient's stress; explain what happened and how it happened; it may not be possible to explain why it happened; let the family and patient know what will be done to prevent the error from occurring again, and work with the patient to develop a treatment plan to remedy/mitigate the effects of any injury resulting from the error. Make sure to express appropriate regret for the error and the concern for the patient and/or the family.

SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Vaginal Bleeding

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your doctor or healthcare provider.
Contact Lenses

If you wear contact lenses and notice a change in vision or an inability to wear your lenses, contact your doctor or healthcare provider.
Fluid Retention

Oral contraceptives may cause edema (fluid retention) with swelling of the fingers or ankles and may raise your blood pressure. If you experience fluid retention, contact your doctor or healthcare provider.
Melasma

A spotty darkening of the skin is possible, particularly of the face.
Other Side Effects

Other side effects may include change in appetite, headache, nervousness, depression, dizziness, loss of scalp hair, rash, and vaginal infections.

If any of these side effects bother you, call your doctor or healthcare provider.

GENERAL PRECAUTIONS

Missed Periods and Use of Oral Contraceptives Before or During Early Pregnancy

There may be times when you may not menstruate regularly after you have completed taking a cycle of pills. If you have taken your pills regularly and miss one menstrual period, continue taking your pills for the next cycle but be sure to inform your healthcare provider before doing so. If you have not taken the pills daily as instructed and missed a menstrual period, or if you missed two consecutive menstrual periods, you may be pregnant. Check with your healthcare provider immediately to determine whether you are pregnant. Do not continue to take oral contraceptives until you are sure you are not pregnant, but continue to use another method of contraception.

### Teenage first-time mothers' perceptions about their health care needs in the immediate and early postpartum period in Uganda [^71e1b111]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Disease prevention and treatment of current conditions

When complications arose, there was an expectation that the health workers would be able to assess, diagnose, and treat the condition of the mother or the baby before they were discharged from the hospital. One participant, whose baby was readmitted to the hospital after discharge, explains,

The baby had 'kamunye'[jaundice] and cried all night. She did not want to breastfeed no matter how hard I tried. I felt bad about it. I really wished the midwife had helped; the baby started crying while we were in the hospital, and we tried to get the midwife to help, but she would just say breastfeed the baby unless you want us to fix a tube [nasogastric tube] into her to feed by it. (Participant 35, 19 years).

Another participant whose baby was admitted for breathing problems also narrated,

They took a long time to remove the things they take out of the nose, and because of this delay, the child could not breathe. (Participant 28, 19 years).

Another aspect of disease prevention that the first-time, teenage mothers highlighted was through ensuring health facility and bathroom/ toilet hygiene. This was recognized as a measure that could reduce the risk for infections among the mothers and their babies.

The environment was dirty, the toilets were dirty, the bathrooms were dirty, and if one needed to use a bathroom, one had to clean it themselves to the point that one could pick infections. (Participant 34, 17 years).

Family planning counseling

Although some participants did not think that they needed information about family planning immediately after delivery, others were concerned that while they had been told to ensure that they had a long birth to birth interval they were not told how to achieve that. One 19-year-old teenage mother remarked,

The midwife did not talk to me about family planning. But I do not think that a midwife should tell me about family planning immediately after birth. I think that happens later (Participant 34).

Another participant shared,

Yes, the midwife checked my BP, pulse; she also checked my blood levels and told me that they were low. [She gestured, opening her eye] She did not check the uterine contraction, and she did not talk to me about family planning. (Participant 35 19 years).

### Dupilumab provides acceptable safety and sustained efficacy for up to 4 years in an open-label study of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis [^029f622c]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, dupilumab showed an acceptable safety profile and sustained efficacy in adults with moderate-to-severe AD for up to 4 years. Safety data reported here are consistent with data from previous controlled studies of dupilumab up to 52 weeks, and common AEs (nasopharyngitis, AD, upper respiratory tract infection, conjunctivitis, headache, oral herpes, and injection-site reactions) are consistent with the known safety profile of dupilumab. These AEs are also similar to those reported in a recent analysis of real-world dupilumab safety data, in which conjunctivitis, blepharitis, keratitis, herpes simplex, and headache were the most commonly reported AEs.

Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of TEAEs declined over time, with lower rates in this 4-year analysis (256.86 nE/100 PY) compared with the 3-year analysis of this trial (270.1 nE/100 PY) and an earlier 52-week controlled trial (504.5 nE/100 PY). Treatment discontinuation because of AEs or lack of efficacy was low (4.3 and 2.2% incidence, respectively), and few patients required rescue treatment (1.8% incidence), indicating well-controlled disease. Compliance with study treatment was high (98.1%).

### Making love in the time of corona-considering relationships in lockdown [^e64032d3]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2020). High credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting social changes that were required to slow the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) have resulted in lockdowns across many countries and led to substantial numbers of people being quarantined. For single people, their opportunities to meet a partner were completely lost. For couples who lived apart, this meant that they were not able to see their partner for many months. However, by contrast, for cohabiting couples, lockdown meant that they were forced to spend 24h a day with each other, and perhaps their children or housemates, for months at a time. As lockdowns have loosened around the world, the possibility of a second wave arises, and lockdowns are being reinstated in many regions. The prospect of potential long-term lockdowns means that adjusting to this new normal in relationships is an important consideration. In this Viewpoint, three specialists in sexology and psychology discuss the effects of lockdown on intimacy and consider how it can be considered an opportunity as well as an obstacle for making love in the time of corona.

### Childhood nocturnal enuresis-a marker for pelvic floor disorders and urinary tract symptoms in women? [^cecfb605]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

CNE was defined according to the International Children's Continence Society (ICCS) as both a symptom and a condition of intermittent incontinence that occurs during periods of sleep at the age ≥ 5 years and regardless of the absence or presence of lower urinary tract symptoms. The women answered the question "Were you a bedwetter during childhood?" followed by "If yes, at what age did it stop?" UI, subtypes of UI, and nocturia were defined according to the International Urogynecological Association (IUGA)/ International Continence Society (ICS) definition. UI was defined by the question "Do you have involuntary loss of urine?" Participants reporting UI were also asked if the incontinence had been present for > 10 years (UI > 10 years). Stress UI (SUI) was defined as involuntary loss of urine in connection with coughing, sneezing, laughing, or lifting heavy items; urge UI (UUI) was present if loss of urine was in connection with a sudden and strong urge to void and mixed UI (MUI) if both components were present. In this study a more restricted definition of nocturia (≥ 2 times/night) was used. Overactive bladder (OAB) was defined according to the IUGA/ICS definition as urgency with or without incontinence, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia. Frequency of leakage was stratified into four categories: "less than once a month", "once or more per month", "once or more per week", and "every day and/or night". The amount of leakage was categorized into "a few drops" vs. "small amounts" and "large amounts". The mental impact perceived by incontinent women was dichotomized into "not bothersome" (no problem/a small nuisance) and "bothersome UI" (some bother/much bother/a major problem).

### Openings [^b93dd864]. Annals of Family Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Reviewing his clinic patient schedule for the day, a physician reflects on the history of a young woman he has been caring for over the past 9 years. What starts out as a routine visit then turns into a unique opening for communication and connection. A chance glimpse out the window of the exam room leads to a deeper meditation on parenthood, survival, and healing, not only for the patient but also for the physician. How many missed opportunities have we all had, without even realizing it, to allow this kind of fleeting but profound opening?

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^8dbc2247]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas (IHs) states that IHs occur in as many as 5% of infants and most IHs are small, innocuous, self-resolving, and require no treatment, but because of size or location a significant minority are potentially problematic, including IHs that may cause permanent scarring and disfigurement, hepatic or airway IHs, IHs with potential for functional impairment, ulceration, and associated underlying abnormalities. It notes that the most rapid and significant growth occurs between 1 and 3 months of age and that growth is completed by 5 months of age in most cases; early intervention and/or referral (ideally by 1 month of age) is recommended for infants who have potentially problematic IHs. When systemic treatment is indicated, propranolol is the drug of choice at a dose of 2 to 3 mg/kg per day, with treatment typically continued for at least 6 months and often maintained until 12 months of age (occasionally longer). Topical timolol may be used to treat select small, thin, superficial IHs, and surgery and/or laser treatment are most useful for residual skin changes after involution and, less commonly, may be considered earlier to treat some IHs.

### The risk of breakthrough bleeding justifies the use of combined hormonal contraception over progesterone-only pills while breastfeeding [^79928a8d]. Breastfeeding Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Breakthrough bleeding is a side effect of progesterone-only pills (POPs) in 40% of women, and is reduced to 10% with combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs). In addition, breakthrough bleeding is reduced if POP is supplemented with norethisterone. As breakthrough bleeding is responsible for a quarter of women stopping the pill, it is vital to realize that CHC is an alternative to POP-even during lactation. CHCs are considered safe during lactation, do not reduce milk production, nor impede infant development. Nevertheless, CHCs are often not prescribed for lactating mothers due to this misconception that they reduce milk production. Among Orthodox Jews, breakthrough bleeding frequently results in stopping POP, as Jewish religious law prohibits any physical contact of the mother with her partner during active bleeding, and for 7 days after bleeding. When such bleeding occurs, not choosing a CHC alternative, results in couples risking discontinuation of POP, and in conceiving within a year of the previous birth, with its increased risk of preterm labor and birth defects. To measure how physicians respond to the presumed dilemma of balancing the risk of breakthrough bleeding versus the concern of reduction of milk production, we conducted a preliminary online survey. Physicians were asked if they would prescribe CHC instead of POP to breastfeeding mothers, 3 months postpartum with breakthrough bleeding. Half of the physicians responded they would prescribe CHC, whereas close to half of the physicians responded that they would not. The main reasons given by the respondents for avoiding CHC was a concern regarding possible milk reduction. These results confirm a significant degree of a lack of updated pharmacological information regarding the options of oral contraceptive use for lactating mothers, particularly for those where breakthrough bleeding has major behavioral and religious consequences. Thus, we contend that the risk of breakthrough bleeding justifies the more routine use of CHC in lieu of POP in lactating mothers.

### Your baby by two months… [^873232b7]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

Important Milestones: Your Baby By Two Months In 2022, CDC's milestones and parent tips were updated and checklist for ages 15 and 30 months were added. For more information about the CDC's developmental milestones, please review the Pediatrics journal article and these important key points. How your child plays, learns, speaks, acts, and moves offers important clues about your child's development. Developmental milestones are things most children can do by a certain age. What most babies do by this age: Social/Emotional Milestones
- Calms down when spoken to or picked up
- Looks at your face
- Seems happy to see you when you walk up to her
- Smiles when you talk to or smile at her Language/Communication Milestones. Concerned About Your Child's Development. Act Early. You know your child best. Don't wait. If your child is not meeting one or more milestones, has lost skills he or she once had, or you have other concerns, act early.

Talk with your child's doctor, share your concerns, and ask about developmental screening. If you or the doctor are still concerned:

- Ask for a referral to a specialist who can evaluate your child more; and
- Call your state or territory's early intervention program to find out if your child can get services to help. Learn more and find the number at cdc. gov/FindEI.
- Look for signs your baby is full, such as closing her mouth or turning her head away from the breast/bottle. If your baby is not hungry, it's ok to stop feeding.
- Do not shake your baby or allow anyone else to — ever. You can damage his brain or even cause his death. Put your baby in a safe place and walk away if you're getting upset when he is crying. Check on him every 5–10 minutes. Infant crying is often worse in the first few months of life, but it gets better.
- Have routines for sleeping and feeding. This will help your baby begin to learn what to expect.
- Hold a rattle off to one side of your baby's head, shake it, and see if your baby looks for the noise.
- Practice staying calm when your baby is upset by talking softly, holding, rocking, or singing to her. This will help her calm down and lessen her stress and fears.

### Silent triage: public health decision-making beyond prioritisation [^673bef3f]. BMJ Global Health (2023). High credibility.

Characteristics of Silent Triage in the COVID-19 pandemic

In contrast to conventional triage decisions concerning acute care, Silent Triage may also concern chronic medical care, medical supply and Public Health services like vaccination or mass treatment schemes. In the first months of the pandemic, cancer prevention and screening programmes were suspended completely or downscaled to avoid SARS-CoV-2 infections, leading to more late-stage diagnoses.

Decisions that may evoke Silent Triage such as a lock-down could be made urgently considering the scarcity of resources, for example, a shortage or unavailability of personal protective equipment. Having said that, we are aware that lock-downs — a decision designed to limit overall virus spread — also involve multiple other decisions, implicit and explicit, which determine an individual's or subpopulation's ability to access essential services such as vaccination or screening.

However, we assume that policy makers will have been aware — to varying degrees according to context — of some of these indirect impacts and in some cases, measures were introduced to counter them. For example, as routine childhood vaccinations in the UK remained accessible, we postulate that — nevertheless — fear and trade-offs between competing interests were reasons why many groups then decreased their uptake of those offers. As this also happened unconsciously, unintended, sometimes unexpectedly, we consider it a Silent Triage.

We argue that, unlike conventional medical triage, the term Silent Triage should also be used including non-medical, preventive interventions and other services as school meal provision or provision of scarce blood products. Selection may occur by starting, halting or omitting health interventions. For example, the closure of schools has increased malnutrition among school children as more than 370 million children globally missed out on daily school meals. Often, school meal programmes provided the only meal many children consumed in a day. Closures were brought forward, even though a direct causality regarding the transmission route was scientifically difficult to support.

### Child abuse: behavioral aspects and other associated problems [^edae3db1]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Although researchers in psychology and the social sciences will need to continue to identify the behavioral consequences of abuse and treatment strategies, pediatricians may still be the first line professionals to suspect and intercept victims. Remember that, especially in cases where there have been threats or falsification of illness, it is wise to enlist integrated multidisciplinary services to ensure the safety of the child before confronting any potential perpetrators. Physicians have become better trained to be more vigilant in detecting signs of physical abuse, but it seems that psychologic and sexual maltreatment may cause more long-term problems but are more difficult to detect. Although a book by Everett and Gallop is written for mental health professionals, the chapters on why a history of childhood trauma is often missed, recognizing signs and symptoms, and asking about abuse, are all helpful for pediatricians and other health care professionals. In certain situations, physicians should attempt to talk to children privately, so that those who are old enough might have an opportunity to relate events that are traumatic, and so that abusive parents will not have an opportunity to interrupt, instill additional fear in the child, or abruptly change providers. Children need someone to ask them directly about their experiences and act on any suspicions. Asking once may not be enough, because a frightened child may initially deny physical or sexual abuse, but be ready to tell at another time. A vocal adult survivor of Munchausen syndrome by proxy and severe physical abuse explains: The dilemma is how to be loved and accepted. Even once a child recognizes that it is wrong, victims may be afraid to speak up for fear of anger and more abuse at the hand of the abuser. By the time I reached eleven, I was angry enough at what my mother had gotten away with, I would have been more truthful. It would have been a relief to have someone else voice their own suspicions. But, no one ever asked and I could not be the one to give away my mother or the love of my family. Although society is still struggling with its ability to prevent abuse, it must also be concerned with dealing with its consequences. The problem seems overwhelming in its enormity and the resources do not seem to be adequate to tackle these issues so basic to the care and nurturing of children. Nonetheless, physicians must keep their eyes open to behaviors that signal distress, recognize and strive to eliminate the underlying cause, and make certain that children receive treatment to minimize the myriad of behavioral and other long-term problems that are associated with child abuse.
