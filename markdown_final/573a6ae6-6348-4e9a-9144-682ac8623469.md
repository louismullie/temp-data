## Question

How should a coronaviral urinary infection be treated?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat a so‑called "coronaviral urinary infection". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what clinical entities this phrase could actually represent. Then, I should assess severity, timing, and host risk to decide whether antivirals are indicated. Next, I will review renal-specific management, especially for COVID-19–associated AKI. After that, I'll consider management of lower urinary tract symptoms that may be post-viral or inflammatory. Then, I must rule in or out secondary bacterial UTI and address source control. Finally, I need to check drug–drug interactions, special populations, evidence gaps, and synthesize a practical algorithm for care, making sure each assertion is backed by data where possible [^1137oade] [^114FQU7d] [^114z7gH7] [^115y1PZg].

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity, because "coronaviral urinary infection" is not a standard diagnosis. Wait, I should verify what we're actually treating: possibilities include direct SARS-CoV-2 involvement of the kidney/urothelium (supported by antigen detection in kidney tubules and urine sediment), COVID-19–associated bladder inflammation/LUTS, secondary bacterial UTI (especially catheter-associated), and COVID-19–related AKI, which is common and prognostically important; therapy must be tailored to the dominant presentation rather than assuming a novel "viral UTI" syndrome [^111GsSKh] [^112c64BW] [^112gbvt9] [^1137oade] [^115qWVGj] [^115uLR6i].

> Next, I should review severity and timing because antivirals are time-sensitive. I need to check symptom clusters: dysuria/urgency/frequency suggest LUT involvement; oliguria, rising creatinine, or electrolyte derangements suggest AKI; fever and pyuria with systemic features raise concern for bacterial UTI. I should confirm duration from symptom onset, as oral antivirals must start within about 5 days and IV options within about 7 days; I also need to weigh age, comorbidities, and immunocompromise to estimate risk for progression, and I must not forget to check catheter status, as this strongly modifies pretest probability for bacterial infection and dictates source-control steps [^115y1PZg] [^111C3VM4] [^114dEX5z].

> Now, for primary antiviral therapy when indicated and timely, I should confirm the preferred options. Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is first-line for high-risk outpatients within 5 days of symptom onset, but hold on, I need to screen rigorously for CYP3A-mediated interactions (e.g., tacrolimus, amiodarone) and plan management of residual inhibition even after the 5-day course; if interactions or feasibility issues arise, remdesivir is a reasonable alternative within the first week of illness, with safety data even in AKI or advanced CKD cohorts, whereas molnupiravir is less effective and reserved for when preferred agents are unsuitable — wait, I almost wrote "Molnupirravir"; let me correct that to molnupiravir before proceeding [^114z7gH7] [^111C3VM4] [^115eRP1L]. I should also acknowledge that much of the antiviral effectiveness data derive from unvaccinated or pre-Omicron settings, so real-world benefit may vary but remains meaningful in older or immunocompromised patients [^114z7gH7].

> Turning to AKI, I will now examine renal-specific management. I should confirm ADQI recommendations: use balanced crystalloids for volume expansion unless contraindicated, avoid nephrotoxins and unnecessary contrast, and prefer continuous modalities (CVVHD/CVVHDF) over intermittent hemodialysis to mitigate hypercoagulability-related circuit clotting; initiate RRT for standard indications without delay. Let me double-check the diagnostic workup: urinalysis is often abnormal in COVID-19 AKI (proteinuria and hematuria are common), and if there is heavy proteinuria or atypical features, I should consider biopsy to differentiate direct viral or immune-mediated glomerulopathies; these steps are consistent with consensus guidance and observational cohorts [^1117nXcY] [^114FQU7d] [^115qWVGj] [^112X3464].

> For lower urinary tract symptoms possibly linked to COVID-19, hold on, let's not jump to conclusions that a bladder-directed antiviral is required — there isn't one. I should manage symptomatically using standard urologic approaches (e.g., antimuscarinics or β3-agonists for overactive bladder phenotypes and supportive care), monitor the trajectory, and refer to urology if symptoms persist beyond the expected course; data suggest many patients improve over months, although a subset may have longer persistence, so I need to set expectations and follow-up thoughtfully [^1137oade] [^117VWsN7] [^1163QzT9].

> If bacterial UTI or urosepsis is suspected — especially in catheterized or hospitalized patients — I need to ensure cultures precede antibiotics. Let me first confirm: obtain a urine culture (ideally from a freshly replaced catheter) and two sets of blood cultures before initiating antimicrobials, then start empiric therapy per guideline-concordant regimens for complicated pyelonephritis or CAUTI with systemic features; meanwhile, perform prompt source control, including catheter removal/replacement, relief of obstruction, or drainage of abscesses as indicated. For prevention and device strategy, I should maintain closed catheter systems and consider hydrophilic-coated catheters for intermittent catheterization to reduce microtrauma and infection risk [^114dEX5z] [^116gHYk5] [^117CU9Hp] [^115ZAhTT] [^117SVS32] [^112nDrsH].

> I should confirm special considerations and drug safety before finalizing therapy. I need to check all concomitant medications for interactions with ritonavir using trusted resources and coordinate with relevant specialists for high-risk interactions; in immunocompromised patients, early antiviral therapy is prioritized given higher risk of progression and potentially attenuated vaccine response; for pregnancy, data for several interventions remain limited, so I should use shared decision-making regarding risks and benefits and recognize that some COVID-19 biologics are authorized for prevention rather than treatment, underscoring the need to align the intervention with the clinical objective [^114z7gH7] [^111C3VM4] [^117Gqqbf].

> But wait, what about evidence gaps and rebound phenomena? I need to acknowledge that much of the kidney and LUTS literature is retrospective, small, or pre-Omicron, so certainty is limited; nonetheless, kidney tropism and AKI associations are biologically plausible and clinically observed. Regarding rebound after antivirals, I should reassure that recurrence of symptoms can occur and may include urinary complaints, but serious outcomes are uncommon and additional therapy is not currently recommended beyond renewed isolation as per public health guidance [^112gbvt9] [^1163QzT9] [^111wJt86] [^113w9284].

> Let me synthesize a practical treatment path. If early COVID-19 is present with urinary symptoms in a high-risk host, prioritize timely antiviral therapy (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir if no prohibitive interactions, otherwise consider remdesivir), plus supportive measures; if AKI predominates, follow ADQI-based fluid, avoidance of nephrotoxins, and RRT strategies while managing COVID-19 per severity; if LUTS without bacterial infection persist, use symptom-directed urologic therapy and monitor; if bacterial UTI/urosepsis is suspected, culture first, start guideline-concordant empiric antibiotics, and perform source control promptly, all while screening for interactions with COVID-19 therapeutics [^114z7gH7] [^114FQU7d] [^1137oade] [^117CU9Hp].

There is **no evidence** for a distinct "coronaviral urinary infection" as a clinical entity [^1137oade] [^112ZjyK9]; urinary symptoms in COVID-19 are typically due to indirect effects such as inflammation, AKI [^114FQU7d], or secondary bacterial infection. Management focuses on **supportive care** (hydration, analgesia, bladder-directed therapy) [^1137oade], **standard COVID-19 antivirals** (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir or remdesivir) when indicated [^111C3VM4] [^114z7gH7], and antibiotics only for confirmed bacterial co-infection. Monitor for **AKI** with urinalysis and renal function tests [^113SkUFx], and use continuous RRT if needed in severe cases [^114FQU7d]. There is **no role** for antiviral therapy targeting urinary tract SARS-CoV-2, and no evidence supports corticosteroids or immunomodulators for isolated urinary symptoms.

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Patients with COVID-19 may present with **urinary symptoms** such as frequency, urgency, dysuria, hematuria, and proteinuria [^1163QzT9] [^112c64BW]. These symptoms are typically associated with systemic inflammation, acute kidney injury (AKI) [^114FQU7d], or secondary bacterial infections rather than direct viral infection of the urinary tract [^1137oade].

For **diagnostic evaluation**, the assessment should include:

- **Urinalysis**: Assess for proteinuria, hematuria, and leukocyturia [^115qWVGj].

- **Urine culture**: Rule out bacterial co-infection [^116gHYk5].

- **Renal function tests**: Monitor serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [^112h3jsQ].

- **PCR testing**: Detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in urine, although this is infrequently positive and not routinely recommended [^112ZjyK9] [^113SDtAG].

---

## Pathophysiology

SARS-CoV-2 may indirectly affect the urinary tract through systemic inflammation, immune-mediated injury, and endothelial dysfunction [^113m3kj1]. Direct viral invasion of **renal tubular cells and podocytes** has been documented [^112c64BW] [^111GsSKh], contributing to AKI [^114FQU7d] and proteinuria [^113CZbDB].

---

## Treatment strategies

### Supportive care

Supportive care remains the cornerstone of managing **COVID-19–associated urinary symptoms** [^1137oade]:

- **Hydration**: Maintain adequate fluid intake to prevent dehydration and reduce renal stress.

- **Analgesia**: Use acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) cautiously for symptom relief.

- **Bladder-directed therapy**: Consider anticholinergic medications or beta-3 agonists for significant lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).

---

### Antiviral therapy

Currently, there is **no specific antiviral therapy** targeting SARS-CoV-2 infection of the urinary tract [^1137oade]. However, standard COVID-19 antivirals may indirectly improve urinary symptoms by reducing systemic viral load and inflammation. These include **nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid)** for high-risk outpatients within five days of symptom onset [^111C3VM4] [^114z7gH7] and **remdesivir** for hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, including those with AKI [^115eRP1L].

---

### Antibiotic therapy

Antibiotics are **not indicated for viral infections** but should be administered if bacterial co-infection is confirmed or strongly suspected. When indicated, initiate **empirical therapy** based on the local antibiogram and adjust according to culture results [^117SVS32]; for **catheter-associated infections**, follow established guidelines for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) [^117CU9Hp].

---

### Management of acute kidney injury (AKI)

AKI is a **common complication** in COVID-19 patients with urinary involvement [^115qWVGj]. Management includes:

- **Fluid management**: Use balanced crystalloids for volume expansion [^1117nXcY].

- **Renal replacement therapy (RRT)**: Consider continuous venovenous hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration in severe cases [^114FQU7d].

- **Avoid nephrotoxins**: Minimize exposure to nephrotoxic medications [^112h3jsQ].

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive strategies focus on reducing the risk of urinary complications in COVID-19 patients through **vaccination**, which reduces the severity of systemic illness, thereby indirectly lowering urinary risk [^115y1PZg]. Additional measures include minimizing catheter use with strict aseptic technique to prevent CAUTI [^117SVS32] [^112nDrsH] and regularly monitoring renal function and urinary symptoms in hospitalized patients.

---

## Prognosis and outcomes

The prognosis of urinary involvement in COVID-19 varies depending on the severity of systemic illness and the presence of complications such as AKI. AKI significantly increases **mortality and morbidity** in COVID-19 patients [^114FQU7d] [^115qWVGj]. Most urinary symptoms resolve with supportive care as systemic illness improves, although persistent symptoms may occur in some patients.

---

## Current research and clinical trials

Ongoing research focuses on understanding the **pathophysiology** of SARS-CoV-2-related urinary complications [^114WPLKa] and evaluating potential therapeutic interventions. Clinical trials are investigating antiviral therapies, immunomodulators, and supportive care strategies to improve outcomes in COVID-19 patients with urinary involvement.

Considerations for antiviral drug selection: There are key differences in drug effectiveness, profile of adverse effects, and other factors among the three authorized or approved antiviral medications (nirmatrelvir/ritonavir, remdesivir, molnupiravir) that inform tailored drug selection. Of note, much of the antiviral effectiveness data were generated from studies of unvaccinated populations and/or preceded the contemporary SARS-CoV-2 variant era; real-world data continue to accrue.

Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir has shown high effectiveness against severe COVID-19 outcomes in older individuals and those with incomplete vaccination. A key consideration in prescribing nirmatrelvir/ritonavir is ensuring careful assessment of possible drug–drug interactions because ritonavir potently affects the activity of multiple cytochrome P450 enzymes; the effect may also endure after drug discontinuation during enzyme regeneration.

Several excellent resources are available for point-of-care reference to avoid and reduce clinically important interactions, including those provided by the University of Liverpool and National Institutes of Health treatment guidelines; notably, in the United States, licensed pharmacists are permitted to prescribe nirmatrelvir/ritonavir after medication review. Important drug classes to consider include immunosuppressants (e.g. tacrolimus), antiarrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone), and others.

Regarding specific circumstances for acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19-associated AKI, particularly in those undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT), the ADQI 2020 guidelines recommend consideration of continuous venovenous hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration. This approach is advised to decrease the filtration fraction and reduce the risk of circuit clotting, as COVID-19 can induce a hypercoagulable state.

### Does COVID-19 cause or worsen LUT dysfunction, what are the mechanisms and possible treatments? ICI-RS 2023 [^1137oade]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). High credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and produced a worldwide pandemic in 2020. There have been 770,875,433 confirmed cases and 6,959,316 attributed deaths worldwide until September 19, 2023. The virus can also affect the lower urinary tract (LUT), leading to bladder inflammation and producing lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in both the acute and chronic phases of the disease.

At the 2023 meeting of the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS), the literature relating to COVID-19 and bladder dysfunction was reviewed. The LUTS reported, as well as the pathophysiology of these bladder symptoms, were the subject of considerable discussion. A number of different topics were discussed including lower LUTS reported in COVID-19, how SARS-CoV-2 may infect and affect the urinary tract, and proposed mechanisms for how viral infection results in new, worsened, and in some cases, persisting LUTS.

The workshop discussed the interaction between the virus and the immune system, providing evidence to support theories underlying the causes of acute and chronic LUTS related to COVID-19 infection. Research questions for further investigation were suggested and identified.

Regarding preventative measures for catheter-associated urinary tract infection, more specifically with respect to closed catheter systems, the IDSA 2010 guidelines recommend maintaining a closed catheter drainage system. This system should include ports in the distal catheter for needle aspiration of urine to reduce catheter-associated asymptomatic bacteriuria (CA-ASB) and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CA-UTI) in patients with short-term indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheters. Additionally, it is recommended to reduce CA-ASB and CA-UTI in patients with long-term indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheters.

### Assessing the burden of nondeferrable major uro-oncologic surgery to guide prioritisation strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic: Insights from three Italian high-volume referral centres [^115q3UPe]. European Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented emergency scenario for all aspects of health care, including urology. At the time of writing, Italy was the country with the highest rates of both infection and mortality. A panel of experts recently released recommendations for prioritising urologic surgeries in a low-resource setting. Of note, major cancer surgery represents a compelling challenge. However, the burden of these procedures and the impact of such recommendations on urologic practice are currently unknown. To fill this gap, we assessed the yearly proportion of high-priority major uro-oncologic surgeries at three Italian high-volume academic centres.

Of 2387 major cancer surgeries, 32.3% were classified as high priority (12.6% of radical nephroureterectomy, 17.3% of nephrectomy, 33.9% of radical prostatectomy, and 36.2% of radical cystectomy cases). Moreover, 26.4% of high-priority major cancer surgeries were performed in patients at higher perioperative risk (American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥ 3), with radical cystectomy contributing the most to this cohort (50%).

Our real-life data contextualises ongoing recommendations on prioritisation strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the need for better patient selection for surgery. We found that approximately two-thirds of elective major uro-oncologic surgeries can be safely postponed or changed to another treatment modality when the availability of health care resources is reduced.

- **Patient summary**: We used data from three high-volume Italian academic urology centres.

### Pemgarda [^117Gqqbf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If you develop COVID-19, your healthcare provider may recommend one of the available COVID-19 treatments.

- **Prevention choices**: Vaccines to help prevent COVID-19 are approved or available under Emergency Use Authorization. Use of Pemgarda does not replace vaccination against COVID-19.

It is your choice to receive or not receive Pemgarda for pre-exposure prophylaxis to help prevent COVID-19. Should you decide not to receive Pemgarda, it will not alter your standard medical care. Pemgarda is not authorized to treat COVID-19 or for post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19.

- **Pregnancy or breastfeeding**: There is no experience using Pemgarda in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. For a mother and her unborn baby, the benefit of receiving Pemgarda may outweigh the risks. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, discuss your options and specific situation with your healthcare provider.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urological care delivery in the United States [^112PcTPe]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Outpatient clinic visits declined substantially for all of the 12 most common urological diagnoses, with a greater decrease observed for nonurgent diagnoses compared to other diagnoses. Outpatient visits for prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer diagnoses saw a 38%–44% decrease in volume during the height of the pandemic, compared to a 54%–59% decrease in visits for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) or microscopic hematuria. This was followed by a fast recovery period where outpatient visits were 6%–15% higher than baseline levels for prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer diagnoses. However, as of February 2021, the volume of outpatient visits was still about 17%–19% lower than pre-pandemic values in February 2020. Although outpatient visits for benign indications such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, erectile dysfunction, and overactive bladder decreased during the peak of the pandemic (49%–54%), outpatient visit rates in February 2021 were close to pre-pandemic levels (5%–12% lower).

- **Trends in procedures**: The frequency of inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures during the lockdown and subsequent reopening phases varied. Procedures for benign conditions, such as vasectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and urodynamics, decreased 68%–78% during the height of the pandemic in lockdown. The recovery for vasectomy increased to about 20% above pre-pandemic numbers, whereas other benign procedures had a more blunted response. Procedures for cancer, s

COVID-19 "rebound" syndromes

Recurrence of COVID-19 symptoms after initial improvement (i.e. "rebound") may occur during SARS-CoV-2 infection, at times accompanied by repeat positive molecular testing, high viral loads, and isolation of cultivable live virus. The precise frequency of rebound syndromes and the impact of antiviral therapy (such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir) are unclear, particularly among vaccinated individuals in the Omicron variant era. Although underlying mechanisms remain uncertain, rebound syndromes do not appear to be primarily driven by acquired drug resistance.

Notably, early clinical trials of nirmatrelvir/ritonavir reported low and similar rates of virological rebound across placebo and treatment groups (2%–7% vs. 2%–4%, varying by rebound definition). In contrast, more contemporary, less controlled observational reports have reported a higher incidence with nirmatrelvir/ritonavir use (> 10%). Across studies, however, rebound syndromes occurring following antiviral therapy do not appear associated with severe illness and/or need for hospitalization. This partly underlies CDC recommendations to isolate if symptoms consistent with COVID-19 return following antiviral treatment, though no additional therapeutic interventions are currently recommended.

### Human kidney is a target for novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^111GsSKh]. Nature Communications (2021). Low credibility.

The pathology of SARS-CoV-2 infection results from both direct and indirect injury. Direct injury is caused by infection of the target cells by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, while indirect injury mainly results from immune responses, circulatory dysfunction, and hypoxia. In the kidney, ACE2 is highly expressed in the brush border of proximal tubular cells and, to a lesser extent, in podocytes, but not in glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells. We used immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescent double staining showed that both SARS-CoV-2 viral NP and S antigens accumulated in ACE2+ kidney tubules (Fig. 3b). SARS-CoV-2 is a cytopathic virus that can also directly induce renal tubular injury during infection and replication.

Interestingly, we found that SARS-CoV-2 NP and S antigens co-express with DP2 and PDS in kidney tubules, and the expression of DP2 and PDS was increased following SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fig. 4b), suggesting SARS-CoV-2 directly initiates hypoxic damage in infected kidney tubules. On the other hand, although host immune cells can infiltrate into infected tissue to counteract viral replication, hyperactivation of immune cells may instead promote fibrosis, induce epithelial cell apoptosis, and cause microvasculature changes. We report here that the SARS-CoV-2 virus recruits high levels of CD68+ macrophages to infiltrate into the tubulointerstitium (Fig. 5a), suggesting that macrophages could induce tubular damage.

### Using dipstick urinalysis to predict development of acute kidney injury in patients with COVID-19 [^113SkUFx]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Low credibility.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread rapidly across the globe, causing a worldwide pandemic associated with high morbidity and mortality in affected patients. Although primarily affecting the lungs, COVID-19 may also injure other organ systems. Kidney involvement is common and may range from isolated proteinuria to severe acute kidney injury (AKI). While the exact mechanism by which the virus induces kidney damage remains unclear, several processes have been postulated, including direct viral invasion of tubular epithelia, podocyte damage, cytokine storm, and complement activation. AKI is a major risk factor for mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.

Simple predictive models that use readily available kidney laboratory parameters, such as urinary dipstick results and serum creatinine, are lacking. Such models would not only allow clinicians to easily prognosticate the development of AKI and the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT) but may also provide insight into the pathophysiology of AKI associated with COVID-19.

Although several studies reported proteinuria and hematuria in conjunction with COVID-19 infection, only a few evaluated differences in the incidence of proteinuria and hematuria on dipstick urinalysis in patients with AKI compared to those without AKI. Even fewer studies investigated the association between proteinuria and hematuria with the development of AKI and the need for RRT. One study reported that a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≥ 1 g/g on admission was associated with an increased risk of requiring RRT.

### Kidney involvement in COVID-19 and its treatments [^114Pw4pC]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Low credibility.

The lungs are the most commonly affected organ by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), but the kidneys are also frequently affected. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can not only cause new kidney damage but also increase the difficulty of treatment and care, as well as mortality for people with underlying kidney diseases. Kidney involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection mainly manifests as kidney tubular injury, with proteinuria as the main clinical sign. To reduce patient mortality, kidney complications should be given increased attention in the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study reviews the existing literature and discusses COVID-19 infection in combination with kidney diseases in terms of kidney damage, pathogenesis, and treatment to guide clinical anti-epidemic responses.

### Gohibic [^116HXSaM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

You are being given this fact sheet because your healthcare provider believes it is necessary to provide you with GOHIBIC (vilobelimab) for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Taking GOHIBIC may benefit adults in the hospital with COVID-19 who require a machine that helps with breathing (invasive mechanical ventilation) or a machine that adds oxygen to the blood outside the body (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO). This fact sheet contains information to help you understand the potential risks and potential benefits of receiving GOHIBIC.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to make GOHIBIC available for use as a treatment for certain adults with COVID-19. GOHIBIC is not FDA-approved for this use. Read this fact sheet for information about GOHIBIC. Talk to your healthcare provider about your options or if you have any questions. It is your choice to take GOHIBIC or stop it at any time.

### Your outpatient has coronavirus disease 2019: What are the treatment options in the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant climate [^115y1PZg]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). Low credibility.

- **Approach to therapeutic decision-making**: Assess risk for severe COVID-19. Initial clinical decision-making includes an assessment of risk for COVID-19 outcomes, such as hospitalization, critical illness, and death, driven by several key demographic and immunologic factors (Figure 1). The most important nonmodifiable risk factor for severe outcomes is older age, particularly age ≥ 65 years. Accumulating medical comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and chronic organ dysfunction (renal, lung, or liver disease) also increase risk. The key modifiable factor to decrease COVID-19 risk is SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, particularly booster vaccination, which dramatically reduces the incidence of severe disease in older individuals. Importantly, an increasing degree of immunocompromise contributes not only to an impaired ability to fend off viral infections but may also attenuate the response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

- **Assess syndrome (severity and duration)**: Individuals with evidence of severe and progressive COVID-19, as with other causes of pneumonia, warrant urgent evaluation in the appropriate care setting. Signs and symptoms may include the presence of lower respiratory complaints such as severe dyspnea, especially when accompanied by hypoxia, ongoing high fevers, and/or lethargy. For those with milder symptoms appropriate for management in the outpatient setting, symptom duration impacts the appropriateness of available antiviral medications. Specifically, oral drugs such as nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid) and molnupiravir (Lagevrio) must be prescribed within 5 days of symptom onset.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is associated with high mortality. Despite documented kidney tropism of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), there are no consistent reports of viral detection in urine or correlation with AKI or COVID-19 severity. Here, we hypothesize that quantification of the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in urine sediment from patients with COVID-19 correlates with the occurrence of AKI and mortality.

- **Methods**: The viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in urine sediments (U-viral load) was quantified by qRT-PCR in 52 patients with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, who were hospitalized between March 15 and June 8, 2020. Immunolabeling of SARS-CoV-2 proteins Spike and Nucleocapsid was performed in two COVID-19 kidney biopsy specimens and urine sediments. Viral infectivity assays were performed from 32 urine sediments.

- **Results**: A total of 20 patients with COVID-19 (39%) had detectable SARS-CoV-2 U-viral load, of which 17 (85%) developed AKI with an average U-viral load four-times higher than patients with COVID-19 who did not have AKI. U-viral load was highest (7.7-fold) within 2 weeks after AKI diagnosis. A higher U-viral load correlated with mortality but not with albuminuria or AKI stage. SARS-CoV-2 proteins partially colocalized with the viral receptor ACE2 in kidney biopsy specimens in tubules and parietal cells, and in urine sediment cells. Infective SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in urine sediments.

Our results further support SARS-CoV-2 kidney tropism.

### Teleurology in the time of Covid-19 pandemic: Here to stay [^116xXM78]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

To assess the implementation and outcomes of telemedicine in a Department of Urology in Northern Italy during the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, all the outpatient clinical activities during the four weeks following the national lockdown (March 9-April 3, 2020) in the Department of Urology of the Trento Province, Italy, were reviewed and categorized. Expert staff members examined the electronic records, selecting whether the clinic appointments should be canceled or confirmed via telephone consultation or face-to-face visit. The rate, indication, and modality of visits were investigated.

Overall, 415 of 928 (45%) scheduled patients canceled their clinic appointment themselves or were canceled by staff members without rescheduling. The remaining 523 (55%) cases were screened, undergoing telephone consultation in 295 (56%) and face-to-face visits in 228 (44%). The rate of face-to-face visits decreased from 63% to 9% during weeks 1 and 4, respectively. Seventy-four percent of face-to-face visits involved suspected or new onset malignancy or potentially dangerous clinical conditions, such as severe urinary symptoms or complicated urinary stones or infection. The median age of patients in the face-to-face and telephone groups was 59 (range 20–69) and 65 years old (range 37–88), respectively.

A pandemic is a dynamic scenario, requiring reorganization and flexibility in healthcare delivery. Forty-five percent of visits were canceled without rescheduling. Although a minimal portion of face-to-face visits persisted, it decreased to less than 10% one month after the lockdown.

### Renal implications of coronavirus disease 2019: Insights into viral tropism and clinical outcomes [^116yAqXd]. Current Opinion in Microbiology (2024). Low credibility.

In recent years, multiple coronaviruses have emerged, with the latest one, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing a global pandemic. Besides respiratory symptoms, some patients experienced extrapulmonary effects, such as cardiac damage or renal injury, indicating the broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2. The ability of the virus to effectively invade the renal cellular environment can eventually cause tissue-specific damage and disease. Indeed, patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 exhibited a variety of symptoms, such as acute proximal tubular injury, ischemic collapse, and severe acute tubular necrosis, resulting in irreversible kidney failure. This review summarizes the knowledge on how SARS-CoV-2 influences the renal environment and induces kidney disease, as well as therapy approaches.

### Human kidney is a target for novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection [^112c64BW]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

The available data revealed that proteinuria and haematuria are common features of COVID-19 patients on hospital admission, and computerized tomography scans of the kidneys from COVID-19 cases showed reduced density, suggestive of inflammation and edema. A very recent study by Yao et al. confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 damages the kidney, and SARS-CoV-2 infection induces acute kidney injury (AKI) based on a small subset of COVID-19 patients. In this study, we found that 27% of COVID-19 patients had abnormal AKI, and patients who are aged or have coexisting disorders such as hypertension and heart failure more commonly developed AKI, suggesting that AKI is relatively common following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

This phenomenon is different from SARS, in which AKI was rare despite being one of the top risk factors for mortality. Yan et al. reported that 63% (32/51) of COVID-19 patients had an elevated level of proteinuria. Similar to this work, we showed here that 29% (20/68) of cases manifested higher levels of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Additionally, the kidney tissues from COVID-19 autopsies manifested severe tubular damage and strong leukocyte infiltration. Collectively, these results illustrate that SARS-CoV-2 mediated AKI may be one of the major causes of multi-organ failure and eventual death of COVID-19 patients.

### Systematic review and subgroup analysis of the incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients with COVID-19 [^112XQNhw]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

In this systematic review, the results from 22 retrospective cross-sectional studies, including 16,199 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 from January 1, 2020, to June 1, 2020, demonstrated that AKI was not rare in COVID-19 patients. The incidence of AKI might be associated with age, disease severity, and ethnicity, according to our subgroup analyses.

COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory disease, but other organs, including the kidneys, are often involved. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and is highly homologous to SARS-CoV. High ACE2 expression in proximal tubular epithelial cells may make the kidneys a potential target, leading to kidney injury. Renal abnormalities, such as proteinuria, haematuria, and AKI, occur in patients with COVID-19. AKI is characterized by a rapid increase in serum creatinine, a decrease in urine output, or both.

The widely used AKI definition was developed by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group in 2012. The most common causes of AKI are septic shock, major surgery, cardiogenic shock, drug toxicity, and hypovolemia. The cause of AKI in COVID-19 patients is likely to be multifactorial, including a direct attack by SARS-CoV-2, haemodynamic instability, microcirculatory dysfunction, tubular cell injury, renal congestion, microvascular thrombi, and endothelial dysfunction, which are commonly found in critically ill patients.

### Is coronavirus disease 2019 associated with indicators of long-term bladder dysfunction [^111wJt86]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Low credibility.

Early reports have suggested that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can present with significant urinary frequency and nocturia, and that these symptoms correlate with markers of inflammation in the urine. We evaluated surrogate markers of chronic urinary symptoms to determine if they were more frequent after COVID-19 infection.

- **Methods**: Routinely collected data from the province of Ontario was used to conduct a matched, retrospective cohort study. We identified patients 66 years of age or older who had a positive COVID-19 test between February and May 2020 and survived at least two months after their diagnosis. We matched them to two similar patients who did not have a positive COVID-19 test during the same time period. We measured the frequency of urology consultation, cystoscopy, and new prescriptions for overactive bladder medications during a subsequent three-month period. Proportional hazard models were adjusted for any baseline differences between the groups.

- **Results**: We matched 5,617 patients with COVID-19 to 11,225 people who did not have COVID-19. The groups were similar, aside from a higher proportion of patients having hypertension and diabetes in the COVID-19 cohort. There was no significantly increased hazard of new receipt of overactive bladder medication (hazards ratio [HR]: 1.04, p = 0.88), urology consultation (HR: 1.40, p = 0.10), or cystoscopy (HR: 1.14, p = 0.50) among patients who had COVID-19 compared to the matched cohort.

In conclusion, surrogate markers of potential bladder dysfunction were not significantly increased in the 2–5 months after COVID-19.

### Review of catheter-associated urinary tract infections and urinary tract models [^115uLR6i]. Journal of Healthcare Engineering (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on catheter-associated urinary tract infection:

- **Definition**: CA-UTI is a common hospital-acquired infection characterized by various medical complications such as catheter encrustation, bladder stones, septicemia, endotoxic shock, and pyelonephritis.

- **Pathophysiology**: Colonization of the urinary catheter and/or uroepithelial cells, evasion of host defenses, replication, and damage to host cells by uropathogens are involved in the development of CA-UTI. Common microbiological agents include E. coli, P. mirabilis, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, K. pneumoniae, P. vulgaris, C. freundii, Providentia rettgeri, and C. albicans.

- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations include fever, urethritis, cystitis, acute pyelonephritis, renal scarring, calculus formation, and bacteremia. Disease progression may lead to urosepsis and death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Several studies report an association between catheter-associated infection, increased mortality, and prolonged length of stay in acute care facilities.

### Impact of Covid-19 on management of urogynaecology patients: A rapid review of the literature [^113cswjY]. International Urogynecology Journal (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus (COVID-19) disease, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was first declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. Since then, it has continued to rapidly spread worldwide, impacting all aspects of life, including medical care and the way clinicians assess and treat patients. Medical providers worldwide have been required to adapt and streamline services to minimize unwarranted, multiple healthcare facility attendances and patient contact where possible by conducting remote consultations, delaying non-urgent visits, and optimizing the provision of one-stop services.

The urogynaecology scope of practice involves, to a significant degree, the care and management of elderly and vulnerable patients; therefore, these measures are of particular importance. As the pandemic continues, national and international societies and organizations have published guidance for management, mainly based on consensus and expert advice, given that the evidence base to support recommendations is still scarce.

Rapid reviews are a method of knowledge or evidence synthesis that produces information in a more timely manner than traditional systematic reviews; therefore, they are particularly useful for new and emerging topics. Rapid reviews involve an expedited process with the omission of certain steps usually performed in a systematic review.

Given the rapid evolution of evidence, recommendations, policies, and clinical management adaptations, a rapid review on the evidence and recommendations is highly warranted since the COVID-19 pandemic was declared.

### Considerations for bedside urologic procedures in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [^114tM7NX]. Urology (2020). Low credibility.

To provide guidance when performing bedside urologic procedures on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) positive patients and offer considerations to maximize the safety of the patients and providers, conserve supplies, and provide optimal management of urologic issues, urologic trainees and attending physicians at our institution, familiar with existing safety recommendations and guidelines regarding the care of infected patients, were queried regarding their experiences. This was done to determine an expert consensus on best practices for bedside procedures for SARS-CoV-2 positive patients.

Our team developed the following general recommendations for urologic interventions on SARS-CoV-2 positive patients: maximize use of telehealth (even for inpatient consults), minimize in-room time, use personal protective equipment appropriately, enlist a colleague to assist, and acquire all supplies that may be needed and maintain them outside the room. Detailed recommendations were also developed for difficult urethral catheterization, bedside cystoscopy, incision and drainage of abscesses, and gross hematuria/clot irrigations.

As patients hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection are predominantly men over 50 years old, there are significant urologic challenges common in this population that have emerged with this pandemic. While there is tremendous variation in how different regions have been affected, the demographics of SARS-CoV-2 mean that urologists will continue to have a unique role in helping to manage these patients.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urological care delivery in the United States [^115jJGuv]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Low credibility.

Our results provide real-world evidence of the broad impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urological practice across the United States and provide insights into the disruptions in health care delivery observed within this multimodal medical specialty. While clinical visits initially rebounded and then declined, the frequency of surgical procedures broadly decreased throughout the time span analyzed, and the use of many diagnostic procedures continues to remain below baseline values, which could impact patient outcomes in the future. Ongoing evaluations of real-world data sources, such as the AQUA Registry and emerging data resources in other specialties, will therefore be needed to characterize the short-term and long-term consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care delivery in the U.S.

### Viral nephropathies: Core curriculum 2024 [^114WPLKa]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2024). High credibility.

Viral-associated nephropathy occurs when kidney disease results from active viral replication. Due to the high global burden of viral infections, clinicians should be aware of their incidence, kidney manifestations, mechanisms of injury, and management. Some viruses, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), can lead to nephropathy more commonly than other endemic viruses. In immunosuppressed patients, viruses like Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, and polyoma virus are more significant causes of nephropathy. Other viruses, such as hantavirus and dengue virus, have high global infectivity rates with rare but severe kidney manifestations.

Advances over the past decades have provided a better understanding of the pathogenesis of viral-associated nephropathies and antiviral therapy options. The patterns of kidney injury include glomerular and tubulointerstitial lesions in the setting of acute and chronic infections. Direct viral infection of kidney parenchymal cells may drive pathologic findings, but kidney pathology may also result from indirect mechanisms due to the activation of the innate and adaptive immune systems. Some viruses can cause kidney injury due to altered hemodynamics from liver dysfunction or shock. More information about the role of genetics, specifically APOL1 polymorphisms, has emerged in relation to HIV-associated nephropathy and SARS-CoV-2-associated nephropathy. Advances in antiviral therapy help reduce nephrotoxicity and improve morbidity and mortality.

### Molecular determinants of disease severity in urinary tract infection [^112d5sKS]. Nature Reviews Urology (2021). Low credibility.

The most common and lethal bacterial pathogens have co-evolved with the host, playing the role of aggressors, while the host immune system is responsible for defense. However, immune responses can also become destructive. Excessive innate immune activation is a major cause of infection-associated morbidity, exemplified by symptomatic urinary tract infections (UTIs), which are caused, in part, by excessive innate immune activation. Severe kidney infections, such as acute pyelonephritis, are major causes of morbidity and mortality. Painful infections of the urinary bladder, known as acute cystitis, can become debilitating in susceptible patients.

Disease severity is controlled at specific innate immune checkpoints, and a detailed understanding of their functions is crucial for developing strategies to counter microbial aggression with novel treatment and prevention measures. One approach is utilizing bacterial molecules that reprogram the innate immune system, either accelerating or inhibiting disease processes. A very different outcome is asymptomatic bacteriuria, characterized by low host immune responsiveness to bacteria with attenuated virulence. This observation provides the rationale for immunomodulation as a new therapeutic tool to deliberately modify host susceptibility, control the host response, and avoid severe disease. The power of innate immunity as an arbitrator of health and disease is also highly relevant for emerging pathogens, including the COVID-19 pandemic.

### AKI in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^115qWVGj]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). High credibility.

Early reports indicate that AKI is common among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and is associated with worse outcomes. However, AKI among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States is not well described.

- **Methods**: This retrospective, observational study involved a review of data from electronic health records of patients aged ≥ 18 years with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. These patients were admitted to the Mount Sinai Health System from February 27 to May 30, 2020. We describe the frequency of AKI and dialysis requirement, AKI recovery, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with mortality.

- **Results**: Of 3993 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, AKI occurred in 1835 (46%) patients; 347 (19%) of the patients with AKI required dialysis. The proportions with stages 1, 2, or 3 AKI were 39%, 19%, and 42%, respectively. A total of 976 (24%) patients were admitted to intensive care, and 745 (76%) experienced AKI. Of the 435 patients with AKI and urine studies, 84% had proteinuria, 81% had hematuria, and 60% had leukocyturia. Independent predictors of severe AKI were CKD, male gender, and higher serum potassium at admission. In-hospital mortality was 50% among patients with AKI versus 8% among those without AKI (aOR, 9.2; 95% confidence interval, 7.5 to 11.3). Of survivors with AKI who were discharged, 35% had not recovered to baseline kidney function by the time of discharge. An additional 28 of 77 (36%) patients who had not recovered kidney function at discharge did so on post-hospital follow-up.

- **Conclusions**: AKI is common among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and is associated with significant outcomes.

### Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on urological care delivery in the United States [^117HJeET]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Results**: Characteristics of the unique patients and practices represented in our sample are summarized. The data include 13,108,874 total visits and 2,194,456 procedures.

- **Outpatient clinic visits by patient characteristics**: Unadjusted trends in outpatient clinic visits from January 2019 through February 2021 are presented for overall, nonurgent diagnoses, potentially urgent diagnoses, new patient visits, and telehealth visits. Overall, there was a similar pattern of a sharp decrease after week 10, followed by a gradual recovery that remained stable through the summer of 2020 to 2021.

- **Figure analysis**: The weekly average of outpatient clinic visits from January 2019 to February 2021 is detailed per practice for various populations: overall (A), select nonurgent diagnoses (B), potentially urgent diagnoses (C), new patient visits (D), and telephone visits (E). The nonurgent subset included conditions like microscopic hematuria, overactive bladder, elevated prostate-specific antigen, erectile dysfunction, and BPH. The urgent subset included conditions like prostate cancer, bladder cancer, kidney cancer, kidney stones, urinary tract infection, gross hematuria, and renal mass. Starting in March 2020 (week 10), there was a sharp, nearly 50% decrease in total outpatient visits, reaching a nadir in April (week 15). A rebound period stretched from May to June (weeks 16 to 24), reaching 92% of baseline, followed by another decrease, with visits at 77% of baseline.

There was a 50.6% decrease in daily outpatient visits at its lowest point, which gradually improved over time.

### Prospective follow-up of overactive bladder symptoms in patients with prior SARS-CoV-2 infection [^117VWsN7]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Low credibility.

SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in genitourinary symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, nocturia, and pain/pressure. In this study, we followed the progression of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms in patients who reported new or worsening OAB symptoms following a coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) diagnosis.

- **Materials and methods**: Individuals from a COVID-19 serology study were invited to participate in a follow-up study. Respondents were divided into three groups based on prior COVID-19 testing. Patients scored symptoms retrospectively before the pandemic, at study onset, and prospectively during a 12-month follow-up. Genitourinary symptoms were assessed using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire for OAB (ICIQ-OAB). Changes in ICIQ-OAB scores from baseline were calculated. The minimal important difference of one on ICIQ-OAB is considered a significant change.

- **Results**: Of participants, 26.0% previously had a positive COVID polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test (PCR+), 5.6% had a positive serology test only (Ser+), and 65.5% were COVID naïve (COVID-). A significant increase in ICIQ-OAB scores was reported at the study onset compared to prepandemic levels by 23.8% of participants. ICIQ-OAB scores were similar at prepandemic but significantly higher at study start (p < 0.001) in the PCR+ group. During follow-up, changes in ICIQ-OAB scores from baseline remained unchanged for the COVID- group but gradually reduced for PCR+, reaching similar levels as the COVID- group by 12 months. By 12 months, 71.4% of PCR+, 42.9% of Ser+, and 68.8% of COVID- participants still reported a significant increase in ICIQ-OAB scores.

### Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on urological care delivery in the United States [^112xqGd1]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Low credibility.

The COVID-19 pandemic caused severe disruptions along the continuum of medical care. Understanding national patterns of urological care — including effects on both urgent and nonurgent surgical procedures, cancer-related care, variations in care across a wide payer mix, and trends based on patient demographics — will enable providers, policy leaders, patients, and administration officials to optimally respond to ongoing and future changes as the COVID-19 pandemic and its sequelae continue to unfold. Therefore, we sought to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on temporal trends in urological care delivery using real-world evidence derived from a national urological data registry. We hypothesized that the pandemic would be associated with significant decreases in nonurgent patient visits and elective procedures but would have significant variation by race or insurance status.

### Safe provision of systemic anti-cancer treatment for urological cancer patients during COVID-19: A tertiary centre experience in the first wave of COVID-19 [^115wchfa]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

On the 23rd of March 2020, the UK government officially announced the first national lockdown in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past two years, we have seen dramatic changes in healthcare service provision, repurposing of drugs for severe COVID-19 infections, and the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines. Coming out of the third wave with anticipation of emerging new variants of COVID-19, we need to address ongoing concerns on how to deliver essential non-COVID-19 services to the public.

All aspects of cancer services have been significantly impacted by the pandemic, resulting in a backlog of patients who may present with more aggressive disease or in extremis. During the early stages of the pandemic, initial observational studies suggested that having active cancer and receiving systemic anti-cancer treatments (SACT) increased a patient's risk of severe COVID-19 and subsequent death. Since then, there has been a significant increase in published material evaluating this risk in patients with cancer. Although the data remains heterogeneous between studies due to variations in oncological characteristics, comorbidities, and study design, common risk factors for poor outcomes from COVID-19 include active cancer (especially haematological malignancies) and those similar to the general population (e.g. older adults, male sex, cardiovascular comorbidities). In addition, receiving SACT does not appear to be a risk factor for severe COVID-19 and death.

Whilst the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and international experts have provided recommendations…

	- In the experience with Rituxan in 2,578 RA patients, the rate of serious infections was 4.31 per 100 patient years. The most common serious infections (greater than or equal to 0.5%) were pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infections, cellulitis, and urinary tract infections. Fatal serious infections included pneumonia, sepsis, and colitis. Rates of serious infection remained stable in patients receiving subsequent courses. In 185 Rituxan-treated RA patients with active disease, subsequent treatment with a biologic DMARD, the majority of which were TNF antagonists, did not appear to increase the rate of serious infection. Thirteen serious infections were observed in 186.1 patient years (6.99 per 100 patient years) prior to exposure and 10 were observed in 182.3 patient years (5.49 per 100 patient years) after exposure.

- **Cardiovascular adverse reactions**: In the pooled, placebo-controlled studies, the proportion of patients with serious cardiovascular reactions was 1.7% in the Rituxan treatment group and 1.3% in the placebo group. Three cardiovascular deaths occurred during the double-blind period of the RA studies, including all rituximab regimens.

### Coronavirus disease 2019: Coronaviruses and kidney injury [^114AwD1a]. The Journal of Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was identified and confirmed in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. COVID-19 is gradually posing a serious threat to global public health. In this review, the characteristics and mechanism of kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection are summarized and contrasted. In particular, urine-oral transmission, prevention, and management of the kidney injury caused by SARS-CoV-2 are emphasized.

We searched PubMed® for English language articles published since 2003 with the keywords "SARS", "MERS", "COVID-19", or "kidney injury". ClinicalTrials.gov was queried for ongoing studies. We also used relevant data from websites, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

Similar to other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory syndrome with rapid progression and kidney injury. The infection process of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by specifically binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Cases of COVID-19 combined with kidney impairment are associated with a higher risk of mortality than those without comorbidities. The pathological changes of the kidney are mainly due to local SARS-CoV-2 replication or indirectly by pro-inflammatory cytokine response. In addition, studies have confirmed the isolation of infectious SARS-CoV-2 in urine, raising the possibility of urine-oral transmission. This is ultimately significant for preventing potential urine-oral transmission.

### Urogenital system damaging manifestations of 3 human infected coronaviruses [^111jU2Db]. The Journal of Urology (2021). Low credibility.

At present, there are no comparative studies on the damage of the three coronavirus infections to the urinary system. Therefore, we reviewed the correlations and differences between invading mechanisms and resultant urogenital system damage caused by these three kinds of coronaviruses. This effort aims to assist doctors in the prevention and treatment of these damages, which will be significant in improving prognosis and quality of life after rehabilitation.

- **Materials and methods**: We searched PubMed® for English language articles published since 2003 with the keywords "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)", "severe acute respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2)", "severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV" and "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV" with "semen" and "kidney". We also used relevant data from websites including the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

- **Results**: Recent studies have revealed that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 invade target cells through a membrane-bound angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, an important component of the renin-angiotensin system, which maintains human homeostasis, whereas MERS utilizes host cells' receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 for entry. While pneumonia is the most prominent symptom in patients infected by coronaviruses due to the transmission through respiratory droplets, the urogenital system can also suffer from infection with coronaviruses, resulting in renal failure, testicular atrophy, etc. The impairments of the genitourinary system differ with the three coronavirus infections, but they remain significant concerns.

### Safe provision of systemic anti-cancer treatment for urological cancer patients during COVID-19: a tertiary centre experience in the first wave of COVID-19 [^117KSjaQ]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

This single-centre retrospective study demonstrated that patients could receive a range of systemic anti-cancer treatments (SACT) during COVID-19 with a low incidence of infection rate and mortality. Although shifts in the type of SACT delivered were observed, with less chemotherapy administered, we were able to continue to start patients on SACT. With emerging new variants and the easing of national lockdown measures, we hope that our data provides reassurance that SACT can be safely delivered during a pandemic with appropriate safety provisions in place. Furthermore, strategies should also include stringent vaccination programs for patients with cancer, considering the availability of COVID-19 vaccines and emerging data on its reduced efficacy in this population.

### Safe provision of systemic anti-cancer treatment for urological cancer patients during COVID-19: A tertiary centre experience in the first wave of COVID-19 [^114P3bHo]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

Safe provision of systemic anti-cancer treatment (SACT) during the COVID-19 pandemic remains an ongoing concern amongst clinicians.

- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis on uro-oncology patients who continued or started SACT between 1st March and 31st May 2020 during the pandemic (with 2019 as a comparator).

- **Results**: A total of 441 patients received SACT in 2020 (292 prostate, 101 renal, 38 urothelial, 10 testicular) compared to 518 patients in 2019 (340 prostate, 121 renal, 42 urothelial, 15 testicular). In 2020, there were 75.00% fewer patients with stage 3 cancers receiving SACT (p < 0.0001) and 94.44% fewer patients receiving radical treatment (p = 0.00194). The number of patients started on a new line of SACT was similar between both years (118 in 2019 vs 102 in 2020; p = 0.898) but with 53.45% fewer patients started on chemotherapy in 2020 (p < 0.001). Overall, 5 patients tested positive for COVID-19 (one asymptomatic, one mild, two moderate, one severe resulting in death). Compared to 2019, 30-day mortality was similar (1.69% in 2019 vs 0.98% in 2020; p = 0.649), whereas 6-month mortality was lower (9.32% in 2019 vs 1.96% in 2020; p = 0.0209) in 2020.

- **Conclusion**: This study suggests that delivery of SACT to uro-oncology patients during the COVID-19 pandemic may be safe in high-incidence areas with appropriate risk-reduction strategies.

### Incidence rates and management of urinary tract infections among children in Dutch general practice: Results from a nation-wide registration study [^113BbBpx]. BMC Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

The frequency of urinary tract infections in relation to age and gender, as well as diagnostic procedures and treatment, were investigated in several studies. However, little is known about seasonal variation and urbanization. Seasonal variations in the incidence of human disease are commonplace, but in the case of urinary tract infections, this aspect has rarely been addressed. Therefore, our first aim is to describe incidence rates of urinary tract infections among children in Dutch general practice in 2001 by age, gender, and in relation to season and urbanization level. It is important to know if there is a relation between these factors and urinary tract infections, because this could provide general practitioners with information about patients for whom they should be more alert to urinary tract infections. In addition, we are interested in whether general practitioners follow the clinical guideline for urinary tract infections concerning prescription and referral.

### Your outpatient has coronavirus disease 2019: What are the treatment options in the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 variant climate [^111C3VM4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Clinical case revisited: therapeutic decision-making for a 71-year-old male kidney transplant recipient with confirmed COVID-19.

Assess risk for severe COVID-19. The patient has many risk factors for severe COVID-19, including older age, multiple comorbidities (obesity, diabetes, renal dysfunction), and transplant immunosuppression. Although the patient has received the CDC-recommended 3-dose primary mRNA vaccine series, he has not received a booster. The combination of potentially blunted initial immunity coupled with waning immunity places him at elevated risk for COVID-19. Prior receipt of tixagevimab and cilgavimab prophylaxis should not affect treatment decisions, given that this combination is not active against contemporary Omicron sublineages. Overall, guidelines recommend prompt antiviral therapy.

Assess symptoms and severity. The patient currently reports upper respiratory symptoms and malaise, without evidence of a severe syndrome or decompensation that would indicate the need for urgent inpatient evaluation and management. Additionally, he reports 3 days of symptoms, placing him in an early window to receive any of the authorized or approved antiviral therapies. US FDA EUA restrictions continue to require treatment initiation within 5 days of symptoms for oral antivirals.

Tailor drug selection. Among available medications, remdesivir and nirmatrelvir/ritonavir have shown the highest effectiveness against severe COVID-19 and are thus preferred therapies for this high-risk outpatient. If remdesivir infusion is available, this may be given over the next several days, without need.

### Triaging urological surgeries to cope with the coronavirus-19 pandemic [^113vjLSe]. Current Opinion in Urology (2022). Low credibility.

The coronavirus-19 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to strains on hospital resources and challenges in safely and effectively triaging surgical procedures. In this article, we discuss the important considerations for triaging urologic surgeries during a global pandemic, factors for performing surgeries safely, and general guidelines for specific surgeries.

Recent findings have shown that many urological procedures have been reduced due to the pandemic, with benign disease states being most affected, whereas oncology cases are affected the least. Recommendations in urology prioritize triaging life-threatening conditions or conditions that may lead to life-threatening ailments during the pandemic. Additionally, published recommendations suggest that all surgical patients be screened for COVID-19 to protect staff, prevent disease dissemination, and educate patients on the worse outcomes that can occur if infected with COVID-19 in the postoperative period.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused worldwide shortages of healthcare resources and increased the need to ethically triage resources to adequately treat the urologic community. These resource limitations have led to increased wait times and cancellations of many urology surgeries that are considered 'elective'.

### Urinary frequency as a possibly overlooked symptom in COVID-19 patients: Does SARS-CoV-2 cause viral cystitis [^1163QzT9]. European Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents a challenge for physicians in triaging patients in emergency rooms. We identified a potentially dangerous overlap between classical urinary symptoms and the not fully described symptoms of COVID-19. After a patient was initially triaged with urosepsis and subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19, we noted an increase in urinary frequency as a symptom of COVID-19, which we identified in seven males out of 57 patients currently being treated in our COVID-19 wards. In the absence of other causes, urinary frequency may be secondary to viral cystitis due to underlying COVID-19 disease. We propose that urinary frequency be considered an anamnestic tool in patients with infective symptoms to increase awareness among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic, helping to prevent the fatal implications of misinterpreting urological symptoms.

### Safe provision of systemic anti-cancer treatment for urological cancer patients during COVID-19: A tertiary centre experience in the first wave of COVID-19 [^113SiqEt]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

In this single-centre retrospective cohort study, we report the outcomes of urological oncology patients receiving systemic anti-cancer treatment (SACT) during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite an inevitable decline in the number of patients receiving SACT during COVID-19, we were able to provide a safe, high-quality urological cancer SACT pathway with a low incidence of COVID-19 infections (0.73%). The low rates of COVID-19 infections in our patients during the first wave were also impacted by national lockdown procedures and high levels of shielding due to our clinically vulnerable groups.

Of the urological cancers, patients with prostate and renal cancers were most affected, with reductions in the delivery of both chemotherapy and targeted therapy, respectively. This reflects clinical decision-making wherein, on a case-by-case basis, treatment was either deferred or commenced without delay based on symptoms, growth rate of cancer, and patient factors. For instance, patients with slow-growing metastatic renal cancers might have been advised to delay starting SACT for a short number of months to avoid hospital visits, risk of infection, and toxicities. In contrast, patients diagnosed with advanced urothelial carcinoma were generally recommended to start SACT since a delay would likely lead to progressive disease over a short period.

Although there was a small increase in the number of patients receiving combination targeted/immunotherapy, this reflects the availability of axitinib/avelumab for untreated advanced renal cancers rather than an effect of the pandemic.

### Acute kidney injury in COVID-19: are kidneys the target or just collateral damage? A comprehensive assessment of viral RNA and AKI rate in patients with COVID-19 [^113SDtAG]. Current Opinion in Urology (2021). Low credibility.

To investigate the possible effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on kidney function and assess the rate of viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) shedding/detection in urine, recent findings have been explored. Most research on this topic indicates that our ability to estimate whether SARS-CoV-2 is a direct causative agent in acute kidney injury (AKI), or whether it causes a cytokine storm effect, is limited.

In our prospective assessment of 333 patients with COVID-19, we observed an AKI frequency of 9.6% (32 cases). Despite previous data suggesting the possibility of detecting SARS-CoV-2 in urine, we were unable to identify any traces of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) in our group. COVID-19 severity (odds ratio, OR = 23.09, confidence interval, CI 7.89–67.57, P < 0.001) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) history (OR = 7.17, CI 2.09–24.47, P = 0.002) were associated with the AKI rate.

AKI is a relatively frequent condition for patients with COVID-19 and is normally correlated with the severity of the disease and the patient's history of CKD. The available data fail to address whether SARS-CoV-2 mRNA is present in urine, whereas our prospective trial data suggest that mRNA is undetectable in urine irrespective of the severity of the disease.

### Chronic kidney disease linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection: A case report [^116tWd9W]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Low credibility.

Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a major public health issue worldwide and the source of substantial healthcare costs. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the Sarbecovirus subgenus along with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome related Coronavirus-1 (SARS-CoV-1). SARS-CoV-2 possesses a large spectrum of virulence, varying from asymptomatic infection to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and multi-organ failure linked to cytokine storm, with possible Kawasaki-like syndromes and auto-immune manifestations linked to interleukin 6 (IL-6) hypersecretion.

Autopsy case series have shown several types of lesions linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially alveolar damage with viral replication in pneumocytes, but also viral replication in the kidneys with podocyte and proximal tubular involvement. Acute kidney injury has also been associated with severe COVID-19 infection and increased in-hospital mortality. SARS-CoV-2 mainly uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) as an entry point into infected cells prior to protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Blood group antigen polymorphisms might also modulate virus binding and infectivity, as individuals with blood group A and B are potentially more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infections.

Epidemiological studies recently illustrated the association between SARS-CoV-2, severe renal dysfunction, and the occurrence of chronic comorbidities. Here, we demonstrate the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 chronic replication in the kidney of a comorbid patient.

### SARS-CoV-2 infection correlates with male benign prostatic hyperplasia deterioration [^115WrEEL]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects extra-respiratory systems, with small-scale studies showing worsened male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) after coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study explores the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and male benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) complications using large-scale real-world data.

- **Materials and methods**: All male patients attending the public healthcare system in Hong Kong receiving alpha-blocker monotherapy for LUTS from 2021 to 2022 were included in this study. Patients with and without a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 were selected as the exposure group and control group, respectively. Baseline characteristics were retrieved, with propensity score matching performed to ensure the balance of covariates between the two groups. BPH complications were then compared, and subgroup analyses were performed.

- **Results**: After propensity score matching, 17,986 patients were included for analysis, among which half had PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n = 8993). When compared to controls, the SARS-CoV-2 group demonstrated a statistically significant higher incidence of retention of urine (4.55% vs. 0.86%, p < 0.001), haematuria (1.36% vs. 0.41%, p < 0.001), clinical urinary tract infection (UTI) (4.31% vs. 1.49%, p < 0.001), culture-proven bacteriuria (9.02% vs. 1.97%, p < 0.001), and addition of 5ARI (0.50% vs. 0.02%, p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis demonstrated similar differences across different age groups.

### Secretion of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in urine [^112ZjyK9]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Low credibility.

Despite the plethora of publications discussing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), evidence of viral secretion in urine is sparse.

- **Purpose of review**: We could identify 34 publications including a total of 2,172 patients. Among those, 549 patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 secretion in urine, which was detected in only 38 patients (6.9%). Within the seven studies displaying positive results, the majority of positive patients (86.8%) were from studies not yet peer-reviewed, including weak data and heterogeneous techniques for sample testing. Furthermore, none of the studies available in the literature addressed the virulence of detected viral RNA in urine.

- **Summary**: Overall, only seven studies were able to detect SARS-CoV-2 secretion in urine, all with a considerably low rate of positivity. However, these studies were of rather low quality considering their methodology. Despite this, as SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in urine, it is important to discuss safety and urinary hygiene protocols. Until further research provides valid data on viral shedding and virulence in urine, the potential risk of transmission through urine cannot be ruled out. Therefore, safety and hygiene measures need to be discussed.

### Covid-19-associated acute kidney injury: Consensus report of the 25th Acute Disease Quality Initiative (ADQI) Workgroup [^113m3kj1]. Nature Reviews Nephrology (2020). Low credibility.

**Pathophysiology and effects of treatment**: Direct pathogenic mechanisms have been implicated in Covid-19 acute kidney injury (AKI). Histopathological data are limited, but a wide range of pathological findings have been described in patients with Covid-19, supporting the idea that multiple causes of AKI exist, including those commonly found in critically ill patients. SARS-CoV-2 might display viral tropism and directly affect the kidney. Endothelial dysfunction, coagulopathy, and complement activation are likely important mechanisms for AKI in a subset of patients with Covid-19. The role of systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction in the development of Covid-19 AKI is still uncertain.

### Coronavirus disease 2019 and kidney injury [^113CZbDB]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2021). Low credibility.

In this paper, we seek to review coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) associated kidney injury with a focus on what is known about pathophysiology.

- **Recent findings**: Kidney injury is a common complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Acute tubular necrosis and glomerular injury are two common findings. Direct viral effect, endothelial dysfunction, and podocyte and tubular epithelial injury have been described. COVID-19-related glomerular injury may also be associated with high-risk APOL1 genotype.

- **Summary**: Data on COVID-19 renal involvement have suggested novel mechanisms of kidney injury that need to be further elucidated. More data are needed on renal involvement in milder disease, renal-specific therapeutic interventions, and long-term sequelae.

### Veklury [^115eRP1L]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Study GS-US-540–5912 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 163 hospitalized subjects with confirmed COVID-19 and acute kidney injury (AKI; N = 60), chronic kidney disease (CKD; eGFR < 30 mL/minute/1.73 m^2; N = 44), or end-stage renal disease (ESRD; eGFR < 15 mL/minute/1.73 m^2; N = 59) on hemodialysis who received Veklury for up to 5 days [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. The adverse reactions observed were consistent with those seen in clinical trials of Veklury in adults. Adverse reactions (all grades) were reported in 13 (8%) subjects in the Veklury group and 3 (4%) subjects in the placebo group. The most common adverse reactions were nausea (1%), abdominal pain (1%), and diarrhea (1%). No subjects experienced serious adverse reactions. One subject permanently discontinued treatment due to an adverse reaction: increased lipase.

- **Laboratory abnormalities**: Frequencies of laboratory abnormalities (Grades 3–4) occurring in at least 3% of subjects with COVID-19 receiving Veklury in Trial GS-US-540–5912 are indicated in Table 13.
