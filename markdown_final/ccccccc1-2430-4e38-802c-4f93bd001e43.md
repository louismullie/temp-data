## Question

A 65­year­old woman presented 3.5 years ago to her primary care physician with complaints of back pain, cough, and weight loss. She did not respond to an initial course of antibiotics for assumed pyelonephritis and developed gross hematuria a few days later. She was subsequently referred to a urologist, who detected a left kidney mass on renal ultrasound. CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed a 7­cm left upper­pole kidney tumor and several bilateral small, subcentimeter lung nodules. Additional imaging found no evidence of metastatic disease in her brain, bones, or liver. She was referred to a nearby cancer center for further evaluation. A core needle biopsy of the kidney mass revealed neoplastic cells, but the sample was too small and heterogeneous to definitively determine a specific histology. In order to relieve worsening symptoms and further elucidate a specific histopathology of the mass, she underwent radical nephrectomy of her left kidney. Pathologic examination revealed kidney cancer with clear­cell histology, and she recovered from surgery with resolution of back pain and hematuria. No treatment for the pulmonary nodules was undertaken because interventional radiology determined that they were not cancerous; however, the patient agreed to undergo active surveillance of the nodules over time to identify changes or progression.
Now, more than 3 years later, the patient presents to the outpatient oncology clinic for an appointment with the medical oncologist. Recently, a routine CT scan revealed lung metastases (ie, the bilateral nodules increased in number and size since the initial scans and the decision to pursue active surveillance). Imaging found no evidence of metastatic disease in her brain, bones, or liver. The patient has an estimated Karnofsky score of 90%, is interested in pursuing systemic treatment for her metastatic kidney cancer, and would like to discuss appropriate and available treatment options.

Give me SAOP

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about first-line systemic therapy selection for a 65-year-old woman with metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma and a good performance status, using the SAOP framework and preserving the thinking process with self-verification language. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about Situation and confirm the diagnosis and staging. Then, I should Assess prognosis using IMDC risk stratification. Next, I will Outline guideline-concordant first-line options and how to personalize them. Finally, I will Plan monitoring, special scenarios, and summarize a recommendation with supporting evidence and shared decision-making considerations [^116RKFfT] [^113aEykX].

> Let me first confirm the Situation and diagnosis. The patient has biopsy-proven clear-cell renal cell carcinoma with pulmonary-only metastases, no evidence of brain, bone, or liver involvement, and a Karnofsky performance status of 90%, which aligns with excellent functional status and supports full-dose combination therapy if indicated [^114gUMWS] [^116RKFfT].

> Wait, let me verify the prognostic Assessment step before jumping to treatment. I need to calculate the IMDC risk score using the five clinical factors: time from nephrectomy to systemic therapy less than one year, hemoglobin less than the lower limit of normal, calcium greater than 10 mg/dL, neutrophils greater than the upper limit of normal, and platelets greater than the upper limit of normal. Given the long interval of more than three years since nephrectomy and no reported abnormal labs, I should confirm that she has zero adverse factors, placing her in the IMDC favorable-risk category, which meaningfully influences first-line therapy selection and expected outcomes [^116ZN9gN] [^113aEykX].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surveillance again. Initially, I thought active surveillance might still be reasonable given the indolent course, but I should double-check the current status. The nodules have now increased in number and size, indicating progression after a prolonged surveillance period, so continuing observation is no longer appropriate and systemic therapy should be initiated [^111w6kYK] [^113LUdp4].

> Next, I should review the guideline-concordant first-line Options. For favorable-risk disease that now requires treatment, ASCO recommends an immune checkpoint inhibitor plus VEGFR TKI combination, with nivolumab plus cabozantinib or pembrolizumab plus axitinib as preferred regimens based on randomized phase 3 trials showing superior efficacy to sunitinib, while acknowledging that ipilimumab plus nivolumab is also an acceptable doublet though more commonly favored in intermediate or poor risk [^116RKFfT] [^113aEykX] [^111wRXBn].

> I need to ensure I am aligning regimen choice with patient-specific factors. Given her excellent performance status, absence of major cardiopulmonary comorbidities, and preference to pursue systemic therapy, both nivolumab plus cabozantinib and pembrolizumab plus axitinib are reasonable. Let me consider toxicity trade-offs: pembrolizumab plus axitinib may have a higher incidence of thyroid dysfunction and hepatotoxicity, whereas nivolumab plus cabozantinib carries more diarrhea, fatigue, and hypertension; I should discuss these profiles and her preferences explicitly during shared decision-making [^notfound].

> But wait, what if she had contraindications to combination therapy or strongly preferred to avoid it. In select favorable-risk patients with comorbidities or strong preference, monotherapy with a VEGFR TKI such as cabozantinib or pazopanib, or single-agent PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab, can be considered, recognizing inferior efficacy compared with combinations but potentially better tolerability in carefully chosen cases [^115vvWoa] [^112Kv7PU].

> I should confirm the role of cytoreductive nephrectomy here. Since she already underwent a radical nephrectomy more than three years ago, cytoreductive nephrectomy is not applicable; moreover, contemporary guidance de-emphasizes immediate cytoreductive nephrectomy in intermediate or poor risk and prioritizes upfront systemic therapy, with surgery reserved for select scenarios such as symptom palliation or oligometastatic consolidation after systemic response [^111bKAbo] [^112uFkAF] [^116vQ4XX].

> Let me think about special scenarios that could alter first-line choice. If sarcomatoid features were present, I should prioritize ipilimumab plus nivolumab or an ICI plus TKI combination given stronger activity in that biology; if brain metastases were identified, I would prioritize local therapy with stereotactic radiosurgery or whole-brain radiotherapy and consider nivolumab plus cabozantinib as a systemic option with intracranial activity; if bone metastases emerged, I would add bone-directed radiation and a bone resorption inhibitor and consider cabozantinib-containing regimens given potential benefit in bone-predominant disease [^115QJqdx] [^116Q9eXA] [^111MvddL].

> Next, I should review the monitoring Plan. I will obtain baseline laboratory studies including CBC with differential, comprehensive metabolic panel with calcium, liver function tests, and thyroid function tests, and perform a baseline CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to document measurable disease. During therapy, I will reassess clinically every 2 to 3 cycles and repeat cross-sectional imaging about every 9 to 12 weeks initially, adjusting frequency based on clinical stability and response, and I will proactively manage class-specific toxicities such as hypertension, diarrhea, hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathies, and hand-foot syndrome with supportive care and dose modifications as needed [^notfound].

> I should double-check second-line planning in case of progression. After ICI plus TKI failure, switching to the alternate class is reasonable, such as moving to ipilimumab plus nivolumab if not previously used, or to a VEGFR TKI like cabozantinib or tivozanib if not previously exposed; after ICI-ICI failure, a VEGFR TKI is appropriate, and after TKI-ICI failure, an alternative TKI can be considered, with emerging data supporting activity of tivozanib in the third-line setting and the potential role of HIF2α inhibitors in later lines [^113rvMSu] [^1154Xw8p] [^115goUFW].

> Hold on, I should verify that shared decision-making and supportive care are embedded. I will discuss financial toxicity, insurance coverage, and out-of-pocket costs, consider cost-effectiveness data favoring nivolumab plus ipilimumab in some analyses, and integrate early palliative care and symptom management to maintain quality of life throughout treatment, aligning choices with her goals and comorbidities [^111XDmqw] [^112Rw3jP].

> Putting this together, my final recommendation is to initiate first-line systemic therapy with either nivolumab plus cabozantinib or pembrolizumab plus axitinib, selected through shared decision-making that weighs efficacy, toxicity profiles, comorbidities, and patient preferences, while establishing a structured monitoring plan and preparing for evidence-based sequencing if progression occurs [^116RKFfT] [^113aEykX] [^111wRXBn].

The patient has **metastatic clear-cell RCC** with lung-only disease and good performance status. Per ASCO, **first-line therapy** should be risk-stratified: for intermediate/poor risk, use an ICI–TKI doublet (e.g. pembrolizumab + axitinib or nivolumab + cabozantinib); for favorable risk, either an ICI–TKI doublet or ICI–ICI (nivolumab + ipilimumab) is appropriate, with surveillance only if asymptomatic and low burden [^116RKFfT] [^113aEykX]. Given progression on surveillance, **systemic therapy is indicated**. Options include pembrolizumab + axitinib, nivolumab + cabozantinib, or nivolumab + ipilimumab, selected based on comorbidities and preferences. If oligometastatic, consider metastasectomy or SBRT; otherwise, proceed with systemic therapy and monitor with CT every 3–4 months.

---

## Patient assessment and risk stratification

- **Performance status**: Karnofsky 90% (ECOG 0–1), excellent.
- **Disease burden**: Lung-only metastases, no brain/bone/liver involvement.
- **Histology**: Clear-cell RCC, confirmed on prior nephrectomy.
- **IMDC risk**: Likely favorable (no anemia, hypercalcemia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, or < 1 year from nephrectomy).

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Per ASCO 2022, **first-line systemic therapy** should be risk-stratified:

| **Risk group** | **Recommended first-line therapy** |
|-|-|
| Favorable | - ICI + TKI (pembrolizumab + axitinib or nivolumab + cabozantinib) [^116RKFfT] <br/> - Or ICI–ICI (nivolumab + ipilimumab) [^notfound] |
| Intermediate/poor | - ICI + TKI or ICI–ICI (strong recommendation) [^116RKFfT] [^114gUMWS] |

---

For **active surveillance**, it is reasonable in asymptomatic patients with low-volume disease and favorable risk, but progression warrants systemic therapy [^111w6kYK] [^113LUdp4].

---

## Available treatment options

### Combination therapies (preferred first-line)

- **Pembrolizumab + axitinib**: Superior OS/PFS vs sunitinib; high ORR; manageable toxicity.
- **Nivolumab + cabozantinib**: Superior OS/PFS vs sunitinib; broad activity including bone.
- **Nivolumab + ipilimumab**: Durable responses; particularly active in intermediate/poor risk and sarcomatoid disease [^113zLoeJ] [^115QJqdx].

---

### Monotherapy options (for select patients)

Cabozantinib is an option for patients unable to receive or tolerate ICIs, and **pembrolizumab** may be considered for patients who cannot receive TKIs.

---

## Factors influencing treatment selection

- **Comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, hepatitis, autoimmune disorders.
- **Patient preferences**: Tolerance for toxicity, convenience, cost.
- **Disease characteristics**: Sarcomatoid features, bone metastases, tumor burden.
- **Prior therapies**: None to date.

---

## Recommended treatment plan

Given favorable risk, good PS, and lung-only disease, **either an ICI–TKI doublet or ICI–ICI is appropriate**. Given progression on surveillance, **systemic therapy is indicated**.

---

### Option 1: pembrolizumab + axitinib

- **Rationale**: Strong efficacy, manageable toxicity, convenient oral TKI.
- **Monitoring**: CT every 3–4 months; labs for liver function, thyroid, and immune-related adverse events.

---

### Option 2: nivolumab + ipilimumab

- **Rationale**: Durable responses, particularly in intermediate/poor risk; may be considered in favorable risk if rapid response is not critical.
- **Monitoring**: CT every 3–4 months; vigilant for immune-related adverse events.

---

### Option 3: nivolumab + cabozantinib

- **Rationale**: Broad activity, including bone; suitable if bone metastases develop.
- **Monitoring**: CT every 3–4 months; monitor for hypertension, diarrhea, and liver enzyme elevations.

---

## Role of metastasectomy or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT)

In oligometastatic disease (≤ 3 lesions), **metastasectomy or SBRT** can achieve prolonged disease control; however, given multiple lung nodules, systemic therapy is preferred.

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Imaging should include **CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 3–4 months** to assess response. Laboratory monitoring should include CBC, renal and hepatic panels, thyroid function, and calcium. Clinically, track symptoms, performance status, and immune-related adverse events.

---

## Potential side effects and management strategies

| **Regimen** | **Common side effects** | **Management strategies** |
|-|-|-|
| Pembrolizumab + axitinib | - Diarrhea <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Hepatitis <br/> - Thyroid dysfunction | - Supportive care <br/> - Dose modifications <br/> - Immunosuppression for irAEs |
| Nivolumab + ipilimumab | - Diarrhea <br/> - Colitis <br/> - Hepatitis <br/> - Endocrinopathies | - Early recognition <br/> - Immunosuppression <br/> - Endocrine replacement |
| Nivolumab + cabozantinib | - Diarrhea <br/> - Fatigue <br/> - Hypertension <br/> - Hand-foot syndrome | - Supportive care <br/> - Dose modifications |

---

## Prognosis and expected outcomes

With modern ICI-based regimens, **median OS exceeds 4 years**, and 5-year survival is ~30–40%. Favorable-risk patients often experience prolonged disease control.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Given favorable risk, good PS, and lung-only metastases, **initiate systemic therapy with either pembrolizumab + axitinib or nivolumab + ipilimumab**, selected based on comorbidities and preferences. Monitor with CT every 3–4 months and manage toxicities proactively.

### Management of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma: ASCO guideline [^1147XxBj]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To provide recommendations for the management of patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).

Methods

An Expert Panel conducted a systematic literature review to obtain evidence to guide treatment recommendations.

Results

The panel considered peer-reviewed reports published in English.

Recommendations

The diagnosis of metastatic ccRCC should be made using tissue biopsy of the primary tumor or a metastatic site with the inclusion of markers and/or stains to support the diagnosis. The International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium risk criteria should be used to inform treatment. Cytoreductive nephrectomy may be offered to select patients with kidney-in-place and favorable- or intermediate-risk disease. For those who have already had a nephrectomy, an initial period of active surveillance may be offered if they are asymptomatic with a low burden of disease. Patients with favorable-risk disease who need systemic therapy may be offered an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) in combination with a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI); patients with intermediate or poor risk should be offered a doublet regimen (no recommendation was provided between ICIs or an ICI in combination with a VEGFR TKI). For select patients, monotherapy with either an ICI or a VEGFR TKI may be offered on the basis of comorbidities. Interleukin-2 remains an option, although selection criteria could not be identified. Recommendations are also provided for second- and subsequent-line therapy as well as the treatment of bone metastases, brain metastases, or the presence of sarcomatoid features. Participation in clinical trials is highly encouraged for patients with metastatic ccRCC. Additional information is available at www.asco.org/genitourinary-cancer-guidelines.

### Personalizing first-line management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma: leveraging current and novel therapeutic options [^116cG8gm]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2022). Medium credibility.

The treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been revolutionized by advances in immunotherapeutic and targeted agents. Therapeutic approaches to RCC in these categories have recently evolved to include immune checkpoint inhibitors, novel vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and combinations of those agents. Multiple regimens within each category have been approved for use in the first-line treatment of clear cell and non-clear cell RCC. However, few of these regimens have been directly compared, leading to a new clinical challenge for physicians: how to select a first-line treatment regimen for an individual patient from among multiple approved options. In the modern era of RCC management, the initial treatment selection therefore becomes highly personalized and depends on numerous patient-specific factors, including histopathologic and clinical features of the disease, comorbid conditions, and psychosocial and economic factors. This review details current first-line treatment options for the management of metastatic RCC and proposes a framework whereby treatment selection can be optimized for individual patients.

### Towards individualized therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^111r6x17]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Over the past decade, the treatment landscape for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has evolved dramatically. The therapeutic options available have expanded and now include immune-checkpoint inhibitors, novel targeted agents and combination strategies, and thus optimal patient selection and treatment sequencing are increasingly pertinent for optimizing clinical outcomes. A better understanding of the underlying biology of the tumour and its microenvironment continues to drive the inception of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, many biomarkers robustly associated with treatment and disease-specific outcomes have been identified, and their integration into clinical decision-making for patients with advanced-stage disease will soon become a reality. Herein, we review relevant aspects of the molecular biology of metastatic RCC, with an emphasis on predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and suggest tailored algorithms to individualize and guide treatment approaches for specific subgroups of patients.

### Selecting targeted therapies for patients with renal cell carcinoma [^112YpnSV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

Advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogeneous disease with variable histology, biology, and response to treatment. In the past 5 years, 6 new agents have been approved for the treatment of RCC, and many more are in clinical development. With an ever-increasing number of treatment options, selecting among them for a particular patient can be a daunting task for clinicians. This article describes how treatment choice can be guided by the disease setting and histology, as well as patient characteristics, comorbidities, and preference within the context of available data. Results from clinical trials are combined with practical considerations to make recommendations for first-line and subsequent treatment of patients with clear cell and non-clear cell RCC. These recommendations should supplement the current NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) for the treatment of advanced RCC.

Implications for practice

Biological discoveries in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have translated into the development of multiple treatment options. Over the past 3 decades, the treatment paradigm has dramatically shifted with the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), now the cornerstone of metastatic RCC management either alone or in combination with targeted agents. Although these advances have revolutionized treatment options for metastatic RCC, questions remain on how to optimally approach management of relapsed or refractory disease. This article will explore the pivotal findings regarding the pathogenesis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and how these discoveries have influenced novel treatments for this disease.

### Treatment and attrition trends for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma in the US [^115bH3Ac]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What are current treatment patterns and attrition rates in metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 8534 patients with metastatic ccRCC, the most common first-line therapy before the approval of immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combinations was tyrosine kinase inhibitor monotherapy (78.8%); following their approval, ICI-based combinations were the most common first-line therapy (60.2%). Only 48.4% and 23.7% of patients received second- and third-line therapies, respectively.

Meaning

The low use of ICI-based combinations in the first line and high attrition rates in subsequent therapy demonstrate the need to improve first-line treatment selection and expand therapeutic options for metastatic ccRCC.

### First-line treatments for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma: an ever-enlarging landscape [^113CQrD1]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The spectrum of the available treatments for kidney cancer in the metastatic setting has widely expanded during the last decade. Upon the approval of more combination therapies, immunotherapy agents constitute the backbone for both first- and second-line treatments. The recent approvals of both combinations nivolumab plus cabozantinib and pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib add further treatment options to the frontline therapeutic armamentarium for patients with mccRCC. Undoubtedly, better CR rates are more frequently achieved, leading to longer durations of response with combination regimens. When having first-line treatment discussions for mccRCC, clinicians should be advised to present options that align with patients' presentations and goals — balancing the goals for CRs, early disease control, potential need for sequential treatments, and risks for upfront versus long-term toxicities in the context of individual patient comorbidities. There are still many unmet medical needs in the field of RCC at the clinical and translational science levels, including among others rare variants of kidney cancers. The completion of ongoing randomized clinical trials will further shed light on more effective and tolerable systemic treatments, addressing some of the existing questions regarding optimal treatment sequencing as well as timing of both surgical and radiation treatments. Further efforts should be invested in future studies to identify patient characteristics and establish biomarkers to tailor optimal, personalized therapeutic algorithms for patients with mccRCC.

### Management of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma: ASCO guideline [^114gUMWS]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

ASCO guideline — management recommendations for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) state that the diagnosis of metastatic ccRCC should be made using tissue biopsy of the primary tumor or a metastatic site with the inclusion of markers and/or stains to support the diagnosis, and The International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium risk criteria should be used to inform treatment. Cytoreductive nephrectomy may be offered to select patients with kidney-in-place and favorable- or intermediate-risk disease, and for those who have already had a nephrectomy, an initial period of active surveillance may be offered if they are asymptomatic with a low burden of disease. For systemic therapy, patients with favorable-risk disease who need systemic therapy may be offered an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) in combination with a vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI); patients with intermediate or poor risk should be offered a doublet regimen (no recommendation was provided between ICIs or an ICI in combination with a VEGFR TKI), and for select patients, monotherapy with either an ICI or a VEGFR TKI may be offered on the basis of comorbidities; Interleukin-2 remains an option, although selection criteria could not be identified.

### Management of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma: ASCO guideline [^113XAWj1]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma — multiple chronic conditions (MCC) considerations emphasize that creating recommendations for patients with two or more chronic conditions is challenging, that any treatment plan needs to take into account the complexity and uncertainty created by MCC with shared decision making, and that clinicians should review all other chronic conditions when formulating treatment and follow-up plans. The guideline notes that practice guidelines should provide information on how to apply recommendations for patients with MCC and that some or all recommended care options may be modified or not applied; evidence may be limited because clinical trials often exclude MCC populations, constraining recommendations.

### How to select amongst available options for the treatment of advanced RCC? [^1113sSu6]. Annals of Oncology (2012). Low credibility.

The treatment of renal cell carcinoma has dramatically changed in the past 6 years with the approval of seven new drugs since 2006. although treatment algorithms have been reported and updated every year since 2006, the choice of targeted therapy is not always easy. Selecting a targeted agent in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) should take into account various parameters, including the status of the disease, the histology, the status of the patient and finally the availability of the drugs in each country. In addition, in front of every patient, the physician will need to raise important questions such as whether the patient should be treated, should receive surgery, and also what is his prognostic group. The different options are described in this manuscript.

### Management of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma: ASCO guideline [^112Rw3jP]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma — patient and clinician communication emphasizes factors that both patients and clinicians should consider and address throughout the emotional and medical journeys of someone facing metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma, noting that the first-line treatments outlined in these recommendations will likely provide a survival benefit to many patients. When disease is no longer controlled, patients may benefit by focusing on QoL and time spent with loved ones, and Palliative care can provide important benefits for this patient group, even when active treatment plans are in play. The panel adds that Second opinions with kidney cancer content experts should become an accepted practice for patients and that case conferences or tumor boards should focus on collaborating on difficult cases to the greatest extent possible. Shared decision making is highlighted, and the care of patients with mRCC requires input from multidisciplinary team members. Patients and caregivers should be encouraged to reach out to family members, friends, and other patients to ensure they can avoid the loneliness, depression, and poor decision making that frequently occur by those attempting to go it alone.

### Cytoreductive nephrectomy in metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma: perspectives in the tyrosine kinase inhibitor era [^112ztNtx]. The Oncologist (2009). Low credibility.

Cytoreductive nephrectomy in combination with adjuvant immunotherapy is an established treatment option for selected patients with metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (mCC-RCC). Multitargeted antiangiogenic and mammalian target of rapamycin tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are now established treatment paradigms in patients with mCC-RCC. Given that all the recent seminal TKI trials in mCC-RCC provide no evidence base for the use of cytoreductive nephrectomy in the TKI era, it is not presently clear where such a surgical approach fits into the treatment paradigm. This review summarizes the evidence for the management of mCC-RCC and outlines novel approaches to be tested within future trials if the initial proposed phase III trials in this setting, using sunitinib, are successful. Overall, two principal questions need addressing. First, is cytoreductive nephrectomy necessary in the TKI era? Second, if so, what is the most appropriate scheduling of TKI therapy with cytoreductive nephrectomy?

### Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: many treatment options, one patient [^112sgprm]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

There has been a recent expansion of therapeutic options in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) targeted at the vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways, which are fundamental to the biology of RCC. These treatment options have similarities in antitumor effect but also important differences in regards to clinical effects, toxicity and patient populations in which they have been investigated. Further, issues regarding the role of debulking nephrectomy, timing of therapy, and appropriate sequencing of agents have emerged as clinically relevant. There are thus potentially many different treatment approaches to each metastatic RCC patient. This review discusses how to integrate the available data regarding targeted therapy in metastatic RCC into personalized cancer care.

### NCCN guidelines updates: management of metastatic kidney cancer [^112GvHBW]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). Medium credibility.

The NCCN Guidelines for Kidney Cancer have undergone a major shift in the risk categorization used for designating "preferred" and "other recommended" or "useful under certain circumstances" first-line treatments. In the most recent version of the guidelines, "favorable risk" is now its own risk category and "intermediate risk" and "poor risk" are combined into one category. The treatment recommendations for clear cell renal cell carcinoma are continually revised and more new options are anticipated based on encouraging results from pivotal trials. In his presentation at the NCCN 2019 Annual Conference, Dr. Jonasch described these promising findings.

Introduction

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common cancer in the United States, with estimates of over 81 000 new diagnoses in the year 2024. The vast majority (approximately 75%-80%) of patients with RCC are diagnosed with the clear cell (ccRCC) subtype. Most patients present with localized disease amenable to definitive nephrectomy, however, between 20% and 40% of patients have been shown to develop metastatic recurrence despite curative-intent local therapy. Additionally, approximately 20%-30% of patients present with advanced or metastatic disease at the time of initial diagnosis.

Over the last 2 decades, the management of metastatic ccRCC has evolved from cytokine-based therapy such as interferon-alpha and interleukein-2 (IL-2) to the development of targeted approaches. In 1992, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of high-dose IL-2 for patients with metastatic RCC, becoming the first immunotherapeutic agent approved for the treatment of cancer. Although high-dose IL-2 provided durable survival benefit in a small subset of patients with metastatic RCC, response rates were limited until the development of targeted agents. In 2005 and 2006, sorafenib and sunitinib became the first tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) agents approved for targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor, followed by subsequent VEGF and mTOR treatment therapy strategies in the refractory setting (Figure 1). Since 2018, the treatment paradigm has evolved with the introduction and approval of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combination therapies for first-line treatment of metastatic ccRCC. The advancements in translational discoveries and treatment options are manifested by the improvement in median survival for patients with metastatic ccRCC — from less than a year in the early 1990s to nearly 5 years in some recent trials. Despite these marked improvements in survival, it is estimated that over 14 000 patients in the United States. will succumb to their disease in 2024, highlighting the need for novel and effective options in the treatment-refractory setting. In this article, we aim to summarize the evolving evidence that has shaped current management, and to review emerging novel therapeutics that are currently under investigation for the treatment of metastatic ccRCC.

Figure 1 — first-line treatment algorithm for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium [IMDC] risk groups): After "Need treatment?", patients who do not require therapy undergo "Active surveillance Select cases (see Recommendation 3.1 for details)"; if treatment is needed, assess "Candidate for surgery?" and, if yes, proceed to "Cytoreductive nephrectomy Select cases (see Recommendation 2.1 for details)". If not surgical candidates, perform "Risk stratification according to IMDC" and treat by risk group: "Intermediate- or poor-risk disease" → "Combination treatment with two immune checkpoint inhibitors (ie, ipilimumab and nivolumab) or an immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination with a VEGFR TKI"; "Favorable-risk disease patients who require systemic therapy" → "Immune checkpoint inhibitor in combination with a VEGFR TKI"; and "Favorable-risk disease with coexisting medical problems that preclude combination treatment" → "Monotherapy with either a VEGFR TKI or an immune checkpoint inhibitor".

### Management of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma: ASCO guideline [^112Q5yLK]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Limitation of the research and future research — metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC): These guidelines apply exclusively to patients with ccRCC, and clear cell histology only applies to roughly 70% of cases, so extrapolating to non-ccRCC is not possible. Many trials used sunitinib as the first-line standard of care comparator, limiting modern comparisons. Representativeness is constrained, as clinical trial participation hovers around 3% of eligible participants and is limited to selected centers, and in an immunotherapy-era study approximately 32% of patients failed to meet standard eligibility criteria. Current risk models rely on criteria from the era of treatment solely with TKIs (eg, MSKCC risk criteria), and a revised model that incorporates response to immunotherapy is needed.

### Complementary roles of surgery and systemic treatment in clear cell renal cell carcinoma [^116vQ4XX]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2022). High credibility.

Standard-of-care management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) indisputably relies on surgery for low-risk localized tumours and systemic treatment for poor-prognosis metastatic disease, but a grey area remains, encompassing high-risk localized tumours and patients with metastatic disease with a good-to-intermediate prognosis. Over the past few years, results of major practice-changing trials for the management of metastatic RCC have completely transformed the therapeutic options for this disease. Treatments targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have been the mainstay of therapy for metastatic RCC in the past decade, but the advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape in the metastatic setting. Results from several pivotal trials have shown a substantial benefit from the combination of VEGF-directed therapy and immune checkpoint inhibition, raising new hopes for the treatment of high-risk localized RCC. The potential of these therapeutics to facilitate the surgical extirpation of the tumour in the neoadjuvant setting or to improve disease-free survival in the adjuvant setting has been investigated. The role of surgery for metastatic RCC has been redefined, with results of large trials bringing into question the paradigm of upfront cytoreductive nephrectomy, inherited from the era of cytokine therapy, when initial extirpation of the primary tumour did show clinical benefits. The potential benefits and risks of deferred surgery for residual primary tumours or metastases after partial response to checkpoint inhibitor treatment are also gaining interest, considering the long-lasting effects of these new drugs, which encourages the complete removal of residual masses.

### Emerging innovative treatment strategies for advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma [^111zNcdt]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Dramatic advances in biological discoveries, since the 1990s, have continued to reshape the treatment paradigm of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Von Hippel Lindau (VHL) gene alterations are associated with pro-angiogenic activity and are central to the pathogenesis of clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most predominant histologic subtype of RCC. Antiangiogenic strategies revolving around this VHL/HIF/VEGF axis have been shown to improve survival in metastatic ccRCC. The discovery of immune checkpoints and agents that target their inhibition introduced a new treatment paradigm for patients with RCC. While initially approved as monotherapy, studies investigating immune checkpoint inhibitor combinations have led to their approval as the new standard of care, providing durable responses and unprecedented improvements in clinical outcome. Despite these advances, the projected 14 390 deaths in 2024 from RCC underscore the need to continue efforts in expanding and optimizing treatment options for patients with metastatic RCC. This article reviews key findings that have transformed the way we understand and treat metastatic RCC, in addition to highlighting novel treatment strategies that are currently under development.

### Treatment and attrition trends for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma in the US [^117VNKfZ]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

Our study showed increased utilization of ICI-ICI and ICI-TKI regimens as a first-line treatment for patients with metastatic ccRCC since their approval in April 2018. However, many patients still receive TKI or ICI monotherapy in this setting. Additionally, our findings suggest a continued high attrition rate after 2018. Considering that an important number of patients still die without receiving additional lines of therapy, ensuring appropriate first-line treatment in patients with metastatic ccRCC is of utmost importance. Upon external validation in larger cohorts, our results could guide treatment selection and patient counseling in the clinic.

### First-line treatments for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma: an ever-enlarging landscape [^1151DnfJ]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As of 2021, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is among the 10 most common cancers in both men (sixth) and women (ninth) in the US. The incidence of RCC has doubled since 1975, accounting for 73 750 new cases and 14 830 deaths in 2020 in the US alone, and for approximately 2% of cancer diagnoses and deaths worldwide. The 5-year relative survival rate for patients with RCC was 75.6% between 2011 and 2017, with variations depending on disease stage at the time of diagnosis.

High-dose interleukin (IL)-2 was the first approved immunotherapeutic agent for patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC) in 1992. Despite showing considerable efficacy and achieving a complete response (CR) rate of 5%-9%, IL-2 use has fallen out of favor due to serious adverse events (AEs) affecting multiple organ systems, and a considerable fatality rate that reached 4% in some series. High-dose IL-2 can be an option in the front-line setting; however, it should be considered only in highly selected patients with excellent performance status and requires to be administered at high-volume centers with experience in its use.

Since the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as sorafenib and sunitinib as well as mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors such as everolimus and temsirolimus in the early 2000s, management of metastatic clear cell RCC (mccRCC) has now progressed into an era where immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) combinations or ICI/TKI combinations have become standard of care. Here, we highlight the current therapeutic landscape for patients with mccRCC in the first-line setting and explore the specific considerations relative to currently approved regimens, along with future perspectives.

### Management of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma: ASCO guideline [^111XDmqw]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma — cost implications and cost-effectiveness guidance states that discussion of cost can be an important part of shared decision making, and clinicians should discuss with patients the use of less expensive alternatives when it is practical and feasible when there are two or more treatment options that are comparable in terms of benefits and harms. Patient out-of-pocket costs may vary by insurance and even between pharmacies, higher out-of-pocket costs are a barrier to initiating and adhering to recommended cancer treatments, and financial toxicity remains an understudied yet significant problem for patients with metastatic RCC. As part of guideline development, ASCO may search for cost-effectiveness analyses to inform the relative value of options, excluding analyses lacking contemporary cost data, involving agents not currently available in either the United States or Canada, or that are industry-sponsored. Available comparisons found Nivo plus Ipi to be the most cost-effective combination versus sunitinib and versus axitinib plus pembrolizumab in treating mRCC, and discussions of treatment expense with support from financial counselors and social workers can bolster shared decision making and informed consent.

### Sequencing of agents for metastatic renal cell carcinoma: can we customize therapy? [^115soDZQ]. European Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Context

The expanding armamentarium of agents for the therapy of advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) warrants further investigation of optimal patient selection.

Objective

To analyze the second and subsequent line of targeted therapies for advanced RCC while integrating clinical and molecular markers and imaging.

Evidence Acquisition

Data were acquired from research published in peer-reviewed literature or presented at major conferences.

Evidence Synthesis

Following first-line vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors, second-line therapy with everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor, and axitinib, a VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, have demonstrated benefits in progression-free survival (PFS). Sorafenib, pazopanib, and axitinib have demonstrated extension of PFS following cytokines. Optimal patient selection based on biomarkers is undergoing investigation. Clinical trials evaluating novel agents and combinations should be preferred.

Conclusions

Currently, the sequence of therapy is based on patient and physician decision, which may be influenced by comorbidities and toxicity profiles.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma: today and tomorrow [^111F17KK]. The Oncologist (2011). Low credibility.

In the U.S. and Europe, clinical practice guidelines for metastatic renal cell carcinoma have undergone several revisions as a result of the introduction of molecular-targeted therapies. Recently, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the European Association of Urology (EAU) published updated guidelines to reflect these new treatment approaches that provide greater efficacy and better tolerability than the previous standard of care, cytokine therapy with interleukin-2 or interferon-α. Recommendations are classified by line of therapy, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk level for survival, and level of evidence. Although many similarities exist, levels of evidence between the NCCN and EAU guidelines have differing designations and definitions, and timing of updates varies. New research developments, such as identification of effective combinations of targeted agents, optimal regimens for sequential therapy, newly designed targeted agents, benefits in special populations, and identification of additional prognostic factors and biomarkers, will prompt continued updates and refinements of today's clinical practice guidelines, with the goal of providing physicians with the most up-to-date clinical consensus upon which to base treatment decisions. Because clinical trial populations may not represent real-life patient populations, recommendations should serve only as a guide and must be tailored to the needs of each patient.

### Biomarkers: the next therapeutic hurdle in metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^113jeQB2]. British Journal of Cancer (2012). Low credibility.

Systemic therapy for clear cell (CC)-renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has been dramatically altered with the addition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors to the therapeutic armamentarium (Table 1) However, most patients are not cured and the median progression-free survival (PFS) is 8–12 months in the first-line setting and 4–5 months following VEGF inhibitors. In the absence of biomarkers predictive for activity, patients are currently selected based on eligibility criteria in pivotal phase III trials, patient preferences, toxicity profiles, comorbidities and costs.

Given the modest increments provided by VEGF and mTOR inhibitors coupled with their toxicities and comorbidities prevalent in RCC patients, optimal patient selection is necessary to maximise outcomes. There is a need to incorporate molecular factors in clinical decision making to optimise the therapeutic index and facilitate more rational therapy. This review focuses on biomarkers to guide the therapy of metastatic CC-RCC.

### Role of surgery for locally advanced and metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^112GbThN]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2011). Low credibility.

Both locally advanced and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) present a challenge in terms of their optimal management. This article reviews the literature and evaluates the role of surgery in the treatment of advanced RCC. Surgery is the optimal treatment for locally advanced RCC and minimal, resectable, metastatic disease. Patients with metastatic disease, and some forms of locally advanced disease, may also benefit from multimodal management with local surgical therapy and systemic treatment using either immunotherapy or targeted therapy. Regardless of the disease stage, patients with locally advanced or metastatic RCC represent heterogenous patient populations with different disease characteristics and risk factors. Individualization of care in the setting of a sound oncologic framework may optimize the risk/benefit ratio within individual patient cohorts.

### Systemic therapy for metastatic non-clear-cell renal cell carcinoma: recent progress and future directions [^111Kx4yE]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Insights into the biology of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) have identified multiple pathways associated with the pathogenesis and progression of this cancer. This progress has led to the development of multiple agents targeting these pathways, including the tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib, sunitinib, and pazopanib, the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, and the mTOR inhibitors temsirolimus and everolimus. With the exception of temsirolimus, phase 3 trials tested these agents in patients with clear-cell histology; therefore, their efficacy in non-CCRCC is unclear. To date, there is no established effective therapy for patients with advanced non-CCRCC. This article focuses on treatment options for metastatic non-CCRCC.

### Metastasectomy in patients with renal cell carcinoma: when and how? [^117MSH5i]. Current Opinion in Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The role of metastasectomy in the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) remains controversial. The aim of this review is to summarize and evaluate the recent findings about the surgical treatment of patients with mRCC focusing on the literature published in the last 2 years.

Recent Findings

Despite the lack of randomized controlled trials, the benefit of metastasectomy in term of cancer-specific and overall survival have been demonstrated in large observational studies. Results of ongoing clinical trials evaluating the impact of combination of surgical and systemic therapies are eagerly awaited and may shed the light on a new treatment armamentarium in this subset of patients.

Summary

Several novel systemic agents have emerged and is continuously changing the treatment paradigm in patients with advanced RCC. However, surgical resection of the primary tumor and metastatic deposits represents a definitive cure option in well selected patients.

Treatment selection in metastatic ccRCC

As the predominant histological type within RCC, this is the group of patients for which there is the greatest evidence base to guide management. Renal cell carcinoma can sometimes follow an indolent course, therefore a period of observation can be considered before starting treatment. Immediate treatment is advised however where there is extensive multisite, progressive or symptomatic disease. First-line treatment in mRCC depends heavily on the prognostic category, with differing recommendations for favourable and intermediate-risk disease vs poor-risk disease.

### Combination therapy in renal cell carcinoma: the best choice for every patient? [^114DAcCX]. Current Oncology Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The therapeutic armamentarium for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is increasingly rich nowadays. The definition of a therapeutic algorithm is a crucial issue, considering the complexity of the factors involved in the progression of the disease and the heterogeneity of the population affected. Because of the lack of validated predictive factors, the choice of treatment is made even more difficult. Furthermore, the characteristics of "real life" patients may be different from those enrolled in clinical trials.

The current treatments for mRCC include systemic therapies such as several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) or immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Such therapies can be administered sequentially, but, more recently, combination therapies have been introduced with the aim to improve patient outcomes. These therapies act synergistically on different targets and pathways involved in tumor progression. As suggested by the promising results of recent clinical trials, combination therapies are believed to be of greater importance in the treatment of RCC. While combined therapies are becoming the standard of treatment, it is not entirely clear whether such approaches are the best option for all patients. Indeed, the purpose of this expert review is to assess the rationale on which TKI alone may still be a viable first-line treatment option for some subgroups of patients with mRCC.

### Landmarks in the diagnosis and treatment of renal cell carcinoma [^114zvWbr]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2014). Medium credibility.

The most common renal cancer is renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which arises from the renal parenchyma. The global incidence of RCC has increased over the past two decades by 2% per year. RCC is the most lethal of the common urological cancers: despite diagnostic advances, 20–30% of patients present with metastatic disease. A clearer understanding of the genetic basis of RCC has led to immune-based and targeted treatments for this chemoresistant cancer. Despite promising results in advanced disease, overall response rates and durable complete responses are rare. Surgery remains the main treatment modality, especially for organ-confined disease, with a selective role in advanced and metastatic disease. Smaller tumours are increasingly managed with biopsy, minimally invasive interventions and surveillance. The future promises multimodal, integrated and personalized care, with further understanding of the disease leading to new treatment options.

### Treatment selection in first-line metastatic renal cell carcinoma-the contemporary treatment paradigm in the age of combination therapy: a review [^111wRXBn]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The treatment landscape of metastatic renal cell carcinoma has evolved rapidly over the last decade. Recent combination approaches heralded by targeting immune checkpoints cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 and programmed death-1 (PD-1) have been followed in consecutive years by protocols targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, PD-1, and programmed death ligand-1. The differences in baseline patient characteristics, statistical plans, follow-up length, biomarker-derived approaches, and trial design make cross-trial comparisons difficult. Given the regulatory approval of a number of these regimens, the current available evidence is reviewed herein for combination first-line regimens with published randomized phase 3 trial data.

Observations

Combination approaches have transformed outcomes for patients. Durable disease control and prolonged overall survival have been achieved by both doublet immune checkpoint blockade and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor plus PD-1 blockade. Rationale for variations in trial outcome are offered, alongside approaches to navigating patient-empowered treatment selection, focusing on predictive tools, biomarkers, and the role of real-world data.

Conclusions and Relevance

Advances in the genomic, molecular, and immunologic understanding of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma have lifted the survival curves for this disease markedly in recent years. Combination approaches will remain standard of care in the first-line setting. However, thoughtful study design is needed to accurately estimate outcomes and integrate novel approaches into the treatment armamentarium.

### Clinical review on the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^114SGnek]. JCO Oncology Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

Renal cell carcinomas vary considerably in their tumor biology and disease course, which is reflected in the range of treatment paradigms in localized and metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Active surveillance remains an important component of all renal cell carcinoma management. In mRCC, the rapid evolution from cytokine-based therapy to targeted therapy to immunotherapy with checkpoint blockade has revolutionized the field and drastically altered treatment outcomes. More recently, combination therapies have become a standard of care for most patients with mRCC. In this review, we highlight recent critical data that led to changes in treatment paradigms and provide a practical framework for the management of patients with mRCC.

In an era of several therapeutic options available, optimal treatment sequencing is crucial to providing patients the most effective therapy and promoting quality of life. In clear cell renal cell carcinoma, a combination approach with an immunotherapy backbone, such as nivolumab/ipilimumab or axitinib/pembrolizumab, has a key role in the first-line setting. Safety and activity data support the transition to single-agent targeted therapies in the second-line setting. Nivolumab monotherapy possesses clinical and mechanistic rationale as a second-line therapeutic option for patients treated with targeted therapies in the first-line setting. Gene expression models are being generated from large prospective clinical trial data sets.

### The place of VEGF inhibition in the current management of renal cell carcinoma [^113BzpZ4]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Mature phase III data from the lead compounds is awaited. However, the available phase II and phase III data shows significant activity in both progression-free survival and clinical benefit (CR+PR+SD). Early indications are that there will be a significant effect upon overall survival. Given that this is a disease with few active treatment options for the majority of patients, there is now a significant body of data demonstrating that this class of agents has useful clinical activity.

We therefore believe that all metastatic clear cell RCC patients should at some point during their treatment have the opportunity to be exposed to a VEGF inhibitor. Patients who are of reasonable performance status and who do not have any specific contraindications for anti-VEGF treatment should therefore be referred to a centre that has access to an appropriate agent within the context of a clinical trial. Pharmaceutical companies should be encouraged to expand their planned extended-use programmes to enable patients to access these active drugs pre-licensing. Commissioners should be made aware of the fact that once licensed, these drugs should be made available for a patient population which up until now has had no adequate therapeutic options.

### Role of surgery in metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^112dy5xo]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgery has historically been the mainstay of treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), but recent clinical trials demonstrated that contemporary systemic therapies alone are non-inferior to cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN). Thus, the current role of surgery is not precisely defined. CN remains an appropriate upfront treatment for the palliation of severe symptoms, select cases of metastatic non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma, for consolidation following systemic therapy, and in the setting of oligometastatic disease. Metastasectomy is ideally utilized to achieve a disease-free state when there is minimal morbidity associated with surgery. Given the heterogenous nature of mRCC, the decision for systemic therapy and surgery should be made through a multidisciplinary approach tailored to each individual patient.

Immunotherapy for mRCC

In the setting of residual metastatic disease, following nephrectomy, or recurrent metastatic disease, the Task Force discussed the role of first-line treatment with immunotherapy versus VEGF or mTOR targeted therapy for metastatic disease. The outcome of this discussion is outlined below and summarized in a treatment algorithm for patients with stage IV RCC (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Stage IV renal cell carcinoma (RCC) immunotherapy treatment algorithm. All treatment options shown may be appropriate. The final selection of therapy should be individualized based on patient eligibility and the availability of each therapy at the treating physician's discretion. 1) "Risk" refers to prognostic risk group per Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and/or International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) classification. 2) For patients with small-volume, indolent metastases, an initial period of observation can be considered accounting for patient age/comorbidities, patient preference, and toxicity of available therapy. 3) A clinical trial, including those that are immunotherapy-based, should be considered in all RCC patients in all lines of therapy. 4) As noted in the manuscript, HD IL2 should be considered and discussed with mRCC patients with clear cell histology and good performance status. 5) For patients with advanced non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), if available a clinical trial is the preferred initial treatment option, including trials of checkpoint inhibitors for which limited data exists regarding efficacy in non-clear cell RCC. If unavailable, then a VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is preferred given results from two small randomized trials showing a slight advantage over mTOR inhibitors in this setting. 6) Nivolumab is an appropriate initial recommendation in refractory RCC in the absence of contraindications given the overall survival benefit and tolerability. Other options (TKI, HD IL-2 and mTOR inhibitors) can be considered depending on patient performance status, comorbidities, prior therapy received and preference.

### What is next in second-and later-line treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma? review of the recent literature [^1154Xw8p]. Current Opinion in Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The current treatment landscape of metastatic renal cell carcinoma has changed dramatically from the dominance of single-agent tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy to immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combinations in recent years. However, the optimal subsequent therapy remains ill-defined owing to the novelty of this approach.

Recent Findings

Treatment with TKIs after failure of single or dual ICI therapies may result in robust clinical efficacy. Nonetheless, there is a trend toward lower efficacy of TKIs after previous ICI-TKI combination therapy. Currently, tivozanib is the only drug whose third- and later-line use after failure of TKI and ICI is supported by evidence, with significantly longer progression-free survival and higher objective response rates than sorafenib. Data from retrospective studies highlight the safety and clinical activity of ICI rechallenge.

Summary

Overall, the level of evidence remains low. Treatment after failure of dual ICI therapy is not well defined and may consist of any available TKI. Although first-line use of TKI is less common, strong evidence suggests cabozantinib or nivolumab as standard options in that setting. The recommendations after first-line TKI-ICI therapy failure mirror this recommendation, although the data are less robust.

### First and second-line treatments in metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^115goUFW]. European Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objective

The treatment landscape for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has evolved significantly in recent years, leading to improved outcomes. The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with a practical guide for selecting first- and second-line treatments on the basis of current evidence.

Methods

We critically evaluated systemic treatment strategies for mRCC. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed and Embase, alongside manual searches of guidelines and conference proceedings up to October 2024. A narrative review was performed to reach a consensus, with voting used to resolve differing opinions among authors.

Key Findings and Limitations

First-line treatment options include immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-based combinations or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Four combination regimens have been approved internationally. Owing to the lack of head-to-head trials and standardized biomarkers, treatment decisions rely on factors such as International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk score, functional status, safety profiles, sarcomatoid features, use of immunosuppressive drugs, and need for immediate response. Despite advances, many patients will experience disease progression on ICI-based therapy, necessitating further treatment. The need for standardized second-line approaches remains unmet. TKIs, alone or with everolimus, show promising efficacy, while HIF2a inhibitors offer newer options with a favorable toxicity profile. Rechallenge with ICIs after early progression is not recommended.

Conclusions and Clinical Implications

For optimal mRCC treatment selection, clinicians must carefully balance efficacy, toxicity, and patient preferences, especially when transitioning between first- and second-line therapies, to provide individualized care.

### Treatment selection in metastatic renal cell carcinoma: expert consensus [^112CEJfa]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2012). Medium credibility.

In metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), many factors influence clinical decisions, including histology, tumour burden, prognostic factors, comorbidities, and the ability of the patient to tolerate treatment. Progression-free survival (PFS) durations reported from randomized trials of targeted therapies vary considerably, in part because of differences in patient characteristics. For first-line therapy, an estimate of PFS with sunitinib, bevacizumab plus interferon, or sorafenib in a 'general' population is 8–9 months, but each regimen is suitable for different patient categories. For example, sunitinib is suitable for all-prognosis groups, particularly younger, fitter patients; pazopanib for patients with a good or intermediate prognosis; bevacizumab plus interferon for good-prognosis patients or those with indolent disease; and sorafenib for patients at all prognostic risk levels, particularly the elderly and those with comorbidities. Sequential therapy with targeted agents provides significant benefit, and should be considered in all patients who can tolerate such treatment. Level 1 evidence supports sequential use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as well as these agents followed by everolimus. We consider how patient characteristics have influenced the results of studies of first-line therapy, and we provide expert opinion on the most appropriate treatment choices for particular patient groups receiving first-line and second-line therapy.

### Metastatic nonclear renal cell carcinoma current review in evolving treatment strategies [^1111wXV7]. Current Opinion in Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the 6th most often diagnosed cancer in men and the 10th in women. Nearly 75% of the renal cancer cases are clear cell histologic subtype, whereas nonclear cell histologies represent the remaining 25%. Treatment options for clear renal type are well established. However, as nonclear RCC represents a heterogenous and less frequent group. Current treatment options for these tumors are limited and mostly based on evidence derived from small phase II clinical trials. The present review aims to provide an update of the available treatment options for nonclear RCC.

Recent Findings

In the past decade, the vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, everolimus, and temsirolimus, have demonstrated limited efficacy in nonclear RCC. Recent studies with MET inhibitors and immunotherapy-based combinations have proven promising activity, especially in certain subgroups of patients, such as patients with MET-driven disease or patients with sarcomatoid features RCC.

Summary

Here, we report currently available data about biology and treatment of nonclear cell RCC.

### Treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma [^115m4wm3]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2010). Medium credibility.

The median survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has increased from 10 months to more than 40 months since the advent of targeted therapy. Sunitinib and bevacizumab represent the first-line standards of care for patients with clear cell mRCC. Temsirolimus is the standard of care for those with poor-risk features. Additionally, exploratory analyses of the temsirolimus data indicate important benefits for those with non-clear-cell mRCC. Everolimus has proved its efficacy in second-line therapy. Sunitinib and sorafenib are also effective for non-clear-cell histological subtypes and after failure of first-line treatment. Potential survival benefits can also be derived from cytoreductive nephrectomy (CNT) in patients previously exposed to sunitinib or bevacizumab. Phase III studies are ongoing to address the importance of CNT in the targeted therapy era. Such information is crucial to ensure timely delivery of a combination of medical and surgical therapies to this patient population.

### Treatment patterns and clinical outcomes in patients with renal cell carcinoma in the UK: insights from the RECCORD registry [^1128cwnd]. Annals of Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

introduction

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a malignancy that accounts for over 90% of kidney cancers. Clear cell RCC is the most common (70%–85%). Approximately 30% of all RCC patients have metastatic disease at presentation, and until recently, treatment options were limited as these cancers are relatively resistant to cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, the introduction of targeted therapy has significantly improved the prognosis and treatment outcome for these patients. These therapies target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, both of which are related to the pathogenesis of clear cell metastatic RCC. Despite this progress, there are still a number of treatment challenges, including identifying and optimising the most appropriate sequences or combinations of agents and managing associated side-effects. Health-related quality of life has also become an important medical outcome among this patient population, particularly since there is evidence that tumour response and delay in disease progression can affect it.

Clinical guidelines for the treatment of metastatic RCC reflect clinical trial evidence for targeted therapy. Trial populations may not represent real-life patient populations and have better outcomes than patients ineligible for studies. Optimisation of disease management must therefore be based on clinical trials and real-world experience. Worldwide, registries provide insights into treatment patterns and outcomes for patients with RCC in the real world. Their results suggest that survival has improved in the era of targeted therapies compared with the era of cytokine therapy. While the sunitinib expanded access programme included patients from the UK, real-life data for RCC management in UK clinical practice are limited. These data could provide important information on disease progression, as well as facilitating optimisation of treatment.

The aim of the Renal Cell Carcinoma Outcomes Research Dataset (RECCORD) registry was to collect real-world demographic, treatment, histological and outcome data from RCC patients in the UK. Here, we report on the demographics of RECCORD, the current use of systemic therapy and the clinical outcome associated with different therapeutic approaches.

Based on these results, the Panel recommends considering pembrolizumab as an adjuvant treatment for patients with stage 2 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with grade 4 or sarcomatoid features and clear cell histology, and for patients with stage 3 clear cell RCC (ccRCC), after discussion of benefits and risks. The Panel also recommends considering adjuvant pembrolizumab for stage 4 ccRCC after metastasectomy with complete resection of disease, within a year of nephrectomy. Due to lack of evidence in non-clear cell RCC, the Panel does not recommend including pembrolizumab as a treatment option for non-clear cell histology.

### Real-world survival outcomes associated with first-line immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and combination therapy for metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma [^115DGxCL]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the sixth most common cancer among men and the eighth most common cancer among women in the US, accounting for 4.2% of all incident cancer cases and 2.4% of all cancer deaths each year. Approximately 30% of patients with RCC present with either regional or distant metastases, and 20% of individuals who receive an initial diagnosis of localized disease will eventually develop regional or distant metastases. Clear cell RCC is the most common histologic subtype, representing approximately 80% of all RCCs.

First-line management of metastatic clear cell RCC has recently shifted toward immunotherapy (IT), largely owing to the emergence of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapies and clinical trial results demonstrating improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival compared with tyrosine kinase–inhibiting targeted therapy (TT). Current guideline recommendations for preferred first-line IT-based therapy for metastatic clear cell RCC include both dual IT (eg, ipilimumab plus nivolumab) and combination TT and IT (eg, axitinib plus pembrolizumab) regimens. Although the safety and efficacy of IT-based regimens have been demonstrated in clinical trials, to our knowledge, their effectiveness among more generalizable populations has not yet been assessed. Evaluating new treatments in comparative effectiveness studies is a critical part of validating clinical trial findings because patients enrolled in clinical trials tend to be younger and healthier than those encountered in real-world practice. Given the limited availability of effectiveness data for novel and increasingly used IT regimens for metastatic clear cell RCC, we sought to examine real-world survival outcomes for TT, IT, and combination TT and IT regimens using a generalizable cohort of patients with metastatic clear cell RCC.

### Algorithms in the first-line treatment of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma – analysis using diagnostic nodes [^117G1cdx]. The Oncologist (2015). Low credibility.

Background

With the advent of targeted therapies, many treatment options in the first-line setting of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (mccRCC) have emerged. Guidelines and randomized trial reports usually do not elucidate the decision criteria for the different treatment options. In order to extract the decision criteria for the optimal therapy for patients, we performed an analysis of treatment algorithms from experts in the field.

Materials and Methods

Treatment algorithms for the treatment of mccRCC from experts of 11 institutions were obtained, and decision trees were deduced. Treatment options were identified and a list of unified decision criteria determined. The final decision trees were analyzed with a methodology based on diagnostic nodes, which allows for an automated cross-comparison of decision trees. The most common treatment recommendations were determined, and areas of discordance were identified.

Results

The analysis revealed heterogeneity in most clinical scenarios. The recommendations selected for first-line treatment of mccRCC included sunitinib, pazopanib, temsirolimus, interferon-α combined with bevacizumab, high-dose interleukin-2, sorafenib, axitinib, everolimus, and best supportive care. The criteria relevant for treatment decisions were performance status, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center risk group, only or mainly lung metastases, cardiac insufficiency, hepatic insufficiency, age, and "zugzwang" (composite of multiple, related criteria).

Conclusion

In the present study, we used diagnostic nodes to compare treatment algorithms in the first-line treatment of mccRCC. The results illustrate the heterogeneity of the decision criteria and treatment strategies for mccRCC and how available data are interpreted and implemented differently among experts.

Implications For Practice

The data provided in the present report should not be considered to serve as treatment recommendations for the management of treatment-naïve patients with multiple metastases from metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma outside a clinical trial; however, the data highlight the different treatment options and the criteria used to select them. The diversity in decision making and how results from phase III trials can be interpreted and implemented differently in daily practice are demonstrated.

### Pyelonephritis… [^111tdjn7]. Wikipedia (2005). Low credibility.

Pyelonephritis is inflammation of the kidney, typically due to a bacterial infection. Symptoms most often include fever and flank tenderness. Other symptoms may include nausea, burning with urination, and frequent urination. Complications may include pus around the kidney, sepsis, or kidney failure. It is typically due to a bacterial infection, most commonly Escherichia coli. Risk factors include sexual intercourse, prior urinary tract infections, diabetes, structural problems of the urinary tract, and spermicide use. The mechanism of infection is usually spread up the urinary tract. Less often infection occurs through the bloodstream. Diagnosis is typically based on symptoms and supported by urinalysis. If there is no improvement with treatment, medical imaging may be recommended. Signs and symptoms Signs and symptoms of acute pyelonephritis generally develop rapidly over a few hours or a day.

It can cause high fever, pain on passing urine, and abdominal pain that radiates along the flank towards the back. There is often associated vomiting. Chronic pyelonephritis causes persistent flank or abdominal pain, signs of infection, lower urinary tract symptoms and blood in the urine. Chronic pyelonephritis can in addition cause fever of unknown origin. Furthermore, inflammation-related proteins can accumulate in organs and cause the condition AA amyloidosis. Physical examination may reveal fever and tenderness at the costovertebral angle on the affected side.
- Mechanical: any structural abnormalities in the urinary tract, vesicoureteral reflux, kidney stones, urinary tract catheterization, ureteral stents or drainage procedures, pregnancy, neurogenic bladder and prostate disease in men. Diagnosis Laboratory examination Analysis of the urine may show signs of urinary tract infection. Specifically, the presence of nitrite and white blood cells on a urine test strip in patients with typical symptoms are sufficient for the diagnosis of pyelonephritis, and are an indication for empirical treatment. Blood tests such as a complete blood count may show neutrophilia. Microbiological culture of the urine, with or without blood cultures and antibiotic sensitivity testing are useful for establishing a formal diagnosis, and are considered mandatory. Imaging studies If a kidney stone is suspected, a kidneys, ureters, and bladder x-ray may assist in identifying radioopaque stones.

Where available, a noncontrast helical CT scan with 5 millimeter sections is the diagnostic modality of choice in the radiographic evaluation of suspected nephrolithiasis. All stones are detectable on CT scans except very rare stones composed of certain drug residues in the urine. In patients with recurrent ascending urinary tract infections, it may be necessary to exclude an anatomical abnormality, such as vesicoureteral reflux or polycystic kidney disease. Investigations used in this setting include kidney ultrasonography or voiding cystourethrography. CT scan or kidney ultrasonography is useful in the diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis; serial imaging may be useful for differentiating this condition from kidney cancer. Ultrasound findings that indicate pyelonephritis are enlargement of the kidney, edema in the renal sinus or parenchyma, bleeding, loss of corticomedullary differentiation, abscess formation, or an areas of poor blood flow on doppler ultrasound.
