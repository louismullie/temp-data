## Question

Is mechanical valve replacement a treatment for anemia of chronic disease?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether mechanical valve replacement is an appropriate or effective treatment for anemia of chronic disease, and under what circumstances valve surgery might affect anemia outcomes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and pathophysiology of anemia of chronic disease versus other anemias discussed in the provided sources. Then, I should verify what mechanical valves do to red blood cells and whether they treat or cause anemia. Next, I will review what evidence-based guidelines recommend for anemia management. After that, I need to check if any valve guidelines list anemia as an indication for valve replacement. Finally, I will synthesize when, if ever, valve intervention impacts anemia and conclude the clinical implications for true anemia of chronic disease.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entities. Anemia of chronic disease (also called anemia of inflammation) is driven by cytokine-mediated iron sequestration and impaired erythropoiesis; however, the supplied documents primarily address anemia of chronic kidney disease, where erythropoietin deficiency and iron-restricted erythropoiesis are central, and outline standard management principles such as ensuring iron repletion, using ESAs or HIF-PH inhibitors when indicated, and reserving transfusion for severe cases, which collectively do not include surgical valve replacement as therapy for anemia per se [^116QRdA2] [^112gMnEy] [^113ubhsj] [^114wAW69].

> Wait, let me verify what mechanical valves do to blood cells. Mechanical and other intracardiac prostheses can damage red blood cells via shear stress and paravalvular leak, leading to cardiac prosthesis-related hemolytic anemia; clinically evident hemolysis is uncommon with modern surgical valves (< 1%), although subclinical hemolysis remains frequent, and diagnostic criteria hinge on anemia with reticulocytosis, elevated LDH/unconjugated bilirubin, and low haptoglobin, which means mechanical valves are a cause of hemolysis, not a treatment for anemia of inflammation [^112fm7RW] [^113NUZ49] [^113vNEAk].

> Hold on, I should verify management strategies when prosthesis-related hemolysis is present. The literature emphasizes correcting the mechanical problem (e.g., eliminating paravalvular leak percutaneously or surgically) and using temporizing medical measures such as folate, iron, beta-blockers, and transfusion when needed; again, the valve/prosthesis is the driver of hemolysis, and interventions target the device complication rather than using a valve procedure to treat non-hemolytic anemia syndromes like anemia of chronic disease [^114kXtQe] [^112uZHwK] [^116Rd1sG].

> Next, I should review guideline-based anemia care to ensure I'm not missing a surgical indication. Kidney and general anemia guidelines consistently recommend iron repletion (oral or IV based on context), ESAs or HIF-PH inhibitors for erythropoietin deficiency, and transfusion for severe or acute needs; none propose valve surgery as anemia therapy, which supports that valve procedures are irrelevant to treating anemia of chronic disease unless the anemia is mechanically induced by a prosthesis or severe native valve lesion causing hemolysis [^116QRdA2] [^112gMnEy] [^113ubhsj] [^112xn7j2].

> I need to check whether any valve guideline lists anemia as a stand-alone indication for valve replacement. ACC/AHA and ESC/EACTS valve guidelines focus indications on symptomatic severe valvular disease and objective hemodynamic thresholds, prosthesis choice, and antithrombotic management; they do not list "anemia of chronic disease" as an indication for mechanical valve replacement, which reassures me that surgery is not recommended to treat ACD itself [^114duCXz] [^111sXfY6] [^111iLrwg].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could valve surgery improve anemia indirectly by reducing systemic inflammation and thus help anemia of chronic disease? That sounds plausible at first, but I should double-check the data. Observational work in aortic stenosis shows anemia is associated with worse outcomes and survival appears comparable after AVR between those with and without anemia, yet this reflects correction of severe valve pathology rather than surgery being a therapy for ACD; preoperative anemia is also a risk marker that teams often optimize medically but not an indication for the operation by itself [^111RScih] [^114wZ1Bx] [^116Li74B] [^112GJRPM].

> But wait, what if the anemia is truly hemolytic from a valve problem? In that special case, repairing the leak or replacing a dysfunctional prosthesis can resolve the hemolysis, and subclinical or clinical hemolysis has also been described around TAVR and other structural devices; still, that is targeted treatment of prosthesis- or lesion-induced hemolysis, not treatment of anemia of chronic disease, which remains an inflammatory-iron restriction process [^117T5SKa] [^114kXtQe] [^113NUZ49].

> I will now examine the appropriate evidence-based treatments for anemia syndromes likely to be conflated with ACD. For CKD-related anemia and iron-restricted states, optimizing iron status, then using ESAs or HIF-PH inhibitors as appropriate, is standard; in heart failure with iron deficiency, IV iron improves functional status and reduces hospitalizations, none of which require or suggest valve replacement as anemia therapy, reinforcing that mechanical valve surgery is not part of anemia-of-inflammation management [^116QRdA2] [^112gMnEy] [^113ubhsj] [^112S24Qs] [^114bLpfE].

> Final synthesis: Mechanical valve replacement is not a treatment for anemia of chronic disease; in fact, mechanical prostheses can provoke hemolysis, and when anemia is present, standard care follows iron repletion, ESAs or HIF-PH inhibitors when indicated, transfusion when necessary, and treating the underlying inflammatory condition; valve intervention only improves anemia when the anemia is caused by valve-related hemolysis or severe native valvular disease creating shear-related red cell destruction, not when anemia is due to chronic inflammatory pathways [^112fm7RW] [^114kXtQe] [^116QRdA2] [^112gMnEy] [^111RScih].

---

Mechanical valve replacement is **not indicated** to treat anemia of chronic disease (ACD). ACD is managed with iron therapy [^112xn7j2], ESAs [^112gMnEy], and treating the underlying cause, not valve surgery [^116QRdA2]. Mechanical valves can cause **hemolytic anemia** from shear stress or paravalvular leaks [^113NUZ49], potentially worsening anemia [^112fm7RW]. Valve replacement is only considered for **severe, refractory hemolysis due to prosthetic dysfunction** [^113NUZ49] [^114kXtQe], not for ACD, and **mechanical valves require lifelong anticoagulation** [^111sXfY6], increasing bleeding risk and complicating anemia management [^114tBgxo]; therefore, mechanical valve replacement is inappropriate for ACD and may worsen anemia.

---

## Pathophysiology of anemia of chronic disease

ACD is characterized by **impaired iron utilization, reduced erythropoietin production [^113ubhsj], and shortened red blood cell (RBC) lifespan** due to chronic inflammation [^116xKfSw]. Key mechanisms include:

- **Inflammatory cytokines**: Elevated IL-6 and TNF-α increase hepcidin, reducing iron availability for erythropoiesis [^116xKfSw].

- **Reduced erythropoietin**: Chronic inflammation suppresses erythropoietin production, impairing RBC production [^113ubhsj].

- **Shortened RBC lifespan**: Inflammation-induced oxidative stress and immune-mediated mechanisms shorten RBC survival [^116xKfSw].

---

## Mechanical valve replacement and anemia

Mechanical valve replacement is primarily indicated for severe valvular heart disease, not for anemia management [^114duCXz]. Mechanical valves can cause **hemolytic anemia** from shear stress, turbulence, and paravalvular leaks [^113NUZ49], which destroy RBCs and cause hemolysis [^112fm7RW].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for mechanical valve replacement as a treatment for anemia of chronic disease [^112xn7j2]. Instead, mechanical valves are associated with an increased risk of hemolytic anemia [^112fm7RW] and may exacerbate anemia in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions [^113NUZ49].

---

## Risks and complications

Mechanical valve replacement carries **significant risks and complications**, particularly for anemia management:

- **Hemolytic anemia**: Mechanical valves can cause hemolysis, worsening anemia [^113NUZ49].

- **Anticoagulation therapy**: Lifelong anticoagulation is required, increasing bleeding risk and complicating anemia management [^111sXfY6] [^113dva2u].

- **Surgical risks**: Valve replacement surgery carries risks of infection, thromboembolism, and prosthetic valve dysfunction [^114duCXz].

---

## Alternative treatments for anemia of chronic disease

Effective management of **anemia of chronic disease** involves addressing the underlying inflammatory condition and using medical therapies:

- **Iron supplementation**: Intravenous iron therapy [^112xn7j2] is recommended to correct iron deficiency [^115vsUu9] and improve anemia [^112gMnEy].

- **Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs)**: ESAs [^112gMnEy] are used to stimulate RBC production, particularly in chronic kidney disease-related anemia [^112xn7j2] [^112ijDTe].

- **Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs)**: Emerging oral therapies that stimulate endogenous erythropoietin production and improve iron utilization [^113ubhsj] [^114wAW69].

- **Treating underlying inflammation**: Addressing the underlying chronic inflammatory condition is essential for effective anemia management [^116xKfSw].

---

## Conclusion

Mechanical valve replacement is **not indicated** for the treatment of anemia of chronic disease. It may instead exacerbate anemia via hemolysis [^112fm7RW] and complicate management because lifelong anticoagulation is required [^111sXfY6]. Effective management focuses on medical therapies, including iron supplementation, ESAs, and treating the underlying inflammatory condition [^112xn7j2].

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^113NUZ49]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The incidence of hemolysis in patients with cardiac prostheses varies widely according to the device type and its indwelling time. Mechanical damage to red blood cells (RBCs) due to increased shear stress is the most widely accepted etiology of cardiac prosthesis-related hemolytic anemia (CPHA). However, causes of this increased shear stress are device- and disease-specific.

- **Hemolysis after open valve surgery**: Hemolytic anemia was a common complication of old-generation valves, occurring in up to 15% of surgical valves in the 1960s to 1970s. However, this incidence decreased to less than 1% with modern valve designs. In a study of 301 patients who underwent On-X mechanical valve replacement, clinical hemolysis at long-term occurred in 0% and 0.2% of patients who had aortic and mitral valve replacement, respectively. Several other studies confirmed the rarity of clinical hemolysis after valve replacement with contemporary prostheses. Nonetheless, subclinical hemolysis is not uncommon, occurring in 18% to 51% and in 5% to 10% of contemporary mechanical and tissue prostheses, respectively.

The main mechanism of hemolysis after surgical valve replacement is paravalvular leak (PVL), which may result from suture dehiscence due to heavy annular calcifications, endocarditis, chronic steroids, or suboptimal surgical techniques. Other less common etiologies of hemolysis related to surgical prostheses are listed in Table 1.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically in relation to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the UK Kidney Association 2025 guidelines recommend ensuring patients are iron replete to achieve and maintain the target hemoglobin range in patients receiving ESAs. The guidelines specify:

- **Percentage hypochromic red cells**: Less than 31 pg, ferritin, and transferrin saturation greater than 100 mcg/L and greater than 20% in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD or on peritoneal dialysis; and greater than 200 mcg/L in patients on hemodialysis.

- **Children with CKD on dialysis or not on ESAs**: Ferritin should be greater than 100 mcg/L.

- **Iron administration**: Consider administering iron when ferritin is less than 500 mcg/L and/or transferrin saturation is less than 30% to ensure iron repletion.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, and specifically with respect to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the 2025 guidelines from the UK Kidney Association recommend not initiating ESA therapy in the presence of absolute iron deficiency, defined as ferritin levels less than 100 mcg/L in non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (CKD) and less than 200 mcg/L in dialysis-dependent CKD, or functional iron deficiency, defined as transferrin saturation less than 20% with normal or elevated ferritin levels, until these conditions are corrected and anemia persists. It is advised to administer iron supplements prior to, or when initiating, ESAs.

### Canadian society of nephrology commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^114Rx8E2]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) 2012 clinical practice guideline for anemia management in patients with chronic kidney disease provides the structural and evidence base for the Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on this guideline's relevancy and application to the Canadian healthcare system. While in general agreement, we provide commentary on 11 of the 61 KDIGO guideline statements. Specifically, we agreed that a therapeutic trial of iron is appropriate in cases in which a reduction in erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) dosage or avoidance of ESA and transfusion is desired, transferrin saturations are > 30%, and ferritin concentrations are > 500 μg/L. However, we concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support an upper target or threshold for ferritin and transferrin saturation levels. We agree with the initiation of ESA treatment when hemoglobin (Hb) level is 90–100 g/L; however, we specifically state that an acceptable range for Hb level is 95–115 g/L, with a target of 100–110 g/L, and add caution to individualization above this range due to concerns regarding the safety of ESAs. We agree that ESAs should be used with considerable caution in patients with active malignancy, history of stroke, or history of malignancy, and we suggest initiating ESA therapy at Hb level of 90 g/L and to aim for a Hb level in the range of 90–105 g/L. The reader is encouraged to note the level of evidence and review the entire KDIGO anemia guideline to interpret the guideline statements and commentary appropriately.

### Effects of preoperative intravenous erythropoietin plus iron on outcome in anemic patients after cardiac valve replacement [^114wZ1Bx]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2012). Low credibility.

Preoperative anemia is a risk factor for postoperative morbidity and in-hospital mortality in cardiac surgery. However, it is not known whether treatment of anemia before cardiac surgery by administering recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO) plus iron improves postoperative outcomes and decreases red blood cell transfusions in these patients. In 1998, a collection of consecutive data for patients who underwent valve replacement was initiated, and the inclusion criterion was anemia. Treatment with rhEPO was given at a dose of 500 IU/kg/day every week for 4 weeks, with the fifth dose administered 48 hours before valve replacement. During each rhEPO session, patients received intravenous iron sucrose supplementation.

The intervention cohort (2006 to 2011) included 75 patients, and the observation cohort was composed of 59 patients who did not receive any treatment (1998 to 2005). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that administration of combined therapy was independently associated with decreased postoperative morbidity (odds ratio [OR] 0.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.03 to 0.59, p = 0.008) and in-hospital mortality (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.95, p = 0.04) after adjusting for logistic European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation score, type of intervention, time of cardiopulmonary bypass, and year of surgery. Individually, this treatment also decreased postoperative renal failure (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.88, p = 0.03). The rate of red blood cell transfusion decreased from 93% in the observation cohort to 67% in the intervention cohort, as did the days of hospitalization.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^117MSFZb]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The recognition of hemolytic anemia in patients with classic presentations is straightforward. However, cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia (CPHA) commonly presents with ambiguous symptoms and insidious onset, highlighting the need for a high index of suspicion. In a study of 381 patients who were referred for treatment of mitral paravalvular leak (PVL), of whom 40% had hemolysis, the mean time from index valve replacement to referral was 85.1 ± 115.6 months. Hence, in patients with cardiac prostheses who have unexplained anemia, a systematic stepwise approach to exclude or diagnose CPHA is warranted.

- **Algorithmic approach**: An algorithmic approach to a patient with suspected cardiac prosthesis-related hemolysis includes several diagnostic tools such as computed tomography angiogram (CTA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, left ventricular assist device (LVAD) evaluation, oral anticoagulation (OAC) management, transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).

This structured approach is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.

### Standard versus higher intensity anticoagulation for patients with mechanical aortic valve replacement and additional risk factors for thromboembolism [^112iLLNY]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

Guidelines recommend targeting an international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 to 3.5 for patients with mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR) and additional risk factors for thromboembolic events. Available literature supporting the higher intensity INR goal is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the association of standard and higher intensity anticoagulation on outcomes in this patient population. The Michigan Anticoagulation Quality Improvement Initiative database was used to identify patients with mechanical AVR and at least one additional risk factor. Patients were classified into two groups based on INR goal: standard-intensity (INR goal 2.5) or higher-intensity (INR goal 3.0). A Cox-proportional hazard model was used to calculate adjusted hazard ratios.

One hundred and forty-six patients were identified, of whom 110 (75.3%) received standard-intensity anticoagulation and 36 (24.7%) received higher intensity anticoagulation. Standard-intensity patients were older and more likely to be on aspirin. Atrial fibrillation was the most common additional risk factor for inclusion.

- **Primary outcome**: The primary outcome of thromboembolic events, bleeding, or all-cause death was 13.9 and 19.5/100-person-years in the standard-intensity and higher intensity groups, respectively (adjusted HR 2.58, 95% confidence interval 1.28 to 5.18).

Higher-intensity anticoagulation was significantly associated with any bleeding (adjusted HR 2.52, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 5.00), and there were few thromboembolic events across both groups (5 events total). These results challenge guideline recommendations.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline on anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^116kEQ6p]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

- **Guideline 2.2 - Treatment of anaemia with iron therapy: initiation of ESA and iron status**: We suggest that ESA therapy should not be initiated in the presence of absolute iron deficiency (ferritin < 100 microgram/L) until this is corrected and anaemia persists. In patients with functional iron deficiency, iron supplements should be given prior to or when initiating ESA therapy (2B). Low serum ferritin is a useful marker to diagnose absolute iron deficiency. Normal or high serum ferritin values (≥ 100 microgram/L) do not exclude iron deficiency, as it could be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation.

- **Guideline 2.3 - Treatment of anaemia with iron therapy: route of administration**: We suggest that oral iron will, in general, be sufficient to maintain and may be sufficient to attain the Hb within targets in ESA-treated CKD patients not yet requiring dialysis and in those on peritoneal dialysis (PD) (2B). For CKD patients not requiring haemodialysis, the choice between oral vs. parenteral iron depends on the severity of iron deficiency, previous response and side effects, the availability of venous access, and the need to initiate ESA therapy (2A). In contrast, most haemodialysis patients will require intravenous iron (2A).

When offering intravenous iron therapy to people not receiving in-centre haemodialysis, consider high dose, low frequency (HD/LF) IV iron as the treatment of choice for adults and young people when trying to achieve iron repletion, taking into account all of the following: the availability of venous access, preferences of the person with anaemia.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^116QRdA2]. KDIGO (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, particularly in the context of iron therapy, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend considering a trial of intravenous (IV) iron. Alternatively, a 1–3 month trial of oral iron therapy may be considered for patients with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD). This recommendation applies to adult patients with CKD and anemia who are not currently on iron or erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) therapy. The objective is to achieve an increase in hemoglobin concentration without starting ESA treatment when transferrin saturation is below 30%, and ferritin levels are below 500 ng/mL.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in CKD [^117WjGeS]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

The 2012 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) Clinical Practice Guideline for Anemia in Chronic Kidney Disease provides clinicians with comprehensive evidence-based recommendations to improve patient care. In this commentary, we review these recommendations and the underlying evidence. Most recommendations are well reasoned; however, for some, the evidence is unclear and recommendations require some qualification.

While the KDIGO guideline stresses the potential risks of intravenous iron therapy, withholding iron might have its own risks. The recommendation to avoid hemoglobin levels falling below 9 g/dL sets a lower bound of "acceptability" that may increase blood transfusion. Given the lack of research supporting the optimal transfusion strategy for end-stage renal disease patients, it is difficult to weigh the risks and benefits of red blood cell transfusion.

We find a paucity of evidence that hemoglobin concentration targeted between 11 and 11.5 g/dL is associated with a safety risk. Although the evidence that erythropoiesis-stimulating agent use improves patient quality of life is poor, it is possible that the instruments used to measure quality of life may not be well attuned to the needs of chronic kidney disease or dialysis patients. Our last section focuses specifically on the recommendations to treat anemia in children.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^115pRMGc]. KDIGO (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, particularly concerning erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend individualizing treatment for patients who remain hyporesponsive despite addressing treatable causes. It is important to consider the relative risks and benefits of the following:

- **Decline in hemoglobin concentration**: Evaluating the risk and monitoring closely.

- **Continuing ESA**: If necessary to maintain hemoglobin concentration, careful consideration of the required doses is vital.

- **Blood transfusions**: Considering transfusions when appropriate.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^113vNEAk]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

There is no single specific definition of hemolytic anemia. However, the diagnosis is usually established if three major criteria are present: (a) unexplained anemia, (b) signs of accelerated red blood cell (RBC) production in the bone marrow (e.g. high reticulocyte count), and (c) signs of RBC destruction (e.g. elevated unconjugated bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], low haptoglobin).

The term "sub-clinical hemolysis" is used to describe patients who meet the latter two criteria but do not have anemia. In these patients, the bone marrow adequately compensates for the hemolysis, maintaining normal hemoglobin levels. Prosthesis-related hemolytic anemia can be assumed if new hemolysis is diagnosed in patients with cardiac prostheses and/or mechanical assist devices, in the absence of other causes of hemolysis.

There is scant information on the prevalence and factors associated with preoperative anemia in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and whether it is associated with mortality. We sought to determine the prevalence and factors associated with preoperative anemia, in addition to the prognostic effects of the various levels of preoperative hemoglobin level on mortality in patients undergoing TAVI.

- **Methods and results**: A ten-center observational study encompassing 1,696 patients with aortic stenosis who underwent TAVI was conducted. Anemia was defined by the World Health Organization criteria (hemoglobin < 12.0 g/dL in women and < 13.0 g/dL in men). The prevalence of preoperative anemia was 57%.

- **Patient-related factors**: Associated with preoperative anemia were as follows (in descending order of odds ratio [95% confidence interval]): anemia-related medication (4.90 [3.08–7.80]), history of heart failure (1.77 [1.43–2.20]), male sex (1.69 [1.32–2.16]), mitral regurgitation grade ≥ III (1.61 [1.15–2.25]), history of malignancy (1.44 [1.03–2.09]), and peripheral vascular disease (1.33 [1.04–1.70]). The creatinine clearance was inversely associated with preoperative anemia (odds ratio: 0.92 [0.87–0.97]).

- **Multivariable analyses**: In multivariable analyses, preoperative anemia was not associated with 30-day mortality (1.72 [0.96–3.12]; P = 0.073) but showed the strongest association with 1-year mortality, with a hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 2.78 (1.60–4.82) in patients with hemoglobin < 10 g/dL. Patients with anemia received ≥ 1 blood transfusion twice as often.

### Severe hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure after mitral valve repair associated with non-endothelialization of artificial chordae tendinae: Case report [^1134iTSX]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Mechanical hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure are rare complications of mitral valve repair. We report a unique case of severe hemolytic anemia and severe acute renal failure after mitral valve repair using artificial chordae tendinae. Conservative therapy, including plasmapheresis and blood transfusion, was not effective.

The major cause of the mechanical hemolysis was mild mitral regurgitation originating from the center of the valve and striking the annuloplasty ring. The hemolytic anemia resolved gradually after the replacement of the mitral valve. Upon surgery, the new artificial chordae tendinae was found to be completely non-endothelialized. Non-endothelialization of artificial chordae tendinae may also play a role in the genesis of mechanical anemia.

The major cause of the mechanical hemolysis was mild mitral regurgitation originating from the center of the valve and striking the annuloplasty ring. Non-endothelialization of foreign materials might be another mechanism of hemolysis after mitral repair.

### Controversies in optimal anemia management: Conclusions from a Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) conference [^116xKfSw]. Kidney International (2021). Low credibility.

In chronic kidney disease, anemia and disordered iron homeostasis are prevalent and associated with significant adverse consequences. In 2012, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) issued an anemia guideline for managing the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease. Since then, new data have accrued from basic research, epidemiological studies, and randomized trials that warrant a re-examination of previous recommendations.

Therefore, in 2019, KDIGO decided to convene two Controversies Conferences to review the latest evidence, explore new and ongoing controversies, assess change implications for the KDIGO anemia guideline, and propose a research agenda. The first conference, described here, focused mainly on iron-related issues, including the contribution of disordered iron homeostasis to the anemia of chronic kidney disease, diagnostic challenges, available and emerging iron therapies, treatment targets, and patient outcomes. The second conference will discuss issues more specifically related to erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, including epoetins, and hypoxia-inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors.

Here we provide a concise overview of the consensus points and controversies resulting from the first conference and prioritize key questions that need to be answered by future research.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease [^114RozD9]. KDIGO (2012). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for anemia of chronic kidney disease, specifically with respect to iron therapy and iron deficiency, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend considering a trial of intravenous (IV) iron. Alternatively, a 1–3 month trial of oral iron therapy in patients with non-dialysis CKD could be considered. This is applicable for adult patients with CKD on ESA therapy, who are not receiving iron supplementation, if an increase in hemoglobin concentration or a decrease in ESA dose is desired. This recommendation is particularly relevant when transferrin saturation is below 30% and ferritin levels are below 500 ng/mL.

### Kidney disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines on anaemia management in chronic kidney disease: A European Renal Best Practice position statement [^116GXUQA]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2013). Low credibility.

Recently, the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) group produced comprehensive clinical practice guidelines for the management of anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. These guidelines addressed all important points related to anaemia management in CKD patients, including therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESA), iron therapy, ESA resistance, and blood transfusion use.

Because most guidelines were 'soft' rather than 'strong', and because global guidelines need to be adapted and implemented into the regional context where they are used, the European Renal Best Practice Advisory Board invited some of its members, along with other external experts in this field who were not participants in the KDIGO guidelines group, to participate in an anaemia working group. The goal was to examine and comment on the KDIGO documents in this position paper.

The group concentrated only on those guidelines considered worth amending or adapting. All guidelines not specifically mentioned are fully endorsed.

### UK kidney association clinical practice guideline: Update of anaemia of chronic kidney disease [^111CX2fR]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for anemia of chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend considering a transferrin saturation of less than 20% and a normal or elevated ferritin level to define functional iron deficiency in patients with non-dialysis-dependent CKD, those maintained on peritoneal dialysis, and those receiving hemodialysis. Recognize that normal or high serum ferritin values do not exclude iron deficiency, as it could be due to other causes such as infection or inflammation.

### Erythropoietic effects of vadadustat in patients with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease [^113ubhsj]. American Journal of Hematology (2022). High credibility.

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) develop anemia largely because of inappropriately low erythropoietin (EPO) production and insufficient iron availability to erythroid precursors. In four phase 3, randomized, open-label clinical trials in dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD and anemia, the hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor, vadadustat, was noninferior to the erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, darbepoetin alfa, in increasing and maintaining target hemoglobin concentrations.

Vadadustat increased the concentrations of serum EPO, the numbers of circulating erythrocytes, and the numbers of circulating reticulocytes. Achieved hemoglobin concentrations were similar in patients treated with either vadadustat or darbepoetin alfa. However, compared to patients receiving darbepoetin alfa, those receiving vadadustat had erythrocytes with increased mean corpuscular volume and mean corpuscular hemoglobin, while the red cell distribution width was decreased.

Increased serum transferrin concentrations, as measured by total iron-binding capacity, combined with stable serum iron concentrations, resulted in decreased transferrin saturation in patients randomized to vadadustat compared to those randomized to darbepoetin alfa. The decreases in transferrin saturation were associated with relatively greater declines in serum hepcidin and ferritin in patients receiving vadadustat than those receiving darbepoetin alfa.

### Vafseo [^114wAW69]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease in adults on dialysis**: The efficacy and safety of Vafseo given once daily for the treatment of anemia in adults with CKD on dialysis were demonstrated in two global, multi-center, randomized, active-controlled, non-inferiority, open-label trials involving a total of 3,923 patients with dialysis-dependent CKD (INNO2VATE-1 and INNO2VATE-2). Patients in each trial were randomized 1:1 to receive Vafseo with a starting dose of 300 mg once daily or darbepoetin alfa administered subcutaneously or intravenously as per the prescribing information for 52 weeks to assess the efficacy endpoints. Vafseo was titrated in increments of 150 mg up to 600 mg to achieve the hemoglobin target. After 52 weeks, patients continued study medication to assess long-term safety until the event-driven major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) endpoints were reached.

- **Efficacy and additional endpoints**: Efficacy in each study was based on the difference in mean change of hemoglobin from baseline to the primary evaluation period (Weeks 24 to 36). An additional efficacy endpoint was the difference in mean change of hemoglobin from baseline to the secondary evaluation period (Weeks 40 to 52). MACE was defined as all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and non-fatal stroke and was evaluated in both trials.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^112fm7RW]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Cardiac prosthesis‐related hemolytic anemia (CPHA) is a well-described phenomenon that may be under-recognized. First identified in the 1950s and 1960s among patients undergoing valve replacement with early generation surgical prostheses, CPHA is a potentially life-threatening complication. The incidence of clinically evident hemolysis after surgical valve replacement has decreased due to improved valve design and surgical techniques. However, interest in CPHA has recently increased as studies report varying rates of clinical and subclinical CPHA associated with mechanical circulatory support devices and transcatheter valvular interventions.

The management of CPHA is challenging because of its atypical presentation, lack of standardized definitions/classifications, and the scarcity of outcomes data on treatment strategies. This study aims to provide a contemporary overview of the literature on the incidence, mechanisms, and management strategies of hemolytic anemia associated with various cardiac prostheses.

### Summary of the KDIGO guideline on anemia and comment: reading between the (guide)line(s) [^112K6LAb]. Kidney International (2012). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) clinical practice guideline for anemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is designed to assist healthcare providers in treating CKD patients with anemia. A guideline is not intended to define a standard of care and should not be construed as one, nor should it be interpreted as prescribing an exclusive course of management. It is intended to provide information and to allow the practitioner to make an informed decision based on evidence and expert judgment. Every healthcare professional making use of these recommendations is responsible for evaluating the appropriateness of applying them in any particular clinical situation. Owing to the general nature of a guideline, it is sometimes difficult to translate it to an individual patient's condition. As the primary goal is to improve patient care, we have decided to focus on practical clinical aspects of the KDIGO anemia guideline.

### Use of breath carbon monoxide to measure the influence of prosthetic heart valves on erythrocyte survival [^116akd92]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

First-generation prosthetic heart valves commonly caused sufficient red blood cell (RBC) injury to induce hemolytic anemia. Although multiple studies have shown that new-generation valves are not associated with anemia, the extent to which these valves are injurious to RBCs is not known because RBC survival has not been measured in these subjects. Using a technique that utilizes breath carbon monoxide (CO) to quantify RBC turnover, this study measured RBC lifespan in 38 subjects with normally functioning, new-generation valves. Erythrocyte survival averaged 98.8 ± 23 and 103 ± 15 days, respectively, in 20 subjects with mechanical valves and 18 subjects with bioprosthetic valves (p > 0.05). However, these life spans were significantly (p < 0.01) less than those of healthy subjects (122 ± 23 days) and a group of elderly subjects with osteoarthritis (128 ± 26 days). The mean hemoglobin concentrations of the two groups of valve patients were within normal limits. In conclusion, new-generation heart valves commonly are associated with a small degree of hemolysis that is compensated for by increased RBC production.

### Severity of anaemia and association with all-cause mortality in patients with medically managed left-sided endocarditis [^1112E4Cs]. Heart (2022). High credibility.

To assess the prevalence and severity of anaemia in patients with left-sided infective endocarditis (IE) and its association with mortality, the study utilized the Partial Oral versus Intravenous Antibiotic Treatment of Endocarditis trial. In this trial, 400 patients with IE were randomized to receive either conventional or partial oral antibiotic treatment following the stabilization of infection, showing non-inferiority. Haemoglobin (Hgb) levels were measured at randomization. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality after 6 months and 3 years. Notably, patients who underwent valve surgery were excluded due to competing reasons for anaemia.

Out of 400 patients with IE, 248 (mean age 70.6 years, SD 11.1; 62 women, 25.0%) were medically managed. Among these, 37 patients (14.9%) had no anaemia, 139 (56.1%) had mild anaemia (Hgb < 8.1 mmol/L in men, Hgb < 7.5 mmol/L in women, and Hgb ≥ 6.2 mmol/L), and 72 (29.0%) had moderate to severe anaemia (Hgb < 6.2 mmol/L). Mortality rates for patients with no anaemia, mild anaemia, and moderate to severe anaemia were 2.7%, 3.6%, and 15.3% at the 6-month follow-up and 13.5%, 20.1%, and 34.7% at the 3-year follow-up, respectively. Moderate to severe anaemia was associated with higher mortality after 6 months (HR 4.81, 95% CI 1.78 to 13.0, p = 0.002) and after 3 years (HR 2.14, 95% CI 1.27 to 3.60, p = 0.004) and remained significant after multivariable adjustment.

In conclusion, moderate to severe anaemia was present in 29% of patients with medically treated IE after stabilization of infection and was independently associated with higher mortality within the following 3 years. Further investigations are warranted.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^112uZHwK]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

The management of cardiac prosthesis-related hemolysis involves determining the optimal treatment strategy based on the degree of hemolysis, clinical symptoms, severity of prosthetic dysfunction, and the predicted risk and success of surgical or percutaneous interventions.

- **Medical therapy**: Medical therapy with close follow-up is appropriate for patients with mild hemolysis that is not significantly interfering with quality of life.
	- **Folic acid**: Folate deficiency is common in chronic hemolysis due to increased consumption from accelerated erythropoiesis. In cases of persistent hemolysis, prophylactic oral folic acid supplementation is recommended to avoid substantial folate deficiency.
	- **Iron supplementation and blood transfusion**: Oral or intravenous iron supplements may be sufficient to treat stable degrees of hemolysis. However, blood transfusion is often needed in cases of severe hemolysis until mechanical corrective measures are undertaken.
	- **Beta-blockers**: Beta-blockers can reduce shear forces in patients with paravalvular leak (PVL)-related hemolysis by reducing blood pressure and heart rate. Oral beta-blockers have led to significant improvements in hemolytic anemia in several retrospective series.
	- **Pentoxifylline**: Pentoxifylline improves blood viscosity and erythrocyte deformability. Its use may subside mild hemolysis in patients with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) or mechanical valves. In a small randomized trial of 40 patients with cardiac prosthesis-related hemolytic anemia (CPHA), hemolysis indices improved in 60% of patients on pentoxifylline compared to 5% of patients in the placebo group.

### Aortic valve replacement as a trigger of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome [^116vqvx4]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Mechanical hemolysis is a frequent but usually harmless complication of aortic valve replacement. The most common reason is valvular leakage. This report presents atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) as an alternative cause of mechanical hemolysis after this procedure.

aHUS is a complement-mediated disease characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. It necessitates immediate specific treatment, including plasma exchange or complement inhibition, to avoid an adverse outcome. The present case identifies aortic valve replacement as a trigger of aHUS and shows that this disease must be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of hemolysis after valve surgery.

- **Guideline 3.9: Treatment of anaemia with ESA therapy - ESA dose adjustments**: We suggest that ESA doses should ideally be decreased rather than withheld when a downward adjustment of Hb level is desirable (2B).

- **Guideline 3.10: Treatment of anaemia with ESA therapy**: We suggest that ESA administration in ESA-dependent patients should continue during acute illness, surgical procedures, or any other cause of hospitalization, unless there is a clear contraindication such as accelerated hypertension (2B).

- **Guideline 3.11: Caution in prescribing ESA in certain CKD patient sub-groups**: We suggest exerting extreme caution while prescribing ESA therapy in CKD patients with a history of stroke or malignancy, particularly in those with active malignancy when cure is the anticipated outcome (2C).

- **Monitoring of therapy (guidelines 4.1–4.7)**:

- **Guideline 4.1: Monitoring of treatment - Hb during ESA therapy**: We suggest that Hb concentration should be monitored every 2–4 weeks in the correction phase and every 1–3 months for stable patients in the maintenance phase. More frequent monitoring will depend on clinical circumstances (2B).

- **Guideline 4.2: Monitoring of treatment - iron therapy**: We recommend regular monitoring of iron status (every 1–3 months) in patients receiving intravenous iron to avoid toxicity (2B). A serum ferritin consistently greater than 800 microgram/L with no evidence of inflammation (normal CRP) may be suggestive of iron overload (1B).

- **Guideline 4.3: Monitoring during intravenous iron administration**: We recommend that resuscitative medication and personnel train

### A randomized trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of vadadustat in patients with anemia associated with chronic kidney disease receiving hemodialysis [^112iouLV]. BMC Nephrology (2025). High credibility.

Anemia is a frequent complication in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Anemia may develop early in the course of CKD, but its severity increases with the decline of renal function. Although the pathogenesis of anemia in CKD is multifactorial, the deficiency of erythropoietin (EPO) production is a predominant cause. The kidneys are unable to secrete sufficient EPO to support erythropoiesis and maintain hemoglobin within normal ranges. The standard of care for the treatment of anemia in CKD is the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) alone or in combination with iron supplementation. However, ESAs are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular and thromboembolic events. Furthermore, ESAs require parenteral administration and refrigeration. Thus, oral treatment modalities for anemia associated with CKD may be beneficial.

Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (HIF-PHIs) are an oral treatment alternative for patients with CKD-related anemia. HIF-PHIs have been shown to stabilize HIF, a transcription factor that regulates hypoxia-sensitive genes, stimulating EPO production, resulting in increased red blood cell (RBC) production as well as improved iron uptake and utilization.

Vadadustat, an orally bioavailable HIF-PHI, is approved in 37 countries globally for the treatment of CKD-related anemia in dialysis-dependent (DD) patients. It has a starting dose of 300 mg once daily, with dose titration in increments or decrements of 150 mg within the range of 150 to 600 mg to achieve or maintain hemoglobin levels within the desired range.

### Evidence gaps in the era of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants [^113dva2u]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Valvular heart disease has a prevalence of 2.5% (any valve) in the United States and is equally distributed between men and women. Prosthetic heart valve replacement is recommended for many patients with severe valvular heart disease, and on average, 300,000 prosthetic heart valve replacements are performed every year worldwide, 100,000 of which are in North America. By 2050, the annual number of valve replacements is projected to be 850,000. Mechanical valves are more durable than bioprosthetic valves but typically require lifelong anticoagulation therapy. The use of vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) provides excellent protection against thromboembolic complications in patients with mechanical heart valves, but their use is bound by previously described drawbacks.

Although preclinical studies showed a potential role of non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) in the presence of a mechanical valve, in the RE‐ALIGN trial, dabigatran was associated with increased thromboembolic risk. Patients with severe mitral stenosis or mechanical valves were excluded from the major NOAC trials, and thus their results cannot be generalized in this distinct patient population. In vitro studies have demonstrated that dabigatran (1 μmol/L) and high‐dose rivaroxaban (300 ng/mL) were as effective as unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in preventing thrombus formation on mechanical heart valves. In porcine models of heterotopic mechanical valve implantation, dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been equally effective as enoxaparin in preventing thrombus formation.

### Do all hemolytic anemias that occur after mitral valve repair require surgical treatment [^1178qSqq]. Clinical Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

We report on a 29-year-old woman with severe hemolytic anemia following mitral valve annuloplasty. Although hemolysis due to a mechanical prosthetic mitral valve is well-recognized, hemolytic anemia associated with mitral valve repair is an uncommon condition. Reoperation may be considered if the patient has serious and persistent anemia. Although valve replacement is suggested as a unique intervention, it may not be the solution every time due to mechanical effects. Various mechanisms of hemolysis related to mitral valve repair have been suggested, but sufficient and precise data is not available. In this case, we aimed to emphasize whether all hemolytic anemias that occur after mitral valve repair require surgical treatment.

Hemolysis after transcatheter valve replacement

The incidence of hemolysis after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is unknown because routine surveys are not performed in these patients. Although clinical hemolysis is not commonly seen, subclinical hemolysis following TAVR may not be uncommon. In a study of 122 patients who had TAVR with balloon-expandable valves, subclinical hemolysis occurred in 15%. The strongest predictor of hemolysis was patient-prosthesis mismatch rather than the degree of paravalvular leak (PVL). This intriguing finding, which requires confirmation in additional studies, suggests that transcatheter (versus surgical) prostheses may be associated with less hemolysis due to their lower reported incidence of patient-prosthesis mismatch.

In another study of 64 TAVR patients, 37.5% had evidence of subclinical hemolysis 6 months after the procedure. Moderate to severe PVL and bicuspid valve morphology independently predicted hemolysis (represented in Figure 1 A, B), and hemolysis was associated with a fourfold increase in hospital readmissions at 1 year. Of note, 21% of patients had evidence of subclinical hemolysis before TAVR, supporting the notion that severe native aortic stenosis can lead to hemolysis due to flow acceleration across the stenotic valve. Other TAVR-specific mechanisms of prosthesis-related hemolytic anemia (CPAH) are related to the remaining native leaflets and their potential impact on red cell shear stress.

### Clinical practice guidelines for anemia in chronic kidney disease: Problems and solutions. A position statement from Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) [^116P9nkG]. Kidney International (2008). Low credibility.

The development of clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of anemia in chronic kidney disease has been instrumental in identifying and reducing variations in the use of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and iron replacement. Challenges to the effectiveness and safety of recommendations made in these guidelines were magnified when recent clinical trials showed no benefit or harm with respect to cardiovascular outcomes in subjects randomized to higher target hemoglobin levels. To address these concerns, Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) convened an international conference to examine the problems and shortcomings of existing anemia guidelines, which are a prime example of duplication of efforts to derive recommendations from a limited evidence base.

The meeting was attended by representatives of the major guideline-developing organizations, who agreed to avoid future duplicative efforts and to save resources in generating a common evidence report. This report's recommendations could then be prioritized and implemented locally. This is a report to the international nephrology community of the recommendations for and timeline of the next anemia guidelines. It has been reviewed by the conference participants and approved as a position statement by the KDIGO Board of Directors.

### Anaemia in patients with aortic stenosis: influence on long-term prognosis [^111RScih]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2015). Low credibility.

The prognostic implications of anaemia in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) remain unclear. Accordingly, the present study aimed to evaluate the prognostic implications of anaemia in AS patients before and after aortic valve replacement (AVR).

- **Methods and results**: A total of 856 AS patients (age 71 ± 12 years, 60.2% male, 47.4% severe AS) were included. The mean haemoglobin (Hb) level was 13.2 ± 1.8 g/dL, and the prevalence of anaemia (Hb < 13.0 g/dL for men, < 12.0 g/dL for women) was 32.0%. The prevalence of anaemia rose with increasing severity of AS (28.9% and 35.6% in moderate and severe AS, respectively, P = 0.048) and was independently associated with increased all-cause mortality in severe AS patients whilst under medical therapy [hazard ratio (HR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29–3.97, P = 0.005]. Similarly, each 1.0 g/dL decrease in Hb was independently associated with increased mortality risk at follow-up (HR 1.35, 95% CI 1.07–1.47, P = 0.006). However, after AVR surgery, severe AS patients who had anaemia had similar long-term survival as patients with normal Hb (log rank P = 0.19). When all AS patients were included and AVR surgery entered as a covariate, anaemia was still independently associated with increased all-cause mortality irrespective of the severity of AS.

- **Conclusions**: A high prevalence of anaemia in moderate and severe AS patients was observed, and its presence was independently associated with increased all-cause mortality. However, after AVR surgery, anaemic patients had similar survival rates as patients with normal Hb.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^112mXwaM]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

Refractory LVAD-related hemolysis: Intensification of antithrombotic therapy has the potential to improve or resolve hemolysis in the majority of LVAD patients. However, persistent hemolysis despite maximally tolerated anticoagulation is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of stroke and death. Hence, pump exchange through various surgical techniques, such as subxiphoid ± thoracotomy or redo sternotomy, should be considered early in these patients.

Occluder devices-induced hemolysis: Severe hemolysis that developed or worsened after transcatheter shunt closure is often due to the residual peri-device shunt. These residual shunts can often be ameliorated with additional occluder devices and/or intra-device coil deployment within the Nitinol cage of the occluder. However, replacement of the involved prosthesis with a different device or conversion to surgical repair is often required.

Regarding the medical management of chronic kidney disease, specifically in relation to anemia management, the KDIGO 2012 guidelines recommend considering a trial of IV iron therapy. Alternatively, a 1–3 month trial of oral iron therapy may be considered for patients with non-dialysis CKD. This applies to adult patients with CKD and anemia who are not receiving iron or ESA therapy. The trial should be considered if an increase in hemoglobin concentration without starting ESA treatment is desired, transferrin saturation is less than 30%, and ferritin is less than 500 ng/mL.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^117LNaap]. Clinical cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Hemolysis after transcatheter shunt closure**: New hemolysis requiring blood transfusion occurred in 1% to 2% of patients undergoing percutaneous PVL closure in two large registries in the United Kingdom and the United States, likely due to incomplete obliteration of the PVL. Higher profile devices (e.g. ventricular septal occluders) are more associated with hemolysis than the lower profile Amplatzer vascular plugs. Severe hemolysis has also been reported following percutaneous closure of septal defects and peri-MitraClip regurgitation, mostly due to residual peri-device shunt.

- **Illustrative case (Figure 2)**: Redo surgery for severe hemolysis following failed percutaneous paravalvular leak closure attempt. Panel A shows an Amplatzer vascular plug in place, but a residual leak is present. Panel B illustrates the removal of the Amplatzer vascular plug followed by patch repair of the leak. MV indicates the mitral valve, and arrows annotate the location of the paravalvular leak.

Regarding the medical management of anemia in chronic kidney disease, specifically concerning hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors (initiation), the UKKA 2025 guidelines recommend ensuring patients are iron replete to achieve and aim to maintain the target hemoglobin range in patients receiving ESAs.

- **Percentage hypochromic red cells**: < 2.5%, mean cell hemoglobin (MCH) > 31 pg, ferritin, and transferrin saturation > 100 mcg/L and > 20% in patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD or on peritoneal dialysis, and > 200 mcg/L in patients on hemodialysis.

- **Ferritin for children with CKD on dialysis**: Ferritin > 100 mcg/L for children with CKD on dialysis, as well as children with CKD not on ESAs.

- **Iron administration considerations**: Consider administering iron when ferritin is < 500 mcg/L and/or transferrin saturation < 30% to ensure iron repletion.

### Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in intermediate- and low-risk patients [^114osG9T]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). High credibility.

The 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association focused guideline update on the management of patients with valvular heart disease lowered the age cutoff above which a bioprosthetic valve is reasonable to 50 years, with a Class IIa recommendation. In patients under the age of 50 years, the guideline still recommends a mechanical valve unless the patient has a clear contraindication to anticoagulation.

There is, nonetheless, a trend toward increased use of bioprosthetic surgical valves even in patients under the age of 50 years, often driven by patient preference and the desire to avoid long-term anticoagulation. The availability of newer mechanical valves that can safely be maintained with lower-dose warfarin (target INR 1.5–2.0) and low-dose aspirin may convince more patients to select a mechanical prosthesis. Conversely, patients and physicians may feel more comfortable selecting a bioprosthesis because valve-in-valve TAVR is now an option if a surgical bioprosthesis fails in the future.

Irrespective of whether a mechanical valve or bioprosthesis is selected, aortic root enlargement surgery should be considered in patients with a small aortic annulus to prevent patient–prosthesis mismatch and facilitate TAVR valve-in-valve for the future.

### Severe hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure after mitral valve repair associated with non-endothelialization of artificial chordae tendinae: Case report [^114whHoZ]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Low credibility.

Mechanical hemolytic anemia and acute renal failure are rare complications of mitral valve repair.

- **Case presentation**: We report a unique case of severe hemolytic anemia and severe acute renal failure after mitral valve repair using artificial chordae tendinae. Conservative therapy, including plasmapheresis and blood transfusion, was not effective. The major cause of the mechanical hemolysis was mild mitral regurgitation originating from the center of the valve and striking the annuloplasty ring. The hemolytic anemia resolved gradually after the replacement of the mitral valve. The new artificial chordae tendinae were found to be completely non-endothelialized during surgery. Non-endothelialization of artificial chordae tendinae may also play a role in the genesis of mechanical anemia.

- **Conclusions**: The major cause of the mechanical hemolysis was mild mitral regurgitation originating from the center of the valve and striking the annuloplasty ring. Non-endothelialization of foreign materials might be another mechanism of hemolysis after mitral repair.

### Cardiac prostheses-related hemolytic anemia [^114kXtQe]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

- **Invasive management**: Invasive treatment is reserved for patients with severe symptomatic hemolysis despite maximal medical therapy. The specific invasive treatment differs according to the implicated cardiac prosthesis and the underlying mechanism of hemolysis.

- **Paravalvular leak repair**: The efficacy of transcatheter PVL repair in reducing heart failure symptoms and long-term mortality has been demonstrated in multiple studies. However, the literature on the role of transcatheter PVL correction in resolving hemolysis is scarce and conflicting. For example, Ruiz et al. reported a substantial decrease in the percentage of patients who required blood transfusions or erythropoietin injections after percutaneous PVL repair from 56% to 5%. On the contrary, in another study of 168 patients with PVL, blood transfusion requirements decreased only modestly after percutaneous repair from 34% to 21%. These inconsistencies may be related to variable definitions of hemolysis and the degree of PVL reduction achieved. Several studies have demonstrated that effective correction of hemolysis in these patients requires complete amelioration of the PVL. Nonetheless, this can be challenging due to various patient and device-specific reasons. Indeed, up to 30% of patients undergoing percutaneous PVL repair have more than mild residual PVL following intervention, even at centers of excellence. Among patients with significant residual leaks, a small percentage will experience worsening of hemolysis, often requiring further percutaneous or surgical device intervention.

### Iron replacement therapy: do we need new guidelines [^114JkrER]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Approximately one-third of the world's population suffers from anemia, with at least half of these cases attributed to iron deficiency. The introduction of new intravenous iron preparations over the last decade has raised uncertainty regarding their administration and whether oral therapy remains an appropriate and effective treatment.

Numerous guidelines are available, but none provide detailed information about therapeutic start and end points or how to best treat iron-deficiency anemia based on its underlying causes or in relation to concomitant or additional diseases.

The study identifies major issues to be considered in future guideline revisions for optimal iron replacement therapy. Key considerations include assessing the need for treatment, determining start and stop times, planning follow-up for relapse, and recommending appropriate or inappropriate dosages and therapy types. It also questions if certain patients should not be treated with iron replacement therapy.

### Meta-analysis of impact of anemia and hemoglobin level on survival after transcatheter aortic valve implantation [^112GJRPM]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Low credibility.

To establish evidence on whether baseline anemia and decreases in baseline hemoglobin levels affect survival after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), we performed a meta-analysis of available studies. Studies considered for inclusion met the following criteria: the design was a comparative study of patients with baseline anemia versus those without baseline anemia, or a cohort study investigating baseline anemia (as a dichotomous variable) or baseline hemoglobin levels (as a continuous variable) as one of the prognostic factors of mortality. The study population was patients who underwent TAVI, and main outcomes included early (30-day or in-hospital) or late (including early) all-cause mortality. Study-specific estimates were combined in the random-effects model. Our search identified 15 eligible studies, including a total of 11,657 TAVI patients.

Pooled analysis demonstrated that baseline anemia was associated with a statistically significant increase in early (p = 0.003) and midterm mortality (p < 0.0001), and that incremental decreases in baseline hemoglobin levels were associated with a statistically significant increase in midterm mortality (p < 0.00001). Pooled analysis of only adjusted estimates indicated that anemia was independently associated with a statistically significant increase in early (p = 0.02) and midterm mortality (p < 0.0001), and that incremental decreases in baseline hemoglobin levels were independently associated with a statistically significant increase in midterm mortality (p < 0.00001).

In conclusion, baseline anemia and lower baseline hemoglobin levels are important prognostic factors for mortality among patients undergoing TAVI.

### Choice of prosthetic heart valves: Update for the next generation [^112NDMcr]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

Intervention for valvular heart disease poses unique clinical challenges in cardiology because the diseases are of relatively low prevalence, the interventions do not lend themselves to randomized comparative trials, and important clinical end points are assessed only after decades of follow-up. In addition, continuing advances in prosthetic heart valve technology make follow-up a moving target because long-term data by definition are available only for older prostheses. Newer tissue and mechanical prostheses afford superior hemodynamics compared with their older counterparts, and data suggest that durability and patient mortality are superior with newer compared with older bioprostheses. Arbitrary cutoffs dictating valve choice based predominantly on patient age may not give appropriate weight to individual patient perspectives. In educating and counseling patients regarding choices in heart valve prostheses, the clinician should help the patient weigh the relative merits for the individual patient of projected mortality, valve durability, and requirement for anticoagulation, with associated freedom from re-operation, hemorrhagic and thromboembolic risk, and impact on lifestyle.
