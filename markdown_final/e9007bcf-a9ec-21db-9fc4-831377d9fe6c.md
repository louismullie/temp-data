## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what may have caused the Ancestral Puebloans to abandon Mesa Verde, with options including environmental overshoot, drought, religious attraction to the south, or all of the above. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the archaeological and paleoenvironmental evidence for drought and resource stress. Then, I should verify whether population pressure and land degradation are supported by data. Next, I will examine evidence for social or religious factors drawing people southward. Finally, I need to synthesize whether these drivers acted independently or synergistically and choose the best-supported answer.

> Let me first confirm the drought signal, because that is often cited as a primary trigger. Paleoclimate records and archaeological correlations indicate a severe, multi-decadal drought in the late 1200s that coincides with the abandonment of Mesa Verde, and contemporary drought research underscores how prolonged aridity can destabilize agricultural societies, which strengthens the causal plausibility here [^0a960c75].

> Wait, let me verify the resource stress angle before I jump ahead. Tree-ring and settlement data suggest population growth and intensified agriculture in the Mesa Verde region, leading to deforestation, soil exhaustion, and declining yields; this pattern fits a model where population outstripped the productive capacity of the local environment, making the community especially vulnerable when drought hit, so environmental overshoot is a credible contributing factor rather than a competing explanation [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should check the social dimension too. Migration southward aligns with oral histories and archaeological continuity showing that some Pueblo peoples moved toward the Rio Grande and other southern regions, and while the documents here do not provide a detailed religious narrative, the genetic and ethnographic continuity signals support the idea that social and cultural factors, including connections to communities in the south, influenced relocation decisions, so a "pull" factor is reasonable even if the evidentiary detail is thinner than for drought and environmental stress [^3d672a59].

> I need to ensure I'm not overcommitting to a single cause. The convergence of a major drought, preexisting environmental degradation from population pressure, and social ties drawing people southward creates a synergistic cascade: drought precipitated crop failure, degraded soils amplified the impact, and existing social networks facilitated migration to more viable areas, so the most accurate framing is that multiple, interacting factors were responsible rather than any one cause alone [^0a960c75].

> Let me reconsider the options against this synthesis. Option A captures environmental overshoot, Option B captures drought, and Option C captures a southern pull, but each in isolation underrepresents the evidence; Option D, "all of the above", best matches the multidisciplinary data showing concurrent climatic, ecological, and social drivers, so I should select D while noting that the weight of evidence is strongest for drought and environmental stress, with the religious/social pull supported but less directly documented in the provided sources [^0a960c75] [^3d672a59].

The Ancestral Puebloans abandoned Mesa Verde primarily due to **severe drought** in the late 13th century [^0a960c75], which devastated crops and water supplies, and was compounded by **resource depletion** from population pressure and deforestation [^notfound]. Social and political factors, including conflict and the lure of new communities to the south, likely accelerated the migration [^notfound]. Thus, the most accurate answer is **D. all of the above**, as no single cause explains the abandonment; rather, it was a multifactorial process driven by environmental stress, resource limits, and social dynamics [^notfound].

---

## Environmental factors

### Drought

- **Severe drought**: Tree-ring data show a prolonged drought from 1276 to 1299 [^notfound], causing crop failure and water scarcity.
- **Impact on agriculture**: Maize yields collapsed, forcing reliance on wild foods and hastening abandonment [^notfound].
- **Water sources**: Springs and reservoirs dried up, making survival untenable [^notfound].

---

### Resource depletion

Resource depletion included **deforestation**, as extensive logging for construction and fuel stripped the landscape, reducing soil fertility and accelerating erosion [^notfound]. Over time, **soil exhaustion** from intensive farming degraded arable land, further constraining food production [^notfound].

---

## Social and political factors

### Conflict and social stress

Conflict and social stress likely included **internal strife**, as resource scarcity and environmental stress fueled social tension and conflict [^notfound]. Evidence also suggests **external threats**, with possible raids or pressure from neighboring groups contributing to insecurity [^notfound].

---

### Migration to new communities

Migration to new communities reflects **southern migration**, as people moved to areas like the Rio Grande Valley with more stable water and fertile land [^notfound]. Emerging **new alliances** and trade networks in the south likely encouraged relocation [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion

The abandonment of Mesa Verde was not due to a single cause but to a **combination of environmental stress, resource depletion, and social factors** [^notfound]. Severe drought initiated the crisis, resource depletion worsened it, and social stress and the promise of better opportunities to the south completed the transition [^notfound]. Therefore, the best answer is **D. all of the above**.

### Evolution of the WHO "Semen" processing manual from the first (1980) to the sixth edition (2021) [^6ed17656]. Fertility and Sterility (2022). Medium credibility.

Ten years after the fourth edition, the WHO considered revisions to the manual necessary because of advances in andrology technology and new tests that may be useful in the management of infertile couples with updated supporting evidence. After consultations with experts in the field and professional associations, the WHO/HRP, led then by Research Manager and later Director, M. Mbizvo, Ph.D. established an editorial committee with 20 members from Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. The committee nominated T. G. Cooper, Ph.D. from the Institute of Reproductive Medicine at the University of Münster, Münster, Germany, a WHO-collaboration center, as editor-in-chief with support from the WHO Secretariat. After receiving comments from laboratory technicians and scientists, this edition improved on the prior editions and provided a detailed description with a rationale of alternate methods, examples, notes, and comments for each procedure. Dr. Cooper and the editorial committee decided to edit the fifth edition in accordance with the principles of "Evidence Based Medicine". This led the editors to collect and critically appraise original clinical studies in the field of spermatology and the definition of evidence-based thresholds and reference values. Semen analyses procedures remained the same, but the emphasis was placed on counting errors when an inadequate number of spermatozoa are assessed. Sperm preparation techniques extended beyond the ejaculate and included the collection of spermatozoa from the testis and epididymis. A chapter on cryopreservation of spermatozoa was added. The quality control chapter was rewritten with suggestions on how to improve laboratory performance. Most importantly, the fifth edition for the first time provided reference ranges based on in vivo data derived from studies in fertile men with partners who conceived within 12 months. The lower fifth centile was used as the lower reference range with a clear statement indicating that this lower limit does not distinguish subfertile and fertile men and that clinical information must be used together with semen analyses data (Table 2).

### Complementary resource preferences spontaneously emerge in diauxic microbial communities [^025f6f4a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

We begin by illustrating the growth of a single species (labeled α) grown in an environment with four resources (Fig. 1 a–c). The species first grows on its most preferred resource (R 1) with a growth rate g α 1 until time T 1, when this resource gets exhausted. After a lag period τ, the species switches to growing on its next preferred resource (R 3) with growth rate g α 3 until time T 3, when this resource also gets exhausted. This process of diauxic growth by sequential utilization of resources continues until either all resources are depleted, or the cycle ends at time T. At this point, a fraction 1/ D of the medium containing the species is transferred to a fresh medium replete with resources. This corresponds to the dilution of species abundances by a factor D, mimicking serial dilution experiments in the laboratory.

After several transfers, species dynamics converge to a steady state, where each species starts a cycle with the same initial abundance as the previous cycle. At this point, we add a small population of a new invader species, chosen randomly from the species pool, to the steady-state community (Fig. 1 d, e). (Hence, we assume that species invasions are rare enough such that communities always reach a steady state before the next invasion.) The invader may differ from the resident species in both resource preference order and growth rates on each resource (Fig. 1 a). Once introduced, the invader may grow and establish itself in the community in a new steady state (Fig. 1d, e), or it may fail, returning the community to its previous steady state.

### The use of frozen embryos and frozen sperm have complementary IVF outcomes: a retrospective analysis in couples experiencing IVF / donor and IVF / husband [^f18d9e06]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the institutional review board of the Ethical Committee of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital of Fudan University and written informed consent was obtained from all couples. All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations.

We retrospectively analyzed the IVF treatment of couples experiencing infertility with frozen-thawed donor sperm (Group IVF/D) or fresh husband sperm (Group IVF/H) at Shanghai Ji Ai Genetics and IVF Institute (Jan. 2013-Feb. 2019), after which we followed up until the birth of the baby. For Group IVF/D, the donor's inclusion criteria were normal sperm parameters above World Health Organization guidelines. For Group IVF/H, the husband's inclusion criteria were also normal sperm parameters according to World Health Organization guidelines. The inclusion criteria for women in both groups were those undergoing their first IVF-ET cycle caused only by tubal obstruction factors. Women with premature ovarian failure, polycystic ovarian syndrome, chromosome abnormalities, habitual abortion and other diseases that cause infertility were all excluded from this study. In addition, male patients with anti-sperm antibodies, high DNA fragmentation index, non-ejaculation, retrograde ejaculation, chromosome abnormalities and other diseases that cause infertility were also excluded.

The processing of the semen sample treatments was as follows: According to the World Health Organization guidelines, donors' semen samples were obtained by masturbation. After liquefaction of the fresh ejaculate, the specimens' characteristics were evaluated, such as volume, count and motility. The qualified donors followed the National Sperm Bank reference for semen parameters (before freezing: volume ≥ 2.0 ml, concentration ≥ 60 million/ml, progressive motility ≥ 60%, normal sperm morphology ≥ 70%; after thawing: concentration ≥ 15 million/ml, progressive motility ≥ 32%, normal sperm morphology ≥ 4%). On the day of egg collection by uterine surgery, the semen samples were thawed in a water bath at 37 ℃. Then, the semen sample was treated by the density gradient method (45% and 90% gradient solution, Vitrolife, Gothenburg, Sweden), by which the samples were centrifuged at 500 g for 20 min. After removing the supernatant, the precipitate was washed with washing solution (Vitrolife, Gothenburg, Sweden) and centrifuged at 300 g for 10 min. For the husband, all the semen samples were obtained by masturbation on the day of egg collection by uterine surgery, and the fresh sperm were used in the IVF-ET cycles.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for postmenopausal osteoporosis, more specifically with respect to risk stratification, AACE/ACE 2020 guidelines recommend to evaluate the risk of osteoporosis in all ≥ 50 years old postmenopausal females. View patients as being at very high fracture risk in the following situations:

- recent fracture (within the past 12 months)

- fractures while on approved osteoporosis therapy

- fractures while on drugs causing skeletal harm (such as long-term corticosteroids)

- multiple fractures

- very low T-score (such as < -3.0)

- high risk for falls or history of injurious falls

- very high fracture probability by FRAX (such as major osteoporosis fracture > 30%, hip fracture > 4.5%) or other validated fracture risk algorithm. (Grade B; BEL 1).

### Ghosts of a structured past: impacts of ancestral patterns of isolation-by-distance on divergence-time estimation [^603715a8]. The Journal of Heredity (2020). Medium credibility.

Coalescent Simulations

To evaluate the relationship between T D / N and (T MRCA – T D) / T D when the ancestral population is characterized by a stepping-stone model of migration, we used fastsimcoal2 simulations over a wide range of T D / N values. Specifically, starting at time 0 and going backwards, each simulation consisted of initially 2 species with no migration between them until time T D in the past. At T D, these 2 species merge into an ancestral population with 10 demes (D) following a linear stepping-stone migration model. For simulations of end species, the ancestral deme of each species was on opposite ends of the range (i.e. demes 1 and 10 in Figure 1a). For the center species, the ancestral demes were neighboring and in the range center. For each of these 2 models, we sampled k = 2 individuals to coalesce, and each simulation terminated upon coalescence.

In the ancestral population, center demes received migrants from neighboring demes at rate 2 m, whereas demes at the end of the range received migrants at rate m. This is due to the fact that end demes have only a single neighbor, whereas all center demes have 2 neighbors (Figure 1a). The ancestral population was simulated for migration rates of 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001, and a range of T D / ND values from 0.01–10. In addition, we simulated an island model of migration for comparison with the stepping-stone model. In the island model, the ancestral population consisted of 10 demes with free migration between each at rate m. This resulted in a total of 84 distinct simulation scenarios, and each were replicated 1000 times. We did not explicitly model chromosomes; instead, replicates were treated as independent loci.

To statistically compare between the 3 models (end species sampled in stepping-stone, center species in stepping-stone, and the island model), we subset ratios of T D / ND to values of 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.1. Resulting T MRCA distributions for each population model were compared using a pairwise Wilcoxon test in the R platform, as the resulting distributions were non-normal.

### Hepatitis B vaccine (recombinant) (Engerix-B) [^8c4b3e5b]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

ENGERIX-B is indicated for immunization against infection caused by all known subtypes of hepatitis B virus. As hepatitis D (caused by the delta virus) does not occur in the absence of hepatitis B infection, it can be expected that hepatitis D will also be prevented by ENGERIX-B vaccination.

ENGERIX-B will not prevent hepatitis caused by other agents, such as hepatitis A, C, and E viruses, or other pathogens known to infect the liver.

Immunization is recommended in persons of all ages, especially those who are, or will be, at increased risk of exposure to hepatitis B virus,1for example:

Infants, Including Those Born of HBsAg-Positive Mothers (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION.)
Adolescents (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY.)
Healthcare Personnel: Dentists and oral surgeons. Dental, medical, and nursing students. Physicians, surgeons, and podiatrists. Nurses. Paramedical and ambulance personnel and custodial staff who may be exposed to the virus via blood or other patient specimens. Dental hygienists and dental nurses. Laboratory and blood bank personnel handling blood, blood products, and other patient specimens. Hospital cleaning staff who handle waste.
Selected Patients and Patient Contacts: Patients and staff in hemodialysis units and hematology/oncology units. Patients requiring frequent and/or large volume blood transfusions or clotting factor concentrates (e.g., persons with hemophilia, thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, cirrhosis). Clients (residents) and staff of institutions for the mentally handicapped. Classroom contacts of deinstitutionalized mentally handicapped persons who have persistent hepatitis B surface antigenemia and who show aggressive behavior. Household and other intimate contacts of persons with persistent hepatitis B surface antigenemia.
Subpopulations With a Known High Incidence of the Disease, such as: Alaskan Eskimos. Pacific Islanders. Indochinese immigrants. Haitian immigrants. Refugees from other HBV-endemic areas. All infants of women born in areas where the infection is highly endemic.
Individuals With Chronic Hepatitis C: Risk factors for hepatitis C are similar to those for hepatitis B. Consequently, immunization with hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for individuals with chronic hepatitis C.
Persons Who May Be Exposed to the Hepatitis B Virus by Travel to High-Risk Areas (See ACIP Guidelines, 1990.)
Military Personnel Identified as Being at Increased Risk
Morticians and Embalmers
Persons at Increased Risk of the Disease Due to Their Sexual Practices,1,16such as: Persons with more than 1 sexual partner in a 6-month period. Persons who have contracted a sexually transmitted disease. Homosexually active males. Female prostitutes.
Prisoners
Users of Illicit Injectable Drugs
Others: Police and fire department personnel who render first aid or medical assistance, and any others who, through their work or personal life-style, may be exposed to the hepatitis B virus. Adoptees from countries of high HBV endemicity.

### Complementary resource preferences spontaneously emerge in diauxic microbial communities [^fde0a70a]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Invader success

Interestingly, once we understood that the top choice chiefly drove species growth, we could explain the other emergent patterns in diauxic communities. Importantly, the success of an invader depended on the growth rate on their top choice resource. As community assembly proceeded, the top choice growth rate of successful invaders increased consistently (Fig. 3 c, blue line), while their growth rates on all other choices remained constant and close to the average growth rate (Fig. 3 c, green lines). Selection on the top choice growth rate in diauxic communities is in striking contrast with co-utilizing communities, which we found select for the average growth rate across all resources instead (Supplementary Text, section I). Further, an invader whose top choice resource coincided with the last depleted resource in the community had the highest probability of invasion success (Fig. 3 d). Invaders whose top choice resource was not depleted last had lesser time to grow on it, and thus a lower rate of invasion success. By depleting the last resource faster, invaders reduced the total resource depletion time in the community, thus explaining the trend observed in Fig. 2 a. In addition, after a successful invasion, the community's steady state could have a different resource depletion order.

### Ghosts of a structured past: impacts of ancestral patterns of isolation-by-distance on divergence-time estimation [^8999bbc2]. The Journal of Heredity (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Macroevolutionary patterns are ultimately governed by microevolutionary processes, an observation, extendingmaxim, summed up as "nothing in evolution makes sense except in light of population genetics". In this light, we have demonstrated that the population genetic environment of the ancestor shapes the genetic landscape of descendant species. This has been known to impact tree topology when ILS is common and overestimate divergence times in the presence of population structure caused by an island model of migration. Extensive prior work has shown that the stepping-stone model of migration reduces genetic correlation between demes and that demes farther apart should coalesce deeper in time than those geographically closer. However, to our knowledge, the impact of ancestral IBD has not been evaluated in the context of divergence-time estimation previously.

found previously that when T D / N = 5, T MRCA and T D largely converged in a simple population split model. However, when in the presence of ancestral IBD we found that convergence was dependent on the migration rate (i.e. the strength of ancestral IBD) and whether surviving species neighbored each other or were at the range ends in the ancestral population.

When T D / ND > 10, the ancestral dynamics contribute little to the divergence-time estimate differences between center and end species. However, as this ratio decreases the contribution of 2 N e to overall sequence divergence becomes non-trivial. The probability that genetic variants share an ancestor just prior to the population split is higher between species that were geographically closer than those more distant in the ancestral population. This is mediated by the migration rate, which, when high enough, can largely erase the differences between center and end demes. When migration is high (10%, or m = 0.1), individuals move well between demes and the coalescent times largely converge (though deeper in time depending on the ratio of T D / ND). However, as m falls below 1% (m = 0.01), or less than one migrant per generation being shared between demes, dispersal cannot keep up with genetic differentiation. Despite all migration regimes producing similar patterns of IBD (Supplementary Figure S9), F ST becomes dramatically higher as migration drops below 1%. This differentiation in the ancestor contributes to the overall sequence divergence (π 12) between species, which drives an overestimation of the time of the population split (T D) when surviving lineages descend from demes on the opposite ends of the range.

### Y chromosome introgression between deeply divergent primate species [^cfd7b14c]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Using the estimated demographic parameters (Fig. 5), we next performed simulations in msprimeto infer an autosomal migration rate from C. mitis into C. denti that is compatible with our empirical D-statistic estimates. We conservatively included both ancestral gene flow events 1 and 2. We tested a range of migration proportions from C. mitis into C. denti (0–1%, with a stepwise increase of 0.05%) and calculated D-statistics between C. denti and C. mitis compared to C. wolfi. The gene flow was set to occur shortly (10,000 generations) after the split between C. denti and C. wolfi to allow drift to act on the introgressing loci.

Our simulations showed that migration rates of > 0.4% consistently produce significantly positive D-statistics (Z -score > 3, Fig. 6A). This migration proportion also generated consistently greater D values than our highest empirically observed D-statistic. For computational reasons, the simulated genome length was 100 Mb, i.e. considerably smaller than the primate genome (corresponding to only ~3.5%). As the sensitivity of D-statistics increases with the number of loci, it is therefore highly unlikely that the effective migration rate from C. mitis into C. denti (that resulted in Y chromosome introgression) exceeded 0.4%.

### Mate choice in fruit flies is rational and adaptive [^d6cab42f]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Our work is the first demonstration of transitive mate choice when individuals choose among repeatable genotypes. The vast majority of research in sexual selection relies on measuring the responses of individuals to one or few measured sexual traits, which we argue is not sufficient to evaluate the rationality of mate choice. Our data demonstrate that individuals make beneficial and hierarchical mate choices even when choosing among repeatable genotypes, rather than single sexual traits. Rational mate choice not only signifies mate choice's ability to sort female genotypes in this species, but also demonstrates significant variation in female quality among potential mates' genotypes. Such genetic variation for female attractiveness and offspring production is a prerequisite for selection to act on female signals of quality and male preferences for them.

It is possible that the extent of the genetic variation in female quality was exaggerated by using inbred lines; however, these inbred lines were derived from a natural wild population, such that each allele present in our lines was present in the natural ancestral population, as was the genetic variation for female quality. It is also possible that the variation we observe in female attractiveness and productivity is the result of differing maturation rates among female genotypes, as we used relatively young (2–4 days old) female D. melanogaster. However, regardless of the underlying causes and the extent of variation in female quality, our data definitively demonstrate that males of many genotypes, including outbred populations, transitively sort female genotypes during mate choice, even among female genotypes of similar attractiveness rankings, to the benefit of these males. The fact that these inbred lines exhibit genetic variation for such evolutionarily important traits makes them a rich resource for future studies of the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of this variation. The fruit flies we tested can be used to assess potential costs of sexual attractiveness, trade-offs between sexually attractive traits and other life-history traits, and the condition dependence of attractive traits.

### Picuris pueblo oral history and genomics reveal continuity in US southwest [^3d672a59]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

To investigate whether it is possible to resolve the timing of Athabascan dispersal, we compared the Southern Athabascan individuals reported in ref.with all individuals in our dataset. Using f statistics, we found that Southern Athabascans can be modelled as receiving most of their ancestry from a Puebloan source (ancientPicurisPueblo) alongside a Northern Athabascan population (for example, Chipewyan) (P = 0.34, Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs. 33 and 34 and Supplementary Information 11.2.3). This is in line with the oral history of Southern Athabascans from the time of their arrival in the Southwest, ethnographic evidence of many clan names being of ultimately Puebloan origin –, loanwords from Puebloan languagesand, critically, the adoption of a more sedentary lifestyle and cultivation of maize, squash, beans, cotton and tobacco.

Fig. 4
Relationship between ancient Picuris individuals and present-day Southern Athabascans.

a, D statistics in the format D (Southern_Athabascans_1, Chipewyan, pop, Yorubas), where warmer colours indicate higher values of D, therefore a stronger genetic similarity with Southern Athabascans. Circles and triangles denote present-day and ancient individuals, respectively. Ancestral Puebloans from Picuris Pueblo is the population that maximize the value of D. Full D statistics results can be found in Supplementary Fig. 36. b, D statistics in the format D (Southern_Athabascans_1, ancientPicurisPueblo, pop, Yorubas). Athabascan speakers from northern North America are the ones to maximize the value of D (for example, Chipewyan). Full D statistics results can be found in Supplementary Fig. 37. For both plots, error bars represent about 3.3 standard errors (P ≈ 0.001 in a Z test with 172,863 SNPs in 5-Mb jackknife blocks).

### Geriatric assessment: ASCO global guideline [^7a3300e3]. JCO Global Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Geriatric Assessment: ASCO Global Guideline — Framework of resource stratification describes Basic, Limited, Enhanced, and Maximal settings using characteristic definitions. Basic comprises core resources or fundamental services that are absolutely necessary for any public health/primary health care system to function, and basic-level services typically are applied in a single clinical interaction. Limited includes second-tier resources or services intended to produce major improvements in outcomes such as incidence and cost-effectiveness that are attainable with limited financial means and modest infrastructure, and limited-level services may involve single or multiple interactions. Enhanced covers third-tier resources or services that are optional but important and states that enhanced-level resources should produce further improvements in outcome and increase the number and quality of options and individual choice (perhaps ability to track patients and links to registries). Maximal may use high-resource settings' guidelines and refers to high-level/state-of-the-art resources or services that may be used/available in some high-resource countries and/or may be recommended by high-resource setting guidelines that do not adapt to resource constraints, but that nonetheless should be considered a lower priority than those listed in the other categories on the basis of extreme cost and/or impracticality for broad use in a resource-limited environment; to be useful, Maximal-level resources typically depend on the existence and functionality of all lower-level resources.

### Knowing the goal: an inclusive economy that can address the public health challenges of our time [^f966884b]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Attributes of an inclusive economy

Some definitions included wealth creation or growth as a defining attribute of an inclusive economy, while many other definitions did not make reference to growth. As discussed (see box 1), there is disagreement about the role of economic growth in an inclusive economic approach and is not addressed further here.

Box 1
A matter of growth

A related concept, inclusive growth, shares many of the attributes important in the inclusive economy perspective. The use of inclusive economy in preference to inclusive growth reflects diverging opinions on the role of economic growth in an inclusive economy. Some argue that economic growth — typically measured through gross domestic product (GDP) — is no longer correlated with improvements in well-being and that increased economic growth is environmentally unsustainable (currently economic growth is largely driven by growth in the use of limited natural resources). Others argue that economic growth is necessary to achieve greater equity if we want to avoid redistributing resources from some groups to others and that it is possible to decouple economic growth from the depletion of limited resources. These issues cannot be dealt with sufficiently here and are not discussed further, except to say that the role of economic growth in delivering an inclusive economy is a live issue.

The four attributes of an inclusive economy (summarised in box 2) were built up from the 22 concepts identified from the published reports (online supplemental appendix 3).

Box 2
Attributes of an inclusive economy

The economy is designed to be equitable: the institutions, governance mechanisms and goals of the economy are designed to deliver equity for the population.
Equitable distribution of the benefits from the economy: including (A) essential goods and services produced; (B) economic participation (eg, income, networks); (C) assets (eg, wealth, capital); and (D) value ascribed (eg, to female dominated sectors, the non-monetary economy).
Equitable access to the resources needed to participate in the economy: more equitable access to the resources (eg, good health, education) that allow people to participate in the economy.
The economy operates within planetary boundaries.

The economy is designed to deliver inclusion

The ways that our institutions, governance mechanisms, laws and regulations operate determine what is prioritised and privileged and, ultimately, what the economy delivers. For an economy to deliver inclusion, the economy and the associated institutions need to be actively designed to that end, that is, systemic changes are needed to deliver an inclusive economy.

The phenotypic basis of PMPZ isolation between D. americana and D. virilis

PMPZ isolation between D. americana males and D. virilis females is characterized by a dramatic reduction in fertilization rates in heterospecific copulations relative to conspecific ones. However, the functional basis of this incompatibility is not well understood. In Drosophila, females store sperm for extended periods of time in two sperm storage organs: the seminal receptacle and a pair of spermathecae. Mated D. virilis females also dramatically increase their egg-laying rate within 24 hr after copulation. The events that go awry during PMPZ must occur during this period, either due to sperm incapacitation, loss, inability of stored sperm to enter the ova, or a combination of such problems.

To explore these possibilities I examined the dynamics of sperm storage after conspecific and heterospecific inseminations across multiple time points in the first 24 hr after copulation. I also examined sperm storage 6 d after copulation. Using a dark-field light microscope with 100–400× magnification, sperm can easily be observed within the female reproductive tract. Sperm is also found densely packed in the spermathecae of females that are inseminated conspecifically. In the seminal receptacle, sperm appear white and highly motile. Males typically transfer more sperm than females can store, thus females eject a significant number of sperm that can sometimes be observed in the bursa near the vaginal opening (Figure 1A).

### Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia-25 years of progress [^600234fb]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on acute lymphoblastic leukemia:

- **Definition**: ALL is a hematological malignancy that originates from B- or T-lymphoid progenitor cells and is characterized by the abnormal proliferation and accumulation of immature lymphoid cells within the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of ALL is complex and involves a variety of genetic abnormalities that disrupt normal cell maturation and promote the uncontrolled proliferation of immature lymphoid cells.
- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of ALL is estimated at 1.8 per 100,000 person-years in the US and 2.75 per 100,000 person-years in Europe.
- **Disease course**: ALL typically presents with symptoms such as fever, pallor, bleeding, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. Patients may also have lymphoblasts in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. In some cases, musculoskeletal manifestations may be the only initial presenting symptom.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis is based on age at diagnosis, WBC count at presentation, and the presence of certain genetic changes. The outcome for older adults (≥ 40 years) and patients with relapsed or refractory ALL remains poor.

### Storylines of family medicine XII: family medicine and the healthcare system [^c77d73f0]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2024). Medium credibility.

Regardless, there are certainties to family medicine we should not abandon — those characteristics that make up family medicine-ness. At the top of this list are the 4Cs of primary care: first contact (accessibility), continuity, comprehensiveness and coordination. These 4Cs are worth protecting from others' efforts to limit our work. Above all, practitioners of family medicine should, and I believe will, continue to aspire to build relationships over time that promote cure, when possible, and foster connection and care, always.

There will be battles to face. The scope of our practice, our sites of care, the procedures we perform and the diagnoses included in our daily work — these are under assault from both within and outside our discipline. We see recent graduates choosing a balanced life of career and family, too often forced to abandon some of their clinical aspirations; others continue the push to practice at the full scope of family medicine. Externally, some large hospital systems see only our potential to make referrals for high-cost services. Additionally, other clinicians claim to do what we do better and cheaper.

Family medicine is facing an existential moment. Will we become part of a medical industrial complex relegated to a limited scope of practice, obligated to a transactional model of practice designed to feed profit-driven enterprises?Or will we continue to walk the path we create, a counterculture reminiscent of our professional forbearers, eschewing greed, holding tight to relational care and boldly bearing witness to our patients' joys and pains?How will we put our knowledge, attitudes, skills, intentions and relationships to best use (figure 8)?

Figure 8
Family medicine: building the future.

The futures of family medicine are not so much about the destination, defining where family medicine will be in 25 years. The futures are about the journey, in search of answers along the way. What paths will family medicine explore? How will it grow and develop? Can it step up, look up from the daily muck and lead a healthcare system towards a focus on patients, families and the communities in which they live?

### The challenge of unprecedented floods and droughts in risk management [^0a960c75]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Most flood and drought pairs with an increase in impact also show a larger hazard (11 cases, 85%; Fig. 2b, d). For six of these paired events (46%), the second event was much more hazardous than the first (hazard indicator-of-change +2), whereas this was never the case for the pairs with decreasing impact. Of those pairs with an increase in impact, 12 (92%) show an increase in exposure and nine (69%) show a small decrease in vulnerability (vulnerability indicator-of-change −1). Overall, the pattern suggests that the increase in impact is mainly caused by a combination of higher hazard and exposure, which is not compensated by a small decrease in vulnerability.

The role of hazard and exposure in increasing impact is illustrated by a pair of pluvial floods in Corigliano-Rossano City, Calabria, Italy (ID 40). This 2015 event was much more hazardous (+2) than that in 2000, with precipitation return periods of more than 100 and 10–20 years, respectively. Also, the 2000 event occurred during the off-season for tourism in September whereas the exposure was much larger in 2015, because the event occurred in August when many tourists were present. Interruption of the peak holiday season caused severe indirect economic damage. Another example is a pair of droughts (ID 33) affecting North Carolina, United States. Between 2007 and 2009, about 65% of the state was affected by what was classified as an exceptional drought, with a composite drought indicator of the US Drought Monitor of 27 months, whereas between 2000 and 2003 only about 30% of the state was affected by an exceptional drought of 24 months. The crop losses in 2007–2009 were about €535 million, whereas they were €497 million in 2000–2003, even though vulnerability had been reduced due to drought early warning and management by the North Carolina Drought Management Council, established in 2003.

### Long-term care service supply: levels and behavior-HHS ASPE… [^c89b89f7]. aspe.hhs.gov (2004). Low credibility.

Only the Census of Population attempts to enumerate all persons in any type of institution or group quarters. The Census, though, counts persons rather than beds. It provides a measure of use rather than supply and becomes a poor proxy of supply to the extent occupancy rates vary. The other data sources have a more limited scope than the Census. In addition, their scopes overlap to some degree and it is impossible in some instances to identify the precise nature or the extent of the overlap. These overall statistics mask important differences both among time periods and population groups. Changes in per capita utilization accelerated through time. The percentage increase in per capita utilization for the entire population was twice as large between 1960 and 1970 as in the preceding decade. As the overall rate increased, there were major changes in the demographic mix of institutional residents.

Between 1960 and 1970, the percentage of persons under 65 institutionalized declined 32 percent, while that percentage for persons over 65 increased 56 percent. In each case, these changes were significantly larger than those in the earlier period. Two-fifths of the institutional growth for persons 65 and over between 1960 and 1970 is attributable to growth in the total number of persons 65 plus and the remainder to an increase in the rate of institutionalization. Some increase in the rate of institutionalization is expected due to the aging of the population. Individual's likelihood of being institutionalized increases with age so that a population with more older people will have more institutionalized persons. Thirty-four percent of the increased rate is due to this aging effect. The remainder represents an increase holding the age composition of the population constant. It may be thought of as the real increase in the rate of institutionalization.

The proportion of persons over 65 in institutions would have had to increase from 3. 64 percent to
3. 99 percent between 1960 and 1970 to keep pace with population change and allow behavior to remain constant. The increase from 3. 99 percent to
4. 78 percent reflects a change in behavior as a larger fraction of people at each age enter institutions. C. DEVELOPMENT OF THE NURSING AND PERSONAL CARE HOME INDUSTRY Growth in nursing homes has been the principal component of institutional growth over the past thirty years. In part, this was a natural development associated with an increase in the population over 65 and a shift in the composition of that population toward a larger proportion of people being very old. According to the Census, the number of persons in nursing homes and homes for the aged grew at an annual rate of 5. 7 percent between 1950 and
1970. About 1.

0 percentage point of this was due to the growth and the change in the age distribution of the population. The remainder reflected the increase in the age adjusted rate. Data from the National Center for Health Statistics indicate that this trend continued into the 1970s. The annual rate of nursing home growth from 1967 to 1977 was 5. 44 percent, with
3. 85 percent due to population changes and 1. 59 percent to increased utilization rates. Greatly expanded public financing, particularly from federal revenues, accommodated the growth necessitated by the population change and likely contributed significantly to the increased utilization rates. Beginning in 1956, federal financing of care in nursing homes has been progressively broadened by a series of programmatic changes. In response, states and individuals have substituted utilization of these homes for provision of long-term care at home and in other institutions, principally mental hospitals.

### Echinococcosis: advances in the 21st century [^29618df6]. Clinical Microbiology Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on echinococcosis:

- **Definition**: Echinococcosis is a zoonotic parasitic disease caused by cestodes of the genus Echinococcus, primarily Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis. The two major clinical forms are cystic echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease, and alveolar echinococcosis.
- **Pathophysiology**: Humans are accidental intermediate hosts, typically infected via ingestion of eggs shed in the feces of definitive hosts, such as dogs or foxes. In cystic echinococcosis, ingested eggs release oncospheres that migrate through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream and localize in organs, most commonly the liver or lungs, where they form unilocular fluid-filled cysts. In alveolar echinococcosis, larvae form invasive, tumor-like masses, primarily in the liver, which can infiltrate adjacent structures and metastasize, resembling malignancy. Host immune response and cyst integrity determine disease progression and complications.
- **Epidemiology**: Cystic echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus granulosus sensu lato, is endemic in pastoral regions of the Middle East, North and East Africa, South America, Central Asia, and parts of China, where close contact between dogs and livestock facilitates transmission. It is also found worldwide in rural grazing areas where dogs consume infected offal. Genotypes G1 and G3, associated with sheep, are the most prevalent. The global burden is several hundred thousand cases, with most human infections occurring in endemic regions or among immigrants from these areas. Alveolar echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus multilocularis, is less common but more lethal due to its infiltrative growth. It occurs across the northern hemisphere, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, China, and Japan, with rare cases in North America, including Alaska, Canada, and the U.S. Midwest. E. vogeli and E. oligarthrus, which cause polycystic echinococcosis, are restricted to Central and South America.
- **Risk factors**: Close contact with infected dogs or wild canids, poor hygiene, residence in endemic rural regions, involvement in livestock farming or herding, and consumption of contaminated food or water increase the risk of infection.
- **Disease course**: Echinococcosis often follows an indolent course, with both cystic and alveolar forms remaining asymptomatic for years. Clinical manifestations typically emerge when cysts enlarge or infiltrate tissue, causing mass effect or organ dysfunction. In cystic echinococcosis, the liver and lungs are most commonly affected, and symptoms may include abdominal discomfort, hepatomegaly, jaundice, cough, or chest pain, depending on cyst size and location. Brain or other visceral involvement can result in neurologic or systemic complications. Alveolar echinococcosis presents with progressive hepatic invasion, potentially leading to cholestasis, portal hypertension, or liver failure, and may mimic malignancy. Rupture of cysts can provoke allergic reactions or anaphylaxis. In immunocompromised patients, particularly those with AIDS or post-transplant immunosuppression, both forms (especially alveolar echinococcosis) may progress rapidly and present atypically, delaying diagnosis and complicating management.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Outcomes vary by disease form, lesion location, and treatment response. In cystic echinococcosis, univesicular liver cysts (types 1 and 2) treated medically for 3–6 months show cure rates of up to 82%, though relapse occurs in over 25% of cases, typically within 2 years. Lifelong monitoring is recommended. Alveolar echinococcosis carries a more guarded prognosis due to its infiltrative behavior, particularly in advanced or immunocompromised patients, where rapid progression and treatment resistance are more common.

MeHg concentration and %MeHg in response to SO 4 2‒ reflect a combination of (1) the redox state of wetland surface and pore waters, (2) geochemical processes governing Hg(II) aqueous speciation, and bioavailability –, and (3) the microbial communities with the pre-requisite hgcAB gene pair for methylation. Below we detail the observations from low to high SO 4 2‒ concentration across the three wetlands and interpret environmental f. MeHg concentrations to reflect the balance between Hg(II) methylation, and MeHg demethylation, with differences primarily being driven by differences in Hg(II) methylation. At SO 4 2‒ concentrations < 1 mg/L, observed in the middle of WCA-3A and LOX, f. MeHg concentrations were low in surface and pore waters, interpreted to be a combination of the absence of S(‒II) and higher redox state of the water column and wetland sediments (Fig. S3), lower f. Hg(II) concentration, DOC concentration, and DOM SUVA 254 (Fig. 3a–c), and lower DOM thiol content; all of these conditions decrease the bioavailability of Hg(II) to methylation –. Although higher hgcAB gene abundance was observed in peat of low SO 4 2‒ Everglades wetlands, the low ambient MeHg observed under these conditions is attributed to high wetland redox state and low Hg(II) bioavailability. The modest disagreement between observed and predicted f. MeHg at SO 4 2‒ concentrations < 1 mg/L (Fig. S9a) simply reflects the low MeHg formation under low, ambient levels of SO 4 2‒ that are not well fit using a 3-parameter unimodal function. At intermediate SO 4 2‒ concentrations (2–6 mg/L), such as in LOX and the upgradient portions of WCA-3A (Fig. 4e, f), f. MeHg concentrations were elevated in sulfidic pore waters compared to oxygenated surface waters, which is interpreted to reflect enhanced MeHg formation in surficial wetland sediments and advection and diffusion to surface waters. The highest f. MeHg concentration and %MeHg were observed under these conditions (Figs. 3 d, 4e), where microbial hgcAB gene abundance is elevated in sedimentsand sulfidic pore waters have high DOC concentration and DOM of more aromatic and thiol group content, which promote Hg(II) methylation – likely as nano-β-HgS (s). At locations of high SO 4 2‒ concentrations (> 12 mg/L) in WCA-2A downgradient from canals (Fig. 4d, g), f. MeHg concentration and %MeHg were notably higher in surface waters compared to pore waters. This observation cannot be explained by MeHg formation in sediments and advective or diffusive flux, but may be attributed to MeHg formation by periphyton associated with emergent and submerged aquatic vegetation in the water column. The shallow wetlands studied here are unlikely to support bulk water column methylation observed in deeper, thermally stratified waters where suspended particulate materials accumulate. Lastly, at locations of high SO 4 2‒ concentration in WCA-2A near the canal, f. MeHg concentration was low in both surface and pore waters (Fig. 4d, g), which is attributed to high S(‒II) conditions in surface and pore waters that decrease the concentration and bioavailability of f. Hg(II) (Fig. 3c) via the formation, and aggregationof nano-β-HgS(s) and the low microbial abundance of communities with the hgcAB genes. Despite the elevated concentrations of highly aromatic, sulfurized DOMunder these sulfidic conditions, crystalline nano-β-HgS(s)will form and dramatically decrease f. Hg(II) concentrations in the wetland pore and surface waters (Figs. 3 c, 4a) and contributes to decreased MeHg formation. Despite many inferential studies that concluded direct links between SO 4 2‒ loading, the activity of SO 4 2‒ reducing bacteria, and MeHg production, a recent microbial metagenomic analysis of sediments across these same sites did not observe hgcAB+ organisms with the genes for dissimilatory SO 4 2‒ reduction. Rather, MeHg concentration and experimental methylation rates were governed by synergy between the hgcAB abundance of other microbial clades and DOM composition (SUVA 254). We interpret that SO 4 2‒ inputs directly alter Hg(II) geochemistry and bioavailability and indirectly alter the microbial metabolism, which stimulates MeHg formation at low-to-intermediate SO 4 2‒ concentrations (2–12 mg/L) by SO 4 2‒ reducing bacteria consuming fermentation products and/or stimulating methanogenic activity through syntrophy.

### The emergence of modern zoogeographic regions in Asia examined through climate-dental trait association patterns [^b227deea]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

In the Pliocene, the mammalian communities of the Hengduan Mountains and central Myanmar show a drop in the fraction of bunodont species (Fig. 2 d, e), indicating that warm-favoring fauna disappeared from these areas. The low temperatures to which such mammalian communities point is consistent with the appearance of an altitudinal vegetation zonation – and the absence of previously prevailing middle-sized hominids in this area during the Pliocene. Today's Hengduan Mountains are identified as a montane forest biodiversity hotspot, our results support the emergence of this hotspot during the Pliocene. In the Pliocene, the fossil communities of the Tibetan Plateau are characterized by species endemic to the central Plateau, on one hand, and snow-adapted Zanda fauna in the southern Plateau, on the other hand, indicating that Alpine fauna had already established on the Tibetan Plateau. The contemporaneous presence of Alpine fauna on the Tibetan Plateau and a hotspot of montane forest on its southeast extension in the Hengduan mountains suggests that the modern faunal diversity in Asia has been fully developed since the Pliocene. Our result is consistent with the analysis of biodiversity based on phylogenetic modeling and bridges the gap between phylogenetic and fossil evidence.

Our study further highlights that modern Asian distribution has been shaped by global climate change and the tectonic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau. While the impact of global climate changes is rather clear, the impact of the Tibetan Plateau on the Asian biota and climate during the Neogene is difficult to trace because the orogenic history of the Tibetan Plateau is the subject of much controversy, involving both biotic and abiotic evidence –. Most of the evidence of a high Plateau relies on oxygen-stable isotope paleoaltimetry estimations, but this method comes with many uncertainties. The differences between elevation estimates obtained with oxygen isotope and other proxies are considerable, with the former yielding much higher estimates (Fig. 3 c). Looking through the lens of dental traits and climate redescriptions, the Tibetan Plateau started to differ from neighboring regions on its southeast extension (e.g. Yunnan), being distinctively colder, only from the early Late Miocene (Fig. 2 b, c). This supports a relatively low Tibetan Plateau during the Early Neogene and is consistent with most of the biotic evidence.

### Can we prevent childhood leukaemia? [^e5c95095]. Leukemia (2021). Medium credibility.

But first, a caveat. ALL has provided one of the real success stories in oncology. Universally lethal in the absence of effective treatment, this cancer has been transformed by stepwise, incremental gains via systematic clinical trials of combination chemotherapy with a current cure rate of around 90%. So, why should we be interested in prevention? One glib sounding but the valid answer would be to say, 'ask any parent of a patient'. The reality is that the treatment is traumatic for very young patients and their families, and toxic with some cost or deleterious trade off in terms of morbidity and long-term health impacts. The excellent prospects for curative treatment are massively important to the affected families but prevention, if possible, would surely be even better?

### Genome-wide screen for context-dependent tumor suppressors identified using in vivo models for neoplasia in… [^cbf1fafc]. G3 (2020). Medium credibility.

Genetic approaches in Drosophila have successfully identified many genes involved in regulation of growth control as well as genetic interactions relevant to the initiation and progression of cancer in vivo Here, we report on large-scale RNAi-based screens to identify potential tumor suppressor genes that interact with known cancer-drivers: the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor and the Hippo pathway transcriptional cofactor Yorkie. These screens were designed to identify genes whose depletion drove tissue expressing EGFR or Yki from a state of benign overgrowth into neoplastic transformation in vivo We also report on an independent screen aimed to identify genes whose depletion suppressed formation of neoplastic tumors in an existing EGFR-dependent neoplasia model. Many of the positives identified here are known to be functional in growth control pathways. We also find a number of novel connections to Yki and EGFR driven tissue growth, mostly unique to one of the two. Thus, resources provided here would be useful to all researchers who study negative regulators of growth during development and cancer in the context of activated EGFR and/or Yki and positive regulators of growth in the context of activated EGFR. Resources reported here are available freely for anyone to use.

### Use of endocrine therapy for breast cancer risk reduction: ASCO clinical practice guideline update [^ec006ee8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for breast cancer, more specifically with respect to chemoprophylaxis, ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend to evaluate patients for baseline fracture risk and measure bone mineral density prior to initiating an aromatase inhibitor. Recognize that multiple studies have reported an increased rate of bone loss in women treated with aromatase inhibitors. Use anastrozole with caution in postmenopausal women with moderate bone mineral density loss, and if it is used, consider the use of bone-protective agents such as bisphosphonates and RANK ligand inhibitors. Encourage all patients receiving aromatase inhibitors to exercise regularly and take adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements. Recognize that a history of osteoporosis and/or severe bone loss is a relative contraindication for the use of anastrozole. In the International Breast Intervention Study-II, women with severe osteoporosis (T score < -4 or more than two vertebral fractures) were excluded. Recognize that other endocrine preventive therapies that do not reduce bone density, such as tamoxifen or raloxifene, are also available for this group of women.

### Evidence, hierarchies, and typologies: horses for courses [^194d7e42]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2003). Low credibility.

Debate is ongoing about the nature and use of evidence in public health decision making, and there seems to be an emerging consensus that the "hierarchy of evidence" may be difficult to apply in other settings. It may be unhelpful however to simply abandon the hierarchy without having a framework or guide to replace it. One such framework is discussed. This is based around a matrix, and emphasises the need to match research questions to specific types of research. This emphasis on methodological appropriateness, and on typologies rather than hierarchies of evidence may be helpful in organising and appraising public health evidence.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

1. Indications

Progestin - only oral contraceptives are indicated for the prevention of pregnancy.

 2. Efficacy

If used perfectly, the first-year failure rate for progestin - only oral contraceptives is 0.5%. However, the typical failure rate is estimated to be closer to 5%, due to late or omitted pills. The following table lists the pregnancy rates for users of all major methods of contraception.

Emergency Contraceptive Pills

Treatment initiated within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse reduces the risk of pregnancy by at least 75%.9

 Lactational Amenorrhea Method

LAM is a highly effective, temporary method of contraception.10

Among couples who initiate use of a method (not necessarily for the first time), and who use it perfectly (both consistently and correctly), the percentage who experience an accidental pregnancy during the first year if they do not stop use for any other reason.
Among couples attempting to avoid pregnancy, the percentage who continue to use a method for one year.
The percentage of women becoming pregnant noted in columns (2) and (3) are based on data from populations where contraception is not used and from women who cease using contraception in order to become pregnant. Among such populations, about 89% become pregnant within one year. This estimate was lowered slightly (to 85%) to represent the percentage that would become pregnant within one year among women now relying on reversible methods of contraception if they abandoned contraception altogether.
Foams, creams, gels, vaginal suppositories, and vaginal film.
Cervical mucus (ovulation) method supplemented by calendar in the pre-ovulatory and basal body temperature in the post-ovulatory phases.
With spermicidal cream or jelly.
Without spermicides.
The treatment schedule is one dose within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse, and a second dose 12 hours after the first dose. The Food and Drug Administration has declared the following brands of oral contraceptives to be safe and effective for emergency contraception: Ovral®(1 dose is 2 white pills), Alesse®(1 dose is 5 pink pills), Nordette®or Levlen®(1 dose is 4 yellow pills).
However, to maintain effective protection against pregnancy, another method of contraception must be used as soon as menstruation resumes, the frequency or duration of breastfeeds is reduced, bottle feeds are introduced, or the baby reaches 6 months of age.
