## Question

which ssris are most likely to cause weight gain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which SSRIs are most likely to cause weight gain and how to rank them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-quality comparative evidence to anchor the ranking. Then, I should verify within-class differences and the time course of weight effects. Next, I will examine pharmacogenomic modifiers that could amplify risk for specific agents. After that, I should quantify the magnitude of weight gain and translate it into clinical risk. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified ranking and outline monitoring and mitigation strategies with appropriate caveats about confounding and causality [^115ZQUzS] [^112fb5e7].

> Let me first confirm the anchor evidence. A large target trial emulation using EHR data from 183,118 patients found that, compared with sertraline, escitalopram and paroxetine had higher 6‑month weight gain and a 10–15% higher risk of gaining at least 5% of baseline weight, while fluoxetine was approximately weight-neutral and bupropion was associated with less gain; importantly, this analysis adjusted for baseline confounding and informative measurement, strengthening causal inference for comparative effects across first-line agents [^115ZQUzS] [^117172dd].

> Wait, let me verify the within-class hierarchy for SSRIs specifically. Multiple sources converge that paroxetine carries the highest long-term weight-gain liability among SSRIs, with escitalopram and citalopram also showing more gain than sertraline or fluoxetine; fluoxetine tends to be weight-neutral or mildly weight-reducing acutely, with attenuation of that effect over time, which aligns with both guideline summaries and observational cohorts [^111s75sh] [^112RpUSj] [^115ZQUzS].

> I need to check the time course because acute and chronic effects diverge. Initially, SSRIs can suppress appetite and produce modest weight loss, but with sustained use beyond 3–6 months, weight gain emerges and accrues, particularly in years 2–3 of treatment; large UK cohort data show a 21% higher risk of ≥ 5% weight gain during antidepressant treatment overall, with the strongest signal in the second and third years, and this pattern is consistent with earlier long-term fluoxetine trials showing late emergence of modest gain after initial loss [^112fb5e7] [^114isVDW] [^113X8RQH].

> Hold on, I should verify pharmacogenomic modifiers that could magnify risk for specific SSRIs. CYP2C19 poor or intermediate metabolizer status is associated with greater early weight gain on citalopram, with about a 1.7–3.0% additional gain at 6 months versus normal metabolizers; this effect appears more pronounced in patients with overweight at baseline, suggesting a clinically actionable risk amplifier for citalopram selection and dosing [^115EyDgb] [^115cD622] [^116VmqVM].

> Let me quantify the magnitude so I can translate this into patient counseling. In the target trial emulation, escitalopram and paroxetine averaged roughly 0.4 kg more gain than sertraline at 6 months, and carried a 10–15% higher risk of ≥ 5% weight gain; over longer horizons, sertraline itself is associated with about 1.5–2.0 kg mean gain at 1–2 years in some cohorts, underscoring that even "lower-risk" SSRIs are not weight-neutral with sustained use, though they remain preferable to higher-liability agents like paroxetine or escitalopram [^115ZQUzS] [^117172dd] [^112fb5e7].

> I should double-check edge cases and outliers. Fluvoxamine has been flagged in large-scale observational digital trace analyses as having higher search interest for weight gain than other SSRIs, but this is hypothesis-generating and lower-credibility; nonetheless, it nudges me to be cautious with fluvoxamine in patients with obesity risk, pending stronger comparative data [^112X7FJi].

> Next, I should review patient-level risk factors that modify susceptibility. Lower baseline BMI, female sex, younger age, and more severe depressive symptoms at initiation are associated with greater antidepressant-associated weight gain; pharmacogenomic CYP2C19 poor metabolizer status further elevates risk with citalopram, so I need to ensure I screen for these modifiers when choosing and dosing SSRIs [^117W7Pot] [^116uD13f] [^115EyDgb].

> Let me synthesize a practical, risk-stratified ranking while acknowledging that absolute differences are modest but clinically meaningful over time. Highest risk: paroxetine; moderate-high risk: escitalopram and citalopram, with citalopram risk amplified in CYP2C19 poor/intermediate metabolizers; lower risk: sertraline and fluoxetine, with fluoxetine often weight-neutral or mildly weight-reducing early but not protective against longer-term gain; if weight neutrality or loss is prioritized, bupropion is the preferred non-SSRI alternative based on comparative data, though it is not serotonergic and may not suit all patients [^115ZQUzS] [^111s75sh] [^117172dd] [^115EyDgb].

> But wait, what if the patient already started paroxetine or escitalopram and is doing well psychiatrically? I should confirm that switching is reasonable if weight gain is clinically significant, and that mitigation strategies can be tried first: dose minimization, dietary counseling, and adjuncts like topiramate have evidence for reversing SSRI-associated weight gain in small studies; shared decision-making with quantitative estimates of expected weight effects is recommended by endocrine guidelines, and I should document the risk–benefit discussion explicitly [^116p143M] [^111s75sh] [^1163AeET].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about causality. Observational cohorts can be confounded by indication, illness severity, and measurement practices; however, the consistency across large, well-adjusted datasets, the dose–duration relationship, and the temporal clustering of gain in years 2–3 strengthen the case for a medication effect, even if the absolute average differences are small at 6 months and accrue over longer horizons [^112fb5e7] [^114isVDW].

> Final check and clinical bottom line: among SSRIs, paroxetine has the most consistent and clinically concerning long-term weight-gain signal, followed by escitalopram and citalopram, with sertraline and fluoxetine representing lower-risk options; CYP2C19 poor/intermediate metabolizer status materially increases citalopram-associated gain, and sustained treatment beyond 6–12 months is when weight accrual becomes most apparent, so I should monitor weight proactively and adjust therapy if gains approach or exceed 5% of baseline [^115ZQUzS] [^115EyDgb] [^112fb5e7].

Paroxetine is the SSRI most associated with weight gain [^112gPLHR], with an average gain of **2–4 kg over 6–12 months** and a higher risk of **≥ 5% weight gain** than sertraline [^115ZQUzS]. Citalopram and escitalopram also carry a moderate risk, while fluoxetine and sertraline are more **weight-neutral** or cause minimal gain [^115ZQUzS]. Weight gain risk is higher with longer treatment, higher doses, and in younger patients; monitor weight regularly and consider switching to lower-risk agents if gain occurs [^112fb5e7] [^115Cqx9Y].

## Comparative weight gain among SSRIs

| **SSRI** | **Average weight gain** | **Risk of ≥ 5% weight gain** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Paroxetine | 2–4 kg over 6–12 months | High | - Meta-analysis [^112RpUSj] <br/> - Observational studies [^115ZQUzS] |
| Citalopram | 1–2 kg over 6–12 months | Moderate | - Observational studies [^115ZQUzS] |
| Escitalopram | 1–2 kg over 6–12 months | Moderate | - Observational studies [^115ZQUzS] |
| Sertraline | Minimal gain (< 1 kg) | Low | - Clinical guidelines [^111s75sh] <br/> - Observational studies [^115ZQUzS] |
| Fluoxetine | Minimal gain or loss (< 1 kg) | Low | - Clinical guidelines [^111s75sh] |

---

Paroxetine shows the highest risk and magnitude of weight gain among SSRIs, whereas fluoxetine and sertraline are generally weight-neutral or associated with minimal gain [^111s75sh].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting paroxetine's association with weight gain

- **Meta-analysis**: Paroxetine is significantly associated with weight gain compared with other SSRIs [^112RpUSj].
- **Observational studies**: Higher incidence of ≥ 5% weight gain with paroxetine than with sertraline or fluoxetine [^notfound].
- **Clinical guidelines**: Paroxetine is highlighted as having the highest weight gain risk among SSRIs [^111s75sh].

---

## Factors influencing weight gain with SSRIs

Several factors influence the likelihood and magnitude of weight gain with SSRIs:

- **Duration of treatment**: Longer treatment duration increases weight gain risk [^112fb5e7].
- **Dosage**: Higher doses are associated with greater weight gain [^notfound].
- **Patient demographics**: Younger patients, females, and those with lower baseline BMI are at higher risk [^117W7Pot].
- **Genetic factors**: CYP2C19 poor metabolizers gain more weight with citalopram [^115EyDgb].

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Given the potential for weight gain with SSRIs, clinicians should:

- **Monitor weight**: Regularly monitor weight and BMI during treatment [^notfound].
- **Patient education**: Inform patients about weight gain risk and encourage healthy lifestyle habits [^1163AeET].
- **Medication selection**: Consider weight-neutral alternatives (e.g. fluoxetine, sertraline) for patients at high risk of weight gain [^111s75sh].
- **Dose adjustments**: Use the lowest effective dose to minimize weight gain risk [^115ijqFc].
- **Switching strategies**: If significant weight gain occurs, consider switching to another SSRI or a different class of antidepressants [^111c9Qwb].

---

## Conclusion

Paroxetine has the highest risk of weight gain among SSRIs, with citalopram and escitalopram having moderate risk, while fluoxetine and sertraline are more weight-neutral. Clinicians should monitor weight, educate patients, and consider alternative medications if significant weight gain occurs [^111s75sh].

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^115Wxugy]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) and obesity are both common heterogeneous disorders with complex aetiology, with a major impact on public health. Antidepressant prescribing has risen nearly 400% since 1988, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In parallel, adult obesity rates have doubled since 1980, from 15 to 30 percent, while childhood obesity rates have more than tripled. Rising obesity rates have significant health consequences, contributing to increased rates of more than thirty serious diseases. Despite the concomitant rise of antidepressant use and of the obesity rates in Western societies, the association between the two, as well as the mechanisms underlying antidepressant-induced weight gain, remain under explored. In this review, we highlight the complex relationship between antidepressant use, MDD and weight gain. Clinical findings have suggested that obesity may increase the risk of developing MDD, and vice versa. Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis activation occurs in the state of stress; concurrently, the HPA axis is also dysregulated in obesity and metabolic syndrome, making it the most well-understood shared common pathophysiological pathway with MDD. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of different classes of antidepressants on body weight. Previous clinical studies suggest that the tricyclics amitriptyline, nortriptyline and imipramine, and the serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor mirtazapine are associated with weight gain. Despite the fact that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use has been associated with weight loss during acute treatment, a number of studies have shown that SSRIs may be associated with long-term risk of weight gain; however, because of high variability and multiple confounds in clinical studies, the long-term effect of SSRI treatment and SSRI exposure on body weight remains unclear. A recently developed animal paradigm shows that the combination of stress and antidepressants followed by long-term high-fat diet results, long after discontinuation of antidepressant treatment, in markedly increased weight, in excess of what is caused by high-fat diet alone. On the basis of existing epidemiological, clinical and preclinical data, we have generated the testable hypothesis that escalating use of antidepressants, resulting in high rates of antidepressant exposure, might be a contributory factor to the obesity epidemic.

### Antidepressants and body weight: a comprehensive review and meta-analysis [^112RpUSj]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

Psychotropic drugs often induce weight gain, leading to discomfort and discontinuation of treatment and, more importantly, increasing the risk of obesity-related illnesses such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary heart disease. There is evidence that antidepressant drugs may induce a variable amount of weight gain, but results are sparse and often contradictory.

Data Sources

We performed a literature search using the MEDLINE, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Cochrane research databases for all publications available to January 2009. We used the following keywords: antidepressant, psychotropic drugs, body weight, weight gain, obesity, overweight, adverse event, side effects, SSRIs, tricyclic antidepressants, and the name of each antidepressant active compound together with body weight or other keywords. Studies reporting body weight changes during treatment with different antidepressants were selected for eligibility. Finally, 116 studies were included in the analysis.

Data Extraction

Weight change mean and standard deviation and size of each group were recorded. Missing means and standard deviations were directly calculated by using information available in the article when possible. Non-placebo-controlled studies were compared to a virtual placebo sample, whose mean and standard deviation were derived by the weighted mean of means and standard deviations of all placebo samples. Methodological quality of studies, heterogeneity, publication bias, and effect of treatment duration were systematically controlled.

Data Synthesis

Quantitative results evidenced that amitriptyline, mirtazapine, and paroxetine were associated with a greater risk of weight gain. In contrast, some weight loss occurs with fluoxetine and bupropion, although the effect of fluoxetine appears to be limited to the acute phase of treatment. Other compounds have no transient or negligible effect on body weight in the short term. However, the effect of each antidepressant may vary greatly depending on an individual's characteristics and generally became more evident in the long term to a variable degree across compounds.

Conclusions

Despite the fact that some analyses were done on only a few studies due to the difficulty of finding reliable information in literature, to our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive meta-analysis to allow comparison of different antidepressants as regards their impact on body weight. Data presented may be helpful for a more accurate treatment selection in patients at risk of obesity or related medical illness.

Limitations of current findings

Although these previous studies described the effects of antidepressants on body weight, there are multiple problems in clinical observations because of the methods used. Most previous data on antidepressant-induced weight gain were extracted from drug trials of antidepressant medications or larger cross-sectional observational studies investigating the broad spectrum of MDD research. Confounding effects such as physicians specifically selecting antidepressant medication taking into consideration the risk of weight gain could not be eliminated. Moreover, as described previously, weight gain is one of the most undesired effects of treatment, and one of the major reasons for discontinuing treatment within the first 2 months of treatment initiation. In most cases there was no long-term follow-up reported that would allow us to ascertain the impact of antidepressant treatment or exposure over the lifetime.

SSRIs and SNRIs

Initially, when patients were treated acutely with SSRIs weight loss was observed. Currently, SSRIs are useful for the treatment of obese patients with binge eating disorder, given their anti-impulsive action. However, their clinical relevance for weight loss in these patients remains unclear. In the recently published Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline on the Pharmacological Management of Obesity, the use of SSRIs is not listed as a therapeutic tool. Despite the fact that SSRI use has been associated with weight loss when acutely treated, a number of studies have shown SSRIs to be associated with long-term risk of weight gain. However, the number of long-term studies over the period of 1 year is limited, and there is a need for studies specifically investigating the long-term effects of SSRIs on body weight.

Cascade et al. reported that 6% of patients using SSRIs gained weight. The Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS) is a longitudinal study that has found that SSRIs and the SNRI venlafaxine use are associated with significant weight gain. A long-term comparison study investigated the effects of different types of SSRI on weight gain in patients with panic disorder. It showed that paroxetine, fluoxetine, citalopram and fluvoxamine induced weight gain of, respectively, 8.2 ± 5.4, 5.2 ± 4.4, 6.9 ± 5.7 and 6.3 ± 4.2 kg in a 1-year period. Michelson et al. observed changes in body weight during a 1-year trial period of fluoxetine treatment. The initial 12-week period was associated with weight loss of 0.35 kg, and 50 weeks of treatment resulted in weight gain of 3 kg.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^117W7Pot]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Obesity is a chronic and complex multifactorial disease associated with multiple metabolic comorbidities, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, and psychiatric diagnoses such as major depressive and anxiety disorders. There is a bidirectional relation between depression and obesity; thus, patients with obesity have a 55% increased risk of being diagnosed with depression over time, and patients with depression have a 58% increased risk of developing obesity.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line treatment for depression. One side effect of their use is body weight gain during short- and long-term management. In fact, it is reported that patients prescribed an SSRI gain 4.2 kg more than non-users after a three-month treatment period, and that after 2.5 years of SSRI treatment, there is an increment of 2.5% of the initial body weight. The risk factors associated with weight gain while receiving antidepressant medications are lower BMI at baseline, age under 65, and female gender. However, the mechanisms of weight gain related to antidepressant use are not well known. Possible mechanisms include remission of major depression and increased neurotransmitters such as serotonin, which regulates feeding behaviors, energy expenditure, and decreased brown adipose tissue thermogenesis.

### Antidepressant medications and weight change: a narrative review [^112twPu6]. Obesity (2020). Medium credibility.

Antidepressant medications are the first-line treatment option for moderate to severe major depressive disorder. However, most antidepressants have numerous documented adverse events, including cardiometabolic effects and weight gain, which are major public health concerns. Antidepressant agents provide varying risk of associated weight gain, including significant within-class differences. Some agents, such as mirtazapine, show significant levels of weight gain, while others, such as bupropion, demonstrate weight-loss effects. Current findings suggest the role of histamine and serotonin off-target appetite-promoting pathways in adverse weight-gain effects. Therefore, controlling for undesired weight effects is an important consideration for the selection of antidepressants.

### Long-term side effects of SSRIs: sexual dysfunction and weight gain [^115vsp2i]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are associated with a variety of side effects, many of which are resolved during the first couple of weeks of treatment. Side effects that emerge or persist after 1 month of treatment include sexual dysfunction and weight gain. Although these adverse events are serious, they can be managed successfully if recognized early.

### Anorexia nervosa [^113nxSDe]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anorexia nervosa is characterised by a low body mass index (BMI), fear of gaining weight, denial of current low weight and its impact on health, and amenorrhoea. Estimated prevalence is highest in teenage girls, and up to 0.7% of this age group may be affected. While most people with anorexia nervosa recover completely or partially, about 5% die of the condition, and 20% develop a chronic eating disorder. Young women with anorexia nervosa are at increased risk of bone fractures later in life.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review which aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for anorexia nervosa? What are the effects of interventions to prevent or treat complications of anorexia nervosa? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to August 2007 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 40 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: anxiolytic drugs, cyproheptadine, inpatient/outpatient treatment setting, oestrogen treatment, psychotherapy, refeeding, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and tricyclic antidepressants.

### Medication-induced weight change across common antidepressant treatments: a target trial emulation study [^115ZQUzS]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antidepressants are among the most commonly prescribed medications, but evidence on comparative weight change for specific first-line treatments is limited.

Objective

To compare weight change across common first-line antidepressant treatments by emulating a target trial.

Design

Observational cohort study over 24 months.

Setting

Electronic health record (EHR) data from 2010 to 2019 across 8 U.S. health systems.

Participants

183118 patients.

Measurements

Prescription data determined initiation of treatment with sertraline, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, bupropion, duloxetine, or venlafaxine. The investigators estimated the population-level effects of initiating each treatment, relative to sertraline, on mean weight change (primary) and the probability of gaining at least 5% of baseline weight (secondary) 6 months after initiation. Inverse probability weighting of repeated outcome marginal structural models was used to account for baseline confounding and informative outcome measurement. In secondary analyses, the effects of initiating and adhering to each treatment protocol were estimated.

Results

Compared with that for sertraline, estimated 6-month weight gain was higher for escitalopram (difference, 0.41 kg [95% CI, 0.31 to 0.52 kg]), paroxetine (difference, 0.37 kg [CI, 0.20 to 0.54 kg]), duloxetine (difference, 0.34 kg [CI, 0.22 to 0.44 kg]), venlafaxine (difference, 0.17 kg [CI, 0.03 to 0.31 kg]), and citalopram (difference, 0.12 kg [CI, 0.02 to 0.23 kg]); similar for fluoxetine (difference, -0.07 kg [CI, -0.19 to 0.04 kg]); and lower for bupropion (difference, -0.22 kg [CI, -0.33 to -0.12 kg]). Escitalopram, paroxetine, and duloxetine were associated with 10% to 15% higher risk for gaining at least 5% of baseline weight, whereas bupropion was associated with 15% reduced risk. When the effects of initiation and adherence were estimated, associations were stronger but had wider CIs. Six-month adherence ranged from 28% (duloxetine) to 41% (bupropion).

Limitation

No data on medication dispensing, low medication adherence, incomplete data on adherence, and incomplete data on weight measures across time points.

Conclusion

Small differences in mean weight change were found between 8 first-line antidepressants, with bupropion consistently showing the least weight gain, although adherence to medications over follow-up was low. Clinicians could consider potential weight gain when initiating antidepressant treatment.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^115DNGJ8]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Mechanism proposed of antidepressant-induced weight gain

Central and peripheral mechanisms of appetite and feeding behaviour regulation are complex; regulatory factors such as neurotransmitters, neuropeptides and hormone-like peptides have a role in orchestrating appetite, feeding behaviours and metabolic pathways. In previous studies, it has been suggested that weight gain associated with antidepressants reflects the action of monoamine pathways, which include serotonergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic receptors. The specific mechanisms of action of different antidepressants on weight are described below (Figure 1).

### Antidepressant utilisation and incidence of weight gain during 10 years' follow-up: population based cohort study [^112fb5e7]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Comparison with other studies

A systematic review analysed short term studies and estimated weight increases over eight months' follow-up. Another study evaluated weight gain up to two years using electronic health records, with estimates consistent with a 2.1 kg weight gain with fluoxetine treatment and about a 4.8 kg increase with setraline. These figures suggest that increases of ≥ 5% body weight are plausible. Our study adds to previous data by providing longer follow-up (up to 10 years) of antidepressant treatment, showing that the risk of weight gain is increased for at least the first five years of treatment. Our study also adds a comparison with a general population sample that was not treated with antidepressant drugs, showing an association between antidepressant use and transitions to overweight and obesity. Weight gain is a well recognised side effect of antipsychotic treatment, but prescribing guidelines generally devote less attention to weight management in the context of antidepressant treatment. Obesity and depression are common, often coexist, and are associated with physical comorbidity and worse health outcomes. Researchers have observed that the negative perceptions associated with either a depression diagnosis or an obesity diagnosis may be potentiated when the conditions overlap. This makes weight management and obesity prevention particularly important in this population. The relation between depression symptoms and health behaviours that might contribute to weight gain is also a relevant concern.

From a population perspective, these results suggest that the widespread use of antidepressants might be an important factor contributing to increasing body weight. These results should be set in the context of increasing BMI in the general population. Data from the health survey for England show that between 2004 and 2014 the prevalence of obesity in adults increased from 23% to 26%, and mean BMI increased from 26.9 to 27.2. From a clinical perspective, these observations reinforce the need for active body weight management to accompany antidepressant treatment, although this might often be met with limited success. The potential for weight gain may also be a consideration in the selection of individual antidepressant drugs.

Conclusions and policy implications

Initiation of antidepressant drugs shows a strong temporal association with weight gain, which is greatest during the second and third years of treatment. During the second year of treatment, the risk of ≥ 5% weight gain is 46.3% higher than in a general population comparison group. These associations are consistent across a wide range of clinical, social, and demographic characteristics. The increasingly widespread use of antidepressants is of concern in the context of the increasing prevalence of obesity.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^111rByLd]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, we have performed a retrospective pharmacogenomics study to understand the SSRIs' common weight gain side effects. We showed that the CYP2C19 genotype might explain weight gain in citalopram patients, and it might become a projection tool for preventing weight gain and obesity, particularly in patients who are overweight. Further studies are needed to validate this observation in prospective trials.

### Antidepressant utilisation and incidence of weight gain during 10 years' follow-up: population based cohort study [^111E7WcQ]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

This population based cohort study reports data for participants registered in primary care who had three or more measurements for body mass index (BMI), with sampling stratified by BMI category. Analysis reveals a high prevalence of exposure to antidepressant drugs. Considering the entire period of follow-up (10 years), participants who were prescribed an antidepressant had an increased risk of ≥ 5% weight gain compared with those who had never been prescribed an antidepressant, after allowing for differences in case mix. This association was consistently observed across a wide range of population subgroups. Participants of normal weight showed an increased risk of transitioning to overweight or obesity, and overweight participants were more likely to become obese if they were treated with an antidepressant. The risk of weight gain was substantially increased during the second and third years of treatment. Less than 12 months' use of antidepressants did not appear to be associated with weight gain, but this might be an artefact from incomplete data recording. Pharmacological classes of antidepressants displayed intraclass heterogeneity for later risk of weight gain. Mirtazapine was associated with the highest incidence rate ratio of weight gain, although the drug was relatively infrequently prescribed.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^112K3mGa]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion and future directions

In this review, we have discussed the relationship between MDD and obesity. Clinical findings have suggested that obesity could increase the risk of developing MDD, and vice versa. Several pathways may have a role in this interaction, including neuroendocrine, neuroimmune and neurotropic mechanisms. Among those, activation of the HPA axis occurs both during MDD/stress and obesity, making it the most accepted shared common pathophysiological pathways in both disorders. Leptin and insulin resistance are pathophysiological mechanisms that need to be further elucidated, along with the roles of the immune system and neurotropic factors.

Despite the concomitant occurrence of the frequent use of antidepressants and the high incidence of obesity in Western societies, additional studies are required to fully test our hypothesis that the rise in obesity rates is related at least in part to increasing antidepressant use, and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying antidepressant-induced weight gain. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of different classes of antidepressants on body weight. Previous clinical studies suggest that TCAs amitriptyline, nortriptyline and imipramine were associated with weight gain. Mirtazapine (SNRI) has been associated with increased weight gain. Studies have suggested that weight gain associated with antidepressants reflect the action of monoamine pathways, which include serotoninergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, cholinergic and dopaminergic receptors. It has been suggested that the mechanism behind weight gain induced by TCAs and mirtazapine (SNRI) involves affinity for histaminergic receptors. Histaminergic receptors have been shown to interact with orexigenic neuropeptides such as orexin A, NPY and ghrelin. Bupropion (SNRI) has been shown to induce significant weight loss via selective inhibition of dopamine. On the other hand, because of dispersion in clinical studies, the effect of SSRI on body weight remains still unclear. Despite the fact that SSRI use has been associated with weight loss during acute treatment, a number of studies have shown that SSRIs may be associated with long-term risk of weight gain. Long-term studies with very much extended periods are needed in order to understand long-term effects of SSRI on body weight.

### Pharmacological management of obesity: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111s75sh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — antidepressant selection and weight effects recommends a shared decision-making process that provides patients with quantitative estimates of the expected weight effect when antidepressant therapy is indicated (1|⊕⊕⊕○), noting that the expected length of treatment should also be considered. Evidence indicates heterogeneous weight effects: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine and sertraline have been associated with weight loss during acute treatment (4–12 wk) and weight neutrality in the maintenance (> 4 mo) phase, with no significant effect observed for citalopram or escitalopram; paroxetine has the greatest long-term increase in body weight among SSRIs, amitriptyline is the most potent tricyclic inducer of weight gain, and mirtazapine is associated with long-term weight gain; among serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, venlafaxine and duloxetine have been reported to slightly increase body weight; bupropion is the only antidepressant that consistently causes weight loss and significantly decreased body weight in clinical trials; the commissioned systematic review found weight gain with amitriptyline (1.8 kg) and weight loss with bupropion (−1.3 kg) and fluoxetine (−1.3 kg).

### Long-term changes in adiposity markers during and after antidepressant therapy in a community cohort [^113KQtk3]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The higher increase in BMI among AD users during follow-up also involved a more than 60% elevated risk of at least a 5% increase in BMI, which is usually considered as clinically relevant, and a more than 50% elevated risk of at least a 5% increase in waist circumference as compared to those who did not use these drugs. Within AD classes, SSRI users had a more than 60% and 40% elevated risks of at least a 5% increase in BMI and waist circumference, respectively, whereas TCA users were at an even more than tripled risk of at least a 5% increase in waist circumference. Our observation of a steeper increase in BMI during TCA and SSRI use during follow-up is compatible with previous research that documented elevated weight gain in people using ADs over periods of over 1 year. Although we only observed an association with waist circumference for any TCA use, this finding is in line with those of clinical and observational studies that constantly revealed associations between this AD class and weight gain. Moreover, extending previous evidence, we could demonstrate that a sustained use of SSRIs is not only associated with a steeper increase in BMI, but also a steeper increase in waist circumference (fluoxetine, escitalopram) and fat mass (fluoxetine). However, the results with respect to fluoxetine need to be interpreted with caution. Indeed, despite the observed steeper increase in all adiposity markers among the users of this compound, it was not associated with a higher likelihood of at least a 5% increase in any of these markers. Hence, the clinical relevance of the observed steeper increase in adiposity markers associated with this compound remains doubtful.

### Clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and treatment of children and adolescents with obesity [^117Txvhy]. Pediatrics (2023). High credibility.

Pediatric obesity — history and risk context emphasizes structured history taking to guide evaluation and management. The history of the present illness provides a more comprehensive picture of the trajectory of overweight and obesity, starting with maternal pregnancy factors and then childhood and adolescent factors that predispose to obesity, and information about the onset of excess weight gain and consistency of weight status over time (including a review of the growth curve and previous weight control attempts) can clarify what weight status represents for the patient and offer clues to root causes, necessary diagnostic evaluation, and potential therapeutic targets. The family history focuses on obesity-related comorbidities and potential genetic causes of obesity, which may influence both evaluation and treatment, and can provide a clue to genetic susceptibility to obesity — especially if the family history includes severe obesity resulting in metabolic and bariatric surgery or severe obesity present in multiple family members and generations. The medication history should be complete and should include medications associated with weight gain, such as antipsychotics, especially atypical antipsychotics; antidepressants including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors;

### Long-term changes in adiposity markers during and after antidepressant therapy in a community cohort [^112RyTti]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Research on antidepressant-related weight changes over more than 12 months is scarce and adjustment for the effects of depressive episodes has rarely been applied. Accordingly, our aim was to assess the associations of the use of any antidepressants, subclasses of antidepressant and specific compounds prior to baseline and during a 5.5-year follow-up with changes in adiposity markers, and the effect of sex on these associations, with adjustment for multiple confounders including the effects of depressive episodes and their severity. Data stemmed from a prospective cohort study including 2479 randomly selected 35–66 year-old residents of an urban area (mean age 49.9 years, 53.3% women) who underwent physical and psychiatric evaluations at baseline and follow-up. Weight, height, waist circumference, and body fat were measured by trained nurses and information on diagnosis and antidepressant use prior to baseline and during follow-up was collected through standardized interviews. In the fully adjusted models, the number of antidepressants, mainly SSRIs and TCAs, used prior to baseline, was associated with a lower increase of body-mass index (BMI, β (95%CI) = -0.12 (-0.19, -0.05)) and waist circumference (β = -0.28 (-0.56, -0.01)), whereas participants treated with antidepressants during the follow-up had a steeper increase in BMI (β = 0.32 (0.13, 0.50)) and waist circumference (β = 1.23 (0.44, 2.01)). Within the class of SSRIs, the use of fluoxetine, sertraline or escitalopram during follow-up was associated with a steeper increase in adiposity markers. The associations of SSRIs with BMI and waist circumference were only observed when the SSRIs were used during the second period of the follow-up. Sex did not moderate these associations. Our findings suggest an increase of adiposity markers during sustained treatment with TCAs and SSRIs, which however return to normal levels after cessation of treatment. Hence, the benefit of long-term administration of these antidepressants should be carefully weighed against the potential risk of weight gain.

### Long-term changes in adiposity markers during and after antidepressant therapy in a community cohort [^114goRmq]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by a complex co-morbidity profile including obesity. Aside from poor health behavior, the effects of antidepressants (ADs) have been suggested to mediate the association between MDD and subsequent weight gain. Considering the concomitant rise of prescriptions of ADs in the last decades, the potentially weight increasing effect of ADs has become a challenging public health issue.

Numerous randomized and open clinical trials as well as epidemiological studies have addressed this topic and suggest that the classical tricyclics (TCA) are associated with weight gain. A meta-analysis of clinical trials, which could only identify 30 placebo-controlled randomized studies also providing information on weight gain during acute or maintenance treatment, has evidenced that among the assessed compounds only few were associated with weight changes. The classical TCA amitriptyline, the noradrenergic and specific serotoninergic AD (NaSSA) mirtazapine and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) paroxetine were associated with greater risk of weight gain, whereas the SSRI fluoxetine and the norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) bupropion were associated with weight loss, although this effect of fluoxetine was limited to the 4–12 week's acute treatment phase. A more recent meta-analysis confirmed weight gain associated with the use of amitriptyline and mirtazapine and weight loss associated with the use of fluoxetine and bupropion. However, although some of these studies did not only include acute but also maintenance treatment, they could not inform on associations between AD use of more than 12 months and weight changes. Indeed, the longest placebo-controlled clinical trial included in these metanalyses did not exceed a period of more than 12 months. Accordingly, available information on weight changes associated with sustained AD use beyond this period relies entirely on prospective cohort studies. A systematic review of seven cohort studies involving follow-up periods between 2 and 18 years has documented at least 5% weight gain in individuals with AD use in most of the studies. However, besides the risk of indication bias, which is inherent in all observational research, existing long-term studies are subject to several limitations including not systematically recording data on weight in primary care databases, using self-reported weight, and lack of assessment of depressive episodes or symptoms impeding distinction between the effects of ADs and those of depressive episodes. Moreover, none of the previous observational studies could identify episodes with atypical characteristics, which have been shown to be most strongly associated with weight gain. Finally, most studies only assessed changes in weight or body mass index (BMI), although recent data have suggested that waist circumference is more strongly associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease than BMI and that body fat percentage could be an independent risk factor for mortality.

### Weight gain during long-term treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder: a prospective comparison between serotonin reuptake inhibitors [^115EA2XJ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of extended anti-depressant treatment on weight has been poorly investigated. Also unknown is whether different compounds have differential effects. The aim of the present study was to assess changes in weight in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients treated for 2.5 years with clomipramine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

Method

138 DSM-IV OCD patients who responded to 6-month acute treatment at the Mood and Anxiety Disorders Unit, Department of Neuroscience, University of Turin, Italy, were followed-up for 2 years while receiving open-label clomipramine, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, or sertraline. Patients were consecutively recruited and followed from May 1998 to March 2003. The mean percentage change in weight was compared for each group, as was the proportion of patients who had a ≥ 7% weight increase from baseline.

Results

At the end of the 2.5-year study period, patients had gained a mean of 2.5% of their body weight with respect to baseline (1.58 kg); 14.5% of the total sample experienced a significant (≥ 7%) weight increase. Within each but the fluoxetine treatment group, paired t tests showed a significant increase in weight from baseline to final visit. Analysis of variance showed a significant difference between treatment groups (p = .009), with clomipramine being associated with the highest weight increase and fluoxetine and sertraline with the lowest. A higher proportion of clomipramine-treated patients (34.8%) gained ≥ 7% in weight as compared with sertraline and fluoxetine, which accounted for the lowest percentage of patients with a significant weight gain (4.5% and 8.7%, respectively), although this difference was not statistically significant.

Conclusion

Risk of weight gain during extended serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment for OCD differs depending on which compound is used. The differences among antiobsessive drugs may affect compliance with medication and health risks.

### Interventions for preventing weight gain after smoking cessation [^114W6eHW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Most people who stop smoking gain weight, on average about 7 kg in the long term. There are some interventions that have been specifically designed to tackle smoking cessation whilst also limiting weight gain. Many smoking cessation pharmacotherapies and other interventions may also limit weight gain.

Objectives

This review is divided into two parts. (1) Interventions designed specifically to aid smoking cessation and limit post-cessation weight gain (2) Interventions designed to aid smoking cessation that may also plausibly have an effect on weight

Search Strategy

Part 1: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialized Register which includes trials indexed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciSearch and PsycINFO, and other reviews and conference abstracts. Part 2: We searched the included studies of Cochrane smoking cessation reviews of nicotine replacement therapy, antidepressants, nicotine receptor partial agonists, cannabinoid type 1 receptor antagonists (rimonabant), and exercise interventions, published in Issue 4, 2008 of The Cochrane Library.

Selection Criteria

Part 1: We included trials of interventions designed specifically to address both smoking cessation and post-cessation weight gain that had measured weight at any follow-up point and/or smoking six months or more after quitting. Part 2: We included trials from the selected Cochrane reviews that could plausibly modify post-cessation weight gain if they had reported weight gain by trial arm at end of treatment or later.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted data in duplicate on smoking and weight for part 1 trials, and on weight only for part 2. Abstinence from smoking is expressed as a risk ratio (RR), using the most rigorous definition of abstinence available in each trial, and biochemically validated rates if available. The outcome is expressed as the difference in weight change between trial arms from baseline. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using the Mantel-Haenszel method for smoking and inverse variance for weight using a fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We found evidence that pharmacological interventions aimed at reducing post-cessation weight gain resulted in a significant reduction in weight gain at the end of treatment (dexfenfluramine (-2.50kg [-2.98kg to -2.02kg], fluoxetine (-0.80kg [-1.27kg to -0.33kg], phenylpropanolamine (PPA) (-0.50kg [-0.80kg to -0.20kg], naltrexone (-0.76kg [-1.51kg to -0.01kg])). No evidence of maintenance of the treatment effect was found at six or 12 months. Among the behavioural interventions, only weight control advice was associated with no reduction in weight gain and with a possible reduction in abstinence. Individualized programmes were associated with reduced weight gain at end of treatment and at 12 months (-2.58kg [-5.11kg to -0.05kg]), and with no effect on abstinence (RR 0.74 [0.39 to 1.43]). Very low calorie diets (-1.30kg (-3.49kg to 0.89kg] at 12 months) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (-5.20kg (-9.28kg to -1.12kg] at 12 months) were both associated with improved abstinence and reduced weight gain at end of treatment and at long-term follow up. Both bupropion (300mg/day) and fluoxetine (30mg and 60mg/day combined) were found to limit post-cessation weight gain at the end of treatment (-0.76kg [-1.17kg to -0.35kg] I(2) = 48%) and -1.30kg [-1.91kg to -0.69kg]) respectively. There was no evidence that the weight reducing effect of bupropion was dose-dependent. The effect of bupropion at one year was smaller and confidence intervals included no effect (-0.38kg [-2.001kg to 1.24kg]). We found no evidence that exercise interventions significantly reduced post-cessation weight gain at end of treatment but evidence for an effect at 12 months (-2.07kg [-3.78kg, -0.36kg]). Treatment with NRT resulted in attenuation of post-cessation weight gain (-0.45kg [-0.70kg, -0.20kg]) at the end of treatment, with no evidence that the effect differed for different forms of NRT. The estimated weight gain reduction was similar at 12 months (-0.42kg [-0.92kg, 0.08kg]) but the confidence intervals included no effect. There were no relevant data on the effect of rimonabant on weight gain. We found no evidence that varenicline significantly reduced post-cessation weight gain at end of treatment and no follow-up data are currently available. One study randomizing successful quitters to 12 more weeks of active treatment showed weight to be reduced by 0.71kg (-1.04kg to -0.38kg). In three studies, participants taking bupropion gained significantly less weight at the end of treatment than those on varenicline (-0.51kg [-0.93kg to -0.09kg]).

Authors' Conclusions

Behavioural interventions of general advice only are not effective and may reduce abstinence. Individualized interventions, very low calorie diets, and CBT may be effective and not reduce abstinence. Exercise interventions are not associated with reduced weight gain at end of treatment, but may be associated with worthwhile reductions in weight gain in the long term, Bupropion, fluoxetine, nicotine replacement therapy, and probably varenicline all reduced weight gain while being used. Although this effect was not maintained one year after quitting for bupropion, fluoxetine, and nicotine replacement, the evidence is insufficient to exclude a modest long-term effect. The data are not sufficient to make strong clinical recommendations for effective programmes.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^116xcnSV]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Genetic variation is one of the factors that can alter a medication's efficacy by influencing its metabolism (i.e. pharmacokinetics), mechanism of action (i.e. pharmacodynamics), and even adverse side effects by gene-drug interactions. Because cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes contribute to phase I drug metabolism, CYP enzyme variation significantly impact treatment outcomes. Pharmacogenomics offers the opportunity to optimize treatment considering these polymorphisms to develop a more personalized approach to antidepressant selection while reducing adverse drug events. In 2013, the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) developed dosing guidelines for paroxetine, citalopram, and sertraline based on their main metabolizer enzymes' phenotype status CYP2C19 and/or CYP2D6. Different CYP enzymes are involved in SSRI metabolism; however, each drug has a dominant metabolizer enzyme. Thus, citalopram is mainly metabolized by CYP2C19, paroxetine by CYP2D6, fluoxetine by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9, and sertraline by CYP2D6 and CYP2C19. The guidelines recommend a 50% reduction in the starting dose of citalopram, paroxetine, and sertraline in individuals with CYP2D6 or CYP2C19 poor metabolizer phenotype. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration has made recommendations for a maximum dosage of SSRIs in patients with specific metabolizer phenotypes. There are currently little data detailing how CYP2D6 phenotypic status impacts the total amount of fluoxetine; hence, no gene-based dosage recommendations for fluoxetine have been provided.

Pharmacogenomics is a tool to personalize management in multiple areas, such as psychiatry and weight management. Multiple mood disorder studies have evaluated SSRI responsiveness for depression and lithium therapy in bipolar illness in GWAS studies and polygenic risk scores analysis. These studies have found the link between genetic variants of obesity and SSRIs treatment response in depression. However, a study investigating pharmacogenomics and weight gain in mood disorders is required. We hypothesized that patients with decreased metabolism of SSRIs by these cytochrome enzymes would be more likely to experience weight gain as a side effect. The study assesses the association between metabolizer phenotype and weight gain six months following SSRI prescription.

### Antidepressant medication use, weight gain, and risk of type 2 diabetes: a population-based study [^111vrWBD]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Other studies in the field have reported inconsistent findings. A Norwegian cross-sectional health survey, a study of spontaneous reports listed in the WHO Adverse Drug Reaction Database, and an analysis of data from one province in Canada all found support for an association between antidepressant use and diabetes. In a community sample of adults aged ≤ 55 years, treatment with antidepressants was not associated with an increased risk of diabetes, but the study lacked adequate statistical power because the number of antidepressant users who developed diabetes was only four. Analyses using prescription data from the PHARMO database from the Netherlands did not find an increased risk of diabetes among antidepressant users. However, that study did not consider the duration or the dose of antidepressant treatment. Our findings and other studies suggest that inclusion of short-term/low-dose treatments in the definition of antidepressant use is likely to dilute the association. In the present study, exposure to < 200 defined daily doses of antidepressants was not associated with diabetes risk.

Weight gain, both in relative and absolute terms, was greater among antidepressant users than among their control subjects matched for depression status using recorded and self-reported information on depression and related traits. A previous trajectory analysis of repeat BMI measurements found on average a 0.03 unit faster annual increase in BMI among individuals who later developed type 2 diabetes compared with those who remained disease-free. This translates to ∼0.1 kg excess weight gain per year for incident diabetes case subjects. With use of that metric, our findings suggest that antidepressant medication use is related to ∼0.3 kg excess yearly weight gain, a change clearly large enough to contribute to diabetes risk. Our findings are in agreement with previous studies confirming that tricyclic antidepressants may induce weight gain and promote hyperglycemia and showing that SSRI use, despite being related to stable weight or even weight loss in the short term, is associated with an increased risk of weight gain in the longer term.

In the weight gain study reported herein, we undertook a sensitivity analysis based on a subgroup of incident antidepressant medication users who started treatment between baseline and follow-up weight measurements, excluding all prevalent antidepressant users. This exclusion affected little estimated significant weight gain associated with SSRIs but showed even a greater weight gain in relation to tricyclic antidepressant treatment. Because weight gain is a recognized side effect of tricyclic antidepressants, the main analysis may include an underrepresentation of patients who did not tolerate antidepressant treatment well (the depletion of susceptibility bias), contributing to an underestimation of the weight gain associated with tricyclic antidepressant treatment.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^113ZAPfw]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Multiple drugs with indications for chronic weight management have been authorized with improved safety profiles. However, in a patient-centered care model, it is important to recognize barriers that may decrease to less effective and efficient weight management and that negatively impact weight loss outcomes. One of these barriers is weight gain as a medications' side effect, i.e. obesogenic drugs. According to the findings of a patient survey, the most common reason for discontinuing antidepressant medication is a lack of effectiveness. However, up to 27% of patients who reported noncompliance discontinued the drug due to weight increase. Previous research has looked at the link between metabolizer status and medicine discontinuation; however, no convincing relationship has been identified due to study design and sample collection. More research is needed to determine the true impact of metabolizer status on drug discontinuation, particularly in individuals who are overweight and using SSRIs.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^117FkBtp]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Although studies on the association between citalopram blood concentrations and pharmaceutical effectiveness and tolerability are lacking, it is usually assumed that a 50% difference in blood concentration will have a clinical impact. Because of the increase in concentration for CYP2C19 poor metabolizers compared to normal metabolizers, there is an implied risk of adverse outcomes, and the recommendation is to reduce the citalopram dose by 50%. Further studies are needed to evaluate drug blood concentrations and weight gain according to metabolizer status.

Our study has some limitations. First, the low prevalence of some CYP enzyme phenotypes (CYP2D6 rapid/ultrarapid metabolizer) and the small sample size might cause a type II error in assessing our primary outcome. This limits the ability to detect a difference in TBWG % with other enzyme phenotypes. Importantly, given the nature of the study, we could not include all patients prescribed an SSRI because a few had no follow up at our institution. Second, the generalizability of the data is limited by the retrospective nature of our study and does not establish a causal link between CYP enzyme phenotypes and weight gain. Third, it is difficult to investigate characteristics such as drug compliance since medical record data varies so much between health care providers, and the influence of polypharmacy on patient outcomes was not evaluated. This is an important aspect to consider in future research. Previously, tricyclic antidepressants, which have a more profound effect on bodyweight, weight gain, have been a clear limitation of compliance to the medication. Weight gain in our cohort may have resulted in noncompliance, concealing the differences in weight in our cohort among drugs that have previously been associated with higher weight gain. Fourth, there are ascertainment biases inherent to a study conducted in tertiary care centers with a study population that is predominately White. Fifth, the mood response to the SSRI was not formally recorded with validated questionnaires, and this outcome was unclear from retrospective chart review during data gathering. Thus, response to treatment of depression could confound weight gain or weight loss.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^1135QsGn]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Despite their widespread usage of antidepressant medicine, initial drug selection success might be lower. According to the findings of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) trial, only one-third of the patients achieved remission within the first treatment level. Previous studies have found the clinical benefits of using pharmacogenomics to tailor the therapeutic approach in patients with major depressive disorder and anxiety. Poor metabolizers taking escitalopram resulted in a greater rate of therapeutic failure, indicating the potential clinical value of CYP2C19 genotyping for individualization of escitalopram. However, there has not been any difference in adverse drug events reported between pharmacogenomic tailored treatment compared with controls.

Previous studies have retrospectively assessed side effects and metabolizer status with antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and SSRIs. In terms of side effects and CYP2C19 and citalopram/escitalopram, a meta-analysis of 2037 patients found that, compared to normal metabolizers, CYP2C19 poor metabolizers had a greater risk of gastrointestinal, neurological, and sexual adverse effects. The Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE), which includes weight gain among other items and covers 9 categories and 32 items, is a typical measure used to evaluate side effects in most pharmacogenomics studies. Most research, however, focuses on side effects associated with a specific organ or system, which may restrict the relationship between pharmacogenomic studies with weight gain. Another study has looked at variations in the genes CYP2D6, CYP2C19, and CYP2C9 in patients taking SSRIs and tolerability and did not find a clear pharmacogenetic explanation for side effects. In a recent study of 9500 participants, poor metabolizers were at higher risk of side effects adding to the evidence for a link between CYP2C19 metabolism and SSRI tolerability. However, tolerability and side effects were evaluated by a survey using a qualitative assessment considering weight gain. The relationship between poor CYP2C19 metabolizer status and early weight gain documented in the medical record in children using escitalopram or citalopram has been described, adding to the data connecting metabolizer status and weight increase. This is the first study to objectively evaluate one of the common side effects of SSRIs, regardless of the response to treatment in adults.

### Antidepressant utilisation and incidence of weight gain during 10 years' follow-up: population based cohort study [^115JijBY]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Antidepressants are increasingly being prescribed. In a primary care population 23% of 1.5 million participants were prescribed an antidepressant on at least one occasion between 1995 to 2011. The number of antidepressant prescriptions issued nearly doubled over the same period, although some of the increase might be explained by extended duration of courses of treatment. Obesity is associated with depression, which is particularly common in patients with severe obesity. Antidepressant treatment may also be associated with weight gain, through mechanisms that are only partially understood. The current high prevalence of antidepressant use could have potentially important public health impacts through the association with body weight gain, but the nature of this association is poorly described. Although a systematic review of antidepressant use and weight gain collated evidence from 116 clinical trials and clinical cohort studies, fewer than half of the studies contributed data for more than three months of follow-up and it was not reported how many studies included more than 12 months of follow-up. The review also drew attention to the heterogeneity among different antidepressant drugs, with bupropion and fluoxetine being associated with lower weight gain than mirtazapine and nortriptyline. Most studies have reported on weight change in depressed patients treated in clinical settings, but few population based studies have investigated the potential population impact of widespread antidepressant treatment on weight gain. One study evaluated weight change after initiation of antidepressant treatment in 5932 patients registered with the Group Health system in Washington state, USA, and found that weight gain persisted for at least two years. A UK study analysed data for 268 patients treated with antidepressants from a general practice with 11 994 registered patients, and concluded that weight gain persisted during long term treatment, with, in some instances, prescriptions maintained for several years. Another US study evaluated weight gain in the 12 months after initiation of antidepressant treatment in 22 610 adults treated in clinics in New England and found differences in the propensity of individual antidepressants to result in weight gain.

In this study we used primary care electronic health records to evaluate non-randomised evidence on the long term association of antidepressant prescribing with weight gain. We also evaluated the associations in different subgroups and whether individual antidepressant drugs might be associated with greater risks of weight gain.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^114vjnZW]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

In a prospective 4-year follow-up study, SSRI-treated patients had weight gain of 4.6%. In the study conducted by Sussman et al. 17.9% of SSRI users experienced significant weight gain ⩾7%. Escitalopram (SSRI) treatment resulted in an increase of 0.05 in BMI scores during the first 12 weeks, and there was an increase of 0.12 in BMI scores after 6 months of treatment initiation.

In addition to the clinical studies described above, case studies have reported extreme weight gain in patients with SSRI treatment. In the study conducted by Bouwer et al. treatment with citalopram led to weight gain and carbohydrate craving in eight out of eighteen patients. In a 4-week period, one female patient gained 8 kg, whereas in a 5-week period one male patient gained 9 kg. In another case study, a 33-year-old schizophrenic female patient was treated with fluoxetine (40 mg per day) for a 9-month period following antipsychotic treatment with risperidone (6 mg per day) and clorazepate (15 mg per day). The patient was discontinued from fluoxetine because she underwent excessive weight gain (52 kg) accompanied with carbohydrate craving. Therefore, some individuals may be more sensitive to weight gain induced by SSRIs than others.

### An electronic health records study of long-term weight gain following antidepressant use [^112qa3db]. JAMA Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Short-term studies suggest antidepressants are associated with modest weight gain but little is known about longer-term effects and differences between individual medications in general clinical populations.

Objective

To estimate weight gain associated with specific antidepressants over the 12 months following initial prescription in a large and diverse clinical population.

Design, Setting, and Participants

We identified 22,610 adult patients who began receiving a medication of interest with available weight data in a large New England health care system, including 2 academic medical centers and affiliated outpatient primary and specialty care clinics. We used electronic health records to extract prescribing data and recorded weights for any patient with an index antidepressant prescription including amitriptyline hydrochloride, bupropion hydrochloride, citalopram hydrobromide, duloxetine hydrochloride, escitalopram oxalate, fluoxetine hydrochloride, mirtazapine, nortriptyline hydrochloride, paroxetine hydrochloride, venlafaxine hydrochloride, and sertraline hydrochloride. As measures of assay sensitivity, additional index prescriptions examined included the antiasthma medication albuterol sulfate and the antiobesity medications orlistat, phentermine hydrochloride, and sibutramine hydrochloride. Mixed-effects models were used to estimate rate of weight change over 12 months in comparison with the reference antidepressant, citalopram.

Main Outcome and Measure

Clinician-recorded weight at 3-month intervals up to 12 months.

Results

Compared with citalopram, in models adjusted for sociodemographic and clinical features, significantly decreased rate of weight gain was observed among individuals treated with bupropion (β [SE]: -0.063 [0.027]; p = 0.02), amitriptyline (β [SE]: -0.081 [0.025]; p = 0.001), and nortriptyline (β [SE]: -0.147 [0.034]; P < .001). As anticipated, differences were less pronounced among individuals discontinuing treatment prior to 12 months.

Conclusions and Relevance

Antidepressants differ modestly in their propensity to contribute to weight gain. Short-term investigations may be insufficient to characterize and differentiate this risk.

Association of antidepressant prescription with increase in body mass index (BMI) category. Values are frequencies unless stated otherwise

A random effects meta-analysis was conducted (fig 3) to evaluate heterogeneity within and between antidepressant classes. SSRI and TCA classes were heterogeneous (I 2 = 92.8%, P < 0.001 and I² = 75.0%, P = 0.018, respectively). Weak evidence of heterogeneity was found for the SNRI class (venlafaxine and duloxetine) (I 2 = 64.3%, P = 0.094). Given the heterogeneity within classes of antidepressants, the relation between individual antidepressants and weight gain was explored (figs 3 and 4). Mirtazapine appeared to be associated with the greatest adjusted rate ratio of weight gain (1.50, 95% confidence interval 1.45 to 1.56). Figure 4 shows the relative frequencies of prescribing compared with the adjusted rate ratio for individual antidepressants — in order of frequency of use: amitriptyline (25.9%), citalopram (19.8%), fluoxetine (16.0%), sertraline (9.0%), venlafaxine (6.4%), paroxetine (5.5%), mirtazapine (4.5%), dosulepin (3.9%), escitalopram (3.7%), trazodone (1.9%), duloxetine (2.1%), and nortriptyline (1.1%).

Strengths and limitations of this study

This study used data from a large nationally representative primary care database in the United Kingdom. Use of electronic health records enabled us to comprehensively ascertain whether participants had received prescriptions for antidepressants. We used clinical records of weight, height, and BMI. These measures are not always systematically recorded in primary care. Infrequent recording of BMI could lead to underestimation of associations if weight gain occurred but no measurement was taken; conversely, confounding of measurement by indication might occur if family doctors are more likely to record body weight when there has been weight gain. The direction of any possible bias from incomplete recording of body weight is difficult to anticipate. We initially selected participants who had at least three BMI measurements recorded, leading to over-representation of those with comorbidity; participants with no comorbidities being less likely to have BMI recorded than those with concurrent illnesses. Patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus or coronary heart disease may be more likely to be enrolled in self management interventions that focus on diet, exercise, and weight control and this could modify estimated associations. Also, in this non-randomised study, residual confounding might lead to bias. Confounding by indication might occur if the propensity to be prescribed antidepressants is also associated with the propensity to gain weight. The present data show that 94% of treated patients had a diagnosis of depression. However, antidepressant drugs can be prescribed for several disorders, and depression might not always have been the sole indication for prescription. We cannot exclude the possibility that depressive symptoms rather than antidepressant treatment were the reason for changes in body weight. Analyses were based on antidepressant prescription, but non-adherence might be common and could diminish estimated associations. However, clinical trials in depressed patients show that antidepressant treatment is associated with weight gain. The strong temporal association between initiation of antidepressant treatment and weight gain also suggests a causal association. This dataset reflects prescribing habits over a decade. During this time a switch occurred from older tricyclic antidepressants to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Older generation drugs, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors and tricyclic antidepressants, are generally more associated with weight gain than are the newer SSRIs, but the older generation drugs are only infrequently prescribed. Associations with weight gain might depend on drug dose, but it was not possible to reconstruct dosage information for this study.

Table 1
Characteristics of participants according to antidepressant prescribing. Values are number (row percentage) unless stated otherwise

Table 2 presents the distribution of person time for the whole sample and for subgroups by covariates, together with the number of new cases of ≥ 5% weight gain. Over a 10 year period there was a total of 1 836 452 person years of follow-up. For 1 454 909 person years not associated with antidepressant use, the incidence of ≥ 5% weight gain was 8.1 per 100 person years, whereas for 381 543 person years associated with antidepressant use the incidence was 11.2 per 100 person years. The unadjusted rate ratio was 1.38 (95% confidence interval 1.36 to 1.39, P < 0.001). Table 2 also presents data for subgroups by sex, age, initial BMI, comorbidity, coprescribing, deprivation, smoking, and diet advice. While the risk of weight gain without antidepressant use decreased with age and increased with increasing BMI category, the incidence of weight gain was higher for participants treated with antidepressants than for those not treated with antidepressants across all subgroups.

Table 2
Baseline characteristics by antidepressant prescribing and weight gain. Values are frequencies except unless stated otherwise

Figure 1 presents unadjusted and adjusted rate ratios for weight increase according to antidepressant use, as well as estimates for subgroups of covariates. After adjustment for covariates, the rate ratio was 1.21 (95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.22, P < 0.001) indicating that during the entire period of follow-up the risk of ≥ 5% weight gain was 21% higher during antidepressant treatment than at other times. The absolute risk of weight gain without antidepressant use was 8.1 per 100 person years; a rate ratio of 1.21 is consistent with an absolute risk of weight gain with antidepressant use of 9.3 per 100 person years. The risk difference of 1.2 per 100 person years is consistent with a NNH of 59 (95% confidence interval 57 to 65) patient years treated with antidepressants for one episode of weight gain, assuming the association is causal.

Main outcome measures

Antidepressant prescriptions were the exposure of interest. We initially classified these according to section 4.3 of the British National Formulary, including tricyclic and related antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-noradrenaline (norepinephrine) reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and other antidepressant drugs. We then analysed individual antidepressant drugs: mirtazapine, duloxetine, sertraline, venlafaxine, citalopram, fluoxetine, escitalopram, trazodone, amitriptyline, paroxetine, nortriptyline, and dosulepin.

Body weight was the outcome of interest. We evaluated all records of body weight, height, and BMI. If a body weight value was recorded that indicated a weight increase of ≥ 5% compared with the previous year, we classified the calendar year as being associated with weight gain. In the analysis we retained person time not associated with recorded body weight values, incorporating the assumption that weight gain had not occurred. In a sensitivity analysis, we excluded person time with no weight records, so as to provide a "complete case" analysis.

We included several variables as known confounders or effect modifiers in the relation between antidepressant use and subsequent weight gain: sex; initial BMI category; age; smoking status; coprescribing of antiepileptics or antipsychotics; and comorbidities of diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer, and depression. Classifications of presence or absence of cancer, coronary heart disease, and stroke were recorded clinically, or if the participant had been referred to specialist services for management of any of these conditions. We classified diabetes as being present if the condition had been recorded in the dataset clinically, the participant had been prescribed a drug for the control of insulin dependent or non-insulin dependent diabetes, or the participant had been referred to a diabetes clinic. Participants were classified as depressed in each year of follow-up if they were recorded as having depression in a given year. Smoking status was taken from the clinical records, or inferred from referrals to smoking cessation clinics or from prescriptions of devices or drugs for smoking cessation. We also included whether participants had received advice about weight management or diet. Deprivation classification was based on fifths of the English index of multiple deprivation (2010), which evaluates social and material deprivation across seven domains. For subgroup analyses we categorised age into 10 year groups.

### Epidemiology, implications and mechanisms underlying drug-induced weight gain in psychiatric patients [^115hqLiE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2003). Low credibility.

Body weight gain frequently occurs during drug treatment of psychiatric disorders and is often accompanied by increased appetite or food craving. While occurrence and time course of this side effect are difficult to predict, it ultimately results in obesity and the morbidity associated therewith in a substantial part of patients, often causing them to discontinue treatment even if it is effective. This paper reviews the available epidemiological data on the frequency and extent of weight gain associated with antidepressant, mood-stabilizing, and antipsychotic treatment. Possible underlying pathomechanisms are discussed with special attention to central nervous control of appetite including the role of leptin and the tumor necrosis factor system. Metabolic alterations induced by drug treatment such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome are also considered. Weight gain appears to be most prominent in patients treated with some of the second generation antipsychotic drugs and with some mood stabilizers. Marked weight gain also frequently occurs during treatment with most tricyclic antidepressants, while conventional antipsychotics typically induce only slight to moderate weight gain. Serotonin reuptake inhibitors may induce weight loss during the first few weeks, but some of them induce weight gain during long-term treatment. Several antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs are identified which reliably do not cause weight gain or even reduce weight. Based on these insights, countermeasures to manage drug-induced weight gain are suggested.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^11551sF7]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

SSRI (fluoxetine)

Fluoxetine, a SSRI, has weight-reducing effects acutely. Fluoxetine has significant affinity for 5HT2C receptors, which have a role in appetite suppression. In addition, fasting plasma leptin levels (an anorexigenic adipokine) were increased in patients treated with either imipramine or fluoxetine. In an acute experiment, fluoxetine injections in obese and lean rats resulted in reduced food intake. In these rats, fluoxetine significantly reduced NPY levels in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Acute weight loss is due to regulation of the carbohydrate/protein ingestion ratio, which is known to occur through 5HT. Nevertheless, it would be essential to elucidate the mechanism of long-term effect of fluoxetine on body weight, which remains unclear.

### Understanding antidepressant mechanism of action and its effect on efficacy and safety [^111c9Qwb]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

Common side effects of antidepressants, such as weight gain, sexual dysfunction, and fatigue and sleepiness, may be attributable to their mechanisms of action. Antidepressants are neurotransmitter uptake blockers, enzyme inhibitors, and neurotransmitter receptor blockers. Various mechanisms of action can determine how quickly therapeutic benefit becomes apparent and whether certain acute and persistent side effects occur. Understanding mechanism of action can help clinicians select appropriate antidepressants for individual patients and manage adherence problems due to intolerability. Although more research is needed to further elucidate specific antidepressant mechanisms of action, clinicians can use current knowledge to tailor treatment decisions, such as switching patients to a medication with a different mechanism of action when intolerable adverse events are experienced.

### Antidepressant medication use, weight gain, and risk of type 2 diabetes: a population-based study [^111ZnDLB]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

Strengths and limitations

Information on the daily dose of antidepressant medication, based on WHO definitions of average maintenance dose, is an advantage because it enabled determination of the level of exposure to these drugs. Use of records of completed antidepressant prescriptions is also a specific strength, because previous studies have typically relied on information on prescriptions irrespective of whether the patient actually filled them. Our data on antidepressants, being based on physician-prescribed medication that was then purchased by the user from a pharmacy, are likely to be more accurate, although we cannot ascertain the extent to which the medication purchased was actually taken. In this study, comprehensive records on medications and diagnoses of depression and diabetes from national registers unusually covered the entire cohort during the entire follow-up period. Thus, biases related to sample attrition were avoided.

Several limitations to this study are noteworthy. First, the assessment of type 2 diabetes and depression with records from national health registers does not capture nondiagnosed or nontreated diabetes or depression, introducing a source of misclassification. However, an association of antidepressant use and incident diabetes, similar to that found in the present study, has previously been confirmed in a study with glucose-based assessment of incident type 2 diabetes, which will capture case subjects with nondiagnosed and nontreated diabetes.

Second, we assessed weight change using self-reports. Although self-reported weights are correlated with objective weight measurements, there are errors in self-reports that are systematic instead of random, reflecting both roundings to the nearest point of heaping and a tendency to report weights closer to ideal weight. In the present study, the weight change calculated by deducting self-reported weight at follow-up from that at baseline may therefore have, if anything, underestimated large weight changes. The influence of antidepressant use on the accuracy of self-reporting is not known; such impacts could potentially introduce some bias to our results.

Third, other mechanisms beyond weight gain, such as the hyperglycemic effects of noradrenergic activity of antidepressants, may have a role in the increased diabetes risk associated with antidepressants. Further research is therefore needed to examine the entire pathway from antidepressant use to subsequent physical and biochemical changes, including weight gain and the onset of type 2 diabetes. Given that diabetogenic effects are likely to vary depending on a drug's chemical substance, antidepressant-specific analyses, beyond those of SSRIs and tricyclic medication, would be important and should cover, for example, the increasingly popular serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors.

### Fluoxetine for adults who are overweight or obese [^112Jw65T]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluoxetine is a serotonin reuptake inhibitor indicated for major depression. It is also thought to affect weight control: this seems to happen through appetite changes resulting in decreased food intake and normalisation of unusual eating behaviours. However, the benefit-risk ratio of this off-label medication is unclear.

Objectives

To assess the effects of fluoxetine for overweight or obese adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, the ICTRP Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization (WHO) ICTRP Search Portal. The last date of the search was December 2018 for all databases, to which we applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the administration of fluoxetine versus placebo, other anti-obesity agents, non-pharmacological therapy or no treatment in overweight or obese adults without depression, mental illness or abnormal eating patterns.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened abstracts and titles for relevance. Screening for inclusion, data extraction and risk of bias assessment was performed by one author and checked by the second. We assessed trials for the overall certainty of the evidence using the GRADE instrument. For additional information we contacted trial authors by email. We performed random-effects meta-analyses and calculated the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Main Results

We identified 1036 records, scrutinized 52 full-text articles and included 19 completed RCTs (one trial is awaiting assessment). A total of 2216 participants entered the trials, 1280 participants were randomly assigned to fluoxetine (60 mg/d, 40 mg/d, 20 mg/d and 10 mg/d) and 936 participants were randomly assigned to various comparison groups (placebo; the anti-obesity agents diethylpropion, fenproporex, mazindol, sibutramine, metformin, fenfluramine, dexfenfluramine, fluvoxamine, 5-hydroxy-tryptophan; no treatment; and omega-3 gel). Within the 19 RCTs there were 56 trial arms. Fifteen trials were parallel RCTs and four were cross-over RCTs. The participants in the included trials were followed up for periods between three weeks and one year. The certainty of the evidence was low or very low: the majority of trials had a high risk of bias in one or more of the risk of bias domains. For our main comparison group - fluoxetine versus placebo - and across all fluoxetine dosages and durations of treatment, the MD was -2.7 kg (95% CI -4 to -1.4; P < 0.001; 10 trials, 956 participants; low-certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between -7.1 kg and 1.7 kg. The MD in body mass index (BMI) reduction across all fluoxetine dosages compared with placebo was -1.1 kg/m² (95% CI -3.7 to 1.4; 3 trials, 97 participants; very low certainty evidence). Only nine placebo-controlled trials reported adverse events. A total of 399 out of 627 participants (63.6%) receiving fluoxetine compared with 352 out of 626 participants (56.2%) receiving placebo experienced an adverse event. Random-effects meta-analysis showed an increase in the risk of having at least one adverse event of any type in the fluoxetine groups compared with placebo (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.42; P = 0.07; 9 trials, 1253 participants; low-certainty evidence). The 95% prediction interval ranged between 0.74 and 1.88. Following fluoxetine treatment the adverse events of dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea were observed approximately twice as often compared to placebo. A total of 15 out of 197 participants (7.6%) receiving fluoxetine compared with 12 out of 196 participants (6.1%) receiving placebo experienced depression. The RR across all fluoxetine doses compared with placebo was 1.20 (95% CI 0.57 to 2.52; P = 0.62; 3 trials, 393 participants; very low certainty evidence). All-cause mortality, health-related quality of life and socioeconomic effects were not reported. The comparisons of fluoxetine with other anti-obesity agents (3 trials, 234 participants), omega-3 gel (1 trial, 48 participants) and no treatment (1 trial, 60 participants) showed inconclusive results (very low certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence suggests that off-label fluoxetine may decrease weight compared with placebo. However, low-certainty evidence suggests an increase in the risk for dizziness, drowsiness, fatigue, insomnia and nausea following fluoxetine treatment.

### Weight gain and associated factors in patients using newer antidepressant drugs [^111FRAUf]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of the present study was to examine weight gain and its association with clinical and sociodemographic characteristics in patients using newer antidepressants.

Methods

The study had a cross-sectional design. A total of 362 consecutive psychiatric patients taking antidepressant drugs for 6 to 36 months were included in the study.

Results

The prevalence rate of weight gain was 55.2%; 40.6% of the patients had a weight gain of 7% or more compared to the baseline. Overall, antidepressant use was significantly related to increased body weight. Specifically, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, venlafaxine, duloxetine and mirtazapine, but not fluoxetine, were associated with significant weight gain. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that lower education status, lower body mass index at the onset of antidepressant use and family history of obesity were independent predictors of weight gain ≥ 7% compared to the baseline.

Conclusions

The study results suggest that patients who take newer antidepressants might have significant problems related to body weight.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^115cD622]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The current study identified that poor/intermediate metabolizer status for CYP2C19 is associated with a 1.7% more weight gain after 6 months than normal metabolizers in patients taking citalopram. This study shows that this remains significant among patients with overweight, where patients with poor/intermediate metabolizer status for CYP2C19 and taking citalopram had a TBWG of 3.0%. There were no disparities in comorbidities across individuals with various metabolizer statuses, and the difference in weight change remained after excluding patients who were using a CYP 450 inducer or inhibitor concurrently, highlighting the importance of the metabolizer status. Our results are generally consistent with previous studies showing the effect of citalopram on body weight. Aldrich et al. conducted a retrospective study using an electronic medical record of 263 youth with anxiety and depression prescribed citalopram. They showed a significant association between poor CYP2C19 metabolizer phenotype and earlier weight gain after 45 days of treatment. The weight changes related to other antidepressants were not connected with the other pharmacogenomic genes of interest.

Our findings are also consistent with previous studies in which fluoxetine and sertraline have shown minimal effects on weight gain. Conversely, paroxetine has demonstrated a greater risk of weight gain. Serretti et al. reported that the mean weight difference during 8 months of treatment was 2.73 kg for paroxetine. These findings were not replicated in our cohort treated with paroxetine; this discrepancy might be explained by the different intervals of the observations in the two studies.

A number of reasons complicate weight changes in individuals receiving depression medication; they may indicate an improvement in those who have lost weight due to their depression, but they can also be a side effect of the treatment. In our study, weight gain was seen in overweight patients on citalopram with poor/intermediate CYP2C19 metabolizer status. Previous research has found that participants who considered their weight status as overweight were more likely to gain weight in the future. We found that weight increase in patients treated with citalopram was significant even after controlling for BMI, indicating the importance of metabolizer status. As a result, it is critical to identify individuals who are prone to weight gain and risk factors that may contribute to it. It is crucial to underline that a decision tool such as pharmacogenomics may be more effective in these individuals as an ad hoc instrument.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^116QDPMQ]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

This retrospective cohort study approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board (IRB 19–001,222) included participants from the Right Drug, Right Dose, Right Time (RIGHT) Study who underwent genetic sequencing of pharmacogenomic genes. The RIGHT study included 11,090 participants, of which 60% were female and 97% were White. For the analyses, we considered participants from the RIGHT Study who had been prescribed citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, or fluoxetine between 2004–2018. From those, we only included patients with a stable weight in the 6 months before starting the SSRI (n = 1,780). Of these, we exclude those who were < 18 years old, patients who did not have at least 6 months of treatment, did not have weight assessed during follow-up, had a history of bariatric surgery, were pregnant, or had a history of anti-obesity therapy (n = 1,117). The final analytic sample included 663 participants (Fig. 1). This study followed the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) reporting guideline (Additional file 2: Table S1).

Fig. 1
Study cohort

Data collection

Three physicians exhaustively reviewed the electronic medical record (EMR) to confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria. For the 663 participants included in the analysis, medication list, height, and body weight were extracted from the EMR, and comorbidities were extracted with ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. Race was self-reported by study participants in the EMR, and race categories (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White) were defined based on the US Office of Management and Budget's Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity. Body weight was extracted in kilograms at the time of prescription (± 2 weeks), three (± 2 weeks), and six (± 2 weeks) months of the initial prescription. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated with the formula weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^115EyDgb]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prescription medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), commonly used to treat depression, are associated with weight gain. The role of pharmacogenomics in predicting SSRI-induced weight gain is unclear.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study from participants in the Mayo Clinic RIGHT study who were prescribed citalopram, paroxetine, sertraline, or fluoxetine, our aim was to evaluate the association of metabolizer phenotype and total body weight after 6 months of SSRIs initiation. We evaluated the metabolizer phenotypes (poor/intermediate, normal, and rapid/ultra-rapid) of the cytochromes P450 enzymes genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 known to influence the metabolism of SSRI medications: CYP2C19 for citalopram, CYP2D6 for paroxetine, CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 for sertraline, and CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 fluoxetine. In addition, we assessed the association of metabolizer phenotype and total body weight change at six months following SSRI prescription using parametric analysis of covariance adjusted for baseline body weight and multivariate regression models.

Results

CYP2C19 poor/intermediate metabolizers prescribed citalopram gained significantly more weight than normal or rapid/ultra-rapid metabolizers at 6 months (TBWG %: 2.6 [95% CI 1.3 — 4.1] vs. 0.4 [95% CI -0.5–1.3] vs. -0.1 [-95% CI -1.5 — 1.1]; p = 0.001). No significant differences in weight outcomes at six months of treatment with paroxetine, sertraline, or fluoxetine were observed by metabolizer status.

Conclusions

Weight gain observed with citalopram may be mediated by CYP2C19 metabolizer status.

### Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder [^112gPLHR]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder acute phase — choosing specific pharmacological treatment: Clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline, which are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of OCD, are recommended pharmacological agents. Although meta-analyses and head-to-head trials suggest greater efficacy for clomipramine than for fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline, the results of head-to-head trials comparing clomipramine and SSRIs directly do not support this impression. Because SSRIs have a less troublesome side-effect profile than clomipramine, an SSRI is preferred for a first medication trial. Although all SSRIs (including citalopram and escitalopram) appear to be equally effective, individual patients may respond well to one and not to another, and reasons for this patient-specific response are unknown; no demographic or clinical variables are sufficiently accurate predictors of treatment outcome to guide selection. In choosing among SSRIs, the psychiatrist should consider safety and acceptability of particular side effects, applicable FDA warnings, potential drug interactions, past treatment response, and co-occurring general medical conditions; for example, paroxetine, the SSRI most associated with weight gain and the most anticholinergic SSRI, would not be the first choice for patients with obesity, diabetes mellitus, constipation, or urinary hesitancy.

Adverse effects

It has been shown that prolong use of antidepressant drugs are associated with development of many adverse effects [Table 3]. While tolerability might be considered different from side effects, the two could also be closely related because side effects from antidepressants are some of the most common factors responsible for the treatment discontinuation. For example, up to 43% of patients with depressive disorder stopped taking antidepressants due to side effects. Therefore, dropout rate and tolerability could be an important indirect hallmark of drug safety. A meta-analysis disclosed that SSRIs had significantly lower dropout rates and adverse events than TCAs. Besides, a network meta-analysis showed that SSRIs were better tolerated than TCAs in patients with depression.

Sexual dysfunction in patients with depression is very complex because it is associated with both the condition and the antidepressant used. Despite the controversy, antidepressant induced sexual dysfunction is an important concern because up to 80% of depressed patients from randomized clinical trials reported sexual side effects. All antidepressants are known to cause sexual dysfunction, though there are minor individual variations among these drugs, but no studies have established that newer antidepressants have lower rates of sexual dysfunction than TCAs. In contrast, a study exhibited that the antidepressants with high serotonin selectivity such as citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine have the highest rates of total sexual dysfunction. Even though imipramine exhibited significantly higher sexual dysfunction than placebo, the rate was lower than the other antidepressants. Nevertheless, an antidepressant bupropion which has no serotonergic effect but dopaminergic effect had a lower risk of sexual dysfunction than other second generation antidepressants.

Other most important adverse effect of antidepressants is weight gain which was reported in different types of antidepressants. Early studies have suggested that newer antidepressants, SSRIs, and SNRIs still have a risk of weight gain, but mirtazapine have less risk of causing weight gain than TCAs. It was commonly known that paroxetine has a higher risk of weight gain amongst the SSRIs, and amitriptyline was thought to cause the most potent weight gain among TCAs.

### Major depression and antidepressant treatment: impact on pregnancy and neonatal outcomes [^111Vi2S1]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use during pregnancy incurs a low absolute risk for major malformations; however, other adverse outcomes have been reported. Major depression also affects reproductive outcomes. This study examined whether 1) minor physical anomalies, 2) maternal weight gain and infant birth weight, 3) preterm birth, and 4) neonatal adaptation are affected by SSRI or depression exposure.

Method

This prospective observational investigation included maternal assessments at 20, 30, and 36 weeks of gestation. Neonatal outcomes were obtained by blinded review of delivery records and infant examinations. Pregnant women (N = 238) were categorized into three mutually exclusive exposure groups: 1) no SSRI, no depression (N = 131); 2) SSRI exposure (N = 71), either continuous (N = 48) or partial (N = 23); and 3) major depressive disorder (N = 36), either continuous (N = 14) or partial (N = 22). The mean depressive symptom level of the group with continuous depression and no SSRI exposure was significantly greater than for all other groups, demonstrating the expected treatment effect of SSRIs. Main outcomes were minor physical anomalies, maternal weight gain, infant birth weight, pregnancy duration, and neonatal characteristics.

Results

Infants exposed to either SSRIs or depression continuously across gestation were more likely to be born preterm than infants with partial or no exposure. Neither SSRI nor depression exposure increased risk for minor physical anomalies or reduced maternal weight gain. Mean infant birth weights were equivalent. Other neonatal outcomes were similar, except 5-minute Apgar scores.

Conclusions

For depressed pregnant women, both continuous SSRI exposure and continuous untreated depression were associated with preterm birth rates exceeding 20%.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^114RV6W9]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Since the US Food and Drug Administration's approval of fluoxetine (Prozac) in 1988, SSRIs have been the most prescribed antidepressants on the market. They act by inhibiting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5HT) uptake. Since then, other SSRIs have emerged in the market, and these include citalopram (Celexa), fluvoxamine (Floxyfral), paroxetine (Aropax) and sertraline (Zoloft). Although SSRIs have been well tolerated by patients because of fewer side effects than previous drug, there is still a substantial profile of adverse drug reactions, such as sexual dysfunction, drowsiness, weight gain, dry mouth, insomnia, fatigue, nausea, dizziness and tremors. The tolerability of a drug can be assessed by discontinuation rates in clinical trials. The discontinuation rate within 2 months for fluvoxamine was ~70%, followed by fluoxetine (45%) and sertraline (40%).

After the successful development of SSRIs, it was proposed that the simultaneous action of selective noradrenaline and serotonin reuptake could provide better efficacy. Thus, antidepressant SNRIs are as effective as TCAs, but side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias and seizures are significantly reduced. SNRIs available on the market include duloxetine (Cymbalta), venlafaxine (Effexor), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq) and milnacipran (Savella).

### Antidepressant utilisation and incidence of weight gain during 10 years' follow-up: population based cohort study [^116y3gAz]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Obesity is an increasing concern worldwide. Between 1975 and 2014 the global prevalence of obesity increased from 3.2% to 10.8% for men and from 6.4% to 14.9% for women. The United States and United Kingdom have among the highest rates of obesity in the world: 69% of US adults are overweight or obese and 36% are obese, and 61% of UK adults are overweight or obese, with the prevalence of obesity increasing from 15% in 1993 to 26% in 2016. Severe obesity is strongly associated with socioeconomic inequality in both the US and the UK. Weight gain and obesity are important public health problems, being associated with increased risk of chronic disease and mortality. Once obesity is established, it is difficult to achieve substantial and sustained weight loss.

### Antidepressant medication use, weight gain, and risk of type 2 diabetes: a population-based study [^112FRK53]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE

To examine antidepressant medication use as a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and weight gain.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS

A series of nested studies within a prospective cohort of 151,347 working-aged men and women including 9,197 participants with continuing antidepressant medication, 224 with severe depression, and 851 with incident type 2 diabetes during a mean follow-up of 4.8 years, as indicated by national health and prescription registers (the Public Sector study, Finland 1995–2005).

RESULTS

In the first analysis, the case subjects were individuals with incident type 2 diabetes compared with matched diabetes-free control subjects. Antidepressant use of ≥ 200 defined daily doses was associated with a doubling of diabetes risk in both participants with no indication of severe depression (odds ratio 1.93 [95% CI 1.48–2.51]) and participants with severe depression (2.65 [1.31–5.39]). In further analyses, the exposed group was antidepressant users and the reference group was nonusers matched for depression-related characteristics. The 5-year absolute risk of diabetes was 1.1% for nonusers, 1.7% for individuals treated with 200–399 defined daily doses a year, and 2.3% for those with ≥ 400 defined daily doses (P trend < 0.0001). An average self-reported weight gain, based on repeated surveys, was 1.4 kg (2.5%) among nonusers and 2.5 kg (4.3%) among users of ≥ 200 defined daily doses (P trend < 0.0001). Separate analyses for tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors replicated these findings.

CONCLUSIONS

In these data, continuing use of antidepressant medication was associated with an increased relative risk of type 2 diabetes, although the elevation in absolute risk was modest.

### Central neuromodulators in irritable bowel syndrome: why, how, and when [^116TbyJk]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In a meta-analysis that evaluated the adverse effects of antidepressants, amitriptyline (relative risk [RR] = 8.74), mirtazapine (RR = 6), and nortriptyline (RR = 2.9) were significantly associated with weight gain compared with placebo. The magnitude of the effect has been quantified in patients receiving low-modest doses of tricyclic antidepressants given for an average of 6 months. There was a mean weight increase of 0.59–1.32 kg/mo, which led to an average total weight gain of 1.36–7.26 kg, depending on drug, dose, and duration of the treatment. Another meta-analysis conducted from studies with antipsychotics found that the use of olanzapine and, to a lesser extent, quetiapine may be associated with significant weight gain compared with placebo. The magnitude of weight gain appears to be dose-related, being more likely at higher doses. It is also more common when combining an antidepressant with an AAP.

Although SSRIs are commonly associated with weight loss at least initially, evidence suggests that paroxetine may induce weight gain. Regarding SNRIs, weight gain appears to be an uncommon adverse effect in patients treated with venlafaxine and duloxetine.

If weight gain occurs during treatment with neuromodulators, reduce the dose of the neuromodulator. Additional options include recommending dietary changes and possibly concomitantly using interventions for treating obesity, such as metformin or glucagon-like peptide 1 agents.

### A large-scale observational comparison of antidepressants and their effects [^112X7FJi]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) represent a diverse class of medications widely prescribed for depression and anxiety. Despite their common use, there is an absence of large-scale, real-world evidence capturing the heterogeneity in their effects on individuals. This study addresses this gap by utilizing naturalistic search data to explore the varied impact of six different SSRIs on user behavior.

Methods

The study sample included ∼508 thousand Bing users with searches for one of six SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) from April-December 2022, comprising 510 million queries. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to examine 30 topics (e.g., shopping, tourism, health) and 195 health symptoms (e.g., anxiety, weight gain, impotence), using each SSRI as a reference. We assessed the relative hazard ratios between drugs and, where feasible, ranked the SSRIs based on their observed effects. We used Cox proportional hazard models in order to account for both the likelihood of users searching for a particular topic or symptom and the associated time to that search. The temporal aspect aided in distinguishing between potential symptoms of the disorder, short-term medication side effects, and later appearing side effects.

Results

Differences were found in search behaviors associated with each SSRI. E.g., fluvoxamine was associated with a significantly higher likelihood of searching weight gain compared to all other SSRIs (HRs 1.85–2.93). Searches following citalopram were associated with significantly higher rates of later impotence queries compared to all other SSRIs (HRs 5.11–7.76), except fluvoxamine. Fluvoxamine was associated with a significantly higher rate of health related searches than all other SSRIs (HRs 2.11–2.36).

Conclusions

Our study reveals new insights into the varying SSRI impacts, suggesting distinct symptom profiles. This novel use of large-scale, naturalistic search data contributes to pharmacovigilance efforts, enhancing our understanding of intra-class variation among SSRIs, potentially uncovering previously unidentified drug effects.

### Antidepressant utilisation and incidence of weight gain during 10 years' follow-up: population based cohort study [^114isVDW]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the long term association between antidepressant prescribing and body weight.

Design

Population based cohort study.

Setting

General practices contributing to the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, 2004–14.

Participants

136762 men and 157957 women with three or more records for body mass index (BMI).

Main Outcome Measures

The main outcomes were antidepressant prescribing, incidence of ≥ 5% increase in body weight, and transition to overweight or obesity. Adjusted rate ratios were estimated from a Poisson model adjusting for age, sex, depression recording, comorbidity, coprescribing of antiepileptics or antipsychotics, deprivation, smoking, and advice on diet.

Results

In the year of study entry, 17803 (13.0%) men and 35307 (22.4%) women with a mean age of 51.5 years (SD 16.6 years) were prescribed antidepressants. During 1836452 person years of follow-up, the incidence of new episodes of ≥ 5 weight gain in participants not prescribed antidepressants was 8.1 per 100 person years and in participants prescribed antidepressants was 11.2 per 100 person years (adjusted rate ratio 1.21, 95% confidence interval 1.19 to 1.22, P < 0.001). The risk of weight gain remained increased during at least six years of follow-up. In the second year of treatment the number of participants treated with antidepressants for one year for one additional episode of ≥ 5% weight gain was 27 (95% confidence interval 25 to 29). In people who were initially of normal weight, the adjusted rate ratio for transition to overweight or obesity was 1.29 (1.25 to 1.34); in people who were initially overweight, the adjusted rate ratio for transition to obesity was 1.29 (1.25 to 1.33). Associations may not be causal, and residual confounding might contribute to overestimation of associations.

Conclusion

Widespread utilisation of antidepressants may be contributing to long term increased risk of weight gain at population level. The potential for weight gain should be considered when antidepressant treatment is indicated.

### Identification of four novel loci associated with psychotropic drug-induced weight gain in a Swiss psychiatric longitudinal study: a GWAS analysis [^115tMMcf]. Molecular Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Compared to the general population, individuals suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorders have a reduced life expectancy of 10–15 years, which is mainly attributable to natural causes including cardiovascular diseases. Multiple risk factors including genetic and environmental susceptibilities (e.g. mental disorder-related factors, such as an unhealthy lifestyle and/or adverse effects of treatment) may explain the observed excessive propensity of patients suffering from mental disorder for developing metabolic diseases. For instance, the use of psychotropic medications, such as antipsychotics (most atypical but also some typical), mood stabilizers (e.g. lithium), and some antidepressants (e.g. mirtazapine) can increase the risk of metabolic disorders, including obesity through various mechanisms. Among the most widespread mechanistic hypotheses, metabolic side effects induced by psychotropic drugs may result from an appetite increase driven in part by pharmacodynamic factors and modifications in the transcription of some hormones involved in energy homeostasis. Over the last twenty years, pharmacogenetics of psychotropic drug induced weight gain has been extensively studied using candidate gene approaches, in particular within dopamine and serotonin receptors. In addition, numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within genes involved in other metabolic pathways (e.g. in enzymes, receptors, or transcriptional coactivators involved in food intake homeostasis) were also associated with weight gain in patients with a mental disorder receiving psychotropic drugs. With the emergence of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in the general population, many additional genetic variants associated with metabolic outcomes such as obesity have been discovered. In particular, this has allowed for the discovery of previously unsuspected genetic variants, such as on the fat mass and obesity (FTO) gene. However, even though GWAS have been a rich source to provide novel candidate genes and pathways, the explained variance by genetics on cardiometabolic phenotypes remains very low. Thus, it appears that the majority of obesity heritability is still unexplained, suggesting that many genetic variants remain to be determined while taking into account the interaction with environmental factors. In particular, a recent review on the genetic overlap between psychiatric disorders and cardiometabolic diseases emphasized the importance of considering gene-environment interactions in the shared pathways between these diseases. Thus, it has been observed that the psychiatric population displays a greater influence of some genetic variants on metabolic features in comparison to the general population, possibly because of an intricate interaction between the mental disorder or the medications used to treat it and metabolic regulation, as well as a higher prevalence of metabolic abnormalities in this specific population.

### Long-term body weight outcomes of antidepressant-environment interactions [^111h1GVw]. Molecular Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

This study suggests that the 'paradoxical' effect of antidepressant treatment in BW in humans when compared with rodents may be explained by the simplified experimental paradigm generally used in rodents, which has not accounted for environmental factors, such as stress and diet, or a meaningfully long follow-up period. We show here that the inclusion of environmental factors after antidepressant treatment may induce long-term weight gain in rodents; therefore, the default explanation that differences in metabolic and neuroendocrine pathways regulating appetite and energy metabolism are required to explain the discrepancy of antidepressant effects in BW between human and rodentsneeds to be revisited, and as such differences may in reality be small or non-existent.

Given that noncompliance to antidepressant treatment seems to be high in the general population (> 50%), our data emphasize the need to examine whether these drugs have effects on BW regulation that persist on a long-term basis after their discontinuation. Alarmingly, SSRI drugs have become so popular that they are already been called 'lifestyle' drugs. In the United States, obesity rates started to increase markedly in the late 1980s, which coincides temporally with the introduction of SSRIs. Yearly increases in the rates of antidepressant dispensingseem to parallel increases in obesity rates; however, detailed analyses of those trends at the population level are required to establish a clinical association.

In conclusion, we propose here that antidepressant treatment, occurring in the context of conditions of high stress and high-fat intake, might be a covert, insidious and long-lasting contributor to weight gain, even after antidepressant drugs are discontinued for a long time, which is compatible with the phenomenon of TDS. Further research is needed to understand the pathways and pathophysiological mechanisms involved in pharmacological–environment interactions underlying the protracted effects of antidepressant drugs on caloric intake and body size and weight. Future studies should also address the role of stress and high-fat diets on long-term BW outcomes during and following antidepressant treatment in clinical settings. It would be particularly important to understand whether long-term BW gain also occurs in animals fed with a variety of different diets, following exposure to stress and time-limited antidepressant treatment.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^113nvhHj]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

MDD

The diagnosis of MDD is made in the presence of five or more of the following symptoms for a continuous 2-week period or longer, as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5): (i) depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day; (ii) significant weight loss/gain or decrease/increase in appetite; (iii) markedly diminished interest or pleasure in almost all activities; (iv) insomnia or hypersomnia; (v) fatigue or loss of energy; (vi) psychomotor retardation or agitation; (vii) feelings of worthlessness; (viii) diminished ability to concentrate or make decisions; and (ix) recurrent thoughts of death.MDD is a complex disorder; its exact pathophysiology remains elusive, as does the mechanism of action of antidepressants. Over many decades, the pathophysiology of MDD was thought to be based on the hypothesis of monoamine depletion, supported by the fact that the monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), a class of antidepressants, restored physiological levels of monoamine in the brain. Although monoamine levels can be restored acutely, within a few hours after treatment, full antidepressant action is achieved only after 3–4 weeks of treatment initiation. This gap between immediate biochemical effects and delayed clinical response fostered the development of new theories for the pathophysiological mechanism of MDD that go beyond the monoamine hypothesis.

### Metabolic, behavioral health, and disordered eating comorbidities associated with obesity in pediatric patients: an obesity medical association (OMA) clinical practice statement 2022 [^117NboeZ]. Obesity Pillars (2022). High credibility.

Anxiety in children with overweight/obesity — epidemiology, screening, and treatment considerations are as follows: Obesity in children is strongly associated with depression and anxiety even after other risk factors are taken into account, with prevalence in the general population 20–25% of youth with the median age of onset 6 years; the frequency (odds ratio) of anxiety in children with obesity is 1.30, children with severe obesity have five times higher risk of anxiety, and anxiety with increased BMI is more common in females than in males. Because of increased prevalence, routine screening for anxiety is recommended in children and adolescents with overweight/obesity, using instruments such as Screen for Child Anxiety Related Disorders (SCARED) (41 items — widely used), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) (7 items), and Spence Children's Anxiety Scale (SCAS) (35–45 items). A child with a positive screen should be referred to a mental health professional; possible treatments include psychotherapy, and if pharmacotherapy is added to the treatment regimen, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first line therapeutic choices, noting that SSRI medications are frequently associated with medication induced weight gain and the choice of SSRI needs to balance effectiveness with a possible exacerbation of weight gain.

### Fluoxetine [^116Y8kmy]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Altered Appetite and Weight

Significant weight loss, especially in underweight depressed or bulimic patients, may be an undesirable result of treatment with fluoxetine.

In US placebo-controlled clinical trials for Major Depressive Disorder, 11% of patients treated with fluoxetine and 2% of patients treated with placebo reported anorexia (decreased appetite). Weight loss was reported in 1.4% of patients treated with fluoxetine and in 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. However, only rarely have patients discontinued treatment with fluoxetine because of anorexia or weight loss [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

In US placebo-controlled clinical trials for OCD, 17% of patients treated with fluoxetine and 10% of patients treated with placebo reported anorexia (decreased appetite). One patient discontinued treatment with fluoxetine because of anorexia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

In US placebo-controlled clinical trials for Bulimia Nervosa, 8% of patients treated with fluoxetine 60 mg and 4% of patients treated with placebo reported anorexia (decreased appetite). Patients treated with fluoxetine 60 mg on average lost 0.45 kg compared with a gain of 0.16 kg by patients treated with placebo in the 16-week double-blind trial. Weight change should be monitored during therapy.

5.7 Increased Risk of Bleeding

SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine, may increase the risk of bleeding reactions. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anti-coagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding reactions related to SNRIs and SSRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Patients should be cautioned about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of fluoxetine and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^111tPtfk]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Major depression is one of the most disabling health conditions internationally. In recent years, new generation antidepressant medicines have become very widely prescribed. While these medicines are efficacious, side effects are common and frequently result in discontinuation of treatment. Compared with specific pharmacological properties of the different medications, the relevance of individual vulnerability is understudied.

Methods

We used data from the Australian Genetics of Depression Study to gain insights into the aetiology and genetic risk factors to antidepressant side effects. To this end, we employed structural equation modelling, polygenic risk scoring and regressions.

Results

Here we show that participants reporting a specific side effect for one antidepressant are more likely to report the same side effect for other antidepressants, suggesting the presence of shared individual or pharmacological factors. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for depression associated with side effects that overlapped with depressive symptoms, including suicidality and anxiety. Body Mass Index PRS are strongly associated with weight gain from all medications. PRS for headaches are associated with headaches from sertraline. Insomnia PRS show some evidence of predicting insomnia from amitriptyline and escitalopram.

Conclusions

Our results suggest a set of common factors underlying the risk for antidepressant side effects. These factors seem to be partly explained by genetic liability related to depression severity and the nature of the side effect. Future studies on the genetic aetiology of side effects will enable insights into their underlying mechanisms and the possibility of risk stratification and prophylaxis strategies.

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^115feS1r]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The second type of factor consisted of liability to traits related to the nature of specific side effects. We tested for the association between PRS for BMI, chronic headaches and insomnia with weight gain, headaches and trouble sleeping as side effects from antidepressants. We found strong evidence for BMI PRS predicting weight gain for all medications. Evidence for headaches and insomnia was moderate, and associations remained heterogeneous across medications and PRS. These observations are consistent with weight gain being a potentially less specific side effect. As discussed above, weight gain is frequently reported for very distinct classes of drugs.

On the other hand, it is unclear whether the heterogeneity observed for headaches and insomnia is due to statistical power. The significant association for headaches was under sertraline, the most reported drug in our sample, which would be consistent with a lack of power underlying the lack of significance for other similar (SSRI and SNRI) pharmacological medications. Genetic risk for insomnia was nominally associated with insomnia from amitriptyline. TCAs are generally associated with drowsiness and fatigue, but people with a higher genetic risk for insomnia were more likely to report insomnia as a side effect from amitriptyline. This may represent a prescribing bias caused by the fact that TCAs are often used (in lower doses) to treat insomnia. We performed a sensitivity analysis by adjusting for whether participants reported taking amitriptyline for insomnia and showed that this did not confound the association we observed. Thus, our observations may be evidence of the genetic risk for insomnia nullifying the energy-lowering effects of amitriptyline. Altogether, our results would suggest that in addition to genetic factors associated with depression, the genetic liability to side effect-related traits, such as BMI for weight gain, also underlie their aetiology. These results further prove the principle of using genetic data to study and predict antidepressant side effects. Genetics-driven prediction of treatment outcomes is one of the major challenges towards achieving precision medicine.

### Drug-induced hyperphagia: what can we learn from psychiatric medications? [^115ijqFc]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

This brief review examines hyperphagia and associated weight gain as undesirable side effects of psychiatric medications; exploring the scope of the problem, proposed mechanisms, and potential interventions. Mechanisms of action appear to include drug-mediated effects on hypothalamic appetite pathways that have been implicated in other etiologies of obesity. There is great individual variation in response to these medications as well as variation in the degree of weight gain within drug classes. Gene polymorphisms may be a key factor in determining individual variations in response. Better understanding of the underlying mechanisms can guide useful interventions. Medication selection and dosing appear to be important strategies to minimize adverse weight gain.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from the published literature report the presence of paroxetine in human milk (see Data). There are reports of agitation, irritability, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to paroxetine through breast milk (see Clinical Considerations). There are no data on the effect of paroxetine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for paroxetine tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from paroxetine tablets or from underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to paroxetine tablets should be monitored for agitation, irritability, poor feeding and poor weight gain.

Data

Published literature suggests the presence of paroxetine in human milk with relative infant doses ranging between 0.4% to 2.2%, and a milk/plasma ratio of < 1. No significant amounts were detected in the plasma of infants after breastfeeding.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Male

Based on findings from clinical studies, paroxetine may affect sperm quality which may impair fertility; it is not known if this effect is reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of paroxetine tablets in pediatric patients have not been established [see Box Warning]. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in three placebo-controlled trials in 752 paroxetine tablets-treatedpediatric patients with MDD.

Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Decreased appetite and weight loss have beenobserved in association with the use of SSRIs.

In placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted with pediatric patients, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients treated with paroxetine tablets and occurred at a rate at least twice that for pediatric patients receiving placebo: emotional lability (including self-harm, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, crying, and mood fluctuations), hostility, decreased appetite, tremor, sweating, hyperkinesia, and agitation.

Adverse reactions upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine tablets in the pediatric clinical trials that included a taper phase regimen, which occurred in at least 2% of patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo, were: emotional lability (including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, mood changes, and tearfulness), nervousness, dizziness, nausea, and abdominal pain.

### Effects of nefazodone on body weight: a pooled analysis of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-and imipramine-controlled trials [^1135t5HR]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that the newer antidepressant drugs may differ with respect to their effects on body weight, especially during long-term treatment. However, the published data about treatment-emergent weight change with the newer antidepressants are limited. Most reports of unexpected selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated weight gain are anecdotal or from small controlled trials. To determine if differences exist among the newer antidepressants, the authors retrospectively analyzed data from clinical trials comparing nefazodone with SSRIs and with imipramine.

Method

Weight change data supplied by Bristol-Myers Squibb from 6 completed clinical trials comparing the antidepressant nefazodone (N = 523) with 3 SSRIs, fluoxetine, sertraline, and paroxetine (N = 513), as well as 3 trials comparing nefazodone (N = 225) with the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine (N = 224) were analyzed. In all studies, nefazodone was found to be equal in efficacy to the comparator antidepressants. Studies that included both acute and long-term treatment phases were included in the analysis. Acute phases of the trials lasted either 6 or 8 weeks, and long-term phases varied in duration from 16 to 46 weeks. The analysis included summarizing the number and percentage of patients in each group with a ≥ 7% change in body weight from baseline at any point in the long-term and acute phases, at endpoint, and at week 16 of the long-term phases.

Results

Using 7% or greater weight change as the measure of clinical significance, 4.3% of SSRI-treated patients had lost weight at any point in the acute phase versus 1.7% of those treated with nefazodone (p = .017). However, at any point during the long-term phase, significantly more SSRI-treated patients than nefazodone-treated patients showed a significant increase in body weight (17.9% vs. 8.3%; p = .003). At any point in the acute phase, significantly more imipramine-treated patients than nefazodone-treated patients had a 7% or greater increase in body weight (4.9% vs. 0.9%; p = .027), and for the long-term phase the comparison yielded 24.5% versus 9.5%. The difference during the long-term phase was statistically significant in women (p = .017), but not in men (p = .078) due to the small numbers of men in each group.

Conclusion

SSRIs caused more weight loss during short-term treatment but more weight gain during long-term treatment. These results lend support to the observation that some antidepressants have a greater expected risk of weight gain than others during long-term therapy.

### Management of medication-induced weight gain [^115Cqx9Y]. Gastroenterology Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Several medications can contribute to weight gain. Medication-induced weight gain can have severe health consequences leading to overweight or obesity, or exacerbation of preexisting obesity and the plethora of obesity-related comorbidities. Weight gain due to medications is potentially avoidable by prescribing medications that are either weight neutral or that lead to weight loss, when appropriate. This article reviews the common classes of medications that contribute to weight gain and discusses alternatives to consider.

Total body weight gain % by metabolizer status

The total body weight gain percentage (TBWG %) at six months for the patients prescribed any SSRIs was 0.7% (-1.4–2.9). When analyzed by medication prescribed, TBWG % at six months for citalopram was 1.1% (-1.3–3.1), paroxetine 0.9% (-1.2–3.3), sertraline 1.1% (-1.0–2.9), and fluoxetine 0.1% (-1.9–2.6). For patients on citalopram, patients who were poor/intermediate CYP2C19 metabolizers gained significantly more weight than normal and rapid/ultrarapid metabolizers (TBWG %: 2.6 [95% CI 1.3 — 4.1] vs. 0.4 [95% CI -0.5–1.3] vs. -0.1 [-95% CI -1.5 — 1.1], respectively; p = 0.001) (Fig. 2). After excluding 3 patients with an inducer or inhibitor of the CYP 450, patients who were poor/intermediate CYP2C19 metabolizers gained significantly more weight than normal and rapid metabolizers (TBWG %: 2.2 [95% CI 1.1 — 4.0] vs. 0.4 [95% CI -0.5–1.5] vs. -0.2 [95% CI -1.3 — 1.4], respectively; p = 0.003). No significant difference was found in TBWG percentage at three or six months according to the CYP2D6 phenotype for paroxetine, fluoxetine, and sertraline, CYP2C9 for fluoxetine CYP2C19 for fluoxetine and sertraline (Table 3).

### Antidepressants and type 2 diabetes: highways to knowns and unknowns [^113MrrtX]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Various mechanisms are proposed for increasing T2D risk due to prolonged use of antidepressants including development of weight gain by TCA. Despite that SSRIs reduce body weight; paroxetine was reported to increase body weight. In addition, depression is regarded as a cofounding factor in patients received antidepressants that may increase T2D risk. Consequently, management of depression by antidepressant agents improves glucose homeostasis and decreases glycated hemoglobin. Of note, antidepressants affect the HPA axis leading to increase cortisol and development of IR. In vitro study demonstrated that SSRIs sertraline and paroxetine inhibit insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and insulin signaling leading to IR. This inhibition correlated with a rapid phosphorylation and activation of a number of Ser/Thr IRS-1 kinases including c-Jun kinases (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). JNK appears as a key player activated by SSRIs because specific JNK inhibitors partially eliminated the effects of these drugs. These findings implicate selected SSRIs as inhibitors of insulin signaling and as potential inducers of IR.

TCA-induced inhibition reuptake of NE causes induction of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Besides, TCA by blocking muscarinic receptor 3 (M3) and alpha-adrenergic (α-1AD) receptor attenuates insulin release and induce hyperglycemia. The insulinotropic effect of ACh results from two mechanisms: one involves a rise in Ca 2+ and the other involves a marked, protein kinase C (PKC) mediated increase in the efficiency of Ca 2+ on exocytosis. A cohort study included 23 non-T2D depressed patients assigned to 11 patients on maprotiline and 12 patients on fluoxetine showed that maprotiline increased body weight and reduce insulin sensitivity as compared to fluoxetine. Therefore, TCA maprotiline leads to more deleterious effects on glucose homeostasis as compared to SSRI fluoxetine. Supporting to this finding, TCA nortriptyline exacerbates glucose dyshomeostasis in T2D patients. However, SSRI fluoxetine had not associated with detrimental effects but is linked with symptomatic hypoglycemia. These findings suggest that antidepressants lead to detrimental effects on glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity with increasing risk for the development of T2D.

5.6 Altered Appetite and Weight

Significant weight loss, especially in underweight depressed or bulimic patients, may be an undesirable result of treatment with fluoxetine.

In US placebo-controlled clinical trials for Major Depressive Disorder, 11% of patients treated with fluoxetine and 2% of patients treated with placebo reported anorexia (decreased appetite). Weight loss was reported in 1.4% of patients treated with fluoxetine and in 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. However, only rarely have patients discontinued treatment with fluoxetine because of anorexia or weight loss [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

In US placebo-controlled clinical trials for OCD, 17% of patients treated with fluoxetine and 10% of patients treated with placebo reported anorexia (decreased appetite). One patient discontinued treatment with fluoxetine because of anorexia [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

In US placebo-controlled clinical trials for Bulimia Nervosa, 8% of patients treated with fluoxetine 60 mg and 4% of patients treated with placebo reported anorexia (decreased appetite). Patients treated with fluoxetine 60 mg on average lost0.45 kg compared with a gain of 0.16 kg by patients treated with placebo in the 16-week double-blind trial. Weight change should be monitored during therapy.

5.7 Abnormal Bleeding

SNRIs and SSRIs, including fluoxetine, may increase the risk of bleeding reactions. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, warfarin, and other anti-coagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding reactions related to SNRIs and SSRIs use have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages.

Patients should be cautioned about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of fluoxetine and NSAIDs, aspirin, warfarin, or other drugs that affect coagulation [see Drug Interactions (7.4)].

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from the published literature report the presence of paroxetine in human milk (see Data). There are reports of agitation, irritability, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to paroxetine through breast milk (see Clinical Considerations). There are no data on the effect of paroxetine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Paxil and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from paroxetine or from underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to paroxetine should be monitored for agitation, irritability, poor feeding and poor weight gain.

Data

Published literature suggests the presence of paroxetine in human milk with relative infant doses ranging between 0.4% to 2.2%, and a milk/plasma ratio of < 1. No significant amounts were detected in the plasma of infants after breastfeeding.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Male

Based on findings from clinical studies, paroxetine may affect sperm quality which may impair fertility; it is not known if this effect is reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of paroxetine in pediatric patients have not been established [see Box Warning]. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in three placebo-controlled trials in 752 paroxetine-treated pediatric patients with MDD.

Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs.

In placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted with pediatric patients, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients treated with paroxetine and occurred at a rate at least twice that for pediatric patients receiving placebo: emotional lability (including self- harm, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, crying, and mood fluctuations), hostility, decreased appetite, tremor, sweating, hyperkinesia, and agitation.

Adverse reactions upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in the pediatric clinical trials that included a taper phase regimen, which occurred in at least 2% of patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo, were: emotional lability (including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, mood changes, and tearfulness), nervousness, dizziness, nausea, and abdominal pain.

### Association between CYP metabolizer phenotypes and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors induced weight gain: a retrospective cohort study [^115AKMZi]. BMC Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

In addition to the CYP genes, other genes related to the serotonin and norepinephrine signaling have been implicated with the therapeutic responses to SSRI. Previous studies have evaluated the effect of genetic variants on change in depressive symptoms and found significant associations with several variants in the serotonin receptor gene (HTR2A) and the response to escitalopram, the norepinephrine transporter gene (SLC6A2) and the response to nortriptyline, and the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NR3C1) and the response to both nortriptyline and escitalopram. Here, we did not evaluate the effect of genetic variants that may affect the response to drugs with different mechanisms of action. Studies have also examined genes related to weight gain and SSRIs, such as catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1), HTR2C, and serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4). The evidence shows that GG COMT and AA TPH1 genotypes have more weight gain outcomes than HTR2C and SLC6A4 polymorphism. Our research did not cover the effect of other genes involved in the SSRI metabolisms; therefore, further research focusing on other enzymes involved in the SSRI metabolism is needed to understand the variability in weight gain response to this class of medication. The study's strengths include a high level of detail regarding CYP genotypes polymorphisms and weight loss outcomes and complications after bariatric surgery. It is, to our knowledge, the largest research evaluating weight change outcomes, combining the administration of CYP inducers and inhibitors at the same time.

Weight Gain

Potential consequences of weight gain should be considered prior to starting olanzapine and fluoxetine capsules. Patients receiving olanzapine and fluoxetine should receive regular monitoring of weight.

Adults - In an analysis of 7 controlled clinical studies, 2 of which were placebo-controlled, the mean weight increase for olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients was greater than placebo-treated patients [4 kg (8.8 lb) vs -0.3 kg (-0.7 lb)]. Twenty-two percent of olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients gained at least 7% of their baseline weight, with a median exposure to event of 6 weeks. This was greater than in placebo-treated patients (1.8%). Approximately 3% of olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients gained at least 15% of their baseline weight, with a median exposure to event of 8 weeks. This was greater than in placebo-treated patients (0%). Clinically significant weight gain was observed across all baseline Body Mass Index (BMI) categories. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 2.5% of olanzapine and fluoxetine-treated patients and 0% of placebo-treated patients.

In long-term olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination studies (at least 48 weeks), the mean weight gain was 6.7 kg (14.7 lb) (median exposure of 448 days, N = 431). The percentages of patients who gained at least 7%, 15% or 25% of their baseline body weight with long-term exposure were 66%, 33%, and 10%, respectively. Discontinuation due to weight gain occurred in 1.2% of patients treated with olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination following at least 48 weeks of exposure.

### Clinical risk factors for weight gain during psychopharmacologic treatment of depression: results from 2 large German observational studies [^116uD13f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Weight gain during psychopharmacologic treatment has considerable impact on the clinical management of depression, treatment continuation, and risk for metabolic disorders. As no profound clinical risk factors have been identified so far, the aim of our analyses was to determine clinical risk factors associated with short-term weight development in 2 large observational psychopharmacologic treatment studies for major depression.

Method

Clinical variables at baseline (age, gender, depression psychopathology, anthropometry, disease history, and disease entity) were analyzed for association with percent change in body mass index (BMI; normal range, 18.5 to 25 kg/m(2)) during 5 weeks of naturalistic psychopharmacologic treatment in patients who had a depressive episode as single depressive episode, in the course of recurrent unipolar depression or bipolar disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. 703 patients participated in the Munich Antidepressant Response Signature (MARS) project, an ongoing study since 2002, and 214 patients participated in a study conducted at the University of Muenster from 2004 to 2006 in Germany.

Results

Lower BMI, weight-increasing side effects of medication, severity of depression, and psychotic symptoms could be identified as clinical risk factors associated with elevated weight gain during the initial treatment phase of 5 weeks in both studies. Based on these results, a composite risk score for weight gain consisting of BMI ≤ 25 kg/m(2), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17-item) score > 20, presence of psychotic symptoms, and administration of psychopharmacologic medication with potential weight-gaining side effects was highly discriminative for mean weight gain (F4,909 = 26.77, P = 5.14E-21) during short-term psychopharmacologic treatment.

Conclusions

On the basis of our results, depressed patients with low to normal BMI, severe depression, or psychotic symptoms should be considered at higher risk for weight gain during acute antidepressant treatment. We introduce a new risk score that might be considered in psychopharmacologic decisions for the prevention of weight gain and resulting metabolic disorders.

### Evidence-based somatic treatment of depression in adults [^114UFwJ5]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

The efficacy of antidepressants has become a contentious topic over the last decade, and yet a review of the literature shows that they are consistently more effective than placebo. Although the average magnitude of this effect is unclear, many individual patients respond well to a course of antidepressants, and relapse when the medication is discontinued. Choosing the right antidepressant for a given patient remains more art than science, but the studies reviewed here provide some helpful guidance. Table 4 lists the second-generation antidepressants along with potential reasons for choosing one over the other (based on side effects, costs, or possible therapeutic advantages.) Based on these data, the following conclusions can be drawn:

- For an all-around first-line antidepressant, sertraline is hard to beat, given its combination of efficacy, tolerability, and low expense. Once escitalopram becomes generic, it will join sertraline in this category.
- Bupropion is often a first-line alternative to sertraline, because of its lack of sexual side effects; although it has less efficacy for anxiety disorders, it is helpful for other comorbidities, such as tobacco dependence and attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder.
- Both paroxetine and mirtazepine are often maligned because of side effects of sedation and weight gain; however, these side effects may be advantageous for those whose depressive symptoms include insomnia and excessive weight loss.
- Although not specifically reviewed in this article, certain antidepressants are liable to cause more drug–drug interactions than others; the most prominent of these are fluoxetine, paroxetine, and fluvoxamine.

### Behavioral interventions for antipsychotic induced appetite changes [^116sTGgN]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Potential Drivers of Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain and Increased Appetite

Identifying Receptors Facilitating Weight Gain

Of the FGAs, low-potency phenothiazines such as chlorpromazine carry the highest risk of increasing weight. Chlorpromazine may even increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2- diabetes. On the other hand, the risk of weight gain is relatively low with high-potency FGAs such as perphenazine, fluphenazine and haloperidol. Of the SGAs, clozapine and olanzapine are most likely to increase weight, appetite and to stimulate overeating. Both drugs also increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2- diabetes. Quetiapine, risperidone, paliperidone, asenapine, iloperidone and sertindole can also increase weight but to a lesser extent. These drugs are currently not associated with an increased risk of metabolic syndrome. Ziprasidone, amisulpride and aripiprazole and possibly lurasidone belong to a third category of antipsychotic drugs in which the risk of weight gain and appetite increase tends to be low or negligible.

Blockade of dopamine (D2 and D3), serotonin (5HT2c), muscarinic (M3) and histamine (H1) receptors have all been implicated to increase appetite. Weight gain liability seems inversely correlated to the specificity of the receptor profile of the antipsychotic drugs; the more receptors targeted, the less specific the drug and the more likely weight gain. Thus it is the non-specificity of an individual drug rather than the categorization into FAGs and SAGs that predict weight gain liability or metabolic risk. Nonetheless, even drugs antagonizing only dopamine receptors (amisulpride, pimozide, etc.) show at least some propensity for weight gain.

### Antidepressants for anorexia nervosa [^117GrDLL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Anorexia Nervosa (AN) is an illness characterised by extreme concern about body weight and shape, severe self-imposed weight loss, and endocrine dysfunction. In spite of its high mortality, morbidity and chronicity, there are few intervention studies on the subject.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of antidepressant drugs in the treatment of acute AN.

Search Strategy

The strategy comprised of database searches of the Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE (1966 to April 28th, 2005), EMBASE (1980 to week 36, 2004), PsycINFO (1969 to August week 5, 2004), handsearching the International Journal of Eating Disorders and searching the reference lists of all papers selected. Personal letters were sent to researchers in the field requesting information on unpublished or in-progress trials.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials of antidepressant treatment for AN patients, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV) or similar international criteria, were selected.

Data Collection and Analysis

Quality ratings were made giving consideration to the strong relationship between allocation concealment and potential for bias in the results; studies meeting criteria A and B were included. Trials were excluded if non-completion rates were above 50%. The standardised mean difference and relative risk were used for continuous data and dichotomous data comparisons, respectively. Whenever possible, analyses were performed according to intention-to-treat principles. Heterogeneity was tested with the I-squared statistic. Weight change was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were severity of eating disorder, depression and anxiety symptoms, and global clinical state. Acceptability of treatment was evaluated by considering non-completion rates.

Main Results

Only seven studies were included. Major methodological limitations such as small trial size and large confidence intervals decreased the power of the studies to detect differences between treatments, and meta-analysis of data was not possible for the majority of outcomes. Four placebo-controlled trials did not find evidence that antidepressants improved weight gain, eating disorder or associated psychopathology. Isolated findings, favouring amineptine and nortriptyline, emerged from the antidepressant versus antidepressant comparisons, but cannot be conceived as evidence of efficacy of a specific drug or class of antidepressant in light of the findings from the placebo comparisons. Non-completion rates were similar between the compared groups.

Authors' Conclusions

A lack of quality information precludes us from drawing definite conclusions or recommendations on the use of antidepressants in acute AN. Future studies testing safer and more tolerable antidepressants in larger, well designed trials are needed to provide guidance for clinical practice.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride (Paroxetine) [^111ckWWF]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Exposure to SSRIs, particularly later in pregnancy, may have an increased risk for PPHN. PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality.

Animal Data

Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 8 (rat) and less than 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD – 60 mg) on an mg/m2basis.

These studies have revealed no evidence of developmental effects. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day which is less than the MRHD on an mg/m2basis. The no effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these deaths is not known.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Data from the published literature report the presence of paroxetine in human milk (see Data). There are reports of agitation, irritability, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to paroxetine through breast milk (see Clinical Considerations). There are no data on the effect of paroxetine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for paroxetine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from paroxetine or from underlying maternal condition.

Clinical Considerations

Infants exposed to paroxetine should be monitored for agitation, irritability, poor feeding and poor weight gain.

Data

Published literature suggests the presence of paroxetine in human milk with relative infant doses ranging between 0.4% to 2.2%, and a milk/plasma ratio of < 1. No significant amounts were detected in the plasma of infants after breastfeeding.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

Infertility

Male

Based on findings from clinical studies, paroxetine may affect sperm quality which may impair fertility; it is not known if this effect is reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)].

### Sex-specific association between antidepressant use and body weight in a population-based study in older adults [^116264Ts]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To investigate the association between antidepressant use and body weight in a population-based study in older adults.

Method

All participant records (N = 7,269) from the prospective Rotterdam Study with data on anthropometrics and current depressive symptoms were studied post hoc (data were collected between September 1993 and December 2011). The association between antidepressant use, derived from pharmacy records, and change in body mass index (BMI) between repeated examination rounds was analyzed. Current depressive symptoms (assessed by questionnaire) and baseline BMI (for the change in BMI analysis only) were deemed important covariates. Additional analyses were stratified by sex and restricted to long-term use (≥ 90 days) and by level of binding affinity to the serotonin reuptake transporter (denoted as hSERT antidepressants).

Results

Participants who used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, n = 198) had a larger increase in BMI compared to nonusers (+0.74 and +0.23 kg/m(2), respectively, P < .001) between repeated examination rounds. No change in BMI was observed for users of tricyclic antidepressants (n = 146) and other antidepressants (n = 57) compared to nonusers. Weight gain was observed only in women who were treated for ≥ 90 days with hSERT antidepressants or SSRIs, and not in men (P value for interaction = .002).

Conclusions

Within our study of older adults, hSERT antidepressants were associated with an increased body weight in women, which is supported by the biological function of serotonin in weight control and the differences in serotonergic signaling between males and females.

### Is increased antidepressant exposure a contributory factor to the obesity pandemic? [^111sAi6d]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Antidepressants

In 1950s, the antidepressant effects of MAOIs were first discovered when tuberculosis patients were treated with iproniazid. Shortly after iproniazid treatment initiation, patients experienced an antidepressant-like effect with elevated mood. Subsequently, it was shown that iproniazid is a MAOI, with the ability to inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase to catabolise monoamines, preventing monoamine depletion in the brain. Since then, it has been hypothesised that a depletion in other neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin contributes to cause MDD. There are different classes of antidepressant drugs, and, primarily, they have been known to work by modulating neurotransmitter levels in the brain. Older generation antidepressants include MAOIs and tricyclics (TCAs), whereas newer types of antidepressants have greater specificity and include selective reuptake inhibitors (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, SSRI), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitors. Other antidepressants include tetracyclics and serotonin antagonist and reuptake inhibitors.

Currently, non-selective MAOIs on the market include phenelzine (Nardil), isocarboxazid (Marplan) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). Selective MAOIs include selegiline (Emsam) and clorgyline. However, the use of such drugs declined because of their serious side effects, such as those related to food and drug interactions. MAOIs are used as a third or fourth line of the therapy when other types of therapy have failed.

The therapeutic action of TCAs is known to occur via inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. These include imipramine (Tofranil), amitriptyline (Elavil), nortiptyline (Allegron), trimipramine (Surmontil), protriptyline (Concordin) and iprindole (Prondol). However, TCAs have multiple nonspecific actions that are associated with side effects. These nonspecific actions include anticholinergic–antimuscarinic (M1), α-1 adrenergic antagonistic and antihistaminergic activities (H1). Furthermore, large doses of TCAs inhibit sodium channels, leading to lethal cardiac arrhythmias and seizures. For this reason, TCA antidepressants are used with caution in patients with high risk of CVD. Moreover, TCA-induced weight gain is one of the main reasons for the discontinuation of treatment within 1 month.

### Olanzapine and fuoxetine (olanzapine and fluoxetine) [^11677u6r]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Table 15 shows data on adolescent weight gain with olanzapine pooled from 6 clinical trials. The data in each column represent data for those patients who completed treatment periods of the durations specified. Little clinical trial data is available on weight gain in adolescents with olanzapine beyond 6 months of treatment.

5.6 Serotonin Syndrome

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including olanzapine and fluoxetine, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e. MAOIs [see Contraindications (4.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone.

Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea).

The concomitant use of olanzapine and fluoxetine with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate olanzapine and fluoxetine in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking olanzapine and fluoxetine, discontinue olanzapine and fluoxetine before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications (4.1) and Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Monitor all patients taking olanzapine and fluoxetine for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with olanzapine and fluoxetine and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of olanzapine and fluoxetine with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms.

### Topiramate treatment for SSRI-induced weight gain in anxiety disorders [^116p143M]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), have been associated with significant weight gain, a problem that frequently leads to noncompliance and premature discontinuation of treatment. Topiramate is a novel anticonvulsant that has also been used as a mood stabilizer and augmentation agent in mood disorders. Topiramate has been observed to have an interesting side effect of weight loss in some individuals. In this study, topiramate was added to the treatment regimen of patients with a primary DSM-IV anxiety disorder who had experienced substantial SSRI-induced weight gain, in an attempt to induce weight loss.

Method

Topiramate was added to SSRI treatment in 15 anxiety disorder patients, starting at a dose of 50 mg/day and titrating up to a target daily dose of 100 mg/day, with a maximum dose of 250 mg/day. Subjects' weight was measured at baseline and after 5 and 10 weeks of treatment.

Results

Before topiramate treatment, SSRI-treated subjects in this sample had gained a mean of 13.0 ± 8.4 kg (28.6 ± 18.5 lb). After the addition of a mean dose of 135.0 ± 44.1 mg/day of topiramate for approximately 10 weeks, subjects lost a mean of 4.2 ± 6.0 kg (9.3 ± 13.3 lb).

Conclusion

Topiramate may have a role in managing SSRI-induced weight gain in anxiety disorder patients.

Total body weight gain % by metabolizer status among BMI groups

Table 4 details the effect of metabolizer status and TBWG % after six months for each medication by BMI group. Patients in the overweight group that were prescribed citalopram who were poor/intermediate CYP2C19 metabolizers gained significantly more weight than normal and rapid metabolizers (TBWG %: 3.0 [95% CI -0.3–6.4] vs. -0.3 [95% CI -2.1–1.5] vs. 1.3 [95% CI -3.6–1.1], respectively; p = 0.02). We did not observe any significant difference in TBWG % between metabolizer status among patients in the underweight, normal weight, or obesity group taking citalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, or paroxetine (Table 5).

### Understanding genetic risk factors for common side effects of antidepressant medications [^1172J6uY]. Communications Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we aimed at gaining insights into the genetic aetiology of self-reported antidepressant adverse side effects. Our study has several insights, including (1) providing prevalence estimates for side effects outside of a controlled clinical trial; (2) assessing drug-class specificity of antidepressant side effects; (3) testing and providing evidence for non-specific factors (i.e. not related to the type of medication), which is of particular interest for some side effects such as suicidality; and 4) testing for genetic factors underlying the aetiology of side effects using PRS. We identified the most common side effect to be reduced sexual drive or function, followed by weight gain. Reduced sexual function was most prevalent among males taking paroxetine, an SSRI, whereas weight gain was the most prevalent among females taking amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). These findings are consistent with research findings showing SSRIs exhibit the most adverse sexual effects, whereas TCAs have been established to cause weight increases.

Studies have suggested that SSRI-based sexual dysfunction may result in 40–65% of individuals ceasing treatment. It is hypothesised that testosterone and dopamine neurotransmitters are dysregulated by SSRIs, a plausible hypothesis considering the role that testosterone plays in sexual function and the high amounts circulating in males compared to females. Moreover, serotonin plays a crucial role in initiating smooth muscle contraction of the genito-urinary system and regulating the response of the sexual cycle; thus, exogenous substances such as SSRIs that alter these mechanisms may cause sexual dysfunction in both males and females. SNRIs have been reported to lead to more dizziness, trouble sleeping and dry mouth than SSRIs. We found a higher prevalence for dizziness and sweating from venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine (SNRIs) compared to other antidepressants.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with major and persistent depressive disorders [^1164f9wq]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) — adverse effects and initiation — are generally well tolerated, with most adverse effects emerging within the first few weeks and including dry mouth, nausea, diarrhea, heartburn, headache, somnolence, insomnia, dizziness, vivid dreams, changes in appetite, weight loss or gain, fatigue, nervousness, tremor, bruxism, and diaphoresis; potentially serious adverse effects include suicidal thinking and behavior, behavioral activation/agitation, hypomania, mania, sexual dysfunction, seizures, abnormal bleeding, and serotonin syndrome; it may be helpful when starting a new SSRI to begin with a sub-therapeutic dose to minimize adverse effects, and because early adverse effects and delayed efficacy can prompt discontinuation, it is important to provide education about the time-course of improvement and adverse effects; although SSRIs have a greater margin of safety in overdose than other antidepressants, deaths have been reported after very large ingestions.

### First-line antidepressants tied to minor differences in weight gain… [^117172dd]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

10. 1001/jama.
2024. 13390 Weight gain is a common adverse effect of antidepressants and might contribute to some patients stopping the medications. Now, a new observational study focused on the effects of 8 first-line antidepressants found that some types were associated with a greater chance of weight gain in patients than others. People who began taking the antidepressants escitalopram, paroxetine, and duloxetine tended to gain slightly more weight — up to about 0. 4 kg — after 6 months of using the medications compared with those who used sertraline, the researchers reported in Annals of Internal Medicine. They were also at a 10% to 15% higher risk of gaining at least 5% of their baseline weight, according to data involving more than 183 100 participants.

Sertraline was the most commonly prescribed antidepressant in the database the researchers used and was linked with an average increase of more than 1. 5 kg after 2 years. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### Do weight changes occur with long-term fluoxetine… [^113X8RQH]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Data are limited concerning weight changes that occur beyond the acute phase of treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Michelson and associates analyzed changes in weight among patients who received long-term fluoxetine therapy. Data were obtained from a study that initially included 839 patients who entered the 12-week acute-therapy phase of the study. After remission of depression had been achieved, 395 patients were randomly assigned to continuation of fluoxetine therapy, in a dosage of 20 mg daily, or placebo. Therapy was given for as long as 50 weeks. Weight was assessed at each visit during the initial 12 weeks of acute treatment and at the 14th, 26th and 38th weeks during the continuation phase of therapy. Weight changes in the fluoxetine and placebo groups during the continuation period were compared. A small but significant weight gain occurred during the week following entry into the study but preceding the initiation of fluoxetine therapy.

For all patients thereafter, a small but significant decrease in weight occurred during the 12 weeks of the acute-treatment phase. Data on patients who completed 38 weeks of continuation therapy revealed that weight loss occurred primarily during the initial four weeks of therapy. It was followed by stabilization of weight. Significant weight gain occurred in the treatment and placebo groups from the beginning of continuation therapy to 38 weeks of continuation therapy. Patients who received fluoxetine gained less weight than patients who received 12 weeks of fluoxetine therapy followed by 14 weeks of placebo, but it was not a significant value. Patients in each of the groups gained a mean of approximately 3 kg during the 50 weeks of follow-up. The authors conclude that after recovery from acute depression, patients are likely to experience modest weight gain that increases over time.

Fluoxetine may initially be associated with weight loss but does not appear to be associated with specific effects on weight during long-term therapy, even up to one year. The authors suggest that the weight gain during the continuation phase in the fluoxetine and placebo groups is consistent with previous studies. Recovery from acute depression is also associated with increased appetite, which could lead to increased food intake and weight gain.

### Reasons for discontinuation or change of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors… [^116wXzdT]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

This qualitative study of 667 online drug reviews found that the most common reason for discontinuing SSRI use or switching to another SSRI was adverse events experienced, and the most common reason for dose change was titration. Adverse events categorized under psychiatric disorders, investigation results, and reproductive system and breast disorders appeared disproportionately more often in online drug reviews than in US and UK regulatory adverse event reporting data. Most authors 625 were patients. The most common reason for medication discontinuation or switching was adverse events experienced, and the most common reason for dose change was titration. Both uptitration and downtitration were initiated by either a health care professional or patient.

The most common adverse events were classified by SOC codes as psychiatric disorders, including insomnia, loss of libido, and anxiety. Compared with those in regulatory data, psychiatric adverse events, adverse events recorded by investigations and adverse events associated with the reproductive system were reported disproportionately more often. For those with multiple paths, the primary SOC code was selected. Many SOC code categories contain the term "disorders, " although we acknowledge that adverse events are rarely disorders. In addition, the SOC code "investigations" is used for test results and includes weight, hormone, and lipid analyses. We collected data on the days from starting the medication until an adverse event occurrence, whether the adverse event stopped after drug discontinuation, whether the patient restarted the drug and, if so, whether the adverse event recurred.

We categorized withdrawal symptoms separately from adverse events. The differences in percentage points did not differ substantially between MHRA and the website. However, the code psychiatric disorders was more prevalent in the website as was investigations. However, the people posting on the health website were more likely to report weight gain and sexual dysfunction or loss of libido. Reports from the health website may reflect adverse events that are more likely to lead to medication discontinuation or that may not be reported as commonly to regulatory agencies due to, for example, patient embarrasment29 or the adverse event being deemed so well-known that another report is thought not to be worthwhile.

### Weight gain differs with various antidepressants… [^115xa4Yr]. jp.reuters.com (2014). Low credibility.

NEW YORK
- People who take antidepressants tend to put on a few pounds, a new study confirms, and some of the drugs are linked to more weight gain than others. Using health records from one New England healthcare system, researchers studied 19, 244 adults treated with antidepressants, recording their weights over the course of a year. The results showed that people taking citalopram, from a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, gained more than two and a half pounds, on average. Other SSRIs were associated with weight gain similar to citalopram, with people taking fluoxetine gaining on average a pound and a half and those taking sertraline gaining nearly two pounds, the authors write in JAMA Psychiatry. On the other hand, people taking bupropion lost on average nearly half a pound.

The tricyclic antidepressants nortriptyline and amitriptyline were also linked with significantly less weight gain than the SSRIs. "Our study provides more support for the idea that if weight is a major concern, Wellbutrin is a good option, " senior author Dr. Roy Perlis told Reuters Health. Perlis is a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and director of the Center for Experimental Drugs and Diagnostics at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. "There's no question we see less weight gain with Wellbutrin, " he said. "But in absolute terms, the difference is rather small. " On average, people taking antidepressants "will gain a very modest amount of weight. between half a pound and perhaps two pounds if they stayed on the medicine for about a year, " he said. But some people will gain much more, he said. "We in practice have long since watched the effect of antidepressants on weight, " Dr. Anne Peters told Reuters Health.

"The key to this medicine is don't overmedicate; don't use drugs unless there's a good reason. " Peters directs the University of Southern California Clinical Diabetes Program in Beverly Hills and was not involved in the current study. Peters noted that Wellbutrin can agitate anxious people and therefore may be a poor match for some people with depression. Wellbutrin affects different brain chemicals than do SSRIs, and some of those chemicals may play a role in appetite. Researchers don't know all the reasons why some antidepressants appear to cause weight gain and others do not, Perlis said.
