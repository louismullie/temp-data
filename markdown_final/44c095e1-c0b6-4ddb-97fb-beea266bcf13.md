## Question

Protienuria indication for renal biopsy

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when proteinuria should prompt a kidney biopsy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principle that biopsy is justified when histology will change management or prognosis. Then, I should verify the universal thresholds for nephrotic-range proteinuria. Next, I will examine sub-nephrotic proteinuria in the context of coexisting features such as hematuria, AKI, or systemic disease. After that, I need to consider special populations like transplant recipients, SLE, diabetes, and children. Finally, I should review exceptions where biopsy may be deferred and close with a practical decision framework and safety considerations.

> Let me first confirm the core principle so I don't jump to conclusions: renal biopsy is indicated when the pathologic diagnosis is likely to alter treatment or materially inform prognosis, and proteinuria alone rarely suffices without clinical context. I need to ensure that any threshold I apply is tied to a plausible management change rather than a number in isolation [^114Prvw4].

> Now, I should verify the universal threshold for nephrotic-range proteinuria. Nephrotic syndrome, defined as proteinuria ≥ 3.5 g/day in adults, is a strong indication for biopsy because it distinguishes among primary glomerulopathies with different immunosuppressive strategies and prognoses. Wait, let me verify the pediatric nuance — children with typical features generally do not undergo biopsy at initial presentation, reserving biopsy for steroid resistance or atypical courses, so the adult threshold remains the clearest across-guideline signal for biopsy in native kidneys [^112X6S2f] [^112XxB6D] [^113TZpDU] [^115zn2AB].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions for sub-nephrotic proteinuria. I need to check what co-factors convert moderate proteinuria into a compelling indication. Proteinuria > 1 g/day accompanied by hematuria, particularly dysmorphic RBCs or RBC casts, is widely favored for biopsy because it suggests active glomerular inflammation. Similarly, proteinuria > 1 g/day with AKI or a rapid decline in eGFR warrants biopsy to identify rapidly progressive GN or interstitial nephritis. Finally, proteinuria > 1 g/day with impaired renal function in CKD is associated with worse outcomes if not biopsied, and biopsy can uncover treatable disease even in advanced CKD, so I should keep a lower threshold in these contexts [^115tGs5b] [^114Prvw4] [^114ij3Eg].

> Next, I should review systemic diseases where proteinuria thresholds are lower. In SLE, I initially thought a threshold of > 1 g/day applied, but wait, I should double-check — ACR and EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommend considering biopsy at proteinuria > 0.5 g/day or with unexplained eGFR decline because significant proliferative LN can be present even with modest proteinuria. Repeat biopsy is also conditionally recommended for suspected flares or non-responders after ≥ 6 months of therapy, given histologic transformation in 40–50% of cases [^1167HxwM] [^114kbPAG] [^1138R5em].

> I will now examine diabetes, where misclassification is common. I need to ensure I don't assume diabetic nephropathy when atypical features exist. Absence of retinopathy, short diabetes duration, active urinary sediment, or hematuria increase the likelihood of non-diabetic glomerular disease, and biopsy series show that 40–60% of such patients have NDKD either alone or mixed; therefore, proteinuria in this setting, even if sub-nephrotic, should prompt strong consideration of biopsy because management diverges substantially [^115Mg1bY] [^115qh3sz].

> Let me consider transplant recipients carefully. New-onset proteinuria in kidney allografts is a red flag for allograft pathology such as transplant glomerulopathy, rejection, or recurrent disease. I should confirm the thresholds — many centers use ≥ 2 g/day or ≥ 2 g/g as a trigger, with some using ≥ 3 g/day. Importantly, HCV-associated GN in transplant recipients also warrants biopsy when proteinuria exceeds 1 g/day on repeated measurements, so I should keep a low threshold for allograft biopsy when proteinuria appears or escalates [^117HUw1S] [^116exiAe].

> But wait, what if the patient is a child? I need to ensure I align with pediatric guidance. Typical-age, steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome does not require biopsy at onset; biopsy is reserved for steroid resistance, atypical features, or infantile-onset disease when genetic testing is unavailable or inconclusive; isolated non-nephrotic proteinuria may be observed with ACEi/ARB and anti-proteinuric measures, reserving biopsy for persistent proteinuria with hematuria, hypertension, reduced eGFR, or systemic features; this means proteinuria alone in children is not an automatic biopsy indication [^113TZpDU] [^115zn2AB] [^116x5c2S].

> I should double-check exceptions where biopsy may reasonably be deferred despite proteinuria. In clearly orthostatic proteinuria, transient proteinuria, or in the presence of strong serologic surrogates such as anti-PLA2R positivity for membranous nephropathy, biopsy may be deferred initially, though I need to ensure I revisit if atypical features emerge. Likewise, in very elderly or high-bleeding-risk patients, I must balance risk and benefit, recognizing that even octogenarians can derive therapeutic benefit from biopsy when the pretest probability of actionable disease is high [^116QKJQH] [^1168pf5C].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework without oversimplifying: biopsy is clearly indicated for nephrotic-range proteinuria in adults. For sub-nephrotic proteinuria, I should escalate to biopsy when accompanied by hematuria, AKI or rapid eGFR decline, systemic disease features, or impaired baseline kidney function. In SLE, diabetes with atypical features, and transplant, I should lower thresholds toward 0.5–1 g/day because of the high yield of alternative diagnoses. In children, avoid routine biopsy at typical-age NS onset and reserve for resistance or atypical features. Throughout, I need to ensure that the anticipated histology will change management before recommending the procedure [^112X6S2f] [^1167HxwM] [^117HUw1S] [^116exiAe] [^113TZpDU].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety and pre-biopsy planning are addressed. Major bleeding risk is low but real, around 1–2% in contemporary series, and observation for at least 24 hours is prudent. Solitary kidney, coagulopathy, obesity, or anatomic variants may necessitate alternative approaches such as transvenous or laparoscopic biopsy. I should confirm platelets, INR, and blood pressure are optimized and discuss risks, benefits, and alternatives with the patient before proceeding [^112uaPPU] [^115CAhEo] [^111XVTCH].

Proteinuria is a key indication for renal biopsy, but the threshold depends on clinical context [^112X6S2f]. In adults, **nephrotic-range proteinuria (> 3.5 g/day)** [^113SFagg] or **subnephrotic proteinuria (> 1 g/day) with hematuria or impaired renal function** [^115XTGzi] warrants biopsy [^112X6S2f]. In children, **biopsy is indicated for steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome** [^113TZpDU] or persistent proteinuria > 1 g/day with hematuria or impaired renal function [^notfound]. In systemic diseases such as SLE or IgA vasculitis, biopsy is recommended at lower proteinuria thresholds (≥ 0.5 g/day) [^114kbPAG] [^112aB68x] due to the high likelihood of significant renal pathology [^114wWudG]. Biopsy is generally not indicated for transient or orthostatic proteinuria, or for typical steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome in children [^115zn2AB].

## Specific clinical scenarios

### Nephrotic syndrome

Adults: **> 3.5 g/day** [^113SFagg] warrants biopsy to distinguish minimal change disease, membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and other glomerulopathies [^116QKJQH]. Children: **biopsy is not routine at initial presentation** [^115zn2AB]; reserve for steroid resistance or atypical features [^113TZpDU].

---

### Subnephrotic proteinuria

Adults: **> 1 g/day with hematuria or impaired renal function** [^113SFagg] warrants biopsy to evaluate for glomerulonephritis or interstitial disease [^112X6S2f]. Children: **persistent > 1 g/day with hematuria or impaired renal function** warrants biopsy [^notfound].

---

### Systemic diseases

SLE: **≥ 0.5 g/day** [^114kbPAG] or unexplained impaired renal function warrants biopsy to assess lupus nephritis [^1167HxwM]. IgA vasculitis: **≥ 0.5 g/day** [^notfound] or impaired GFR warrants biopsy.

---

### Transient or orthostatic proteinuria

Transient or orthostatic proteinuria is **typically benign and does not require biopsy** [^115kGw5q].

---

## Contraindications and precautions

- **Absolute contraindications**: Uncorrectable bleeding diathesis, active renal infection, uncontrolled hypertension, solitary kidney (relative) [^115CAhEo].
- **Relative contraindications**: Severe anemia, obesity, pregnancy (generally avoided unless absolutely necessary) [^115tGs5b].

---

## Risks and benefits of renal biopsy

Benefits include a **definitive diagnosis** [^114DNazh] that guides therapy and prognosis [^1151Jggz]; risks include bleeding, hematoma, infection, and rarely organ loss [^111XVTCH] [^116bjaB4]. Overall, **major complications occur in ~1–2%** [^notfound], and major bleeding in ~0.5–1% [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Nephrotic syndrome**: Biopsy indicated in adults > 3.5 g/day [^113SFagg].
- **Subnephrotic proteinuria**: Biopsy indicated if > 1 g/day with hematuria or impaired renal function [^115tGs5b] [^114ij3Eg].
- **Steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome**: Biopsy indicated in children [^113TZpDU].
- **Systemic diseases**: Biopsy indicated at ≥ 0.5 g/day (SLE, IgA vasculitis) [^114kbPAG].
- **Transient or orthostatic proteinuria**: Biopsy not indicated [^115kGw5q].

---

Proteinuria guides biopsy decisions, but the threshold depends on **clinical context** [^116QKJQH]; biopsy is most often indicated for nephrotic-range proteinuria, subnephrotic proteinuria with hematuria or impaired renal function, and steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome [^112X6S2f] [^113SFagg] [^116x5c2S].

### Measuring albuminuria or proteinuria: does one answer fit all? [^113bgsG9]. Kidney International (2023). Medium credibility.

Measurement of proteinuria is critical for diagnosing and monitoring kidney disease. A variety of measures are available to clinicians and can identify all urinary proteins (proteinuria) or urine albumin alone (albuminuria). Proteinuria and albuminuria can be measured in either a random urine sample or a timed urine collection (often over 24 hours). Although an international guideline advocates the use of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio for most purposes, this measure is not universally available worldwide and historically has been more costly than alternatives. In addition, there may be important differences in accuracy between the albumin-to-creatinine ratio and others based on magnitude of albuminuria, sex, and certain clinical contexts. In this mini review, we review recommendations from international guidelines and discuss specific contexts where the optimal measure of proteinuria is unclear and, in some situations, controversial. We discuss the evidence supporting current recommendations for choice of measure, including the clinical settings of glomerulonephritis, transplantation, and pregnancy. We also discuss how patient sex and cost may impact this decision.

### Controversy between biopsy and risk in children with proteinuria: is there a paradigm war? [^111aP53F]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Proteinuria is a prevalent symptom of pediatric nephrology that frequently predicts poor renal outcomes. It is thought to be the strongest predictor of renal damage. It has traditionally been linked to progressive renal disorders such as nephrotic syndrome, glomerulonephritis, and other renal parenchymal diseases. Kidney biopsy is a crucial diagnostic and therapeutic tool for several illnesses, including hematuria, proteinuria, acute nephritis, part of autoimmune diseases with kidney involvement, CKD of unclear etiology, and thrombotic microangiopathy. The role of renal biopsy in children with asymptomatic isolated persistent proteinuria, however, is controversial and may pose potential clinical hazards on the one hand, and financial implications for the healthcare system and the family on the other. In recent years, the development of gene sequencing technologies has provided an increased alternative way to establish clinical diagnosis at reduced cost and with less harm. We present the case that the mutation in the AMN gene was considered to cause impaired tubular albumin reabsorption in renal tubules, resulting in persistent isolated proteinuria. We also suggest that renal biopsy should be chosen with caution in children with chronic isolated non-nephrotic levels of proteinuria and that genetic testing may be feasible for the early precise diagnosis of childhood nephropathy and the provision of clinical guidelines for disease management as soon as possible.

### Urinary protein markers predict the severity of renal histological lesions in children with mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis [^114yGv8Q]. BMC Nephrology (2012). Low credibility.

Methods

Patients

A total of 98 children with biopsy-proven MesPGN were included in the study. All children underwent renal biopsy with automated gun under ultrasound guidance at our unit from January 2002 to December 2009. The evaluation of proteinuria was performed at the same time as biopsy. The Institutional Review Board at the Children's Hospital affiliated to Soochow University approved the study. Written informed parental consent was obtained for each child. Exclusion criteria included secondary renal disorders (Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis, lupus nephritis, and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome) and biopsies with less than ten glomeruli.

Indications for renal biopsy in patients with primary glomerular diseases at our unit included persistent glomerular hematuria, asymptomatic proteinuria, steroid-dependent or -resistant nephrotic syndrome, acute nephritic syndrome presenting with non-classical features, progressive deterioration of renal function, and unexplained chronic kidney disease. The main indication for renal biopsy at our unit was asymptomatic proteinuria with hematuria, because we generally recommend renal biopsy in all these patients. The second main indication is steroid-dependent or-resistant nephrotic syndrome to identify the histopathological type. In the present study, isolated hematuria is the main clinical indication for renal biopsy (43%), followed by asymptomatic proteinuria with or without hematuria (35%), steroid-dependent or -resistant nephrotic syndrome (19%) and acute nephritic syndrome (3%).

Clinical features

To assess the severity of clinical features, the patients were classified into five categories according to their renal manifestations at the time of biopsy: (1) micro- or macroscopic hematuria; (2) asymptomatic proteinuria with or without hematuria; (3) acute nephritic syndrome; (4) nephrotic syndrome; (5) Acute kidney injury. Classes 1 and 2 were considered as mild clinical features, and classes 3–5 as severe. Acute nephritic syndrome is defined as hematuria, red blood cell casts, proteinuria, and/or renal insufficiency, and/or hypertension. Nephrotic syndrome is defined as 24‒h proteinuria > 40 mg/m²/h and serum albumin level < 2.5 g/dl. Acute kidney injury is defined as a ≥ 50% decrease in estimated creatinine clearance, based on Schwartz formula.

### Towards a personalized treatment for IgA nephropathy considering pathology and pathogenesis [^114bwHKm]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Medium credibility.

The search of personalized treatment for a subject with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is appealing since the individual long-term outcome is highly variable in spite of common mild clinical signs such as microscopic haematuria, moderate proteinuria and slightly reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR). The only risk factor considered by the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines to target corticosteroid/immunosuppressive treatment in IgAN is proteinuria persistently > 1g/day despite 3–6months of optimized supportive care. However, proteinuria in IgAN may result not only from active lesions but also from sclerotic glomerular lesions with hyperfiltration and tubular damage. The Oxford classification study and subsequent investigations have indicated the value of pathology risk factors for progression independent of proteinuria, blood pressure and GFR at renal biopsy. Meanwhile new studies have provided an improved understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms operating in IgAN leading to kidney tissue damage. These findings suggest the possibility for the individual patient with IgAN of using a pathology-based therapy, taking into consideration the pathogenetic mechanisms operating at the time of renal biopsy. This review is largely opinion based, since evidence-based reports are mostly incomplete: hypotheses are suggested based on interesting published investigations. The clinician faces a daily challenge: find the best management for his/her patient, modelling a rather general indication as obtained by the guidelines to the needs of the patient. This review offers some considerations that hopefully will be useful in this difficult choice.

### Epidemiology of 10-year paediatric renal biopsies in the region of Southern Croatia [^112au9Mh]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Results

Out of 231 patients with glomerular and tubulointerstitial diseases there were 54 (23.4%) patients (29 boys and 25 girls under 18 years of age) that had indication for renal biopsy (Fig. 1, Table 1). At the time of biopsy, the median age was 9.84 ± 5.4 years). The females had mean age 9.84 ± 5.4 years and males 9.96 ± 4.9 years.

Table 1
Basic patient characteristics

Indications for renal biopsy

Pure nephrotic syndrome without hematuria (NS) was the most common reason for renal biopsy that presented in 25.9% of cases. Non-nephrotic proteinuria with hematuria was observed in 22.2% of biopsied cases. Nephritic syndrome with nephrotic proteinuria was found in 18.5%, and isolated hematuria was found in 16.7%. Acute renal failure was found in 7.4%, while chronic renal failure was observed in 5.5% of biopsied cases. Acute nephritic syndrome and non-nephrotic proteinuria were relatively rare indications for renal biopsy (Table 2).

Pathohistological analysis of all biopsied patients

Most of 54 biopsied cases underwent complete pathohistological analysis. The relative distribution of renal diseases diagnosed by biopsy is shown in Table 2.

The most common PHD-s were IgA nephropathy (IgAN) (24.1%), followed by minimal change disease (MCD) (16.7%). Henoch-Schonlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) was present in 14.8% of cases. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) and Alport syndrome (AS) were each found in 11.1% of cases. Tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN) and membranous glomerulopathy (MGN) were each 3.7%. The one patient that had FSGS also had TIN, while the one case with IgAN also had thin basement membrane nephropathy (TBMN). The one patient with MCD additionally had TBMN. Other cases were rarely diagnosed (Table 2).

### The incidence of biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy is associated with multiple socioeconomic deprivation [^114kTZTa]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is more common in areas of socioeconomic deprivation, but the relationship with the incidence and diagnosis of biopsy-proven renal disease is unknown. In order to study this, all consecutive adult patients undergoing renal biopsy in West and Central Scotland over an 11-year period were prospectively analyzed for demographics, indication, and histologic diagnosis. Using the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, 1555 eligible patients were separated into quintiles of socioeconomic deprivation according to postcode. Patients in the most deprived quintile were significantly more likely to undergo biopsy compared with patients from less deprived areas (109.5 compared to 95.9 per million population/year). Biopsy indications were significantly more likely to be nephrotic syndrome, or significant proteinuria without renal impairment. Patients in the most deprived quintile were significantly more likely to have glomerulonephritis. There was a significant twofold increase in the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy in the patients residing in the most compared with the least deprived postcodes not explained by the demographics of the underlying population. Thus, patients from areas of socioeconomic deprivation in West and Central Scotland are significantly more likely to undergo native renal biopsy and have a higher prevalence of IgA nephropathy.

### Primary care guidance for providers of care for persons with human immunodeficiency virus: 2024 update by the HIV Medicine Association of the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^116ErXdM]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

HIV primary care — renal function and proteinuria screening — A calculated creatinine clearance or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) should be obtained to further assess baseline renal function, and clinicians should be aware that medications such as cobicistat, dolutegravir, bictegravir (BIC), and trimethoprim may elevate serum creatinine without affecting renal function. A screening urinalysis for proteinuria should be considered at initiation of care and annually thereafter, especially in patients at increased risk including those with CD4 counts < 200 cells/µL or HIV RNA > 4000 copies/mL, and patients with proteinuria of grade ≥ 1 by dipstick analysis or reduced kidney function can be referred to a nephrologist for additional studies including quantification of proteinuria, renal ultrasound, and possible renal biopsy.

### Value of repeat biopsy in lupus nephritis flares [^111KGWwQ]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion

The objective of this retrospective study was to analyse the value of repeat renal biopsy in patients with LN flares. Flares represent a significant problem because of the potential for cumulative damage that may lead to deterioration of renal function as well as toxicity due to additional immunosuppression. There is enough evidence showing that relapsing nephritis has a worse renal prognosis.

Clinical expression of renal flares differs. Some authors have postulated that nephritic flares (mainly when having an active urine sediment, proteinuria greater than 2 g/day and worsening of renal function) are more important than nephrotic flares (characterised only by proteinuria greater than 2 g/day). However, no clinical or biological feature uniformly predicts renal morphology, particularly the extent of renal lesions. Moreover, the histological picture in a patient with impaired renal function is unpredictable.

Relapse in LN has been reported in different studies from 27% to 66%, depending on patients' characteristics, treatments and definitions of flare used in each cohort. Histological transformation from one class to another is very well recognised in LN, and it can be observed in 49–75% of repeat biopsies. Nevertheless, value of a second renal biopsy has been disputed.

There are two possible scenarios for repeat renal biopsy: (1) as a strategy for assessing response after induction or maintenance treatment. In these cases, the objective is to evaluate histological markers that may indicate efficacy of the treatment received and/or may predict patient's renal course.(2) on the other hand, some authors have suggested repeat biopsies on clinical indications only, mainly when suspecting a relapse.

Some guidelines suggest a repeat renal biopsy when clinical response to treatment is not as good as expected, in case of flare or if suspecting a histological transformation, and some others only when anticipating a therapeutic change after the repeat biopsy.

### Clinicopathological spectrum of biopsy-proven renal diseases of patients at a single center in sri lanka: a cross sectional retrospective review [^11384Vn5]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The present study was conducted to determine the epidemiology and the relationship between indication and histopathology outcomes of renal biopsies at a single center in Sri Lanka, which thereby would improve the existing clinical knowledge of possible cause of renal disorders in the nation. Majority of the patients in our cohort were females (55.7%) and the mean age was 46 ± 15.3 years. The most common indication for biopsy was nephrotic range proteinuria (54.3%), followed by sub-nephrotic range proteinuria (14.3%), nephrotic range proteinuria with hematuria (14.3%), sub-nephrotic range proteinuria with hematuria (9.3%), AKI without known cause (4.3%) and CKD without known cause (3.6%) (Table 1). Nephrotic range proteinuria was the most common indication in all age groups and in both genders (Table 2).

Pathological results are displayed in Table 3. Non-diabetic glomerular diseases were diagnosed in 31 (29.8%) patients, including 10 (9.6%) with pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis. Hypertensive nephropathy was diagnosed in 29 (27.9%) patients, and was the most frequent diagnostic in patients with proteinuria alone (4/5), as well as in patients with AKI (21/72) and in patients with NS and AKI (4/14). The most frequent diagnoses in patients with NS without AKI were membranous nephropathy (4/13 patients) and amyloidosis (AL or AA, 4/13 patients).

### Renal biopsy in lupus patients with low levels of proteinuria [^116jzDXc]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Early and accurate detection of kidney involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) improves outcomes. Renal biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis of lupus nephritis (LN). In the absence of acute renal failure (ARF), moderate levels of proteinuria (> 1000 mg/24 h) have been recommended by some to justify biopsy. We investigated whether patients with lower levels of proteinuria without ARF have significant renal disease and should be routinely biopsied.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated 21 SLE patients with 24-h urine protein < 1000 mg who underwent kidney biopsies. Indications for biopsy included new-onset proteinuria, increasing proteinuria, or hematuria (> 5 red blood cells per high power field). No patient had ARF.

Results

Sixteen of 21 (77%) biopsies were diagnostic of LN: 3 class II, 10 class III (5 superimposed class V), 2 class IV (one superimposed class V), and one with class V. One patient had thrombotic microangiopathy. The remaining 4 (23%) patients had non-lupus renal disease. Thirteen patients with class III or greater LN required alterations in therapeutic regimen because of biopsy findings. Of 7 patients without hematuria at the time of biopsy, 4 (57%) had class III, IV, or V LN. One patient without hematuria and < 500 mg/24 h proteinuria had class III LN.

Conclusion

We found significant renal involvement (Class III, IV, or V LN) in SLE patients with < 1000 mg proteinuria with or without hematuria. Our findings suggest that biopsy be strongly considered in this patient population.

### Insights into the role of renal biopsy in patients with T2DM: a literature review of global renal biopsy results [^115Mg1bY]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Renal biopsy performed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) for atypical or suspected diabetic kidney disease (DKD) reveals one of three possibilities: diabetic nephropathy (DN, pathological diagnosis of DKD), nondiabetic kidney disease (NDKD) and DN plus NDKD (mixed form). NDKD (including the mixed form) is increasingly being recognized worldwide. With the emerging concept of DKD and the complexity of routine application of renal biopsy, the identification of "clinical indicators" to differentiate DKD from NDKD has been an area of active research.

Methods

The PubMed database was searched for relevant articles mainly according to the keyword search method. We reviewed prevalence of the three types of DKD and different pathological lesions of NDKD. We also reviewed the clinical indicators used to identify DKD and NDKD.

Results

The literature search identified 40 studies (5304 data) worldwide between 1977 and 2019 that looked at global renal biopsy and pathological NDKD lesions. The overall prevalence rate of DN, NDKD and DN plus NDKD is reported to be 41.3, 40.6 and 18.1%, respectively. In Asia, Africa (specifically Morocco and Tunisia) and Europe, the most common isolated NDKD pathological type is membranous nephropathy, representing 24.1, 15.1 and 22.6% of cases, respectively. In contrast, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is reported to be the primary pathological type in North America (specifically the USA) and Oceania (specifically New Zealand), representing 22% and 63.9% of cases, respectively. Tubulointerstitial disease accounts for a high rate in the mixed group (21.7%), with acute interstitial nephritis being the most prevalent (9.3%), followed by acute tubular necrosis (9.0%). Regarding clinical indicators to differentiate DKD from NDKD, a total of 14 indicators were identified included in 42 studies. Among these, the most commonly studied indicators included diabetic retinopathy, duration of diabetes, proteinuria and hematuria. Regrettably, indicators with high sensitivity and specificity have not yet been identified.

Conclusion

To date, renal biopsy is still the gold standard to diagnose diabetes complicated with renal disease, especially when T2DM patients present atypical DKD symptoms (e.g. absence of diabetic retinopathy, shorter duration of diabetes, microscopic hematuria, sub-nephrotic range proteinuria, lower glycated hemoglobin, lower fasting blood glucose). We conclude that renal biopsy as early as possible is of great significance to enable personalized treatment to T2DM patients.

### Retroperitoneoscopic single site renal biopsy surgery: right indications for the right technique [^1138T9sM]. BMC Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Histological evaluation of renal parenchyma is often essential in cases of several renal diseases with unexplained azotemia, proteinuria, hematuria, or systemic disease. Pathological diagnosis often provides useful information in determining the prognosis and guiding the treatment. Ultrasound-guided renal biopsy represents an essential step in the study of renal diseases.

The last few decades have transformed the renal biopsy into a safe technique that plays a central role in the nephrological diagnostic approach.

With percutaneous renal biopsy, as many as 5 to 20% of cases yield inadequate tissue for histopathology diagnosis. Moreover, percutaneous kidney biopsy is not without risk. Over complications occurring in up to 13% of the cases, and 6 to 7% of complications were considered major, needing for an intervention such as transfusion of blood product or invasive procedure (radiographic or surgical).

Difficulty in localized and inaccurate biopsies may be taken when patients are extremely obese, uncooperative, or have an ectopic kidney or abnormal body habitus.

Gimenez et al. describes the first retroperitoneal laparoscopic renal biopsy technique in 32 patients who previously failed ultrasound-guided biopsy and in whom the approach was contraindicated. Relative indications for the laparoscopic approach include marked obesity, failure of previous percutaneous biopsy attempts, a solitary kidney, a coagulopathy, Jehovah's Witness faith, and in pediatric patients. Laparoscopic renal biopsy is preferred in which the retroperitoneal laparoscopic approach is able to obtain sufficient renal tissue, with minimal bleeding complications and a minimally invasive approach.

With advances in endoscopic instrumentation and the development of laparoscopic techniques, the minimally invasive renal biopsy is safety and preferable. Retroperitoneal laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) has been developed in an attempt to further reduce the morbidity and scarring associated with laparoscopic surgery. Early clinical series have demonstrated the feasibility of a broad range of retroperitoneal LESS urologic procedures. We present our preliminary experience with retroperitoneal LESS in a series of 14 subjects who required renal biopsy.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for glomerulonephritis [^117XPySD]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Medium credibility.

KDIGO 3.4.1 — indications for kidney biopsy in children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) are Not Graded and include late failure to respond following initial response to corticosteroids, a high index of suspicion for a different underlying pathology, and decreasing kidney function in children receiving calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). The commentary adds that there may also be a role for biopsy in selected cases of new-onset nephrotic syndrome based on epidemiological associations of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and histologic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) with demographic factors such as age and African American background, and states that greater attention should be given to the role of genetic testing to supplement histologic examination of the renal tissue, particularly in SRNS.

### Centre variation in incidence, indication and diagnosis of adult native renal biopsy in scotland [^114yvXVY]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

UK native renal biopsy incidence is unknown. Biopsy registries in other countries indicate that the incidence of renal biopsy varies widely. Indications for renal biopsy are largely opinion based.

Methods

The Scottish Renal Biopsy Registry aimed to analyse the incidence of native renal biopsy in Scotland and examine indications and diagnoses obtained where practice varied widely.

Results

Consecutive native adult renal biopsies performed in eight of the nine Scottish regions that include 82.4% of the population between 2002 and 2006 were examined. A total of 2480 native renal biopsies were performed equating 126.3 biopsies per million population per year (PMP/year). A total of 56.9% of patients were male, mean age 55.6 years (SD 1.3). The centres varied widely, from a lowest mean annual incidence of 65.8 PMP/year in Fife to the highest of 170.7 PMP/year in Tayside. The prospectively recorded indications and diagnoses were compared between Greater Glasgow, Clyde and Forth Valley (GC&FV) (population 1.56 million, 101.6 biopsies PMP/year) and Tayside (population 0.39 million, 177.4 biopsies PMP/year). Differing incidence of renal biopsy in these regions was mainly explained by patients with proteinuria and preserved renal function in the absence of nephrotic syndrome (19.2 PMP/year in GC&FV versus 60.8 PMP/year in Tayside), probably due to variation in nephrologists' opinion about the utility of biopsy for this indication. Tayside diagnosed more primary glomerulopathies, diabetic nephropathy and chronic ischaemia than GC&FV.

Conclusions

We have demonstrated wide regional variability in incidence of native renal biopsy within a single country, with analysis suggesting that this is mainly explained by uncertainty about the utility of renal biopsy for patients with proteinuria and preserved renal function. Further studies are required to determine the value of renal biopsy in this setting.

Kidney transplant biopsy — indications and thresholds: Renal allograft biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing the cause of a change in renal allograft function, and patients showing a 20%-25% increase in creatinine level above baseline values warrant consideration for biopsy. Delayed graft function lasting longer than 48 hours should be monitored closely and a biopsy performed every 7–10 days until graft function recovers. New-onset proteinuria, protein ≥ 2.0 g/g creatinine or ≥ 2.0 g/24 h, also merits a kidney biopsy. Additional listed triggers include new onset of proteinuria (2C) and unexplained proteinuria ≥ 3.0 g per gram creatinine or ≥ 3.0 g per 24 hours. (2C).

Complications of kidney biopsy

Rates for each of the listed possible complications of kidney biopsy (drop in haemoglobin, bleeding requiring transfusion/embolization, nephrectomy, urinary tract infection and death) were overall estimated to be low by responders (Table 4). For bleeding requiring transfusion (n = 126, 69.2%), bleeding requiring embolization (n = 157, 86.3%), urinary tract infection (n = 165, 90.7%), nephrectomy (n = 179, 98.4%) and death (n = 180, 98.9%), the most commonly estimated complication rate was < 1%.

Table 4
Complications of renal biopsy (N = 182)

Indications for kidney biopsy

Answers were varied for indications of kidney biopsy (Table 5). Overall, respondents were in favour of ordering a kidney biopsy when investigations are suggestive of acute glomerulonephritis (n = 165, 90.7%). Respondents were also likely to biopsy if patients had an AKI with elevated ANCA titres (n = 173, 95.6%) or elevated anti-DNAse B titres (n = 155, 85.6%). When considering a patient with a non-recovering AKI, the most selected duration to wait before biopsy was 2 weeks (n = 76, 42.9%). When evaluating a patient with chronic renal insufficiency and reduced kidney size on imaging, only 2.2% (n = 4) of respondents chose to biopsy. Haematuria and proteinuria > 1 g/day in chronic renal insufficiency was a more favourable indication (n = 152, 83.5%) than haematuria and < 1 g/day proteinuria in chronic renal insufficiency (n = 70, 38.5%).

### Distribution of glomerular diseases in Taiwan: preliminary report of national renal biopsy registry-publication on behalf of Taiwan society of nephrology [^116gHs6Y]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

The incidence was 5.5, 4.7,4.5, and 4.1 pmp/yr. for IgA nephropathy, FSGS, MGN, and MCD, respectively. The incidence of primary glomerulonephritis was 21.9 pmp/yr. Compared with the incidence of primary GN worldwide, McGrogan et al. demonstrated a mean incidence of 2.5, 0.8, 1.2, and 0.6 /100,000/year for IgA nephropathy, FSGS, MGN, and MCD, respectively.

The strength of this study is that it recruited biopsies from 17 medical centers, which accounted for 79.7% of all renal biopsies in 2015, thus should be representative for epidemiological analysis for Taiwan, and this is the first report of the national data. However, the current study has several limitations. Our statistics may underestimate the true incidence of GN for two reasons. First, we do not have a population screening program to detect silent cases of GN, which is practiced in Japan. Diseases with asymptomatic urinary abnormality or microscopic hematuria such as IgA, MGN, and FSGS may be diagnosed at a later stage. Secondly, biopsy policies may vary from center to center, and renal biopsy is often not performed when the therapeutic advantage is judged as low. For example, patients with steroid– sensitive proteinuria in children, hematuria without proteinuria, PIGN, and diabetic nephropathy would not undergo renal biopsy in some of the medical centers. Therefore, the incidence of MCD, IgA nephropathy, PIGN, and diabetic nephropathy may be underestimated. Actually, there are several factors influencing the variability of biopsy practice worldwide, including heterogenecity of indication of renal biopsy, social and economic status, lack of renal biopsy data collection, which was just reviewed by Fiorentino et al.

### Epidemiology of 10-year paediatric renal biopsies in the region of Southern Croatia [^114hTs1Z]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

The most frequent reason for renal biopsy in our research, was NS (about one quarter). These results are consistent with some studies from literature, while in studies by Czech authors isolated hematuria was the main indication. Nephrotic proteinuria with hematuria was the main indications in Morocco, while in the study by authors from UK non-nephrotic proteinuria predominated with 36% of cases.

The reason for renal biopsy in NS group of patients regarding response to corticosteroid therapy gave predictable results due to the fact that we usually perform biopsy in patients failed to reach complete remission with corticosteroid therapy. The response to steroid therapy in SDNS patients was well at the beginning, but occasionally we needed to execute a renal biopsy due to corticosteroid side effects or because of the need to use another immunosuppressant. These findings are in correlation to studies done by Paripović et al. Kanodia et al. and Bazina et al. while they differ from results of Printza et al. and Boyer et al. In contrast, Bircan et al. had a very wide scale of indications for biopsy in patients with NS, with only 21.9% of SDNS, 13.2% of SRNS, and even 26.3% of patients with complete remission of NS. In our study, the second indication for renal biopsy was non-nephrotic proteinuria with hematuria, which is in accordance with some other studies. About one fifth of indications for renal biopsy in our research was nephritic syndrome with nephrotic proteinuria, which is significantly higher than in our previous studies, where that category was comprised of 3.1% of all biopsied cases or 10.8% in the study of Coppo et al.

### Glomerulonephritis histopathological pattern change [^114bz5Pd]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Glomerulonephritides (GN) are relatively rare kidney diseases with substantial morbidity and mortality. They are often difficult to treat, sometimes with no cure, and can lead to chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Incidence of ESKD is rising annually worldwide due to a variety of reasons. GN treatment is associated with additional morbidity and cost that is due to expensive immunosuppressive medications, increased risks of infectious, malignancy or other complications. Kidney biopsy is the diagnostic procedure of choice with variable indications from center to center. It is useful in identifying the exact specific diagnosis, assessing the level of disease activity and severity, and hence aids in proper therapy and helps predicting prognosis. Common clinical scenarios where biopsy is needed are nephrotic syndrome (NS), prolonged acute kidney injury (AKI), rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN), systemic diseases with renal dysfunction, sub-nephrotic proteinuria, isolated microscopic hematuria, unexplained renal impairment, renal transplant dysfunction, and some familial renal diseases. Kidney biopsy data can help identify prevalence of certain renal diagnoses. There is a global change of pattern of glomerular disease over the last five decades. Here we present our data of six years of native kidney biopsies in four centers in Kuwait comprising about 80% of all cases in the country.

### Proteinuria in children [^115kGw5q]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Proteinuria is common in children and may represent a benign condition or a serious underlying renal disease or systemic disorder. Proteinuria may occur secondary to glomerular or tubular dysfunction. Although a 24-hour urine protein excretion test is usually recommended, it may be impractical in children. A spot, first-morning urine test for protein/creatinine ratio can be useful in this situation. Proteinuria is usually benign, in the form of transient or orthostatic proteinuria. Persistent proteinuria may be associated with more serious renal diseases. Clinical features from the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests help determine the cause of proteinuria. Treatment should be directed at the underlying cause. Patients with active urinary sediments, persistent and gross hematuria, hypertension, hypocomplementemia, renal insufficiency with depressed glomerular filtration rate, or signs and symptoms suggestive of vasculitic disease may require a renal biopsy and referral to a pediatric nephrologist.

### Effects of receiving renal biopsy on the prognosis of chronic kidney disease patients with impaired renal function [^111Zb9Xy]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been gradually becoming one of the most important public health burdens worldwide. A study enrolling 47,204 participants showed that the overall prevalence of CKD was 10.8% (10.2–11.3%). While the ERA-EDTA registry annual report 2012 revealed that among patients undergoing renal replacement therapy (RRT), 15% of them had no specific renal pathological diagnosis, which meant no precise treatments targeting their primary kidney disease.

Renal biopsy is the gold standard to diagnose renal diseases. However, there is currently poor consensus about proper indications of this procedure. Most of the nephrologists agreed that renal biopsy should be performed in patients with nephrotic syndrome (NS), proteinuria more than 1 g/d, proteinuria, hematuria and acute kidney injury (AKI) for pathological findings to provide information for treatment alteration and prediction of prognosis. Impaired renal function was not a recognized indication for renal biopsy. Because subjects with impaired renal function may have a higher risk of bleeding, also the renal tissue obtained by biopsy may not give enough information for diagnosis and change of treatment if chronic renal damages prevail. However, previous studies found that skipping renal biopsy in patients with renal impairment may miss treatable interstitial nephritis, which may progress to ESRD quickly without proper treatment. Systematic diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), vasculitis and allergic purpura, may affect the kidney function and cause renal impairment. And renal biopsy is a crucial method to evaluate the activity and severity of the diseases. Thus, it is important to get a better knowledge of the baseline and pathological characteristics of the cohort with renal impairment.

Nowadays most nephrologists empirically decided whether the renal biopsy is needed for CKD patients with impaired renal function, at the same time, relied on the levels of other characteristics including proteinuria, hematuria et al. As no studies have focused on the pathological diagnosis of the population with impaired renal function, and their renal prognoses after biopsy were still unclear. Meanwhile, as the gold standard to diagnose renal diseases, no studies have evaluated the effects of receiving renal biopsy on the long-term renal function for CKD patients. In the current study, we intended to explore the effects of receiving renal biopsy on the prognosis of CKD patients with impaired renal function, and to find the independent predictors for poor renal outcomes in renal function impaired CKD patients who did not receive renal biopsy, thus providing clinical evidence for better management of CKD patients with impaired renal function.

NEPTUNE

The Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) was developed to define the molecular mechanism of NS for targeted therapeutic interventions. NEPTUNE follows the natural history of patients and aims to improve the diagnosis, management, and treatment of NS using innovative research strategies(Figure 2). Participants are enrolled into NEPTUNE at the time of a diagnostic kidney biopsy or at initial presentation of disease for pediatric patients for whom a biopsy is usually not clinically indicated. In the biopsy cohort, an extra core of kidney tissue is obtained during the clinically indicated procedure for research studies. Blood and urine specimens, along with clinical data, are collected prospectively every 4 to 6 months for up to 5 years. NEPTUNE has recruited a prospective longitudinal observational cohort of 861 patients with proteinuric, glomerular diseases who have contributed deep clinical, histologic, genetic, and molecular data as well as profiles of their long-term outcomes under standard care or in independent clinical trials. A key component of NEPTUNE that was established at its inception was the creation of a dedicated biorepository for long-term storage of the full range of biospecimens collected from each participant.

### Kidney biopsy in very elderly patients: indications, therapeutic impact and complications [^115854Nd]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

As life expectancy increases, the proportion of elderly patients with renal diseases raises: the medical care of elderly patients is changing in developed countries. The life expectancy in France in 2019 was 85.6 years for women and 79.7 years for men. The median age of dialysis initiation was 70.9 years in 2018 and 12.9% of prevalent patients on chronic dialysis were older than 85 years.

Kidney biopsy (KB) is an invasive diagnostic procedure aimed at identifying kidney diseases and guiding treatment to prevent progression to chronic kidney disease and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). Nowadays, there is consensus of opinion that an age over 60–65 years is not a contraindication to kidney biopsy (KB) but the level of evidence for patients over 80–85 years of age remains low. There is a general reluctance to perform KB in very elderly patients due to the risk of complications (mostly bleeding) but these patients may also take full advantage of optimized therapeutic strategies.

To evaluate the risk/benefit balance of KB in very elderly patients, we analyzed the indications, adverse events and therapeutic impact of KB in a cohort of consecutive patients over 85 years of age.

### Kidney biopsy in very elderly patients: indications, therapeutic impact and complications [^1147ySXF]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Few data is available on the risk/benefit balance of native kidney biopsy (KB) in very elderly patients.

Methods

Multicenter retrospective cohort study in the Aix-Marseille area: the results of KB and medical charts of all patients over 85 years biopsied between January 2010 and December 2018 were reviewed.

Results

104 patients were included. Median age was 87 years. Indications for KB were: acute kidney injury (AKI) in 69.2% of patients, nephrotic syndrome (NS) with AKI in 13.5%, NS without AKI in 12.5%, and proteinuria in 4.8%. Median serum creatinine was 262 μmol/L, 21% of patients required dialysis at the time of KB. Significant bleeding occurred in 7 (6.7%) patients, requiring blood cell transfusion in 4 (3.8%), and radiological embolization in 1 (1%). The most frequent pathological diagnoses were: non-diabetic glomerular diseases (29.8%, including pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis in 9.6%), hypertensive nephropathy (27.9%), acute interstitial nephritis (16.3%), renal involvement of hematological malignancy (8.7%), and acute tubular necrosis (6.7%). After KB, 51 (49%) patients received a specific treatment: corticosteroids (41.3%), cyclophosphamide (6.7%), rituximab (6.7%), bortezomib (3.8%), other chemotherapies (3.8%). Median overall survival was 31 months.

Conclusions

KB can reveal a diagnosis with therapeutic impact even in very elderly patients. Severe bleeding was not frequent in this cohort, but KB may have not been performed in more vulnerable patients.

Results

During the study period a total of 140 native kidney biopsies were performed at the center. There were 78 (55.7%) females and 62 (44.3%) males. The mean age of the sample was 46 ± 15.3 years. The indication for renal biopsy and histopathological diagnoses are presented in Table 1. In both genders, the most common indications for renal biopsy were nephrotic range proteinuria amounting to 54.3%, followed by sub-nephrotic range proteinuria (14.3%), nephrotic range proteinuria with haematuria (14.3%), sub-nephrotic range proteinuria with haematuria (9.3%), AKI without known cause (4.3%), and CKD without known cause (3.6%). The leading histopathological diagnoses were FSGS (22.1%), lupus nephritis (20%), PSGN (17.1%), DN (12.1%), HTN (9.3%), MCD (6.4%), IgA nephropathy (5.7%), IN (4.3%), vasculitis (2.1%), and MGN (0.7%). The most common diagnoses in the nephrotic range proteinuria were FSGS accounting for 27.6% followed by DN (17.1%), lupus nephritis (14.5%), MCD (11.8%), IgA nephropathy (9.2%) and HTN (7.8%).

### Aetiology of acute / subacute nephritic syndrome: results from kidney biopsy registries in Japan and Europe [^117NzVxn]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Kidney disease comprises a diverse group of disorders, which may present as several different clinical patterns depending on the underlying disease mechanism. Kidney biopsy is the gold standard for obtaining a definitive diagnosis, and studies have demonstrated that results from kidney biopsies can alter prognosis and therapeutic decisions in up to 50% of cases. However, meaningful comparisons of data on glomerular diseases across different regions are compromised by differences in biopsy practices, including variability in biopsy rates, differences in histological classification and coding practices, the time period studied, the age distribution of reported cases, and the exclusion of non-glomerular diseases and secondary glomerulonephritis. Acute/subacute nephritic syndrome (ANS), in this study defined as a combination of hematuria, proteinuria and a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a patient without a prior diagnosis of chronic kidney disease, is an alarming constellation for nephrologists and is considered a strong indication for kidney biopsy. Since biopsy practices are likely to vary less in cases of ANS, it is well-suited for cross-regional comparisons. This study aimed to compare the frequencies of underlying diseases causing ANS in Japan and Europe using data from kidney biopsy registries, and to explore differences related to age and sex.

### Renal outcome in type 2 diabetic patients with or without coexisting nondiabetic nephropathies [^115qh3sz]. Diabetes Care (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the risk factors for adverse renal outcome in type 2 diabetic patients who underwent renal biopsy and were followed-up longitudinally.

Research Design and Methods

We examined 68 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes during the period of 1985–1999 who underwent renal biopsy for proteinuria ≥ 1 g/day, renal involvement (proteinuria or renal impairment) at the absence of retinopathy, renal involvement with duration of diabetes < 5 years, or unexplained hematuria of glomerular origin. Their clinical features and underlying renal lesion were correlated with the renal outcome after longitudinal follow-up. Three groups of patients were defined based on their renal pathology: group I consisted of 24 patients (35%) with diabetic glomerulosclerosis (DGS) alone, group II consisted of 13 patients (19%) with nondiabetic nephropathy (NDN) superimposed on DGS, and group III consisted of 31 patients (46%) with NDN alone without evidence of DGS.

Results

After a mean follow-up of 123 months from the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes (74 months from the time of renal biopsy), univariate analysis showed that risk factors for reaching end-stage renal disease (requiring maintenance dialysis, or a serum creatinine [SCr] ≥ 700 micromol/l) included proteinuria ≥ 2g/day (P = 0.0087), SCr > 120 micromol/l (P = 0.0005), presence of retinopathy (P < 0.00001) at the time of biopsy, and biopsy showing DGS (groups I and II) (P = 0.035). On multivariate analysis, retinopathy was the only independent variable correlated with end-stage renal failure. This study also showed that the association of hematuria or proteinuria with the absence of retinopathy constitutes the strongest indication for a nondiabetic lesion (positive predictive values of 94%).

Conclusions

Patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing renal biopsy constitute a heterogeneous group by their clinical presentations and underlying pathology, but longitudinal studies on the renal outcome of these patients remain limited. Our study showed that renal biopsy is indicated in selective diabetic patients because of potentially treatable nephropathy and of a better prognosis than DGS.

### Kidney biopsy practice amongst australasian nephrologists [^115tGs5b]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Table 5
Indications for renal biopsy (N = 182)

AKI Acute kidney injury, CKD Chronic kidney disease, GN Glomerulonephritis

In patients with normal kidney function, isolated proteinuria > 3 g/day (n = 167, 92.8%), as well as proteinuria > 1 g/day and haematuria (n = 151, 83.4%) were favourable indications for biopsy. Respondents were less likely to request a kidney biopsy in patients with isolated proteinuria > 1 g/day independent of their blood pressure status – normotensive (n = 109, 60.2%), hypertensive (n = 100, 55.6%).

In diabetic patients, chronic kidney insufficiency without retinopathy (n = 20, 11.0%) and nephrotic range proteinuria (n = 39, 21.4%) were not seen as a usual indication for kidney biopsy. Conversely, rapidly deteriorating kidney function (n = 86, 47.3%) or the presence of active urinary sediment (n = 126, 69.2%) were more common kidney biopsy indications.

Overall, respondents were less likely to order a kidney biopsy if the patient had a solitary kidney with 45 respondents (24.7%) opting for a kidney biopsy in patients with proteinuria > 3 g/day.

Respondents were less likely to biopsy pregnant patients. Nearly a quarter (22.5%, n = 41) of respondents would biopsy pregnant patients at less than 32 weeks gestation with proteinuria > 3 g without clinical features of pre-eclampsia. In pregnant patients at later stages of pregnancy (at or greater than 32 weeks gestation), the proportion of respondents that would biopsy decreased (n = 7, 3.8%).

In patients with a kidney transplant, most respondents would biopsy patients with rapidly rising creatinine after good initial kidney function (n = 173, 95.6%). Similarly, kidney biopsy was usually considered in a transplant patient with serum creatinine not improving after anti-rejection therapy (n = 160, 87.9%) and with new onset proteinuria > 3 g/day (n = 161, 88.5%). Fewer respondents considered kidney biopsy in a transplant patient with slowly progressive deteriorating graft function (n = 90, 49.5%).

### Lupus nephritis: clinical presentations and outcomes in the 21st century [^112aB68x]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The role of kidney biopsy

The definition of renal involvement in SLE gained particular importance in the most recent sets of SLE classification criteria, where histology, together with a consistent SLE serology, is sufficient for disease classification. Nevertheless, the role of kidney biopsy has been questioned as most forms of LN can adequately be treated with glucocorticoids (GC) plus mycophenolate (MMF). However, because of the lack of univocal correlation between clinical presentation and histological abnormalities, renal biopsy remains fundamental in the evaluation and management of LN. It allows differentiation into pathological classes, the definition of the severity of renal involvement in terms of active and chronic lesions and the identification of other rare non-LN conditions such as anti-phospholipid antibody-associated nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, thrombotic microangiopathies, drug-induced tubulo-interstitial nephritis, diabetes nephropathy or hypertensive nephroangiosclerosis. A comprehensive assessment of renal biopsy may therefore guide clinicians in the choice of the more appropriate therapeutic strategy. A threshold of proteinuria to perform a renal biopsy has not yet been defined, but when it stably reaches or overcomes the level of 500 mg/24 h or spot urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) > 500 mg/g (50 mg/mmol), especially with impaired renal function or active urinary sediment, it is reasonable to perform invasive investigations. Biopsy can also be considered in the presence of persistent haematuria or pyuria after exclusion of other potential causes or in case of unexplained renal insufficiency with normal urinalysis.

An adequate biopsy sample should include at least 10 glomeruli and the analysis be performed by light microscopy (LM), immunofluorescence (IF) and electron microscopy (EM) when available.

With the exception of cases with severe activity and chronicity indexes, the prognostic value of the basal kidney biopsy on long-term outcome is quite modest, while a second biopsy could be more informative. Nevertheless, no standardized protocols have been defined so far and re-biopsy is not part of routine care. According to international recommendations, a second biopsy can be considered in the presence of renal flare, unresponsiveness to treatment, worsening of renal function, persistent proteinuria or haematuria or to exclude an alternative diagnosis. Recent small LN studies suggest it may be highly informative also in patients in complete clinical renal response to stratify the risk of relapse and to guide immunosuppression withdrawal. Despite a clinical response to treatment, some patients still maintain mild histological signs of activity on repeated kidney biopsy which can lead to irreversible nephron loss.

Etanercept has shown encouraging results in reduction of serum amyloid A in amyloidosis and patients with a baseline serum creatinine below 2 mg/dl tended to show a benefit following TNF-alpha inhibition.

Based on studies in non-diabetic nephropathy, patients with renal involvement in CTDs should receive RAAS blocking agents once proteinuria is > 1 g/day. Renal function needs to be monitored as well as serum potassium levels and blood pressure. In chronic kidney disease in the pre-dialysis state the lowering of LDL-cholesterol safely reduced the risk of major atherosclerotic events. Accelerated atherosclerosis is a common finding in patients with chronic inflammation and in CTDs in particular. Thus, modification of the risk factors contributing to the evolution of cardiovascular disease is crucial in these patients. Moreover, adherence to therapeutic advice may be an underestimated problem, since a recent study indicated that only one-quarter of patients with SLE had an adherence rate ≥ 80%. In addition, counselling against smoking should be mandatory in patients with SLE and RA.

In summary, renal manifestations of CTDs are frequent. Renal biopsy to ensure diagnosis is necessary in most patients presenting with deterioration of renal function, increase of proteinuria or signs of nephritic syndrome (summarized in Table 4). An interdisciplinary approach to optimize treatment is the aim for patients with CTDs.

Suggested kidney biopsy indications in connective tissue diseases

Renal biopsy suggestions differ between centers due to local preferences. General recommendations are difficult to define and we would consider higher levels of proteinuria (> 1 g/d) compared to the EULAR/ERA-EDTA recommendations as biopsy indication for patients with lupus nephritis in our center.

### Differential diagnosis of glomerular disease: a systematic and inclusive approach [^113VyNbU]. American Journal of Nephrology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Glomerular disease is a complex and evolving topic. In evaluating a specific case it is not unusual for the clinician to ask: 'Am I missing something? Should I biopsy? When? Should I treat first, then biopsy?' This work, which is both evidence and experience based, is intended to address each of these concerns and many other issues relevant to the differential diagnosis of glomerular disease.

Summary

The central approach is the use of diagnostic algorithms that are based on quantitative measures routinely obtained early in the course of the diagnostic evaluation. The algorithms are designed to be easy to navigate, systematic, and inclusive. Also provided is a detailed and prioritized list of recommended diagnostic testing, and the rationale for each test.

Key Message

This work is intended to facilitate accurate diagnosis in the individual patient presenting with evidence of glomerular disease.

### Outcome study of renal biopsy patients in okinawa, Japan [^116mXqv3]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Here we report a community-based epidemiologic study of patients who received renal biopsy in Okinawa, Japan between 1967 and 1994. The total number of cases was 2832 (1395 men and 1437 women), and the mean (SD) age at biopsy was 30.0 (10.0) years (range 1.0 to 88.0 years). The most common clinical indications for renal biopsy were proteinuria/hematuria (46.7%), nephrotic syndrome (21.2%), acute glomerulonephritis (10.1%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (7.5%). Patients who received renal biopsy between 1985 and 1994 (N = 1480) were much less likely to have acute glomerulonephritis than patients treated between 1967 and 1984 (N = 1352); the rates of proteinuria/hematuria, renal failure, and diabetes mellitus were slightly higher in the later period. Okinawa patients who began dialysis between 1971 and 2000 (N = 5246) were also studied. Among them, a total of 468 patients (260 men and 208 women) began dialysis after renal biopsy. The cumulative incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among these patients was 17% in 17 years. Half of these patients developed ESRD in the 5.8 years after renal biopsy. Among the dialysis patients, the biopsy rate was 12.6% in chronic glomerulonephritis, 1.7% in diabetes mellitus, 2.6% in nephrosclerosis, and 52.1% in systemic lupus erythematosus. The diagnoses of primary renal diseases were primarily made clinically. The survival rate after starting dialysis therapy was slightly better in those with than in those without renal biopsy but this finding was not statistically significant (adjusted hazards ratio 0.855, 95% CI 0.711–1.028, P = 0.095). The clinical significance of renal biopsy, other than its provision of histologic evidence, remains to be shown.

### Controversy between biopsy and risk in children with proteinuria: is there a paradigm war? [^116Yygsf]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Proteinuria is a prevalent symptom of pediatric nephrology, while kidney biopsy remains the gold standard for kidney tissue analysis, and it is currently controversial. We report the rare case that the mutation in the AMN gene was considered to cause chronically isolated proteinuria and also suggest that renal biopsy should be chosen with caution in children with chronic isolated non-nephrotic levels of proteinuria and that genetic testing may be feasible for the early precise diagnosis.

Case Presentation

A 35-month-old boy presented with excessive urine foaming for more than half a month; his proteinuria was considered non-nephrotic range and urine protein electrophoresis was suggestive of mixed proteinuria; other than that, the investigations are non-specific. Given the child's chronic isolated proteinuria and good renal function, we chose to refine the genetic test rather than a renal biopsy; a compound heterozygous variant was found in the AMN gene of this child which was caused by a point mutation in the father, and a partial chromosomal deletion in the mother.

Conclusions

Cubilin(encoded by CUBN), amnionless(encoded by AMN), and megalin form a multiligand receptor complex; CUBN or AMN gene variants have been implicated as a hereditary cause of megaloblastic anemia, proteinuria, and neurological impairment. In the past few decades, chronic isolated proteinuria caused by CUBN gene variants is benign, non-progressive, and has normal renal function. However, the child is the first reported case of isolated proteinuria of AMN gene mutation, indicating that the earlier diagnostic genetic sequencing in an otherwise well, not nephrotic proteinuria child may be a convenient, cost-effective, and harmless option, challenging the traditional paradigm.

Class III/IV (± V) LN after triple immunosuppressive therapy — management by response: In people who have undergone triple immunosuppressive therapy and achieved a complete renal response, we conditionally recommend continuing the same immunosuppressive regimen. In those with a partial renal response (PRR), we conditionally recommend individualizing therapy depending on clinical factors that include the trajectory of response. If the patient with PRR is improving with reduction in proteinuria and increasing/stabilization of eGFR, continuation of the initial triple regimen with continued glucocorticoid taper is reasonable; however, if there are indications of worsening disease activity, we suggest altering therapy. A repeat kidney biopsy may be helpful, and a specific duration of therapy is not recommended due to variability in clinical presentations.

### Diagnostic yield of renal biopsies: a retrospective single center review [^116nu6fo]. BMC Nephrology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

A kidney biopsy is an important diagnostic procedure in nephrology and can aid in determining the appropriate diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis for specific patients. Based upon physical examination, urinalysis and blood tests, physicians attempt to make a clinical diagnosis which is used to guide treatment. This is not always feasible using non-invasive tools, and in such cases a kidney biopsy may need to be performed to confirm or determine the diagnosis, severity, and urgency of therapy.

A kidney biopsy may not always provide information that is needed or pertinent to the clinical scenario. Sometimes an adequate tissue sample of the kidneys cannot be obtained or the information provided from the biopsy fails to shed any light on the patients' symptoms or clinical data. Due to the invasiveness of the procedure, it is important, when recommending a biopsy for an individual patient, to bear in mind not only the risks of the procedure itself but the distinct possibility that it might prove unhelpful in the patient's management.

There are a number of recent studies that have detailed the array of diagnoses obtained from kidney biopsies in adults and children with renal disease. Other reports have assessed the clinical impact that a biopsy may have, but they focused primarily on the risk factors and resulting complications of performing renal biopsies. In this study, we defined a novel system that enabled us to ascertain the usefulness of a particular biopsy by analyzing predictions of the diagnosis pre-biopsy and the physician's treatment decision post biopsy. Using this scheme, we tested the hypothesis that at least 80% of native kidney biopsies provided clinically valuable information that rationally guided the formulation of the patient's prognosis and treatment.

### Serial renal biopsy in systemic lupus erythematosus [^11215Qb2]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

To examine the role of sequential renal biopsies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), with regard to indications, morphologic change over time, and the clinical utility of repeat biopsies.

Methods

Patients with repeat renal biopsies were identified from the University of Toronto Lupus Clinic Database and their biopsies were reviewed blindly by a committee, using the WHO classification as well as activity and chronicity indices. Reasons for obtaining biopsy were documented, and therapeutic decisions following repeat biopsy were tabulated.

Results

Fifty-seven patients (49 F/9 M) had at least 2 renal biopsies between 1970 and 1994. The mean interval between biopsies was 4.2 years. The major reason for obtaining the first biopsy was disease diagnosis (32/57), while the majority of repeat biopsies were performed to discern the cause of increasing proteinuria (45/57). A comparison of the WHO classification of initial and repeat biopsies showed evolution to another class in 23 instances, but more commonly a change within a class was seen. A decrease in proliferative lesions (classes III and IV and subsets of V) was noted on repeat biopsies. The chronicity index increased significantly (p = 0.0001) and the activity index decreased (p = 0.064) between biopsies. Seventy-seven percent of patients had a change in treatment based on biopsy results.

Conclusion

The major reason for repeat renal biopsy in patients with SLE was proteinuria. Renal morphology in patients with SLE can change with time, particularly in terms of chronicity and activity features. Repeat biopsies in patients with SLE appear to have clinical utility.

### Acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients who underwent percutaneous kidney biopsy for histological diagnosis of their renal disease [^113SFagg]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design and patients

This was a retrospective cohort study, included patients admitted to the Nephrology ward of Hospital São Paulo, Universidade Federal de São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil. Patients were eligible if submitted to percutaneous kidney biopsy performed with aged ≥ 16 years as indicated by the nephrologists. Exclusion criteria were kidney transplant recipients. In our center, all percutaneous native kidney biopsies were performed in patients admitted exclusively to the nephrology ward. We did not perform native kidney biopsy in outpatient setting. Data were obtained, between January 2008 and December 2014, from patients' medical records and the electronic hospital database. The follow-up period underwent 12-month after the kidney biopsy.

Demographic and clinical data

We analyzed the following variables: age, sex, race, body mass index (BMI), major comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD including heart failure, coronary artery disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

We evaluated the use of diuretics, antibiotics, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), and contrast media (recent use as well as administration during hospitalization). Previous use of corticosteroids was also recorded.

Indications for renal biopsy were nephrotic syndrome (characterized by edema, hypoalbuminemia [< 3.5 g/L], dyslipidemia, and proteinuria ≥ 3.5 g/24 h [h]), or nephrotic-range proteinuria (proteinuria ≥ 3.5 g/24 h), rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN, characterized by hematuria and/or proteinuria on urinalysis associated with rapid decline in renal function indicated by progressively increasing serum creatinine levels, which may occur over days, weeks, or months prior to renal biopsy), sub-nephrotic proteinuria (isolated proteinuria > 1.0 g/24 h), dysmorphic hematuria associated with some grade of proteinuria, renal dysfunction if unknown origin, and renal manifestations of systemic diseases.

### Controversy between biopsy and risk in children with proteinuria: is there a paradigm war? [^116bjaB4]. BMC Nephrology (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

In the general dogma, proteinuria is always damaging. It is typically linked to unfavorable renal outcomes, and kidney biopsy is the only means to establish a definitive histological diagnosis for many of the conditions for which nephrologists care, as well as the gold standard for kidney tissue analysis. However, there is controversy among nephrologists worldwide, especially in pediatrics, over whether to perform renal biopsy and the appropriate timing of biopsy and ACEI application. For example, some children perform urine analysis as routine analysis or medical check-ups, the detection of proteinuria will put the pediatric nephrologists into a dilemma on whether to undertake renal biopsy. Sometimes, the normal kidney tissue or the absence of identified glomerular-related diseases will not be helpful in guiding treatment and management. However, on the contrary, it puts the children at unnecessary potential risk. For many Asian nephrologists, especially in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, there is no doubt that children would have received a kidney biopsy. Starting in 1973, Japan established mass screening programs aiming at the early detection of renal disease and prompt treatment. Favorable public health outcomes have boosted consensus in these countries. While in North America, some nephrologists may wait until proteinuria is severe or a reduced glomerular filtration rate is present before considering further testing, this practice has been criticized for being detrimental to early diagnosis.

From an objective standpoint, the following are the most worrisome characteristics of kidney biopsies. First and foremost, renal biopsy is an invasive procedure, and unintended complications may occur, including bleeding, hematuria, perinephric hematoma formation, inadvertent puncture of other vessels, and arteriovenous fistula. Secondly kidney biopsy has some additional hidden costs: (1) For little children unwilling to cooperate with us, kidney biopsy frequently requires general anesthesia. Thus, the cost of this type of child will be substantially more than the average cost (5115 CNY($705.87) in our center). (2) The sampling of renal biopsy requires a particular technical and empirical judgment of the physician, and there is a certain probability of sampling failure, resulting in repeated puncture and increased invasive injury. Last but not least, the traditional methods of sedation and perpendicular access will also be traumatic for the child, even if general anesthetic and a tangential approach are available currently.

### Clinicopathological spectrum of biopsy-proven renal diseases of patients at a single center in sri lanka: a cross sectional retrospective review [^112MDi23]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The clinical presentation of renal diseases can vary widely. The lack of a comprehensive national registry for Sri Lanka makes it difficult to provide a detailed record of the various clinical presentations and histopathology of renal disorders in the nation. Therefore, this study aims to provide a record of the spectrum of renal diseases in Sri Lanka.

Methods

Renal biopsies performed at the nephrology unit in Colombo South Teaching Hospital (CSTH), Sri Lanka from March 2018 to October 2019 was retrospectively studied. Indications for renal biopsy were nephrotic range proteinuria, sub nephrotic range proteinuria, acute kidney injury without obvious etiology, chronic renal disease without obvious etiology and haematuria.

Results

A total of 140 native kidney biopsies were analyzed in which majority were females (55.7%). The mean age of the population was 46 ± 15.3 years. The most common indications for renal biopsy were nephrotic range proteinuria (54.3%), followed by sub-nephrotic range proteinuria (14.3%), nephrotic range proteinuria with haematuria (14.3%), sub-nephrotic range proteinuria with haematuria (9.3%), AKI without known cause (4.3%), and CKD without known cause (3.6%). The leading histopathological diagnoses were FSGS (22.1%), lupus nephritis (20%), PSGN (17.1%), DN (12.1%), HTN (9.3%), MCD (6.4%), IgA nephropathy (5.7%), IN (4.3%), vasculitis (2.1%), and MGN (0.7%).

Conclusions

The most common indication for renal biopsy was nephrotic range proteinuria in our population. FSGS was the most prevalent histopathological diagnosis and the least frequent diagnosis reported was MGN. The spectrum of renal diseases could differ according to the study location and it changes over time. Therefore, a renal biopsy registry is needed for documenting the changing disease pattern in Sri Lanka.

### Acute kidney injury in hospitalized patients who underwent percutaneous kidney biopsy for histological diagnosis of their renal disease [^112XxB6D]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The primary indications for renal biopsy were nephrotic-range proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome (73 [52.1%] in the AKI vs. 51 [61.4%] in the non-AKI group, p = 0.048), renal dysfunction of undetermined etiology (23 [16.4%] in the AKI vs. 5 [6.0%] in the non-AKI group, p = 0.001), and hematuria with non-nephrotic-range proteinuria (11 [7.8%] in the AKI vs. 11 [13.2%] in the non-AKI group, p = 1,000). RPGN was an indication exclusively in the AKI group (18 [12.9%] vs. 0, p < 0.001).

Primary renal disease was the most common type of disease observed in both groups (86 [61.4%] in the AKI vs. 67 [80.7%] in the non-AKI group, p = 0.125). The primary diagnoses were focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (24 [17.1%] in the AKI vs. 15 [18.0%] in the non-AKI group, p = 0.150) and minimal change disease (MCD) (21 [15%] in the AKI vs. 15 [18%] in the non-AKI group, p = 0.317). Secondary diseases predominated in the AKI group (54 [38.6%] vs. 16 [19.3%], p < 0.001). SLE was the main cause of secondary renal disease, with classes III and IV being the most prevalent (Table 1).

Table 1
Indication for renal biopsy and histopathological diagnoses

Renal biopsy indications for different age groups are shown in Table 2. Nephrotic range proteinuria was the most common indication for renal biopsy in all age groups. The mean age of the patients with nephrotic range proteinuria was 46.8 ± 15.1 years. Majority of the patients who underwent biopsy were above 40 years. However, most patients presented with sub-nephrotic range proteinuria with haematuria were young adults under 40 years (69.2%).

Table 2
Renal biopsy indication in different age groups

Table 3 presents the disease pattern across different age groups. The most common diagnoses in the 16–30 years age category were lupus and PSGN whereas FSGS and HTN nephropathy were the most common diseases among the elderly (≥ 60 years). Majority of the diagnoses were found to be distributed in the age groups of above 40 years. Diabetes nephropathy was common in 50–60 years age group. IgA nephropathy was commonest in 16–30 years age group whereas MCD was almost similarly common in 16–30 years and 40–50 years age groups.

Table 3
Disease pattern in different age groups

Descriptive characteristics of indications for renal biopsy are presented in Table 4. Clinical details revealed 56 (40%) patients to have hypertension and 36 (25.7%) with diabetes mellitus without diabetic retinopathy. In all cases the bilateral kidney size was equal or more than 10 cm. Ultrasound scan had features of chronic renal parenchymal disease in 40 (28.6%) patients. Urinalysis indicated majority of the patients with protein 3+ (57.1%) and red cell casts in 4 (2.9%), granular casts in 32 (22.9%) and 16 (11.4%) patients had dysmorphic red blood cells ≥ 10%. Patients with nephrotic range proteinuria had the highest mean urine protein creatine ratio (UPCR) of 672.8 ± 363.7 mmol/l, whereas sub nephrotic range proteinuria had the lowest mean UPCR of 166.6 ± 65.8 mmol/l. The mean serum creatinine was highest among those with AKI of unknown cause (562.8 ± 377 mmol/l) and was followed by patients with CKD of unknown cause (450 ± 431.6 mmol/l). Those biopsied for nephrotic range proteinuria reported to have the lowest mean serum creatinine value (88.6 ± 61.7mmol/l).

### Clinicopathological spectrum of biopsy-proven renal diseases of patients at a single center in sri lanka: a cross sectional retrospective review [^117KbtJf]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the present study the leading indication for biopsy was nephrotic range proteinuria and its most common pathologic diagnosis was FSGS (27.6%) followed by DN (17.1%), lupus nephritis (14.4%), MCD (11.8%), IgAN (9.2%) and HTN (7.8%). The most frequent diagnosis for nephrotic range proteinuria with hematuria was PSGN (30%) followed by FSGS (25%) and lupus nephritis (25%). Lupus nephritis was the most common diagnosis (40%) for sub nephrotic range proteinuria followed by HTN (20%), interstitial nephritis (15%), PSGN (10%) and DN (10%). The most common diagnosis in the sub nephrotic proteinuria with hematuria group was PSGN (69.2%) followed by lupus nephritis (23.1%) and FSGS (7.7%) (Table 1).

There were 36 (25.7%) diabetes patients in the sample and 19 patients had no morphologic signs of diabetic kidney disease in the renal biopsy. The most common pathologic diagnoses among patients with diabetes were DN (42.2%), FSGS (25%) and lupus (11.1%). Among the group without diabetes, the most common pathologies were lupus (23%) FSGS (21.1%), PSGN (21.1%), HTN (9.6%) and MCD (8.6%) (Table 5). However due to the relatively small sample size and absence of the comorbid duration, we did not divide the comorbid details into age categories and therefore we cannot comment on the above relationship between the age categories. Nevertheless, in our sample there were 77 patients below 50 years and 41 patients below the age of 40 years. This might be a partial explanation for these findings which needs future multicentric and a larger sample size to further investigate among the elderly and younger groups. Interestingly, a study done in Poland with 352 patients aged ≥ 65 years compared with a control group of 2214 individuals aged 18–64 years showed a prevalence of 18.2% diabetes patients among elderly individuals, and as much as 75% of them had no morphologic signs of diabetic kidney disease in the renal biopsy.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) — diagnosis and monitoring of lupus nephritis (LN): Figure 85 suggests testing kidney markers at initial SLE presentation or flares and recommends consideration of biopsy if proteinuria is > 500 mg/d or if eGFR is worsening. The threshold level for isolated proteinuria is noted as lower than ACR 2012 LN guidelines. Biopsy cohorts show significant histologic disease even at low proteinuria: 92% of patients with < 1 g/g proteinuria had ISN/RPS class III, IV, V, or mixed histology, and De Rosa et al demonstrated ~ 85% with proteinuria < 0.5 g/d and ~ 75% with < 0.25 g/d had ISN/RPS class III, IV, or mixed histology. Because LN is frequently asymptomatic, SLE patients should be monitored every 3–6 months with creatinine, urinalysis, and UPCR, with high-risk patients requiring frequent monitoring, especially in the first 5 years of SLE diagnosis.

### One-third of patients with lupus nephritis classified as complete responders continue to accrue progressive renal damage despite resolution of proteinuria [^115A2jzM]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We acknowledge that proteinuria remains an important biomarker in current clinical practice. At the population level, proteinuria is still generally successful at risk stratifying which patients will progress to severe CKD, especially ESRD. Follow-up analyses of both the MAINTAIN Nephritis Trialand the Euro-Lupus Nephritis cohortdetermined that proteinuria of < 700–800 mg/g after 12 months of treatment was generally predictive of a positive long-term renal outcome, defined as a serum creatinine of ≤ 1.0 mg/dL after 7 years in these studies. The sensitivity and specificity of this proteinuria threshold in predicting a positive long-term outcome were 70%–80% in both cohorts. While this demonstrates the broad prognostic ability of proteinuria, it also indicates that there were a significant portion of patients for whom reduced proteinuria did not portend long-term renal protection or vice versa. This is conceptually consistent with the results of our work and likewise highlights the limitation of proteinuria as a metric of treatment success for any given individual. It is additionally worth noting that a serum creatinine of 1.0 mg/dL would represent a 20%–30% loss of eGFR for most young women who start with an eGFR of > 100 pre-LN, as in the patients in this study.

Our work complements prior studies which used protocol kidney biopsies in LN, which have shown that proteinuria can be absent in the presence of active renal histology (or vice versa). Wakasugi et al performed renal biopsies on nearly 200 patients with lupus with and without clinical renal involvement, which was defined as proteinuria > 400 mg/g, active urinary sediment, and/or eGFR < 67 mL/min/1.73 m² in their analysis. They discovered that up to 20% of cases of class III, IV and V LN diagnosed on biopsy were entirely clinically silent based on the criteria above. More recently, De Rosa et al performed per protocol renal biopsies on a subset of patients with LN who had been in renal remission for at least 12 months. Persistent histological activity was present in 44% of these participants (despite resolution of proteinuria), and the activity index on biopsy could accurately predict which participants would experience a renal flare when immunosuppression was tapered. Malvar et al similarly identified a discordance between clinical and histological features in patients with proliferative LN: one-third of patients with clinical response had persistently high histological activity, and roughly two-thirds of patients in histological remission would still be considered clinically active based on the presence of proteinuria.

### Effects of receiving renal biopsy on the prognosis of chronic kidney disease patients with impaired renal function [^115XTGzi]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the current study, baseline 24 h UPE turned out to be an independent predictor for poor renal outcomes in patients who did not receive renal biopsy, while not being a risk factor for patients receiving renal biopsy. A study enrolled 638,150 adults suggested that proteinuria of increasing severity is associated with a faster rate of renal function decline, regardless of baseline eGFR. After analyzing data from 28 cohorts including 693,816 participants, Coresh et al. found that in individuals with baseline albumin creatine ratio (ACR) of 300 mg/g or higher, a 30% decrease in ACR over 2 years was estimated to confer a more than 1% absolute reduction in 10-year risk of ESRD, indicating that the decrease of 24 h UPE had protective effects on the long-term renal outcomes for CKD patients. Our results suggested that renal biopsy was highly recommended for patients with a baseline 24 h UPE of 1 g/d or higher, as well as for patients with hypertension, DM, anemia and hematuria. While for patients with a 24 h UPE less than 1 g/d, there was no significant difference for renal survival probability between biopsy and non-biopsy group. However, a retrospective study revealed that SLE patients with low-level proteinuria may have significant lupus- or non-lupus-related kidney diseases with management implications, suggesting that current guidelines are supposed to expand renal biopsy indications to include isolated proteinuria of any grade. Although the current study indicated that 24 h UPE less than 1 g/d was not associated with poor renal outcomes for patients without receiving renal biopsy, the study was limited by its relatively small sample size as well as short follow-up period, with only few patients coming to endpoints in the cohort of patients with 24 h UPE less than 1 g/d. Studies with large amounts of patients are needed to provide more accurate instructions.

### Renal biopsy in 2015 – from epidemiology to evidence-based indications [^112X6S2f]. American Journal of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Although the number of patients reaching end-stage kidney disease without a biopsy-proven diagnosis is increasing, the utility of renal biopsy is still an object of debate. We analyzed epidemiological data and the main indications for renal biopsy with a systematic, evidence-based review at current literature.

Summary

There is a high discrepancy observed in biopsy rates and in the epidemiology of glomerular diseases worldwide, related to the different time frame of the analyzed reports, lack of data collection, the different reference source population and the heterogeneity of indications. The evidence-based analysis of indications showed that renal biopsy should be crucial in adults with nephrotic syndrome or urinary abnormalities as coexistent hematuria and proteinuria and in corticosteroid resistant-children with severe proteinuria. The knowledge of renal histology can change the clinical management in patients with acute kidney injury significantly, after the exclusion of pre-renal or obstructive causes of kidney damage. Scarce evidence indicates that renal biopsy can be useful in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease and its use should always be considered after weighing the benefits and potential risks. Renal biopsy should be crucial in patients with renal involvement due to systemic disease. In patients with diabetes with atypical features, renal biopsy may be fundamental to diagnose an unexpected parenchymal disease mislabeled as diabetic nephropathy. Finally, in elderly patients, the indications and the risks are not different from those in the general population.

Key Message

Renal biopsy still remains a concrete approach for managing a substantial percentage of renal diseases.

### Posttransplantation proteinuria: an approach to diagnosis and management [^112NmbuH]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2011). Low credibility.

Proteinuria is a common problem encountered in the treatment of renal transplant recipients, occurring in up to 45% of patients. Proteinuria from native kidneys falls rapidly after renal transplantation, and persistent or worsening proteinuria is usually indicative of allograft pathology. Biopsy studies of transplant patients with proteinuria have confirmed that transplant-specific diagnoses (transplant glomerulopathy, interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, and acute rejection) are more commonly found than other proteinuric conditions, such as glomerulonephritis. As in the nontransplant setting, proteinuria is associated with worse clinical outcomes, including an increased risk for death, cardiovascular events, and graft loss. Blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers will reduce proteinuria, but the long-term effect of these medications on patient and graft survival remains unknown.

### Epidemiology of 10-year paediatric renal biopsies in the region of Southern Croatia [^116BdGun]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Almost half of the indications for renal biopsy occur with combination of NS and nephritic syndrome with nephrotic proteinuria, which is mostly in line with previous studies. In our study isolated hematuria was the fourth indication for renal biopsy with 16.7% of cases, which is slightly more than in our previous study (12.3%). Coppo et al. and Rychlík et al. found that isolated hematuria was the key indication for renal biopsy in children. This may be true because indications for renal biopsy in asymptomatic patients with microscopic hematuria are debatable. Study of Zhai et al. suggests that isolated hematuria has relatively low risk of severe pathohistological lesions and that long-term monitoring is recommended, while Coppo et al. suggested that kidney biopsy should be made promptly.

In our study, acute renal failure was a less important reason for renal biopsy, while some studies reported similar, higher (10.7–17.5%), or lower numbers (1.4–4.4%). Similarly, chronic renal failure, was also less important reason for renal biopsy in our research.

By comparing different studies, we could show that indications for renal biopsy have changed throughout time. Thus, in the study of Yin et al. an increasing trend of NS and decreasing trend of acute glomerulonephritis (AGN), rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) and isolated hematuria had been described, while the study in Czech Republic displayed an increase of isolated haematuria and decrease of NS as a reason for renal biopsy. Comparison of our two studies showed almost the same percentages of NS and AGN, there was a modest increase of isolated hematuria and a decrease of non- nephrotic proteinuria as the indication for renal biopsy during that period.

The most common PHD diagnosis in our research was IgAN. These findings are similar to study done by Coppo et al. and others. Contrary to our results, some studies found lower frequency of IgAN or had not mentioned IgAN at all.

### Kidney biopsy in very elderly patients: indications, therapeutic impact and complications [^116x5gMQ]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Few data is available on the risk/benefit balance of native kidney biopsy (KB) in very elderly patients.

Methods

Multicenter retrospective cohort study in the Aix-Marseille area: the results of KB and medical charts of all patients over 85years biopsied between January 2010 and December 2018 were reviewed.

Results

104 patients were included. Median age was 87years. Indications for KB were: acute kidney injury (AKI) in 69.2% of patients, nephrotic syndrome (NS) with AKI in 13.5%, NS without AKI in 12.5%, and proteinuria in 4.8%. Median serum creatinine was 262μmol/L, 21% of patients required dialysis at the time of KB. Significant bleeding occurred in 7 (6.7%) patients, requiring blood cell transfusion in 4 (3.8%), and radiological embolization in 1 (1%). The most frequent pathological diagnoses were: non-diabetic glomerular diseases (29.8%, including pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis in 9.6%), hypertensive nephropathy (27.9%), acute interstitial nephritis (16.3%), renal involvement of hematological malignancy (8.7%), and acute tubular necrosis (6.7%). After KB, 51 (49%) patients received a specific treatment: corticosteroids (41.3%), cyclophosphamide (6.7%), rituximab (6.7%), bortezomib (3.8%), other chemotherapies (3.8%). Median overall survival was 31months.

Conclusions

KB can reveal a diagnosis with therapeutic impact even in very elderly patients. Severe bleeding was not frequent in this cohort, but KB may have not been performed in more vulnerable patients.

Clinical indications

Figure 3 shows the clinical indications of renal biopsy. Sub-nephrotic proteinuria was the most common clinical indication for kidney biopsy, accounting of 47.8% (n = 160) of all cases, followed by nephrotic syndrome (n = 120, 35.8%), nephritic syndrome (n = 102, 30.4%), acute kidney injury (n = 94, 28.1%), unexplained renal impairment (n = 30, 9.0%) and others (n = 15, 4.5%). The 'others' category included any kidney biopsy in which the treating nephrologist did not specify the indication of the procedure on pathology request form.

Pathological diagnosis

Diabetes nephropathy (DN) was the most common pathological finding, accounting for 12.8% (n = 71), followed by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) (n = 47, 8.5%), glomerulomegaly (n = 44, 7.9%), IgA nephropathy (n = 44, 7.9%) and hypertensive renal disease (n = 14, 2.5%). Post-infective glomerulonephritis (PIGN) contributed to 4.5% (n = 25) of the renal biopsy in the Northern Territory.

Based on the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society classification, the cohort of lupus nephritis (LN) was categorised as follows: class I (n = 22, 4.0%), class II (n = 8, 1.4%), class III (n = 11, 2.0%), class IV (n = 17, 3.1%) and class V (n = 12, 2.1%).

### Remission of proteinuria in primary glomerulonephritis: we know the goal but do we know the price? [^114quB7t]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

Membranous nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and IgA nephropathy are the most commonly recognized types of primary glomerulonephritis that progress to end-stage renal disease. Persistent proteinuria is a major determinant of such progression. Reduction of proteinuria slows progression of renal disease and improves renal survival, but many of the agents used to reduce proteinuria carry a considerable risk of toxicity. The assessment of benefit versus risk of these medications can be further complicated by the temporal disconnect between the onset of benefit and of serious adverse events. In addition, relapses are common in these disorders and there is often a need for retreatment. Such retreatment might lead to repeated and/or prolonged drug exposure and to the oversight or underestimation of the cumulative dose of these agents because of the potentially extended interval between relapses. Consequently, it is very important to constantly review each patient's status and take into account their age, comorbid conditions and cumulative drug exposure when assessing treatment options. The potentially delayed development of adverse events also emphasizes the need for long-term surveillance of patients who receive immunosuppressive treatment for glomerular disease, often well beyond their drug exposure period and even when the treatment has been successful.

### Clinicopathological spectrum of biopsy-proven renal diseases of patients at a single center in sri lanka: a cross sectional retrospective review [^112uC3hH]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

Clinical and pathological records of adult patients (≥ 18 years) who had a native kidney biopsy performed at the nephrology unit in Colombo South Teaching Hospital (CSTH), Sri Lanka during the period of March 2018 to October 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Colombo South Teaching Hospital is one of the leading tertiary care centers in Sri Lanka and patients with renal diseases are referred to the nephrology team lead by the consultant nephrologist. If indications are sufficient, the consultant nephrologists would direct the patients for renal biopsy which are being performed under real time ultra sound scan guidance. Renal biopsy was not performed on patients who had diabetes mellitus with diabetic retinopathy unless there was a compelling indication.

Indications for renal biopsy

Indications for biopsy were defined as follows:
Acute kidney injury without obvious etiology (AKI) – Increase in serum creatinine by > 0.3mg/dl (> 26.5 mmol/l) within 48 hours; or increase in serum creatinine > 1.5 times of baseline, which is known or presumed to have occurred within the prior 7 days; or urine volume < 0.5ml/kg/h for 6 hours without a known etiology.
Chronic renal disease without obvious etiology (CKD) – Abnormality of kidney functions or structure present for 3 months without obvious etiology with normal kidney sizes were not contraindications for biopsy.
Nephrotic range proteinuria- Defined by 24-hr urine protein > 3 g/day/1.73 m², UPCR > 300mmol/l with or without edema.
Sub nephrotic range proteinuria-Defined by 24-hr urine protein between 1–3 g/day/1.73 m², Urine Protein Creatinine Ratio (UPCR) between 100–300mmol/l.
Haematuria – Microscopic presence of red cells in urine full report together with the presence of proteinuria (Hematuria alone was not an indication for renal biopsy).

Diagnosis criteria for hypertensive nephropathy (HTN).

The criteria for the diagnosis of hypertensive nephropathy were as follows: i) > 5 year history of primary hypertension that is typically accompanied by left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary heart disease, heart failure, cerebral arteriosclerosis and/or history of cerebral vascular accident; ii) relatively normal urine sediment; iii) retinal arteriosclerosis or arteriosclerotic changes in the retina; iv) slowly progressive renal insufficiency with gradually increasing proteinuria that is usually non-nephrotic; v) hypertension precedes the development of either proteinuria or renal insufficiency and there is no other obvious cause of renal disease.

Methods

Patient demographics

Between January 2011 and December 2013, 14 patients (11 male and 4 female) between 18 to 80 years old (mean age 58.8 years) were referred to our division for retroperitoneal LESS for renal biopsy. All these patients had absolute contraindications for a percutaneous renal biopsy.

All patients had abnormal proteinuria and or renal insufficiency, defined by a serum creatinine of > 1.4 mg/dL (14 cases) and were referred for a LESS renal biopsy. All patients had undergone a complete evaluation by a nephrologist beforehand. Proteinuria ranged between 75 to 721 mg/dL; average serum creatinine was 2.15 mg/dL (range: 0.98 to 4.98). Three patients had morbid obesity; mean body mass index was 55 kg/m² (range: 51.3 to 60.5). Of the entire group, three patient were ASA (American Society of Anesthesia) class 1, eight were ASA class 2, and three were ASA class 3 (morbid obesity). The indications for pursuing a laparoscopic approach are listed in Table 1.

Table 1
Patient indications for performing LESS renal biopsy, surgical data and histopatological diagnosis based on retroperiotneoscopic LESS renal biopsy

OT: Operative time in minutes; ANP: Analgesia Post Surgery; HS Hospital Stay.

Patients were fully informed about the risks, benefits, alternatives, personnel and the novelty of Retroperitoneal LESS Renal Biopsy. Before surgery, we ensured that each patient had provided consent for this procedure. They were informed that retroperitoneal access via Petit's Triangle would be secured as a matter of routine in each case and that, at the surgeon's discretion, the procedure would be converted to standard laparoscopic surgery on failure to progress. Each patient was informed that such elective conversion to standard laparoscopy was not a complication but rather surgical prudence because of the novelty of this procedure. All data were collected retrospectively in excel file without any patient identifying information. The techniques used were all part of routine care at Department of Urology University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, and since each patient signed a general consent to the processing of personal data, formal ethical approval from our institutional review board was not necessary.

Rationale for screening and biopsy in HCV-related glomerular disease — The prevalence of glomerular disease in patients infected with HCV is not known. However, HCV is associated with MPGN and possibly with other glomerular diseases. Thus, screening HCV-infected patients for hematuria, proteinuria, or reduced GFR can detect cases of HCV-related CKD (5.1). This screening would have to be carried out by hepatologists, infectious disease specialists, or general internists who care for the majority of HCV-infected patients. Kidney biopsy is indicated when HCV infection is suspected as a cause of hematuria, proteinuria, or reduced GFR (5.2).

### Utility of renal biopsy in the clinical management of renal disease [^1151Jggz]. Kidney International (2014). Low credibility.

Characterizing chronic kidney disease (CKD) at all stages is an essential part of rational management and the renal biopsy plays a key role in defining the processes involved. There remain no global guidelines available to the renal community on indications for this important diagnostic, prognostic, and relatively safe test. Although most nephrologists recognize several clear indications for a renal biopsy, it is still underutilized. It not only helps the clinician to manage the patient with CKD, but it can also help clarify the epidemiology of CKD, and aid research into the pathobiology of disease with the aim of discovering new therapies. It may be useful for instance in elderly patients with CKD, those with diabetes and presumed 'hypertensive nephropathy', and in some patients with advanced CKD as part of the pretransplant work-up. In some populations (for example, immunoglobulin A nephropathy and ANCA vasculitis), renal biopsy allows disease classification that may predict CKD progression and response to therapy. For the individual, interval renal biopsy may be of use in providing ongoing therapeutic and prognostic information. Molecular advances will change the landscape of renal pathology and add a new dimension to the diagnostic precision of kidney biopsy. Organizing the multiplicity of information available in a renal biopsy to maximize benefits to the patient, as well as to the epidemiologist and researcher, is one of the challenges that face the nephrology community.

### KDOQI clinical practice guideline for diabetes and CKD: 2012 update [^111ioe8P]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2012). Medium credibility.

KDOQI Diabetes Guideline: 2012 Update — research priorities in diabetic kidney disease (DKD) state that, given the limitations of albuminuria as an outcome measure, studies are needed to evaluate durability of effects on urinary albumin excretion, and the categorization of albuminuria outcomes should be based on a minimum of two of three consecutive urine samples being in the same category. Consider an indication for regulatory approval based on demonstration of a lasting reduction in urinary albumin excretion, but conditional upon firm commitment to continue long-term studies to determine effects on GFR (glomerular filtration rate) loss and clinically relevant outcomes. Evaluate the relative roles of ACE-Is (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors), ARBs (angiotensin receptor blockers), renin blockers, and mineralocorticoid receptor blockers on progression of DKD in patients with albuminuria. Kidney biopsy outcomes based on carefully measured structural variables that correlate strongly with GFR loss may reduce the duration of primary prevention or early intervention DKD clinical trials, and enzyme replacement for Fabry's Disease is given as an example. Clinical trials represent important opportunities to advance knowledge beyond addressing the primary hypotheses themselves, and protocols should include plans for acquiring and banking blood, urine, DNA, and other samples for eventual biomarker discovery and validation, with the DCCT cited as an example.

### Effects of receiving renal biopsy on the prognosis of chronic kidney disease patients with impaired renal function [^114Prvw4]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We demonstrated that CKD patients with impaired renal function who received renal biopsy had better long-term renal outcomes compared to patients without receiving renal biopsy. And baseline 24 h urine protein excretion more than 1 g/d was an independent predictor for poor renal outcomes in patients without specific pathological diagnosis, but not for patients receiving renal biopsy, indicating that renal biopsy should be strongly recommended for CKD patients with impaired renal function, especially for those with relatively mass urine protein excretion.

Kidney biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of pathological kidney diseases since the early 1950s. However, it is an invasive procedure with potential risks, and is recommended only when the pathological findings may affect treatments or provide information for prognosis. Impaired renal function (elevated serum creatine level or decreased eGFR) has been seen as a symbol of chronic renal damage, and renal tissue obtained from biopsy may not give enough information for accurate diagnosis if chronic damage (tubulointerstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, arteriosclerosis) prevails. As a result, in previous studies indicating the protective effects of renal biopsy, the change of treatments or improvement of renal outcomes commonly resulted from the biopsy diagnosis in patients with acute kidney injury and nephrotic syndrome, less commonly in those with chronic impaired renal function. However, the major managements for CKD patients with impaired renal function were mainly limited to supportive treatments including blood pressure control, use of ACEI/ARB, restriction of the salt and protein intake, glycemic control and prevention of complications. The above supportive treatments were not specifically targeted therapies, which cannot effectively defer the progression of the disease in some cases.

### Renal biopsy: update [^115CAhEo]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The renal biopsy is an invaluable tool in the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of patients with kidney disease. As the success of the procedure is defined not only by the ability to obtain adequate tissue but also by the safety profile, significant advances which define risk factors and determine the optimal timing of observation after the percutaneous native renal biopsy merit discussion. Alternative methods of obtaining tissue, such as transvenous renal biopsies, have also been described, especially in patients with contraindications to the percutaneous method.

Recent Findings

The percutaneous renal biopsy has been established as a safe and effective method of obtaining renal parenchyma. Complications, although rare, may occur and the majority of these are related to bleeding. The optimal timing of observation after the biopsy should be determined by when most complications occur, and, as over 33% of complications occur after 8 h, an observation period of at least 24 h is recommended. In patients with contraindications to the percutaneous approach, such as failure of adequate radiologic visualization or a bleeding diathesis, alternative methods of obtaining tissue have been attempted. These include open, laparascopic, transurethral, or transvenous renal biopsy.

Summary

Without contraindications, the percutaneous renal biopsy remains the standard method of acquiring renal tissue. At least 24 h of observation is recommended after the percutaneous native kidney biopsy for the development of potential complications. When a contraindication to the procedure exists, other methods of renal biopsy by experienced physicians may be attempted.
