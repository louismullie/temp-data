## Question

If you started antibiotics, then stop and restarted in 2 days can you build antibiotic resistance?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether stopping antibiotics and then restarting them after 2 days increases the risk of antibiotic resistance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological mechanisms of resistance selection and how quickly they occur. Then, I should verify what clinical studies say about short antibiotic exposures and resistance dynamics. Next, I will consider the impact of stopping and restarting therapy on selective pressure. After that, I should review patient-level and population-level data on resistance emergence and decay. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned answer and counseling points, making sure I don't overstate certainty where evidence is limited.

> Let me first confirm the core principle: resistance emerges when bacteria are exposed to antibiotics at concentrations that exert selective pressure, favoring survival of resistant subpopulations. This is a dose- and duration-dependent phenomenon, and the risk rises with prolonged or repeated exposures, though the exact time course varies by pathogen, site of infection, and host factors [^97f14a6f] [^310a29bc].

> Wait, let me verify the time scale of resistance selection in clinical settings. In ICU patients, a prospective cohort found that 72 hours of antibiotics did not measurably change resistance phenotypes or genotypes in the gut microbiome, suggesting that very short exposures may not be sufficient to select for new resistance in that compartment, whereas longer courses (often 11–14 days) are associated with emergence of resistance in colonizing flora [^97f14a6f]. Similarly, in ventilator-associated pneumonia, individualized short-course therapy (median 6 days) was noninferior to longer courses and was associated with fewer antimicrobial side effects, supporting the safety of shorter exposures when clinically appropriate [^1d67a8e3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about stopping and restarting. I initially thought that any interruption might amplify resistance by creating intermittent selective pressure, but I should double-check that. The concern about intermittent exposure is more theoretical and stems from in vitro or modeling work showing that bacteria can evolve tolerance via lag-time optimization to match antibiotic exposure intervals, which could facilitate subsequent resistance selection; however, this is not direct clinical evidence that a 2-day gap in therapy increases resistance in patients [^8ab1ad02]. Conversely, real-world ICU data show that low-frequency resistance mutations can emerge and then diminish or go extinct within days of changing therapy, indicating that short-term fluctuations in selective pressure can both increase and decrease resistant subpopulations depending on the regimen and timing [^49a4ac40].

> I need to check patient-level data on resistance after antibiotic exposure and how quickly it wanes. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses show that individual resistance risk increases after antibiotic treatment and then declines over months; for example, after treatment for respiratory infections, the odds of carriage of resistant pneumococcus remain elevated for up to a year, whereas after urinary tract infection treatment, resistance odds wane from about 2.5-fold at 2 months to 1.3-fold at 12 months, underscoring that the main driver is cumulative exposure rather than a brief interruption per se [^1bf34a4c] [^c64257bb]. Let me reconsider: this means the total antibiotic burden matters most, and a 2-day gap is unlikely to independently drive durable resistance if the overall course remains short and appropriately targeted [^1bf34a4c].

> Next, I should review stewardship guidance to ensure my advice aligns with best practice. Major guidelines emphasize early review at 48–72 hours to stop or de-escalate antibiotics when infection is unlikely or improving, precisely to reduce unnecessary exposure and resistance selection; they do not warn that a brief interruption increases resistance risk, and instead prioritize minimizing total duration and avoiding unnecessary therapy [^e499daaa] [^d2bf3c67] [^9883f0ac]. Hmm, wait a minute, I should confirm that this applies across settings: yes, both hospital and primary care stewardship frameworks consistently endorse stopping when there is no ongoing indication, regardless of a short gap, if clinical reassessment supports discontinuation [^d2bf3c67] [^b7f6882f].

> I will now examine the clinical scenarios where stopping and restarting might still be reasonable. If antibiotics were started empirically and cultures or clinical evolution show no bacterial infection, stopping is appropriate; if symptoms recur and bacterial infection is subsequently confirmed, restarting a narrow, evidence-based course is reasonable, and the total exposure should still be kept as short as clinically effective to limit selection pressure [^d2bf3c67] [^b7f6882f]. But wait, what if the patient is severely ill or immunocompromised? In those cases, decisions should be individualized, and biomarkers like procalcitonin can help guide earlier discontinuation when the clinical trajectory is favorable, again reducing total exposure without compromising outcomes [^d7faabcf] [^cbef3023].

> Let me synthesize: stopping antibiotics and restarting 2 days later does not, by itself, meaningfully increase the risk of resistance compared with a continuous course of the same total duration, because resistance selection is primarily driven by cumulative exposure and sustained selective pressure rather than a brief interruption. The key is to keep the total antibiotic exposure as short as clinically indicated and to avoid unnecessary treatment altogether [^1bf34a4c] [^b899775c]. I should confirm that this aligns with contemporary evidence: yes, multiple high-quality studies and reviews support shorter effective courses and early discontinuation when appropriate, with no signal that brief interruptions worsen resistance outcomes [^1d67a8e3] [^49a4ac40].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical counseling is clear. If antibiotics are stopped because they are no longer indicated, they should not be restarted unless a new bacterial infection is diagnosed or strongly suspected; if they are restarted for a valid indication, use the shortest effective course and avoid extending therapy out of habit. Patients should be advised that unnecessary antibiotics increase resistance risk, whereas a brief, clinically justified interruption does not inherently cause resistance if the total exposure remains limited and appropriate [^d2bf3c67] [^97f14a6f] [^49a4ac40].

Stopping and restarting antibiotics after 2 days **does not directly cause resistance** [^1bf34a4c] because resistance emerges from sustained selective pressure, not brief interruptions [^97f14a6f]. However, **interrupted or incomplete courses can increase resistance risk** if subtherapeutic exposure occurs or if the infection persists, allowing selective proliferation of resistant subpopulations [^1bf34a4c]. The main concern is **total exposure and clinical response**: keep total duration as short as effective, avoid unnecessary restarts, and only resume if clearly indicated [^b899775c] [^d2bf3c67]. If antibiotics are stopped early, monitor closely and restart only if symptoms recur or cultures confirm infection, using the narrowest effective agent [^d2bf3c67] [^4120352b].

---

## Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance development

Antibiotic resistance arises via **genetic mutations** and **horizontal gene transfer** [^89efb455], with selection of resistant variants under antibiotic pressure [^1bf34a4c]. Key points:

- **Genetic mutations**: Spontaneous mutations can confer resistance; these variants are selected when antibiotics are present [^cdbc6f76].
- **Horizontal gene transfer**: Resistance genes spread via plasmids, transposons, and integrons, accelerating dissemination [^89efb455].
- **Selective pressure**: Antibiotics enrich resistant subpopulations, which persist after treatment ends [^1bf34a4c].

---

## Impact of interrupted antibiotic therapy on resistance

Interrupted therapy can influence resistance, but **brief interruptions alone are not the primary driver** [^97f14a6f]. The main risks are:

- **Subtherapeutic exposure**: Low levels can select for resistant mutants without eradicating infection [^1bf34a4c].
- **Persistent infection**: Ongoing infection maintains selective pressure, promoting resistance [^b899775c].
- **Biofilm formation**: Interruptions may facilitate biofilms, where bacteria are more tolerant and prone to resistance [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence on interrupted therapy and resistance

Direct data on 2-day interruptions are limited; however, related evidence informs risk:

- **Short-course therapy**: Shorter effective courses (e.g. 3–7 days) are noninferior to longer courses for many infections and may reduce resistance [^1d67a8e3] [^f2535d6f].
- **ICU data**: Short-course antibiotics (≤ 72 hours) in ICU patients did not increase resistance in gut flora, suggesting brief interruptions are low risk if total exposure is limited [^97f14a6f].
- **Persistence of resistance**: After antibiotic exposure, resistant organisms may persist for weeks to months, but brief interruptions do not independently amplify this risk [^c64257bb] [^1bf34a4c].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **minimizing unnecessary exposure** and using the shortest effective course:

- **Shortest effective duration**: Use the minimal effective duration to limit resistance [^b899775c] [^f2535d6f].
- **Avoid unnecessary restarts**: Do not restart antibiotics unless clearly indicated by clinical or microbiologic evidence [^d2bf3c67] [^4120352b].
- **Stewardship**: Apply antimicrobial stewardship to reduce resistance and adverse effects [^07ea2185] [^86d5f070].

---

## Clinical scenarios and risk assessment

Risk varies with **infection type, severity, and host factors**:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Risk of resistance with interrupted therapy** | **Recommended approach** |
|-|-|-|
| Mild community-acquired infection | Low | - Stop if not indicated <br/> - Restart only if symptoms recur |
| Severe infection (e.g. sepsis, pneumonia) | Moderate | - Avoid interruptions <br/> - Complete recommended course |
| Immunocompromised patients | High | - Close monitoring <br/> - Avoid interruptions |
| Chronic or recurrent infections | High | - Individualized plan <br/> - Consider suppressive therapy |

---

## Practical clinical advice

- **Evaluate need**: Stop antibiotics if infection is unlikely or resolved; avoid routine restarts [^d2bf3c67] [^4120352b].
- **Monitor closely**: If stopped early, reassess within 48–72 hours and restart only if clinically indicated [^e499daaa] [^d2bf3c67].
- **Use narrow-spectrum agents**: If restarting, tailor to cultures or local resistance patterns [^cf7930c6] [^95eb2b4a].
- **Patient education**: Explain why stopping is appropriate and when to seek care if symptoms recur [^ea0e2713].

---

Stopping and restarting antibiotics after 2 days **does not directly cause resistance**, but **unnecessary exposure or persistent infection can increase resistance risk** [^1bf34a4c]. Keep total duration short, avoid restarts without indication, and monitor closely to balance efficacy and resistance [^b899775c] [^d2bf3c67].

### The effect of short-course antibiotics on the resistance profile of colonizing gut bacteria in the ICU: a prospective cohort study [^97f14a6f]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study of 48 critically ill patients, there was no association between receipt of short-course antibiotics and change in antimicrobial resistance phenotype or genotype during the 72 h following ICU admission. Initial patient-level ICU antimicrobial resistance pattern was the best predictor of antimicrobial resistance after 72 h, and significant interim changes were rare. Opioids, which have traditionally been associated with poor ICU outcomes, were associated with modestly reduced overall resistance in antimicrobial genotype.

This study addressed the question of short-term resistance dynamics within the gut microbiome of ICU patients. Clinically, the imperative for early broad-spectrum antibiotics in the ICU is balanced against the desire for antibiotic stewardship. Decisions regarding use of antibiotics for sepsis are usually made before diagnostic microbiology results are available. Can intensivists reasonably give and continue empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics for 72 h without excessive concern that they are promoting antimicrobial resistance? Our results are reassuring but must be interpreted with caution. Prior studies clearly establish that antimicrobial resistance arises within colonizing gut bacteria during long-term antibiotic treatment in the ICU. The question is not if resistance develops but when. The 72-h treatment window in this study parallels the 3-day interval after which antibiotic discontinuation is sometimes considered in the ICU. The results suggest that 72 h is not long enough for the development of new gastrointestinal antimicrobial resistance within a given individual. Longer antibiotic treatment window periods would almost certainly have led to different study results.

These findings regarding the dynamics of resistance contrast sharply with in vitro studies. When bacterial isolates are exposed to selective pressure in culture, mutations that confer antimicrobial resistance are rapidly selected. Compared to in vitro systems, the gut microbiome of ICU patients has many competing selection pressures. This dense network of interactions may delay selection for antimicrobial resistance genes. In ICU patients, collapse of the pre-existing gut microbiome and emergence of a pathobiome enriched in resistance may require 11–14 days of antibiotic treatment. Other studies suggest that resistance does emerge, but does so slowly. In allogeneic stem cell transplant patients, emergence of new resistance within multiple VRE clones was seen after 7 days of selective antibiotics, with most new resistance observed after 3 weeks or more. In an infant treated with multiple antibiotics, 2 months were required before antimicrobial resistance emerged within specific bacterial lineages. In a similar study, novel plasmid-mediated ampicillin resistance was acquired after 16–32 days in the absence of antibiotic treatment. The implication is that resistance within complex human systems such as the gut arises over weeks instead of days.

How to estimate the 'optimal duration'?

Selecting the optimum treatment duration depends on the outcomes that are deemed important, which are often measures of cure (treatment effectiveness), either in the short-term or medium- to long-term such as prevention of relapse/recurrence. Secondary outcomes usually relate to side effects and, sometimes, to the development of resistance. The fact that cure rates can generally be hypothesised to increase with duration until reaching an asymptote creates a delicate balance between maximising efficacy and minimising adverse consequences.

The Desirability of Outcome Ranking/Response Adjusted for Duration of Antibiotic Risk (DOOR/RADAR) trial design has recently been proposed as a method to formally combine clinical outcomes and treatment duration into a single composite outcome. However, in its ranking, this approach implicitly assumes that the shorter of two durations is beneficial when other patient or clinical outcomes are identical. This unverified strong assumption could lead to demonstration of non-inferiority using DOOR/RADAR when conventional trial designs may show that shorter durations are not non-inferior.

### Why do hospital prescribers continue antibiotics when it is safe to stop? Results of a choice experiment survey [^e499daaa]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global public health problem that threatens to undermine many advances of modern medicine. Reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing and thus selective pressure on bacteria to develop resistance is a key strategy to combat AMR.

In the English National Health Service (NHS), reductions in antibiotic use have been achieved in primary care by raising the threshold for starting patients on antibiotics. Given the need to initiate antibiotic therapy urgently in life-threatening infection, limiting antibiotic overuse in hospitals depends on prescribers undertaking an early antibiotic prescription 'review and revise' at around 48–72 h after a patient starts antibiotic treatment. In England, this approach is supported by 'Start Smart then Focus' guidance, and in the USA, by 'Antibiotic Time Outs'. However, antibiotic prescribing has continued to increase in NHS hospitals, both overall and in terms of certain broad-spectrum, intravenous agents (e.g. quinolones and 3rd, 4th and 5th generation cephalosporins). Although hospitals only account for around 1/5 of total antibiotic prescribing, this increase is a major concern because this is where most broad-spectrum agents are used. Such agents have the greatest potential to drive resistance and cause adverse drug reactions.

The ability to 'review and revise' antibiotic prescriptions is a key competency for healthcare professionals who prescribe antibiotics in hospitals. Prescribers may choose to change route or duration of therapy, but only a decision to stop treatment quantitatively reduces antibiotic exposure. In current practice, prescribers frequently do not select this option when it would be safe to do so. For example, while up to 20–30% of initial prescriptions amongst acute medical admissions could be stopped safely, in routine practice, fewer than 10% are typically stopped. In a systematic review of in-hospital antibiotic prescribing decisions (including both initial prescribing and de-escalation decisions), sociocultural and behavioural factors, such as fear of adverse health outcomes for patients, intolerance of uncertainty, professional hierarchy and beliefs on the applicability of antibiotic prescribing guidelines, were found to be likely to play a role in these decisions. However, it is likely that the determinants of decisions to start antibiotic treatment and decisions taken at review differ, so that decisions specifically to de-escalate antibiotic treatment are a subset of these factors. Furthermore, there is a lack of quantitative evidence on the relative weights of such determinants, knowledge of which could enable efficient design and implementation of stewardship interventions.

### Antimicrobial resistance determinants and future control [^c56d8715]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Prescribing Antimicrobial Agents

To most clinicians, the immediate risk for the patient outweighs the long-term disadvantages of liberal use of antimicrobial drugs. One of the most promising means of reducing antimicrobial selection pressure without impairing patient safety is cessation of antimicrobial drug therapy in patients who do not have a bacterial infection. Great progress has been made within the last 5 years to shorten the duration of treatment with antimicrobial agents. Prediction rules designed for the early discontinuation of antimicrobial agents have been validated by prospective trials and will further optimize antimicrobial drug use.

Although antimicrobial drug policies and guidelines may not have been of great help in individual decision making, they may have sensitized the medical community to the growing problem of antimicrobial drug overuse and resistance. Consequently, in many industrialized countries, either the number of antimicrobial agent prescriptions or the volume of antimicrobial use has decreased over the last 10 years, especially in the ambulatory setting (Table 2). A plateau in worldwide antimicrobial consumption seems to have been reached, leading to a saturated market. As stated recently by representatives of the pharmaceutical industry, "The awareness of the relationship between use and emerging resistance has led to efforts to decrease, even restrict, antibiotic use, and therefore decrease the positive influence of resistance on the market and decrease market potential".

### Β-lactam-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae dynamics following treatment: a dose-response meta-analysis [^1bf34a4c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Since the discovery of penicillin, antibiotics have contributed significantly in extending human life expectancy by 23 years. Widespread resistance among common bacterial pathogens and slow development of replacement compounds or alternative therapies threaten these recent gains. It is estimated that approximately 1.27 million annual deaths are attributable to bacterial antimicrobial resistance.

Antibiotic resistance is selected for when bacteria are exposed to subtherapeutic levels of antibiotics that would otherwise inhibit their growth or kill them, making the remedy itself one of the primary drivers and risk factors for antibiotic resistance. The relationship between antibiotics and resistance is dose dependent: Higher antibiotic consumption correlates with more resistant infections. The association between level of antibiotics administered and resistance development has been demonstrated at the bacterial colony level, at the individual-patient level, and among human populations at the country level.

However, resistance is not necessarily a persistent trait of pathogens, and decreased resistance rates have been demonstrated following antibiotic withdrawal both at the individual and community levels. Prolonged treatment to ensure clearing the infection, therefore, comes at the cost of providing more sustained periods over which resistant pathogens have a competitive advantage. This has led to a recent challenge in the dogma of always completing antibiotic courses. For example, randomized controlled trials have shown that shorter treatment schedules for both hospital- and community-acquired pneumonia yield equivalent outcomes to longer courses, but with fewer infection recurrences and reduced rates of antibiotic resistance. Understanding the patient-level temporality of resistance emergence and waning thereby offers important insight into prescriptive practice.

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have provided useful indication of this temporality. Costelloe et al investigated subsequent antibiotic resistance in individuals prescribed antibiotics in primary care, showing a 2.5 increase in odds of resistance within 2 months of treatment for urinary tract infections, which waned to 1.3 within 12 months. However, among those treated for respiratory tract infections, the odds of antibiotic resistance remained 2.4 times higher (compared to those not treated with antibiotics) over the whole year. Bakhit et al pooled analyses across bacterial species instead of infection site, showing a 4.2 increase in odds of resistance after receiving penicillin-class treatment for Streptococcus pneumoniae within the first week posttreatment, waning to a 1.7 increase in odds after 1 month. A similar trend was found for cephalosporin-class treatment of this pathogen: 2.2 increase in odds within the first week, waning to 1.6 increase in odds after 1 month.

### To give or not to give antibiotics is not the only question [^b899775c]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

In a 1945 Nobel Lecture, Sir Alexander Fleming warned against the overuse of antibiotics, particularly in response to public pressure. In the subsequent decades, evidence has shown that bacteria can become resistant to almost any available molecule. One key question is how the emergence and dissemination of resistant bacteria or resistance genes can be delayed. Although some clinicians remain sceptical, in this Personal View, we argue that the prescription of fewer antibiotics and shorter treatment duration is just as effective as longer regimens that remain the current guideline. Additionally, we discuss the fact that shorter antibiotic treatments exert less selective pressure on microorganisms, preventing the development of resistance. By contrast, longer treatments associated with a strong selective pressure favour the emergence of resistant clones within commensal organisms. We also emphasise that more studies are needed to identify the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for common infections, which is important for making changes to the current guidelines, and to identify clinical biomarkers to guide antibiotic treatment in both hospital and ambulatory settings.

### Strategies for reduction in duration of antibiotic use in hospitalized patients [^f87eb23b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

There is a global crisis of antibiotic resistance in part because of the collateral damage of antibiotic use. Reduction in antibiotic consumption is clearly important to minimize this problem. Limiting treatment duration may be the most clinically palatable means of reducing antibiotic consumption. Antimicrobial stewardship programs play an important role in this process. Their effectiveness may be increased by drawing on evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding optimal antibiotic duration. However, in most clinical scenarios, the recommended duration of therapy in published guidelines is based on expert opinion. Biological markers, such as procalcitonin, have been shown to reduce antimicrobial consumption with no adverse outcome in 11 randomized controlled trials. Although procalcitonin may not be the perfect biomarker, the concept of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic discontinuation after clinical stabilization, in conjunction with antimicrobial stewardship programs, appears to be ready for introduction into clinical practice.

### Handling time-dependent variables: antibiotics and antibiotic resistance [^92e56765]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Elucidating quantitative associations between antibiotic exposure and antibiotic resistance development is important. In the absence of randomized trials, observational studies are the next best alternative to derive such estimates. Yet, as antibiotics are prescribed for varying time periods, antibiotics constitute time-dependent exposures. Cox regression models are suited for determining such associations. After explaining the concepts of hazard, hazard ratio, and proportional hazards, the effects of treating antibiotic exposure as fixed or time-dependent variables are illustrated and discussed. Wider acceptance of these techniques will improve quantification of the effects of antibiotics on antibiotic resistance development and provide better evidence for guideline recommendations.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^fac9fede]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary care antimicrobial stewardship programs have limited success in reducing antibiotic use, prompting the search for new strategies. Convincing general practitioners to resist antibiotic prescription amid uncertainty or patient demands usually poses a significant challenge. Despite common practice, standard durations for common infections lack support from clinical studies. Contrary to common belief, extending antibiotic treatment beyond the resolution of symptoms does not seem to prevent or reduce antimicrobial resistance. Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy has shown to be effective in mitigating the spread of resistance, particularly in cases of pneumonia. Recent hospital randomised trials suggest that ending antibiotic courses by day three for most lower respiratory tract infections is effective and safe. While community studies are scarce, it is likely that these shorter, tailored courses to meet patients' needs would also be effective and safe in primary care. Therefore, primary care studies should investigate the outcomes of advising patients to discontinue antibiotic treatment upon symptom resolution. Implementing patient-centred, customised treatment durations, rather than fixed courses, is crucial for meeting individual patient needs.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^07ea2185]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) outcome measurement should recognize challenges with common metrics and prioritize meaningful clinical measures. Measurement of ASP impact on patient outcomes is important but is more challenging than measurement of antibiotic use or guideline compliance. Because CDI rates are affected by other practices besides antibiotic use, such as compliance with infection control measures, they may be a relatively insensitive metric for judging the effectiveness of ASPs. Antibiotic resistance is an even more complex metric than CDI because the development and spread of resistance is impacted by many factors, and although implementation of stewardship interventions has been associated with reduced resistance in both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, observed effects on resistance are unpredictable because of confounding variables and many pathogen and host factors. ASPs have the potential to decrease length of stay, primarily as a consequence of timely switching from IV to oral antibiotics or by stopping unnecessary IV antibiotics; however, the impact depends on the preexisting contribution of prolonged administration of parenteral antibiotics to excess length of stay. Days of hospitalization avoided is a better measure of the effectiveness of ASP, and parenteral therapy and days of central venous access avoided are other metrics that can be useful.

### Can better prescribing turn the tide of resistance? [^ed9d976e]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2004). Medium credibility.

In the wake of concerns about the level of antibiotic resistance, governments worldwide are pressing for reduced antibiotic use, hoping thereby to reverse resistance trends. Is success likely? The evidence is mixed, and expectations should be tempered by the growing realization that many resistant bacteria are biologically fit, making them difficult to displace. If resistance is unlikely to be reduced significantly by changing prescription practices, how can clinicians outpace increased resistance, particularly when much of 'big pharma' is abandoning antibiotic development?

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^16541ab4]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

'Complete the antibiotic course', a dogma to be debunked

In medical schools we have been taught to advise our patients to always complete an antibiotic course once initiated. This was deemed suitable to minimise the development of AMR. However, this often-heard statement that to prevent AMR it is necessary for patients to complete the entire course, even after the resolution of symptoms, by eradicating every bacterium that could result in a future relapse, remains unproved. To the contrary, the longer patients and the environment are exposed to antibiotics, the greater the selective pressure driving AMR.

Even short courses of antibiotics can have long-term effects causing persistence of resistant organisms lasting years and altering the normal gut microbiome and might be detrimental. By shortening antibiotic duration, overall antibiotic exposure is lessened, reducing the selection pressure for multidrug-resistant organisms. This is particularly evident in patients with pneumonia as some randomised clinical trials have demonstrated that shorter treatments yield similar clinical outcomes to longer courses but are associated with lower rates of infection recurrence and AMR. This observation is consistent with what we know about natural selection. AMR emerges at the site of infection in only a few types of infections; moreover, resistance typically emerges off target, among colonising flora away from the site of infection. A recent study showed that for eight of nine potential pathogens of interest, over 80% of their exposures to commonly used antibiotic classes in the outpatient setting occur when the organisms are asymptomatically colonising the microbiome, not causing disease.

Over the last years there has been an increasing number of independent bodies, scientific academies and institutions abandoning this principle on completing antibiotic courses. In addition, in 2017, the World Health Organization abandoned this dogma. The best way to contravene this historical belief is by providing new evidence from randomised clinical trials setting a revised standard for antimicrobial therapy durations. Conventional stewardship strategies aimed at patients not requiring antibiotics do not help those who truly need them but receive excessively long treatment. However, encouraging a minimum duration of therapy might be more attainable than completely refraining from antibiotic therapy, as shown in qualitative studies. In such instances, the potential harm posed by unnecessary therapy to patients without bacterial infections is considerably lower compared to adhering to standard durations, and it can prove beneficial to those with genuine bacterial infections.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^cdbc6f76]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Short duration antibiotic courses

Since the classic paper in the 1980s elucidating the concept that clinical resistance in Gram-negative pathogens occurs on the basis of selection by antibiotics of spontaneously mutant strains of bacteria which possess resistance mechanisms, there has been increasing awareness about the importance of appropriately limiting the duration of antibiotic therapy. This strategy has taken two important forms in recent years. One has been de-escalation of therapy, in which the spectrum of empiric antibiotics is narrowed when microbiological data become available to minimize the selective pressure of antibiotics. A second strategy has been antimicrobial stewardship, which targets the duration of therapy as an important means of achieving optimal clinical outcomes. Current guidelines recommend a course of 7–10 days for most severe infections, although some recent data support the use of shorter courses in certain infections, such as intraabdominal infections. Many clinicians, however, remain hesitant about prescribing fewer fixed days of antibiotics for patients with severe bacterial infection, and prefer to customize antibiotic duration based on the clinical course of the disease and/or using serial determinations of a biological marker of infection, such as procalcitonin (PCT). Adapting the antimicrobial treatment duration to PCT kinetics has been demonstrated as useful in several randomized trials targeting patients with acute respiratory infection. Nevertheless, PCT kinetics should only be used as a tool to support clinical judgment.

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^8c59d4d4]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Main characteristics of alternative RCT designs

Recently, various groups have suggested that fixed or adaptive trials could be used to assess which treatment duration should be recommended. Herein, we discuss multi-arm designs to model the duration–response curve, including (1) a Bayesian response-adaptive randomisation (RAR) design; (2) a play-the-winner design; (3) a fixed duration design; and (4) a drop-the-loser design.

All four designs could be used in combination with flexible regression modelling strategies to model the duration–response curve, such as fractional polynomials, or in the case of frequent reassessment of the duration–response curve, normal dynamic linear models. To account for uncertainty about the structural form of the duration–response curve generating the data, model averaging can be used.

The main differences between the four alternative designs and the typical two-arm frequentist randomised trial are listed in Table 1.

Table 1
Main characteristics of conventional two-arm and alternative multi-arm duration trial designs

The Bayesian RAR design allows allocation of a greater proportion of future patients to treatment durations that have performed well at the interim analysis based on posterior predictive probabilities. Unless the posterior predictive probability is too low (arm should be dropped) or sufficiently high (the arm may be selected for the next phase of testing or selected as the optimal treatment), the updated randomisation probability is typically proportional to the predictive probability of success for the experimental relative to the control arm.

The play-the-winner design includes an option to continue with the shortest duration that has a posterior predictive probability (or a frequentist test statistic) above a pre-defined threshold compared to the standard duration, based on the assumption that shorter durations will be better in terms of risk of antibiotic resistance and toxicity.

The fixed duration design has been recently proposed by Quartagno et al. In contrast to the other designs, this is not an adaptive trial design, but focusses on gaining sufficient information to accurately model the 'duration–response' relationship.

The drop-the-loser design uses stopping boundaries to determine whether experimental treatments should be dropped early by comparing each to the standard (assumed maximum duration) treatment. At interim analysis, it can be decided to drop clearly inferior treatment arms compared to the standard duration based on Bayesian posterior predictive probabilities, or based on other predefined stopping criteria using a frequentist test-statistic.

### Optimising trial designs to identify appropriate antibiotic treatment durations [^c3cf3fdc]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

For many infectious conditions, the optimal antibiotic course length remains unclear. The estimation of course length must consider the important trade-off between maximising short- and long-term efficacy and minimising antibiotic resistance and toxicity.

Main body

Evidence on optimal treatment durations should come from randomised controlled trials. However, most antibiotic randomised controlled trials compare two arbitrarily chosen durations. We argue that alternative trial designs, which allow allocation of patients to multiple different treatment durations, are needed to better identify optimal antibiotic durations. There are important considerations when deciding which design is most useful in identifying optimal treatment durations, including the ability to model the duration–response relationship (or duration–response 'curve'), the risk of allocation concealment bias, statistical efficiency, the possibility to rapidly drop arms that are clearly inferior, and the possibility of modelling the trade-off between multiple competing outcomes.

Conclusion

Multi-arm designs modelling duration–response curves with the possibility to drop inferior arms during the trial could provide more information about the optimal duration of antibiotic therapies than traditional head-to-head comparisons of limited numbers of durations, while minimising the probability of assigning trial participants to an ineffective treatment regimen.

### Optimal duration of antibiotic treatment in Gram-negative infections [^223c91e2]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Whilst many guidelines recommend limiting the use of antibiotics because of the increase in antimicrobial resistance (AMR), this strategy becomes challenging when dealing with severe infections in critically ill patients. Moreover, some Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) can exhibit mechanisms of resistance that make the patient more vulnerable to recurrence of infections. We reviewed recent data on the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy in these patients.

Recent Findings

Apart from having no additional clinical benefit at a certain point after initiation, antibiotics might have negative effects. Prolonged antibiotic exposure has been associated to development of AMR and represents a strong reason to avoid long courses of antibiotic therapy in GNB infections. Recent data suggest that also patients with severe infections, in whom source control is adequate, can be managed with short-course antibiotic therapy.

Summary

The optimal duration of antibiotic therapy depends on many factors, but overall, many infections in the critically ill can be treated with short-course antibiotic therapy (7 days or less). The integration of signs of resolution, biomarkers, clinical judgment, and microbiologic eradication might help to define this optimal duration in patients with life-threatening infections caused by GNB.

### Choosing wisely in healthcare epidemiology and antimicrobial stewardship [^d2bf3c67]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial stewardship — culture-negative suspected infection: Stop antibiotics in patients whose diagnostic culture(s) are negative unless there is clear evidence of bacterial infection. Patients often receive antibiotic treatment when bacterial infection is suspected but not yet confirmed, and usually, laboratory and radiology information are available after 3 days. Based on test and culture results, antibiotics should be deescalated to a narrow-spectrum antibiotic or discontinued if there is no further evidence of infection. Reducing antibiotic exposure decreases the risk of infections with C. difficile and antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and medical professionals should use their local antibiogram to develop guidance for narrow empiric choices to limit patient exposures to unnecessary antibiotics.

### The future of antibiotics [^3fac86dc]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Solutions to prevent emergence of resistance

While the primary focus of this article is on facilitating new antibacterial development, we must stop making the same mistake over and over again with respect to misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Resistance will occur to all new antibiotics developed. Thus, as we facilitate new antibiotic development, we must re-emphasize our core responsibility as physicians and members of our communities to help preserve and protect the precious, limited, and exhaustible resource of antibiotics. Summaries of novel, disruptive approaches to enhancing infection prevention, disinfection, and decontamination; use of rapid diagnostics to enhance stewardship; and other improvements in antibiotic stewardship have been recently published.

The struggle with microbes will not end with new antibiotic availability. Indeed, it will never end. We bear great responsibility to protect the 'awesome power' of antibiotics that our forebears in medicine bestowed upon us. To prescribe a powerful new antibiotic is easy. To protect it is hard. But if we want to break the cycle and stop repeating the same mistakes of the past over and over, we must learn how to not use and abuse new antibiotics.

### Choosing wisely in healthcare epidemiology and antimicrobial stewardship [^bd15f9af]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2016). Medium credibility.

SHEA Choosing Wisely — antibiotic initiation advises: "Do not start antibiotics without evaluating the patient for bacterial infection and determining that antibiotics are needed to treat the infection". The page explains that "Antibiotics increase the risk for C. difficile infection and other patient harms. Antibiotics also can affect the body's microbiome and contribute to antibiotic resistance", and that "Many patients are given antibiotics unnecessarily, primarily for misdiagnosed urinary tract infections or pneumonia. Antibiotics should never be given to a patient who does not need them". Harms noted include that antibiotics "can cause adverse drug reactions, disrupt the body's microbiome, increase antibiotic resistance, and increase the risk for a patient to get Clostridioides (formerly Clostridium) difficile (C. difficile) infection", with "C. difficile infection" described as "a life-threatening illness that can occur when antibiotics kill normal bacteria in the intestine". The page states that "Patients recovering from C. difficile infections are three times more likely to have a recurrence of C. difficile infection if they take an antibiotic within a month", that "Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a rising cause of death of hospitalized patients", and that "Some studies have linked exposure to antibiotics to other medical problems even beyond the period when a person has an infection, such as asthma in childhood".

### Improving predictions of the risk of resistance development against new and old antibiotics [^f5f4180f]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2015). Low credibility.

The methods used today by academic researchers and the pharmaceutical industry to assess the risk of emergence of resistance, for example during development of new antibiotics or when assessing an old antibiotic, are sub-optimal. Even though easy to perform, the presently used serial passage procedures, minimal prevention concentration measurements and determination of mutation rates in vitro are generally providing inadequate knowledge for risk assessment and making decisions to continue/discontinue drug development. These methods need to be complemented and replaced with more relevant methods such as determination of whether resistance genes already pre-exist in various metagenomes, and the likelihood that these genes can transfer into the relevant pathogens and be stably maintained. Furthermore, to determine the risk of emergence of mutationally conferred resistance the fitness effect of the resistance mechanism is key, as this parameter will determine the ability of the resistant mutants to be maintained and enriched in the host after they have emerged. This information combined with knowledge of bacterial population sizes and growth and killing dynamics at relevant infection sites should allow for better forecasting of the risk of resistance emerging in clinical settings.

### Early discontinuation of antibiotics for febrile neutropenia versus continuation until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer [^a8b7e1d2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

People with cancer with febrile neutropenia are at risk of severe infections and mortality and are thus treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. However, the recommended duration of antibiotic therapy differs across guidelines.

Objectives

To assess the safety of protocol-guided discontinuation of antibiotics regardless of neutrophil count, compared to continuation of antibiotics until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer with fever and neutropenia, in terms of mortality and morbidity. To assess the emergence of resistant bacteria in people with cancer treated with short courses of antibiotic therapy compared with people with cancer treated until resolution of neutropenia.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2018, Issue 10) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS up to 1 October 2018. We searched the metaRegister of Controlled Trials and the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov for ongoing and unpublished trials. We reviewed the references of all identified studies for additional trials and handsearched conference proceedings of international infectious diseases and oncology and haematology conferences.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a short antibiotic therapy course in which discontinuation of antibiotics was guided by protocols regardless of the neutrophil count to a long course in which antibiotics were continued until neutropenia resolution in people with cancer with febrile neutropenia. The primary outcome was 30-day or end of follow-up all-cause mortality.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently reviewed all studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias for all included trials. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) whenever possible. For dichotomous outcomes with zero events in both arms of the trials, we conducted meta-analysis of risk differences (RDs) as well. For continuous outcomes, we extracted means with standard deviations (SD) from the studies and computed mean difference (MD) and 95% CI. If no substantial clinical heterogeneity was found, trials were pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs comprising a total of 662 distinct febrile neutropenia episodes. The studies included adults and children, and had variable design and criteria for discontinuation of antibiotics in both study arms. All included studies but two were performed before the year 2000. All studies included people with cancer with fever of unknown origin and excluded people with microbiological documented infections. We found no significant difference between the short-antibiotic therapy arm and the long-antibiotic therapy arm for all-cause mortality (RR 1.38, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.62; RD 0.02, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.05; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence to low due to imprecision and high risk of selection bias. The number of fever days was significantly lower for people in the short-antibiotic treatment arm compared to the long-antibiotic treatment arm (mean difference -0.64, 95% CI -0.96 to -0.32; I² = 30%). In all studies, total antibiotic days were fewer in the intervention arm by three to seven days compared to the long antibiotic therapy. We found no significant differences in the rates of clinical failure (RR 1.23, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.77; very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for clinical failure due to variable and inconsistent definitions of clinical failure across studies, possible selection bias, and wide confidence intervals. There was no significant difference in the incidence of bacteraemia occurring after randomisation (RR 1.56, 95% CI 0.91 to 2.66; very low-certainty evidence), while the incidence of any documented infections was significantly higher in the short-antibiotic therapy arm (RR 1.67, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.57). There was no significant difference in the incidence of invasive fungal infections (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.31) and development of antibiotic resistance (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.62 to 3.61). The data on hospital stay were too sparse to permit any meaningful conclusions.

Authors' Conclusions

We could make no strong conclusions on the safety of antibiotic discontinuation before neutropenia resolution among people with cancer with febrile neutropenia based on the existing evidence and its low certainty. Results of microbiological outcomes favouring long antibiotic therapy may be misleading due to lower culture positivity rates under antibiotic therapy and not true differences in infection rates. Well-designed, adequately powered RCTs are required that address this issue in the era of rising antibiotic resistance.

### Rapid expansion and extinction of antibiotic resistance mutations during treatment of acute bacterial respiratory infections [^49a4ac40]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Acute bacterial infections are often treated empirically, with the choice of antibiotic therapy updated during treatment. The effects of such rapid antibiotic switching on the evolution of antibiotic resistance in individual patients are poorly understood. Here we find that low-frequency antibiotic resistance mutations emerge, contract, and even go to extinction within days of changes in therapy. We analyzed Pseudomonas aeruginosa populations in sputum samples collected serially from 7 mechanically ventilated patients at the onset of respiratory infection. Combining short- and long-read sequencing and resistance phenotyping of 420 isolates revealed that while new infections are near-clonal, reflecting a recent colonization bottleneck, resistance mutations could emerge at low frequencies within days of therapy. We then measured the in vivo frequencies of select resistance mutations in intact sputum samples with resistance-targeted deep amplicon sequencing (RETRA-Seq), which revealed that rare resistance mutations not detected by clinically used culture-based methods can increase by nearly 40-fold over 5–12 days in response to antibiotic changes. Conversely, mutations conferring resistance to antibiotics not administered diminish and even go to extinction. Our results underscore how therapy choice shapes the dynamics of low-frequency resistance mutations at short time scales, and the findings provide a possibility for driving resistance mutations to extinction during early stages of infection by designing patient-specific antibiotic cycling strategies informed by deep genomic surveillance.

### Resistance decay in individuals after antibiotic exposure in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^c64257bb]. BMC Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

We initially planned simply to update a previous systematic review that had addressed resistance decay. However, we were unable to replicate the search (since there were discrepancies in the numbers of studies found and differences in the eligible and included studies identified) and also realised that the time points were poorly discriminated, especially those from retrospective studies. The design of retrospective studies means that: (1) they can report only the time interval between antibiotic exposure and the isolation of resistant isolates at the end of the study, with no data in between; (2) details of the exposure antibiotic, such as type and dose, are often unknown and (3) there is often a selection bias towards patients with treatment failure. Accordingly, we undertook this review de novo.

This research was reported in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA).

Eligible study designs

Eligible studies compared antibiotic-exposed participants to controls (including randomised controlled trials or RCTs), or involved prospective repeat measure cohorts that reported the prevalence of resistant bacteria among patients, isolates or specimens (percentage of resistant isolates from each swab) over time. Retrospective studies were also identified as part of the same search process but will be reported separately. Case reports were ineligible.

Eligible participants

We included studies of patients (or isolates from them), of any sex or age, symptomatic or asymptomatic, who were treated in the community or had community-acquired infections. Studies that included patients with hospital-associated infections, device-related infections and persistent infections were ineligible (Table 2 in the Appendix).

Eligible types of antibiotic exposure

We included any study in which participants in the index group were exposed to a short antibiotic course (≤ 2 weeks), of any antibiotic class.

Eligible comparison

Groups of participants who either did not use antibiotics (controls) or used them at different times were eligible as comparators.

Outcomes

The primary outcome was the isolation of resistant bacteria at a pre-specified time point. Studies that did not report the duration between the last known antibiotic exposure and isolation of resistant bacteria, or did not report the before and after prevalences of resistant and susceptible isolates in studies comparing two antibiotic exposures, were excluded.

### Short treatment duration for community-acquired pneumonia [^e1647064]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Lower respiratory tract infections are one of the most common indications for antibiotic use in community and hospital settings. Usual guidelines for adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) recommend 5-7days of antibiotic treatment. In daily practice, physicians often prescribe 9-10days of antibiotic treatment. Among available strategies to decrease antibiotic use, possibly preventing the emergence of bacterial resistance, reducing treatment durations is the safest and the most acceptable to clinicians. We aim to review data evaluating the efficacy of short antibiotic duration in adult CAP and which criteria can help clinicians to reduce antibiotic treatment.

Recent Findings

Several studies and meta-analyses demonstrated that the treatment duration of 7days or less was sufficient for CAP. Two trials found that 3-day treatments were effective, even in hospitalized CAP. To customize and shorten duration, clinical and biological criteria have been studied and reflect patient's response. Indeed, stability criteria were recently shown to be effective to discontinue antibiotic treatment. Procalcitonin was also studied but never compared with clinical criteria.

Summary

Treatment duration for CAP is still under debate, but several studies support short durations. Clinical criteria could be possibly used to discontinue antibiotic treatment.

### Antibiotic resistance breakers: can repurposed drugs fill the antibiotic discovery void? [^d965e6cd]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2015). Medium credibility.

Concern over antibiotic resistance is growing, and new classes of antibiotics, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria, are needed. However, even if the scientific hurdles can be overcome, it could take decades for sufficient numbers of such antibiotics to become available. As an interim solution, antibiotic resistance could be 'broken' by co-administering appropriate non-antibiotic drugs with failing antibiotics. Several marketed drugs that do not currently have antibacterial indications can either directly kill bacteria, reduce the antibiotic minimum inhibitory concentration when used in combination with existing antibiotics and/or modulate host defence through effects on host innate immunity, in particular by altering inflammation and autophagy. This article discusses how such 'antibiotic resistance breakers' could contribute to reducing the antibiotic resistance problem, and analyses a priority list of candidates for further investigation.

Treating infections with the shortest course of antimicrobials as clinically appropriate is another stewardship measure that can mitigate the risks associated with antibiotics. Multiple studies have confirmed that shorter durations of antimicrobials are as effective as longer durations for many types of infections. Table 3 describes recommended durations of therapy by site of infection. These data combined with clinician assessment of clinical improvement/stability should be considered when deciding on the optimal antibiotic duration. This technique was employed in the recent REGARD-VAP Trial in which patients with VAP were randomized to individualized short-course treatment (≤ 7 days of therapy and as short as 3–5 days depending on defervescence, hemodynamic stability, and culture results) or usual care (≥ 8 days of therapy). The median durations of therapy were 6 days (IQR 5–7) and 14 days (IQR 10–21) in the individualized short-course and usual care groups, respectively. Individualized short courses of antibiotics were non-inferior to usual care and resulted in fewer adverse effects attributed to antimicrobials (risk difference −31%, 95% CI −37 to −25%). Shorter antibiotic courses have also been associated with reduced risk of developing antimicrobial resistance in observational studies, further demonstrating the importance of limiting antibiotic exposure. While individualized care through clinical evaluation should be used as the primary means of determining duration of antibiotics, biomarkers such as procalcitonin may also aid clinicians in determining when to discontinue antibiotics and reduce antibiotic exposure.

### What can we Do about antimicrobial resistance? [^6f0b2029]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is of global concern, and preserving the ability of many antimicrobials to kill disease-causing bacteria is likely to become more challenging over time. However, we are speeding up this process dramatically by using antibiotics too much or in the wrong way. Respecting simple key principles of optimal antibiotic prescribing together with commitment to further research in this area from the pediatric community is essential to extend the lifeline of antibiotics for the most vulnerable patients without limiting access to antibiotics for those children who require treatment.

### Individualised, short-course antibiotic treatment versus usual long-course treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia (REGARD-VAP): a multicentre, individually randomised, open-label, non-inferiority trial [^1d67a8e3]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is associated with increased mortality, prolonged hospitalisation, excessive antibiotic use and, consequently, increased antimicrobial resistance. In this phase 4, randomised trial, we aimed to establish whether a pragmatic, individualised, short-course antibiotic treatment strategy for VAP was non-inferior to usual care.

Methods

We did an individually randomised, open-label, hierarchical non-inferiority-superiority trial in 39 intensive care units in six hospitals in Nepal, Singapore, and Thailand. We enrolled adults (age ≥ 18 years) who met the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Healthcare Safety Network criteria for VAP, had been mechanically ventilated for 48 h or longer, and were administered culture-directed antibiotics. In culture-negative cases, empirical antibiotic choices were made depending on local hospital antibiograms reported by the respective microbiology laboratories or prevailing local guidelines. Participants were assessed until fever resolution for 48 h and haemodynamic stability, then randomly assigned (1:1) to individualised short-course treatment (≤ 7 days and as short as 3–5 days) or usual care (≥ 8 days, with precise durations determined by the primary clinicians) via permuted blocks of variable sizes (8, 10, and 12), stratified by study site. Independent assessors for recurrent pneumonia and participants were masked to treatment allocation, but clinicians were not. The primary outcome was a 60-day composite endpoint of death or pneumonia recurrence. The non-inferiority margin was prespecified at 12% and had to be met by analyses based on both intention-to-treat (all study participants who were randomised) and per-protocol populations (all randomised study participants who fulfilled the eligibility criteria, met fitness criteria for antibiotic discontinuation, and who received antibiotics for the duration specified by their allocation group). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03382548.

Findings

Between May 25, 2018, and Dec 16, 2022, 461 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to the short-course treatment group (n = 232) or the usual care group (n = 229). Median age was 64 years (IQR 51–74) and 181 (39%) participants were female. 460 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis after excluding one withdrawal (231 in the short-course group and 229 in the usual care group); 435 participants received the allocated treatment and fulfilled eligibility criteria, and were included in the per-protocol population. Median antibiotic treatment duration for the index episodes of VAP was 6 days (IQR 5–7) in the short-course group and 14 days (10–21) in the usual care group. 95 (41%) of 231 participants in the short-course group met the primary outcome, compared with 100 (44%) of 229 in the usual care group (risk difference -3% [one-sided 95% CI -∞ to 5%]). Results were similar in the per-protocol population. Non-inferiority of short-course antibiotic treatment was met in the analyses, although superiority compared with usual care was not established. In the per-protocol population, antibiotic side-effects occurred in 86 (38%) of 224 in the usual care group and 17 (8%) of 211 in the short-course group (risk difference -31% [95% CI -37 to -25%; p < 0.0001]).

Interpretation

In this study of adults with VAP, individualised shortened antibiotic duration guided by clinical response was non-inferior to longer treatment durations in terms of 60-day mortality and pneumonia recurrence, and associated with substantially reduced antibiotic use and side-effects. Individualised, short-course antibiotic treatment for VAP could help to reduce the burden of side-effects and the risk of antibiotic resistance in high-resource and resource-limited settings.

### Short-duration therapy for respiratory tract infections [^460a7d35]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial therapy for community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTIs) must be of sufficient duration to result in clinical cure and bacterial eradication. Elimination of the causative bacteria may prevent disease progression, relapse, or recurrence while minimizing the risk for emergence of resistant bacterial strains. Standard 10-day courses of antibiotic therapy often are not completed by patients. This may decrease the likelihood of bacterial eradication and contribute to increased selection of resistant organisms. The ideal antimicrobial agent for the treatment of CARTIs would have an appropriate pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profile for short-course therapy (eg, 5 days) without loss of either clinical or bacteriologic efficacy. Short-course therapy for CARTIs (such as acute bacterial maxillary sinusitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, community-acquired pneumonia) has been demonstrated to be effective with antibiotics from several different classes, including the ketolide antimicrobials.

### The use of long-term antibiotics for suppression of bacterial infections [^4c3e3c02]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Suppressive antibiotic therapy is prescribed when a patient has an infection that is presumed to be incurable by a defined course of therapy or source control. The cohort receiving suppressive antibiotic therapy is typically highly comorbid and the infections often involve retained prosthetic material. In part due to a lack of clear guidelines regarding the use of suppressive antibiotics, and in part due to the complex nature of the infections in question, patients are often prescribed suppressive antibiotics for extremely long, if not indefinite, courses. The risks of prolonged antibiotic exposure in this context are not fully characterized, but they include adverse drug effects ranging from mild to severe, the development of antibiotic-resistant organisms, and perturbations of the gastrointestinal microbiome. In this narrative review we present the available evidence for the use of suppressive antibiotic therapy in 4 common indications, examine the gaps in the current literature, and explore the known and potential risks of this therapy. We also make suggestions for improving the quality of evidence in future studies, particularly by highlighting the need for a standardized term to describe the use of long courses of antibiotics to suppress hard-to-treat infections.

### Principles of antibiotic therapy in severe infections: optimizing the therapeutic approach by use of laboratory and clinical data [^cf7930c6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2007). Low credibility.

The increasingly daunting problem of antimicrobial resistance has led to an intense focus on optimization of antibiotic therapy, with simultaneous goals of improving patient outcomes and minimizing the contribution of that therapy to making the available antibiotics obsolete. Although even appropriate antibiotic therapy drives resistance, inappropriate therapy may also have adverse effects on the individual patient, as well as on the bacterial ecology. Recent research has validated the benefit of intelligent utilization of both microbiological data and clinical assessment in the empirical selection of initial broad-spectrum therapy and in further guidance of therapeutic decisions throughout the course of illness by use of a systems approach. Thus, the optimal approach to the critically ill patient with infection involves the initiation of aggressive broad-spectrum empirical therapy followed by timely responses to microbiological and clinical results as they become available. An appropriate response to this information often involves de-escalation of therapy or even its discontinuation.

### Shorter and longer courses of antibiotics for common infections and the association with reductions of infection-related complications including hospital admissions [^4226f795]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Resistant bacteria are developing worldwide, causing a serious and concerning threat to global health. The rise in resistance is associated with overuse and misuse of antibiotics, as well as the lack of new drug development. Primary care accounts for 71.4% of all antibiotic prescriptions in the UK. Uncertainty in the distinction between bacterial or viral infections has led to a large variability in the propensity to prescribe an antibiotic for various infectious conditions.

Antibiotic susceptibility testing is used to determine the appropriateness of particular antibiotics to bacterial infections and whether bacteria are displaying some resistance to treatment. Microbiology data in combination with clinical review are used to develop best practice recommendations for the treatment of bacterial infections by outlining when it is appropriate to treat an infection with an antibiotic, the specific antibiotic that should be prescribed, as well as the recommended dose and duration of the antibiotic course that is effective. However, recent evidence suggests that regular updates to guidelines have little effect on reducing antibiotic prescribing and a substantial amount of antibiotics prescribed still deviate from recommended guidelines. When the recommended antibiotic type is prescribed in the UK, antibiotic courses tend to be slightly longer than what is recommended. This is probably, in part, because it was taught that to prevent reinfection and reduce resistance it is necessary for patients to complete the entire course of antibiotics even when symptoms have surpassed, and that prolonged therapy was needed to avoid treatment failure, suggesting that shorter antibiotic courses were perceived as an inferior treatment to longer courses. These ideas were implemented decades ago when there was little concern about antibiotic overuse and, although over time shorter courses have shown to be comparable in efficacy to longer therapies, variability in the duration of prescribed antibiotics remains. Additional evidence suggests that prescribers feel more comfortable selecting a middle-range duration, or in some cases the longest duration specified, even if the intention of the specified range is that the shortest duration is adequate for most patients. Further research is needed to determine the most effective strategies for optimizing duration of antibiotic treatment for individual patients, taking patient characteristics into consideration when identifying the patients who fail to recover on shorter courses of antibiotics.

### Antibiotic treatment of common infections: more evidence to support shorter durations [^f2535d6f]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although there is increasing recognition of the link between antibiotic overuse and antimicrobial resistance, clinician prescribing is often unnecessarily long and motivated by fear of clinical relapse. High-quality evidence supporting shorter treatment durations is needed to give clinicians confidence to change prescribing habits. Here we summarize recent randomized controlled trials investigating antibiotic short courses for common infections in adult patients.

Recent Findings

Randomized trials in the last five years have demonstrated noninferiority of short-course therapy for a range of conditions including community acquired pneumonia, intraabdominal sepsis, gram-negative bacteraemia and vertebral osteomyelitis.

Summary

Treatment durations for many common infections have been based on expert opinion rather than randomized trials. There is now evidence to support shorter courses of antibiotic therapy for many conditions.

### Routine metagenomics service for ICU patients with respiratory infection [^57073716]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Impacts on Antibiotic Treatment

RMg contributed to prescribing decisions in 88 of 110 (80%) cases (Table 2). In 24 (22%) cases, antibiotics were started (n = 10) or escalated (n = 14) on the basis of detecting organisms with intrinsic (n = 20) or acquired (n = 4) resistance to current therapy, the majority (87%) that day (Table 2). In 29 (26%) cases, antibiotics were deescalated or stopped predominantly on the next morning ward round (n = 22/29 cases; 76%). Deescalation occurred in 66% (19/29) of cases when RMg detected no clinically relevant organisms (13 detected no organisms, three detected upper respiratory tract commensals, and three detected Candida spp.). All deescalation cases were followed up. One patient (P78) had antibiotics restarted to treat P. aeruginosa cultured from a respiratory sample taken 3 days after RMg informed the stopping of antibiotics. The patient was otherwise progressing well and left the ICU a few days later. Clinical details of all cases are given in Data File E2, with representative timelines for three HA LRTI cases in Figures 2A–2C.

### Less is more: antibiotics at the beginning of life [^55357f06]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Conclusions

Antibiotic exposure at the start of life is high and the risks and costs of treatment are disproportionate compared to the burden of EOS. Fear to miss a true sepsis case, the impact of bias, noise, and time preference on decision-making are important factors contributing to antibiotic overtreatment. We hypothesize that the decision-making process regarding antibiotic therapy at the beginning of life may be improved with a factual approach. First, we must measure one's own performance and make these data available. This feedback may produce a sense of urgency regarding the needed change of behaviour. Secondly, collaboration and benchmarking using an open-access dashboard quantifying the burden of disease versus the burden of treatment may be an important step to initiate a global initiative to conciliate effective sepsis care and antimicrobial stewardship. In particular, the focus should be made on educational interventions to improve the decision-making process regarding the start and the stop of antibiotics. And thirdly, the development of new algorithms using artificial intelligence analysing routine data may leverage decision-making to the next level of a factual approach. The aim of a preserved microbiome and reduced antimicrobial resistance may improve the health of future generations.

### Non-inherited antibiotic resistance [^f7682496]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2006). Medium credibility.

In addition to their impressive, well-publicized and well-researched propensity to evolve and acquire genetically determined mechanisms for resistance to antibiotics, bacteria that are inherently susceptible to these drugs can also be phenotypically refractory to their action. This phenomenon of 'non-inherited resistance' to antibiotics has been known since the beginning of the antibiotic era but, relative to inherited resistance, it has been given little attention. Here, we review the in vitro and in vivo evidence for the different forms of non-inherited resistance and the mechanisms responsible. With the aid of a simple mathematical model and computer simulations, we show how non-inherited resistance could extend the duration of antibiotic treatment, cause treatment failure and promote the generation and ascent of inherited resistance in treated patients.

### Short-versus long-course antibiotic therapy for acute pyelonephritis in adolescents and adults: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^8f457acc]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Despite the high incidence of acute pyelonephritis in the community setting, there is no consensus on the optimal duration of treatment. A potential reduction in the duration of the administered antibiotic regimens could contribute to avoiding further development of antimicrobial resistance.

Objective

The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare short-course (7- to 14-day) with long-course (14- to 42-day) treatment with the same antibiotic regimens, in terms of the effectiveness and tolerability, in acute pyelonephritis.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and SCOPUS (January 1966-March 2008) to identify and extract data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effectiveness and toxicity of short- versus long-course regimens. Additionally, references of studies were searched. A publication was included if: it was an RCT; involved adult and/or adolescent patients with acute pyelonephritis; compared regimens with the same antibiotic, at the same daily dosage, that were administered for differing durations (a short course and a long course lie, no absolute time cutoff (in days) was employed; rather, the duration of one regimen compared with another defined short- vs long-course]); and reported data regarding clinical success, bacteriologic efficacy, relapses, recurrences, and adverse events and/or patient withdrawals due to adverse events. Trials with a mixed population, including patients with acute pyelonephritis as a subset, were also included in the meta-analysis. Efficacy was assessed by evaluating clinical success, defined as resolution of symptoms and signs at the test-of-cure visit, and bacteriologic efficacy, defined as yielding sterile urine cultures or positive cultures with < 10³ colony-forming units per milliliter of urine at the test-of-cure visit. Tolerability was assessed by extracting data for adverse events.

Results

According to our initial search, 205, 136, 179, and 73 potentially relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, and references of evaluable trials, respectively. Four RCTs were eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Significant differences were not found between the short- and long-course treatment of acute pyclonephritis in terms of clinical success (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; 95% CI, 0.59–2.70), bacteriologic efficacy (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.13–4.95), and relapse (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.08–5.39). Also, significant differences were not found between the short- and long-course treatments regarding adverse events (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.33–1.25), withdrawals due to adverse events (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.28–1.55), and recurrences (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.63–3.06).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis failed to identify any significant differences, with regard to effectiveness and tolerability, between short- and long-course treatment with the same antibiotic.

### Where will new antibiotics come from? [^54a8e2d1]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2003). Medium credibility.

There is a constant need for new antibacterial drugs owing to the inevitable development of resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics to the clinic. When a new class of antibiotic is introduced, it is effective at first, but will eventually select for survival of the small fraction of bacterial populations that have an intrinsic or acquired resistance mechanism. Pathogens that are resistant to multiple drugs emerge around the globe, so how robust are antibiotic discovery processes?

Antibiotic resistance is increasingly affecting the management of infectious diseases. The prescribing clinician is not only important to the development of the problem but also central to its solution. This article addresses the current weaknesses in the information systems and the evidence base that support prescribing. Remedies necessary for improvements in prudent prescribing include better guidance in managing specific diseases where resistance is of prognostic significance and also increasing diagnostic precision.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^f0231e12]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

There is no doubt that we are now faced with greater antibiotic resistance challenges than ever before, limiting treatment options for patients with severe infections. The rate of development of new antimicrobial agents has failed to keep pace with the "ingenuity" of bacteria to mutate and become resistant to antibiotics. We have to adapt to this threat by reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We need to optimize control measures to minimize the risk of spread of resistant bacteria, and we have to find novel ways to detect pathogens early. These approaches will help prevent the spread of MDR pathogens and could enable us to direct last-line (and in some cases, narrow-spectrum) antibiotics more effectively to those patients who need them most, rather than the current "broad-spectrum is best" approaches.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^873bd4c2]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic therapy of up to 21 days for VAP and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was used historically until several prospective studies demonstrated the effectiveness of shorter (7–8 days) therapy with no differences in mortality, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, mechanical ventilation-free days or organ failure-free days. The 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) guidelines and the 2016 IDSA guidelines both recommend 7 days of therapy for HAP/VAP. Ongoing studies are determining if therapy duration could be reduced further.

Bacteremia caused by Enterobacterales has been treated traditionally with 2 weeks of antibiotics. Recent RCTs and meta-analyses investigating shorter (7–8 days) versus longer antibiotic courses (14–15 days) in patients with gram-negative bacteremia (mostly of urinary tract origin) demonstrate non-inferiority. Regarding acute uncomplicated cellulitis, evidence also suggests that prolonged courses may be unnecessary and that 5 days of treatment may be sufficient. IDSA guidelines recommend a 5-day antibiotic therapy duration for uncomplicated cellulitis, but may be extended if the infection has not improved within that time frame.

Generally, in critically ill patients, decisions about antibiotic therapy duration should be individualized, taking into account patient parameters such as severity of illness, the site and type of infection, whether source control has been achieved, whether PK has been optimized, and clinical response. Procalcitonin (PCT) may be useful to guide antibiotic therapy in the ICU. PCT-guided treatment can reduce the duration of therapy and length of hospital stay in adult critically ill patients with sepsis. Based on apparent benefit and no obvious undesirable effects, the 2021 Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines suggest using PCT along with a clinical evaluation to decide when to discontinue antibiotics in adults with an initial diagnosis of sepsis or septic shock and adequate source control, if the optimal duration of therapy is unclear and if PCT is available.

### Design principles of collateral sensitivity-based dosing strategies [^7cfc0b89]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Fitness cost of antibiotic resistance can contribute to the success of CS-based treatments

Resistance evolution is commonly associated with fitness costs. We studied the impact of different levels of fitness cost on the suppression of de novo resistance development (Fig. 7). Fitness cost was included as a fractional reduction of growth per mutation, thereby doubly penalising the double resistant mutant R AB. In the absence of CS, fitness cost below 50% per mutation had little impact (|ΔPoR| ≥ 5%) on R Any for most treatment scenarios. However, when concentration-dependent bactericidal drugs were dosed simultaneously the presence of fitness costs slightly increased the PoR (maximum ΔPoR 10.2%). The presence of fitness cost increased the impact of CS on PoR the three-day cycling regimen using time-dependent antibiotics (Fig. 7 J and N), which failed to fully suppress resistance in the presence of fitness cost-free CS. The fitness cost generating the largest impact of CS for these treatments on PoR was 40% and 50% cost per mutation when treated with bacteriostatic (Δ PoR −48.4%) and bactericidal (Δ PoR −42.8%) drug, respectively.

Fig. 7
The effect of fitness costs for developing resistance for different levels of collateral sensitivity effects on the probability of resistance (PoR).

PoR of R Any, defined as the presence of any resistant subpopulation, was estimated at end of treatment for treatments using different designs (columns) and antibiotic types (rows). Colour and line-type indicate the magnitude of reciprocal CS simulated. Each simulated scenario was realized n = 500 times. Data are presented as mean PoR with the error bars that represent the standard error of the estimation.

### When once is not enough – further evidence of procalcitonin-guided antibiotic stewardship [^3547d322]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Every day, critical care physicians around the world face the same challenge of the optimal timing of antimicrobial administration: when to start and when to stop antibiotics. Duration of antibiotic therapy for sepsis is mostly based on expert opinion, but its reduction is arguably the most promising approach to decrease emergence and selection of antibiotic resistance. The study by Hochreiter and colleagues presents another piece of evidence suggesting that procalcitonin may indeed be a valuable diagnostic parameter to guide antibiotic treatment duration, despite the ongoing controversy about the diagnostic accuracy of pro-calcitonin.

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^7d36952a]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Debridement with One- or Two-Stage Exchange of the Implant

A 1- or 2-stage exchange is performed if patients without bone union do not qualify for eradicative or suppressive treatment with implant retention. A total duration of 12 weeks of biofilm-active therapy is recommended in a 1-stage exchange with intravenous treatment until full antibiotic susceptibility results of the cultures are available.

A 2-stage exchange with an implant-free interval at the site of infection can be required if no biofilm-active antimicrobial is available, surgical factors are unfavorable (eg, soft-tissue status), or suppressive therapy is not an adequate option. This requires temporary stabilization of the fracture, with the type of fixation being at the discretion of the treating surgeon. During the implant-free interval, 6 weeks of antibiotic treatment without biofilm activity is recommended, starting with intravenous treatment until full antibiotic susceptibility results of the cultures are available. After the first 6 weeks of treatment, 2 different approaches exist with no consensus and a lack of data on the optimal continuation therapy. One approach consists of an immediate reimplantation followed by further 6 weeks of biofilm-active treatment. The other allows a 2-week antibiotic-free interval before reimplantation to see whether clinical signs of infection reoccur and to enable regrowth of potential residual bacteria. If no clinical signs of infection occur and tissue cultures from reimplantation stay negative, the antibiotics that were restarted after implantation can be stopped (Fig. 1).

### The future of antibiotics [^b4e8bc54]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance continues to spread even as society is experiencing a market failure of new antibiotic research and development (R&D). Scientific, economic, and regulatory barriers all contribute to the antibiotic market failure. Scientific solutions to rekindle R&D include finding new screening strategies to identify novel antibiotic scaffolds and transforming the way we think about treating infections, such that the goal is to disarm the pathogen without killing it or modulate the host response to the organism without targeting the organism for destruction. Future economic strategies are likely to focus on 'push' incentives offered by public-private partnerships as well as increasing pricing by focusing development on areas of high unmet need. Such strategies can also help protect new antibiotics from overuse after marketing. Regulatory reform is needed to re-establish feasible and meaningful traditional antibiotic pathways, to create novel limited-use pathways that focus on highly resistant infections, and to harmonize regulatory standards across nations. We need new antibiotics with which to treat our patients. But we also need to protect those new antibiotics from misuse when they become available. If we want to break the cycle of resistance and change the current landscape, disruptive approaches that challenge long-standing dogma will be needed.

### Avoiding the perfect storm: the biologic and clinical case for reevaluating the 7-day expectation for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia before switching therapy [^23f1c315]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Persistent methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia (MRSAB) is associated with poor outcomes and serious complications. The MRSA guidelines define treatment failure and persistent bacteremia as lasting ≥ 7 days; however, this definition requires reevaluation. Aggressively reducing the bacterial inoculum promptly is critical because factors already in place before clinical presentation are driving resistance to the few antibiotics that are available to treat MRSAB. Alternative approaches to treat MRSAB should be considered within 3–4 days of persistent MRSAB. With rapid molecular diagnostics emerging in clinical microbiology laboratories and biomarkers as a potential for early patient risk stratification, a future shorter threshold may become possible.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^231125a2]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship programs (ASPs) — antibiotic cycling and mixing: We suggest against the use of antibiotic cycling as a stewardship strategy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Because clinical data are limited on antibiotic mixing, we cannot give any recommendation about its utility. Antibiotic cycling involves withdrawal of an antibiotic or antibiotics class from general use for a designated period of time and substitution with antibiotics from a different class, but many studies have failed to provide compelling evidence due to methodologic shortcomings including single-center setting (usually in ICUs), before-and-after time-series analysis, lack of adherence to prescribing protocols, multiple simultaneous interventions, and lack of long-term follow-up. For mixing, mathematical modeling suggests it may be more promising than cycling, but few clinical studies validate these models, and comprehensive reviews concluded that more work is needed to demonstrate the usefulness of antibiotic mixing.

### Prudent use of antibiotics: are our expectations justified? [^2fcea641]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Prudent use of antibiotics has 3 components, rational use, adherence to local guidelines and policies, and avoidance or reversal of upward demographic trends in antibiotic resistance. Although rational use is mandatory, it must be recognized that adherence to policies will reduce clinical freedom, for good or ill. Expectations that prudent use will deliver reversals in resistance trends should be accepted with caution. Sound, pertinent data are lacking, and our ability to detect change, if it does occur, and to attribute its cause correctly, is questionable.

Antibiotic therapy

In patients with CADP, who respond to antibiotics but relapse shortly after stopping antibiotics, a strategy that could be adopted and is suggested by AGA is chronic antibiotic therapy, at the lowest effective dose (e.g. ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily or 250 mg twice daily) with intermittent gap periods (approximately 1 week per month), or use of cyclical antibiotics (e.g. changing between ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin every 1–2 weeks; Table 2). On the other hand, an interesting observational study involving 39 patients with CADP revealed that prolonged antibiotic use led to sustained remission in just 21% of patients over a median follow-up of 102 months. Moreover, extended antibiotic administration was linked to the development of antibiotic-related adverse effects (28% of patients) and antibiotic resistance (78% of stool samples).

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^95eb2b4a]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Management: patient stratification and antibiotic choices

Perhaps the greatest challenge imposed by MDR Gram-negative bacteria is attainment of the appropriate degree of balance between efficacy and ecology. It is well recognized that there are significant increases in mortality rates when antibiotic therapy is delayed, challenging the clinician to prescribe therapy broad enough to cover all of the most likely pathogens. What is simultaneously recognized is the collateral damage of selecting resistant bacteria that can occur with prolonged receipt of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Three important categories can influence antimicrobial choices: patient characteristics; risk factors for infection with specific pathogens; and severity of illness. Of the demographic data of patients with infections, advanced age and comorbid illnesses have been associated with decreased reserve and, hence, an increase in mortality. Contact with the health care system is an important patient characteristic that influences the broadness of initial antibiotic therapy. Previous hospitalization (within the past 30 days as a defining feature of hospital-acquired infection and within the past 90 days as a defining feature of healthcare-associated infection) increases the risk of infection by a resistant pathogen that was acquired in the healthcare environment. Invasive procedures, even those occurring in the outpatient setting, increase the risk of colonization by MDR organisms, with such colonization serving as an antecedent predisposition to infection with MDR microorganisms. Local microbiologic data are extremely important in predicting the type of resistance that may be present in the etiologic agent causing a clinical infection. It is important to recognize that such local data may vary from unit to unit within a hospital, and when possible unit-specific data are optimal. In recognition of the fact that resistance can rapidly develop within a practice environment, it is important that microbiologic data should be as current as possible. Antibiograms reporting data that are from a previous year may be many months behind what is presently occurring. Very important is the role of prior antibiotic exposure, recognizing the risk of eliminating normal flora and allowing the selection of resistant bacteria. Although various timelines have been suggested in the medical literature about what defines "recent" antibiotic therapy, within the previous 90 days is a consistently cited number. A second element of importance in stratification regarding antibiotic therapy is the likely type of microorganism. As noted previously, risk stratification related to P. aeruginosa has been included in multiple clinical guidelines. Of all the variables that influence stratification of patients into a category requiring coverage of MDR bacteria, severity of illness may be the most important. As severity of illness increases, the margin for error in initial antimicrobial therapy diminishes and this requires consideration of coverage against multiple patterns of bacterial resistance.

### Optimising antibiotic exposure by customising the duration of treatment for respiratory tract infections based on patient needs in primary care [^b7f6882f]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Research on customising antibiotic treatment duration to meet individual patient needs is required in primary care

When evaluating a patient with an RTI, our primary objective is to determine whether antibiotic therapy is necessary. There is substantial evidence indicating that antibiotics have little to no impact on self-limiting infections or when a non-bacterial infection is suspected. If patients are taking antibiotics prescribed by another doctor, or if they started taking antibiotics on their own from leftover medications or pharmacy purchases, and the current doctor determines that the antibiotics are no longer needed, they should be stopped (Panel 2). For patients with RTIs in which antibiotic therapy is warranted, more evidence is needed to determine the optimal treatment durations. Traditional two-arm randomised clinical trials comparing fixed antibiotic durations have limitations, as they provide little insight into the minimal necessary duration for various infectionsand fail to account for the differing needs of individual patients. Based on clinical judgement made from patient history, examination, and precise diagnostic tests, doctors should be encouraged to prescribe first-line treatments at appropriate doses to optimise PK/PD properties, except when contraindicated. Unless the infection is deemed potentially serious, when managing patients with a prescribed fixed antibiotic duration, new studies should ascertain whether treatment cessation upon symptom resolution, prior to completing the antibiotic course, is feasible. In fact, one third of the patients already do that by themselves. Studies using medication event monitoring systems reveal that in real-life scenarios, only one-third of patients adhere to the prescribed antibiotic course. If the results of these studies align with expectations, patients could then be advised to discontinue medication once they feel better and are afebrile.

As a conclusion, short-course antibiotic therapy for VAP did not significantly affect the rate of recurrence relapses, and mortality compared with long-course antibiotic therapy. However, for VAP due to NF-GNB, even if a higher risk of recurrence is reported, it did not translated into clinical outcomes such as mortality and duration of ICU stay. In addition, short-course therapy had several desirable consequences namely decreased antibiotic exposure, reduced antibiotic resistance, and lower overall costs.

### Personalized antibiograms for machine learning driven antibiotic selection [^37559a9d]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Sensitivity analysis

We performed a sensitivity analysis to estimate model performance on the full deployment population, including patients with negative microbial culture results. This is a important because at prediction time, whether a microbial culture will return positive is unknown. Further, negative microbial cultures do not preclude infection at a site not tested. Some patients with negative microbial cultures will have a latent undetected infection with an antibiotic susceptibility profile (set of labels) that goes unobserved. This can skew model performance estimates if patients with censored labels have a covariate distribution different from those with observed labels. To address this, we (1) constructed an electronic phenotype to identify patients with negative microbial cultures that truly lacked infection, (2) re-trained a new set of personalized antibiogram prediction models that include patients flagged by the electronic phenotype and (3) used inverse probability weighted estimates of AUROC to evaluate performance on the deployment population, the union of patient admissions with positive and negative microbial cultures.

Electronic phenotype

We created a rule based electronic phenotype that when applied to the set of patients in our cohort with negative microbial cultures attempted to extract instances where patients were truly uninfected. We created a strict phenotype, prioritizing positive predictive value over sensitivity. Patients were labelled as uninfected during the admission in question if the following was all true. None of the microbial cultures ordered within 2 weeks of the admission returned positive. As in the prior labelling scheme microbial cultures that grew only Coagulase-negative Staphylococci were considered negative. Antibiotics were either never administered, or they were stopped within 24 h of them starting. Antibiotics were not restarted for an additional 2 weeks if they were stopped. No ICD codes related to bacterial infection were associated with the hospital admission (see Supplementary Note 2). The patient did not die during the admission.

### Exploring the principles behind antibiotics with limited resistance [^aa5aa009]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Nearly 50 years have passed since the golden age of antibiotic discovery (1945–1975) ended, and yet we continue to struggle to develop antibiotics with novel modes of action. Even though valiant attempts have been made to leverage a variety of antibiotic discovery platform approaches (genomics, bioinformatics, systems biology, and postgenomic techniques), progress remains incremental at best. This slow progress, coupled with the rapid spread of multi-drug resistant bacteria, has led numerous pharmaceutical companies to abort their antibiotic research initiatives, thereby making the commercial success of prospective antimicrobial drugs largely unpredictable. Hence, it is crucial to identify the key factors shaping the risk of developing resistance and incorporate this knowledge into the antibiotic development process.

In response to the need for effective therapeutic options, two promising avenues have emerged: i) multi-targeting antibiotics, which include single compounds capable of inhibiting multiple bacterial targets, and ii) antibiotics targeting immutable elements of bacterial physiology. The first case comprises single compounds that inhibit multiple non-overlapping molecular targets. The rationale is that resistance development would require the simultaneous occurrence of multiple mutations. However, this approach has its challenges, as it assumes that single mutations offer minimal or no advantage to bacteria. These single mutations are often found in natural bacterial populations, providing significant resistance against other, clinically employed antimicrobial agents. Prolonged antibiotic use might inadvertently promote the spread of mutations acting as stepping stones toward resistance to dual-target antibiotics still in development. Furthermore, bacteria can gain resistance through various mechanisms unrelated to target mutations, including enzymatic breakdown, alterations in membrane permeability, and variations in the activity or specificity of bacterial efflux pumps.

The second solution is to develop antibiotics with non-mutable targets, such as non-protein based cellular structures that are not directly DNA-encoded. These antibiotics may target one function only, but resistance seriously compromises bacterial survival or virulence. Compounds that attack the integrity of the cell envelope could be pivotal here, given the distinctive properties of bacterial cell surfaces which are often not directly protein-encoded, making them less susceptible to mutation-induced alterations. For example, it has been suggested that Lipid II, an intermediate in peptidoglycan biosynthesis presents a new opportunity for drugs with limited susceptibility to resistance.

Based on these prior considerations –, we hypothesize that to limit resistance development, new antibiotics should have dual-modes of action and specifically target membrane integrity. In contrast, antibiotics with two protein-encoded intracellular targets remain susceptible to resistance development.

### Antibiotic resistance and the risk of recurrent bacteremia [^f920beb4]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Antibiotic resistance is considered a major threat for human health. Although infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria have frequently been associated with increased morbidity, higher mortality, and enhanced healthcare costs, the direct and attributable effects of antibiotic resistance have been less accurately quantified. Detrimental health effects of antibiotic resistance may result from inappropriate empiric therapy, from reduced effectiveness of definite therapy with last-resort antibiotics, or a higher frequency of adverse events created by such antibiotics. Several studies have quantified the effects of antibiotic resistance, usually in patients with bacteremia, and mostly on survival (either 30 days after bacteremia or during hospitalization) and length of hospital stay. Yet, associations between antibiotic resistance and patient outcome can be confounded and can be affected by competing events. Adjustment for patient-related and disease-associated factors typically reduces the observed crude associations between antibiotic resistance and patient outcome. As a result, the consequences of antibiotic resistance for patient health are not accurately quantified.

An important sequela of antibiotic resistance could be the occurrence of recurrent infection, either because of delays in providing appropriate antibiotic therapy or because of suboptimal definite antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, the risk of resistance development during antibiotic therapy and the subsequent risk of developing recurrent infections have never been quantified. In the current study, we quantified the association between antibiotic susceptibility and the occurrence of recurrent bacteremia, and to what extent antibiotic susceptibility had changed between first and recurrent infections.

### The use of long-term antibiotics for suppression of bacterial infections [^6c4997ad]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Currently, a wide range of terminology is used, including "long-term suppressive therapy", "indefinite chronic suppression", and "indefinite oral antimicrobial suppression". We recommend "suppressive antibiotic therapy" as a standardized term that accurately and succinctly describes the practice of using long courses of antibiotics to indefinitely suppress bacterial infection, so that relevant data are not unintentionally excluded from systematic reviews. As antimicrobial resistance and the levels of comorbidity in the population increase worldwide, the number of patients prescribed SAT will likely increase. Therefore, it is important that both patients and clinicians have accurate information about the treatment strategy to promote safe patient-centered care.

### Progress in the fight against multidrug-resistant bacteria 2005–2016: modern noninferiority trial designs enable antibiotic development in advance of epidemic bacterial resistance [^cc3d9e6b]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Other challenges to use of superiority design trials are logistical. Patients with an acute, severe infection must be identified by the clinical investigator within hours of presentation for care; prolonged screening and enrollment procedures severely constrain patient accrual. Furthermore, unless point-of-care rapid diagnostics are readily available, attempts to enroll patients with an infection caused by a specific resistant pathogen must be empirical and anticipatory, meaning that many-fold the final required sample size of patients must be enrolled to find a few with the targeted resistant organism. But, and as noted above, detection of a resistant pathogen would mandate use of an alternative comparator regimen predicted to be active against the infecting pathogen.

Finally, if a superiority standard is required, demonstrating superiority with one new agent resets the bar, effectively terminating development of other potential promising agents until resistance to the new agent also becomes widespread and thereby depriving patients and physicians of other potential benefits of new agents (eg, improved safety or tolerability; more convenient dosing regimens).

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the management of pouchitis and inflammatory pouch disorders [^7c4d736e]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

AGA pouchitis guideline — management of chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) in ulcerative colitis (UC) states that in patients who experience recurrent pouchitis that responds to antibiotics but relapses shortly after stopping antibiotics (commonly referred to as "chronic antibiotic-dependent pouchitis"), the AGA suggests using chronic antibiotic therapy to treat recurrent pouchitis (Conditional recommendation, very low certainty of evidence). The panel suggests endoscopic evaluation of the pouch with confirmation of inflammation and ruling out alternative etiologies in patients with recurrent pouchitis, and lowest effective dose of antibiotics (eg, ciprofloxacin 500 mg daily or 250 mg twice daily) with intermittent gap periods (such as approximately 1 week per month), or use of cyclical antibiotics (such as rotating between ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin every 1–2 weeks) may be considered to decrease risk of antimicrobial resistance.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^35c6c9dc]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

The rapid emergence and dissemination of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in ICUs worldwide threaten adequate antibiotic coverage of infected patients in this environment. The causes of this problem are multifactorial, but the core issues are clear: the emergence of antibiotic resistance is highly correlated with selective pressure resulting from inappropriate use of these drugs. Because a significant increase in mortality is observed when antibiotic therapy is delayed in infected ICU patients, initial therapy should be broad enough to cover all likely pathogens. Receipt of unnecessary prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotics, however, should be avoided. Local microbiologic data are extremely important to predict the type of resistance that may be present for specific causative bacteria, as is prior antibiotic exposure, and antibiotic choices should thus be made at an individual patient level.

### Healthcare-associated pneumonia in adults: management principles to improve outcomes [^1389e701]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Guidelines for Management of HAP were developed jointly by the ATS and IDSA in 2004. These guidelines were designed to improve patient outcomes and to decrease the emergence of MDR pathogens (see Fig. 1). Principles include early initiation of appropriate and adequate antibiotic therapy after cultures of blood and sputum are obtained. Quantitative distal airway sampling by bronchoscopy provides greater diagnostic specificity for VAP: in one randomized study, improved outcomes were noted, compared with clinical diagnosis with qualitative endotracheal aspirates. Higher doses of initial, empiric antibiotics also are recommended. Assessment of the patient's clinical response to empiric antibiotics should be correlated with microbiologic results to streamline, de-escalate, or stop unnecessary anti-biotic treatment. Duration of therapy for uncomplicated HAP should be limited to 7 days followed by close monitoring for relapse after cessation of antibiotics. The authors suggest that prevention strategies target modifiable short- and long-term risk factors. They also advocate the use of a multidisciplinary team that is dedicated to the treatment and prevention of HCAP and the basic principle of the modern Hippocratic Oath: "I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure".

### Two steps forward: improving the management of cystic fibrosis pulmonary exacerbations [^43673042]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In this issue of the Journal, Goss and colleagues (pp.) report the findings of the STOP2 (Standardized Treatment of Pulmonary Exacerbations) study, a randomized trial of antimicrobial duration for cystic fibrosis (CF) pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) treatment. Adults with CF experiencing PExs treated with intravenous antibiotics were enrolled at presentation and assessed at an interim time point (7–10 days into antibiotic therapy) for clinical response based on lung function and symptom improvement. Early responders were randomized to either 10 or 14 days of total antibiotic treatment duration, whereas non–early responders were randomized to 14 or 21 days' duration. The primary outcome was the change in FEV 1 from the start of antibiotics to 2 weeks after antibiotic cessation. Almost 1,000 patients with CF were randomized in the study; among the approximate one-third of early responders, 10 days was not inferior to 14 days of antibiotics, and among the remaining non–early responders, 21 days was not shown to be superior to 14 days of antimicrobial therapy.

The STOP2 trial represents a landmark study in the treatment of CF pulmonary exacerbations as it is the first to be adequately powered to compare varying lengths of antibiotic courses. The choice of antibiotic duration in the treatment of infectious diseases is frequently guided by clinical experience or observational studies rather than by evidence from comparative randomized controlled trials. Recent randomized controlled trials have examined shorter antimicrobial regimens for the treatment of ventilator associated or community acquired pneumonia, intraabdominal sepsis, and gram-negative bacteremia and found that shorter courses were not inferior to longer courses. Prolonged antimicrobials are associated with an increased number of days in hospital, central line–associated thrombotic complications, toxicity such as ototoxicity secondary to aminoglycoside use, and drug hypersensitivity reactions, to name a few. Although the study by Goss and colleagues did not identify a statistically significant difference in adverse events between treatment arms, it is important to remember that antimicrobial side effects are cumulative over the lifespan of a patient with CF who will require repeated antibiotic courses to treat pulmonary infections. In addition, although not assessed in this study, increased antimicrobial exposure invariably leads to antimicrobial resistance, which ultimately limits the long-term effectiveness of antibiotic therapy in patients with CF. By demonstrating that shorter courses are not inferior to longer courses (and in the case of non–early responders, longer ones are not superior), the authors have provided valuable data in the guidance of antimicrobial stewardship. The main strength of this study is thus its clinical relevance, as the results have the potential to directly impact the care of individuals with CF.

### Rapid identification of antimicrobial resistance patterns allows a faster antibiotic adequacy [^86b4233f]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Antimicrobial resistance is an important problem that requires an urgent response from the scientific community. One of the main goals is to develop new molecules and antibiotics able to cover extended and pan-resistant strains. However, strategies are also needed to prevent the development of new resistant strains. The concept of antibiotic stewardship addresses this situation by seeking to increase appropriate antibiotic coverage and to reduce the unnecessary use of antibiotics.

Early, appropriate empirical treatment is associated with better survival. Furthermore, if the initial antibiotic treatment is subsequently modified in the light of the culture results, the patient's outcome does not seem to be affected. Many strategies for improving adequate empirical treatment coverage and for limiting the use of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics have been developed, such as the use of risk factors or scores to identify patients who are particularly vulnerable to multidrug-resistant germs. The main problem is that these strategies lack external validation and usually have poor predictive performance; they may encourage the overuse of antibiotics or, more importantly, may not improve the appropriate treatment rate.

The combined effect of CS and mutation rate on resistance development differs between treatments

Because some antibiotic treatments can enhance the genome-wide mutation rate in pathogenic bacteria, we included a set of simulations with higher mutation rates than 10⁻⁹ mutations/bp/h (10⁻⁸–10⁻⁶ mutations/bp/h). We show that the impact of mutation rate on the PoR was dependent on the combination of treatment design and the antibiotic type used, especially in the presence of CS (Fig. 9). The largest impact of the interaction between CS and mutation on PoR was found for the extremes of the antibiotic switching time, i.e. one-day cycling and sequential treatment design (maximum ΔPoR −57.8% and −52.4%, respectively). In the absence of CS, an increased mutation rate generally led to an increased PoR, with the exception of simultaneous administration of time-dependent antibiotics, which actually resulted in full suppression of resistance regardless of CS and mutation rate. For sequential treatments using time-dependent antibiotics with reciprocal CS (Fig. 9 I, M), the highest PoR was observed at a mutation rate of 10⁻⁷ mutations/bp/h, and decreased at higher mutation rates. For all mutation rates and in the presence of CS, simultaneous treatments suppressed resistance.

The effect of increased mutation rate for different CS magnitudes on the probability of resistance (PoR).

The combined impact of mutation rate and the CS on PoR was dependent on treatment schedule. PoR of R Any, defined as the presence of any resistant subpopulation, was estimated at the end of treatment for treatments using different designs (columns) and antibiotic types (rows) for different mutation rates (x -axis). Each simulated scenario was realized n = 500 times. Colour and line-type indicate the magnitude of reciprocal CS simulated. Data are presented as mean PoR with the error bars that represent the standard error of the estimation.

### Temporal trends in phenotypic macrolide and nonmacrolide resistance for Streptococcus pneumoniae nasopharyngeal samples up to 36 months after mass azithromycin administration in a cluster-randomized trial in Niger [^e4e790b2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

A major limitation of our study, because this trial was randomized at the village level and children were selected at random each year to provide a nasopharyngeal swab, is that we can only make inferences about prevalence at the community level. Longitudinal studies on an individual level could yield additional information, such as how often individuals with resistant phenotypes revert to susceptible and the timescale of such transitions.

This study provides perspective on the risk-benefit of MDA distribution programs. Although the study lacks the power to make definitive statistical statements regarding the relationship between MDA and antibiotic emergence, a few qualitative conclusions are supported. Namely, MDA does appear to promote antibiotic resistance, but the population-level impact appears to plateau. To concretely evaluate the short-term benefits of MDA programs versus the long-term risks of antibiotic resistance, more studies are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of increased community-level colonization with resistant organisms and to determine how long the increased prevalence of antibiotic resistance persists after MDA cessation. It is also important to further evaluate the extent to which MDA distribution in a particular community may impact the risk of antibiotic infections in neighboring communities. These types of studies will help clarify when MDA programs can be safely deployed to save lives and decrease morbidity in lower- and middle-income countries.

### Shorter and longer courses of antibiotics for common infections and the association with reductions of infection-related complications including hospital admissions [^7aa75c0a]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

The current study did observe underlying confounding when looking at the risk of a poor outcome in the first 5 days follow-up (when all comparison groups had the same exposure). It is well known that patients at a higher risk of a complication following an acute infection are often the elderly, patients with impaired immune function and multimorbidity; so it was not surprising to see the incidence increase from 0.12% to 0.76% with an increasing Charlson score. Furthermore, the majority of events occurring within 7 days follow-up, suggesting very unwell patient are admitted before completion of their antibiotic course.

Current recommendations do not inform the prescriber of the best treatment for reoccurring infections (except for UTIs), nor do they consider a patient's historic antibiotic exposure, or patients that have had repeated-intermittent antibiotic prescriptions, all of which may affect the success of the subsequent antibiotic treatment. The prescriber is left to prescribe empirically, given the patients history with limited trial data to inform guidance for complex prior exposures. A recent epidemiological study observed reduced effectiveness of antibiotic treatment for patients with prior frequent intermittent antibiotic use compared to occasional users, suggesting that frequent use reduces antibiotic effectiveness and may drive individualized resistance, increasing the likelihood of treatment failure in the future. Further research is needed to determine the most effective strategies for optimizing duration of antibiotic treatment for individual patients, taking a combination of patient characteristics, clinical presentation, symptom severity, and prior use into consideration when identifying the patients who are more at risk of failing to recover on shorter antibiotic courses.

### Advantages and limitations of large language models for antibiotic prescribing and antimicrobial stewardship [^c8434e41]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

Box 1 The complexity of antibiotic prescribing and antimicrobial stewardship –

Clinicians prescribing antibiotics typically undergo complex clinical reasoning involving several key considerations:
Identification of the cause of the clinical picture Determining whether the patient has a bacterial infection or if the symptoms could be due to another infectious agent (e.g. a virus) or a non-infectious disease.
Severity and necessity of empirical antibiotic therapy Deciding if the clinical presentation is severe enough to warrant empirical antibiotic therapy while awaiting a definitive diagnosis, to prevent any perilous delay in treatment that could adversely impact the prognosis.
Choice of antibiotic treatment If empirical antibiotic treatment is necessary, deciding whether to prescribe a single antibiotic or a combination, and selecting the appropriate antibiotic(s) based on the infection site, infection severity, expected causative agents, and the risk of antibiotic-resistant infections considering the patient's medical and microbiological history and the local microbiological epidemiology.

As microbiological test results become available at different times, the clinical reasoning evolves:
Rapid molecular tests If rapid molecular tests (which provide information on the presence or absence of certain etiological agents and resistance determinants within hours) are available, deciding whether to discontinue, escalate, or de-escalate antibiotic therapy based on the results. This requires peculiar expertise also because a negative result does not exclude infections by organisms or resistance determinants not included in the test panel.
Microscopy results and positive cultures In the case of positive cultures, considering whether to escalate or de-escalate antibiotic therapy based on microscopy results (Gram-staining) while waiting for complete culture results.
Complete culture results Adjusting antibiotic therapy based on complete culture results providing identification of the etiological agents.
Possible contamination or colonization Determining whether the identified organism is a true etiological agent or a contaminant (e.g. coagulative-negative staphylococci in a single positive blood culture) or colonization (in case of cultures from non-sterile sites), and if the clinical picture in similar cases might be due to another unidentified organism or a non-infectious cause.
Phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility tests Typically, within 24 h after identifying the etiological agents, phenotypic antibiotic susceptibility test results also become available. This prompts further clinical reasoning to choose the best antibiotic for targeted therapy based on proven susceptibility.

### Antibiotics for acute and chronic respiratory infection in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^5c5748cf]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Prevention and effective treatment of exacerbations are major objectives in the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Antibiotics are mainstay treatment for patients with severe COPD with an acute exacerbation that includes increased sputum purulence and worsening shortness of breath. Although such treatment is associated with clinical benefit, treatment failure and relapse rates may be high, particularly in cases of inadequate antibiotic therapy through incomplete resolution of the initial exacerbation and persistent bacterial infection. These aspects have led to recommendations for a stratified approach to antibiotic therapy based on patient characteristics associated with increased risk factors for failure. Patients at greatest risk for poor outcome (i.e., those with severe COPD) are likely to derive greatest benefit from early treatment with antibiotics. Long-term or intermittent antibiotic treatment has been shown to prevent COPD exacerbations and hospitalizations. These effects may be achieved by reducing bacterial load in the airways in stable state and/or bronchial inflammation. Although systemic antibiotics are likely to remain the core treatment for patients with moderate to severe exacerbated COPD, inhaled antibiotics may represent a more optimal approach for the treatment and prevention of COPD exacerbations in the future. Regardless of the route of administration, further studies are required to evaluate the potential long-term adverse events of antibiotics and the development of bacterial resistance.

### Appropriate antibiotic use and why it is important: the challenges of bacterial resistance [^db5b6c37]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2003). Low credibility.

After the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-20th century, clinicians soon witnessed clinical failures secondary to bacterial resistance. Despite scientists' efforts to synthesize more potent antibiotics during the last five decades, bacterial resistance continues to evolve, in large part because of the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. The treatment of several pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, is problematic. New solutions are needed to preserve the activity of our current antibiotic armamentarium, to lower the overall risk of bacterial resistance and to successfully treat patients with resistant bacterial infections. Options include: development of new antibiotics to treat resistant organisms; vaccination to prevent infections; and improved use of antibiotics. Because bacteria will eventually develop means to avoid being killed by antibiotics, judicious use of antibiotics by all clinicians is imperative. Appropriate antibiotic use involves selection of a "targeted spectrum" antibiotic, as well as an appropriate dose and duration.

### Advantages and limitations of large language models for antibiotic prescribing and antimicrobial stewardship [^91ace84d]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

The evolution of the clinical picture and laboratory results indicating organ function and inflammatory status necessitate continuous evaluation:
Worsening clinical picture If the patient's condition worsens while waiting for an etiological diagnosis, considering whether the worsening is due to insufficient antibiotic efficacy requiring dosage adjustments (e.g. in case of augmented renal clearance in critically ill patients for antibiotics with renal excretion) or the consideration of other etiological agents (e.g. fungal infections in high-risk patients).
Evaluation of therapy based on clinical and laboratory results In the absence of an etiological diagnosis (e.g. negative cultures), continuously assessing the clinical picture and laboratory results (e.g. inflammatory markers trends) to decide on escalation, de-escalation, or discontinuation of antibiotic therapy.
Discontinuation of antibiotics Favorable clinical and laboratory evolution, alongside guideline recommendations, should prompt decisions on discontinuing antibiotics after completing the appropriate course to avoid excessive therapy durations, which can increase risks like invasive fungal infections or Clostridioides difficile infections.

An essential aspect of clinical reasoning for antibiotic prescribing is adherence to antimicrobial stewardship objectives, which aim to ensure:
Reduction of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria emergence Minimizing selective antibiotic pressure on bacterial populations to prevent the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria.
Cost reduction Reducing excessive healthcare costs associated with suboptimal antibiotic use.
Responsible use of antibiotics Promoting responsible antibiotic use at national and global levels across human health, animal health, and the environment. Ensuring sustainable access to effective antibiotic therapy for all those in need. Preserving the future efficacy of antibiotics.

Effective support for antibiotic prescribing through LLM-based tools must enhance accuracy across all these tasks. It should not merely suggest an antibiotic but consider the dynamic phases of antibiotic prescribing and management, ensuring comprehensive information is used to maximize treatment efficacy and safety for the patient and adhere to global antimicrobial stewardship goals.

### Ten golden rules for optimal antibiotic use in hospital settings: the WARNING call to action [^a027e7e9]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Using the shortest duration of antibiotics based on evidence

The duration of antibiotic therapy prescribed in daily practice is often longer than recommended by guidelines. WHO recommends against prolonging the administration of SAP after surgical intervention to prevent SSIs, based on a meta-analysis of 69 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the optimal duration of SAP. For clean and clean-contaminated procedures, CDC guidelines recommend not to give additional doses of prophylactic antibiotics after the surgical incision has been closed in the operating room, even in the presence of a drain. Updated guidelines of IDSA and SHEA recommend stopping all SAP at incision closure, regardless of procedure type or duration.

de Jonge et al. examined the effect of continued SAP on the rate of SSI. Eighty-three RCTs were evaluated; 52 (19,273 participants) were included in the primary meta-analysis. No conclusive evidence for the benefit of the post-operative continuation of antibiotic prophylaxis (vs. discontinuation) was identified. When combined with a comprehensive approach to best practices in SSI prevention, post-operative continuation of SAP produced no additional benefit in reducing the incidence of SSI in any surgical setting. In a 2019 multicenter retrospective cohort study, increased duration of antibiotic prophylaxis was associated with a higher risk of acute kidney injury and CDI, but no reduction in SSIs.

A study of 34 urban and rural South African hospitals demonstrated that implementation of process improvement initiatives and principles targeted to institutional needs, utilizing pharmacists, effectively improved SAP guideline compliance and sustainable patient outcomes. Efforts to shorten antibiotic therapy duration in hospital practice are a growing area of focus for ASPs. However, Langford et al. showed that ASP advice to stop antibiotics or reduce their duration was accepted less often than advice to start or increase antibiotic exposure.

Shortening the duration of antibiotic therapy is a crucial tactic for reducing unnecessary inpatient antibiotic use, where antibiotic pressure is intense. Although there are circumstances that may require prolonged antibiotic therapy (e.g. endocarditis, osteomyelitis), the duration of antibiotic therapy should always be as brief as possible. Regarding intra-abdominal infections, the STOP-IT trial demonstrated that, in the setting of adequate source control, 4 days of antibiotic therapy was non-inferior to 8 days of therapy. In the DURAPOP randomized clinical trial, critically ill patients with post-operative intra-abdominal infections treated with a short course of antibiotics (8 days) showed similar outcomes compared with those treated for 15 days.

### Vancomycin [^aa127b30]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibacterial Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including vancomycin, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When vancomycin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by vancomycin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Prescribing antibiotics when they are truly needed

Clinicians prescribing antibiotics are faced with conflicting priorities. On the one hand, they must provide patients with the best possible treatment. On the other hand, they must preserve the efficacy of antibiotics, minimize opportunistic infections such as CDI, reduce the selection of resistant pathogens in individual patients, and prevent the continued global increase of AMR. These conflicts should be evaluated and balanced before prescribing antibiotics (Fig. 10).

Fig. 10
Finding the right balance in prescribing antibiotics

The intestinal microbiota has an important role in human health and can protect the patient against colonizing enteric bacteria, a phenomenon known as colonization resistance. The indigenous bacteria of the microbiome provide an important host defense mechanism by inhibiting colonization by potentially pathogenic bacteria. However, in certain circumstances, a patient's microbiota can be compromised, no longer protecting against colonization by opportunists.

Antibiotics exert selection pressure on the human microbiome, predisposing to AMR. Antibiotic use can have unintended consequences on commensal intestinal microbiota. Whereas susceptible bacteria are destroyed, the resultant ecologic vacuum promotes the overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria that may already be antibiotic-resistant. Moreover, antibiotics facilitate the transmission of resistance genes conferring resistance to other bacteria (Fig. 11), thereby increasing the risks of cross-transmission between patients and outbreaks of infections caused by MDR bacteria.

Fig. 11
How antimicrobial resistance develops

Many studies have evaluated the long‐term effect on gut microbiota following a course of antibiotics. To demonstrate the long-term effects of antibiotics on the healthy microbiome, the effects of amoxicillin (500 mg) thrice daily for 5 days, ciprofloxacin (500 mg) twice daily for 5 days, and (second-generation cephalosporin) cefprozil (500 mg) twice daily for 7 days were evaluated in healthy individuals. Changes in the microbiota persisted for up to 12 weeks after the end of the treatment, characterized by the incomplete restoration of microbial equilibrium and the emergence of MDR strains. Moreover, compared with parenteral antibiotics, oral agents result in higher concentrations of antibiotics in the intestine and larger numbers of MDR bacteria in the intestinal microbiota. A study of ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) or clindamycin (150 mg four times daily for 10 days) on the fecal microbiota of healthy human beings for 1 year showed a profound impact on the diversity of the microbiome. Changes in microbial equilibrium were most pronounced in the first month after treatment, but persisted until month 20.

### Definitions and guidelines for research on antibiotic persistence [^c401fbee]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2019). High credibility.

Measuring spontaneous persistence

In contrast to triggered persistence, which is determined by the history of the culture, the rare spontaneous persistence should be measured in conditions of steady-state (also called balanced) growth so as to avoid the effect of the past growth conditions. This measurement can be achieved in a chemostat or by subdiluting the culture several timesbefore performing the time-kill assay, making sure to dilute the inoculum to below the persistence level. As spontaneous persistence is a steady-state phenomenon, care should be taken to evaluate whether the culture remains in steady-state growth, also after the inoculum influence has been ruled out. For example, a common pitfall is to perform the time-kill assay without diluting and subculturing the bacteria for enough time to eliminate the persister bacteria triggered by past stationary phase growth. Another common pitfall is to perform the time-kill assay when the culture is too close to the next stationary phase, which again may trigger the formation of persister cells. Even if the culture seems to be growing exponentially, it may no longer be in balanced growth and persister formation may be already triggered at a cell density that is ten times lower than the maximal density. The spontaneous persistence fraction should remain constant with time in steady-state growth conditions. A simple way to test that the results do not depend on the cell density is to perform the same experiment at a twofold lower density and verify that the persistence fraction remains the same.

Regrowth of persister bacteria

An inherent part of the persistence phenomenon is the ability of persisters to eventually resume growth. As evidenced by the low killing rate displayed in the second phase of biphasic killing curves (Fig. 2c), persisters may resume growth at a low and constant rate, independently of the presence of the drug. Only persisters resuming growth after cessation of the antibiotic treatment will give rise to a new population of susceptible bacteria.

Single-cell observation often shows non-growing cells that remain intact during exposure to the drug. However, regrowth must be documentedto illustrate that bacteria have survived exposure to the drug before those can be dubbed persisters.

### Current economic and regulatory challenges in developing antibiotics for Gram-negative bacteria [^7f51357c]. Npj Antimicrobials and Resistance (2025). Medium credibility.

The depletion of the antibiotic pipeline was further exacerbated by the exit of several major pharmaceutical companies from antibacterial R&D. Since the 1990s, 18 major pharmaceutical companies have reportedly exited the field. Although four big pharmaceutical companies- GSK, Novartis, Sanofi, and AstraZeneca- maintained active antibacterial programmes beyond this period, they too have shifted from the field between 2016 and 2019. The declining interest in antibiotic R&D among pharmaceutical companies can be attributed to a combination of scientific, regulatory, and financial challenges. While bacterial resistance and reduced antibiotic susceptibility are significant scientific challenges, it is mainly the economic barriers that deter pharmaceutical companies from investing in this field. Due to the short duration of antibiotic treatments, sales and returns on investment are considerably lower compared to other classes of medication. Consequently, despite substantial investment in antibiotic discovery and development, pharmaceutical companies struggle to recoup development costs and often choose to allocate their resources to fields such as cardiovascular medicine and oncology, which generate sustained revenue due to longer treatment durations and premium pricing. This, along with the lack of expertise in antibiotic R&D, meagre funding for antibiotic research, and limited business models, are contributing to the dwindling antibiotic pipeline.

### A problem of persistence: still more questions than answers? [^1078e4fd]. Nature Reviews: Microbiology (2013). Medium credibility.

The current antibiotic resistance crisis has led to increased pressure to prioritize strategies to tackle the issue, with a strong focus being placed on the development of novel antimicrobials. However, one major obstacle that is often overlooked is persister cells, which are refractory to antibiotic treatment. Tackling persistence is a challenge because these cell types are extremely difficult to study and, consequently, little is known about their physiology and the factors that lead to their emergence. Here, four experts contemplate the main physiological features that define persistence and the implications of persistence for antibiotic treatment regimens, and consider what the study of bacterial persistence has taught us about the heterogeneity of bacterial populations.

### Novel approaches are needed to develop tomorrow's antibacterial therapies [^26727f98]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Society faces a crisis of rising antibiotic resistance even as the pipeline of new antibiotics has been drying up. Antibiotics are a public trust; every individual's use of antibiotics affects their efficacy for everyone else. As such, responses to the antibiotic crisis must take a societal perspective. The market failure of antibiotics is due to a combination of scientific challenges to discovering and developing new antibiotics, unfavorable economics, and a hostile regulatory environment. Scientific solutions include changing the way we screen for new antibiotics. More transformationally, developing new treatments that seek to disarm pathogens without killing them, or that modulate the host inflammatory response to infection, will reduce selective pressure and hence minimize resistance emergence. Economic transformation will require new business models to support antibiotic development. Finally, regulatory reform is needed so that clinical development programs are feasible, rigorous, and clinically relevant. Pulmonary and critical care specialists can have tremendous impact on the continued availability of effective antibiotics. Encouraging use of molecular diagnostic tests to allow pathogen-targeted, narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy, using short rather than unnecessarily long course therapy, reducing inappropriate antibiotic use for probable viral infections, and reducing infection rates will help preserve the antibiotics we have for future generations.

### Superbug vs. superphage: a review ofand an interview with dr. chip schooley [^892b42de]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Thinking back to your early days in infectious diseases, did you ever imagine our current state of antimicrobial resistance? Not in the beginning because every couple of years there'd be a new class of antibiotic or we'd see a meaningful modification of an existing drug. As we've gotten more asymptotic, the modifications have had less impact. Plus, over time, we created an ecosystem where the microbes kept learning although we did not. Today, even if we stopped using antibiotics in all the hospitals in the world, the antibiotics currently in the environment would continue to select more drug-resistant pathogens.

The clock isn't going to stop no matter what we do. We definitely need antibiotic stewardship — we definitely need to stop squandering antibiotics in animal feed just to sell animals faster — but none of that is going to stop the changes set in motion by 50 years of antibiotic abuse.

How can the pharmaceutical industry participate more productively in developing new antimicrobial products, including phage? Well, there are a number of lessons from HIV therapeutics we can apply. The biggest disadvantage of phage or new antimicrobials in general compared with treatments for diseases such as HIV is that you only use them for a short period of time; therefore, amortization in terms of recovering R&D costs is much more complicated. That's also why hepatitis C therapeutics are much more expensive per pill than HIV therapeutics despite being made in virtually the same way in the same plants.

At the moment, relatively few fixed cocktails might treat most patients with multidrug Staph or Pseudomonas. And those phages are already in hand — they just need to be engineered to scale and combined in unique combinations that have intellectual property protection. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out. But right now there aren't many in pharma who seem to have figured this out.

### Shorter and longer courses of antibiotics for common infections and the association with reductions of infection-related complications including hospital admissions [^3578b174]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Antimicrobial resistance is a serious global health concern that emphasizes completing treatment course. Recently, the effectiveness of short versus longer antibiotic courses has been questioned. This study investigated the duration of prescribed antibiotics, their effectiveness, and associated risk of infection-related complications.

Methods

Clinical Practice Research Datalink identified 4 million acute infection episodes prescribed an antibiotic in primary care between January 2014-June 2014, England. Prescriptions were categorized by duration. Risk of infection-related hospitalizations within 30 days was modelled overall and by infection type. Risk was assessed immediately after or within 30 days follow-up to measure confounders given similar and varying exposure, respectively. An interaction term with follow-up time assessed whether hazard ratios (HRs) remained parallel with different antibiotic durations.

Results

The duration of antibiotic courses increased over the study period (5.2–19.1%); 6–7 days were most common (66.9%). Most infection-related hospitalizations occurred with prescriptions of 8–15 days (0.21%), accompanied by greater risk of infection-related complications compared to patients who received a short prescription (HR: 1.75 [95% CI: 1.54–2.00]). Comparing HRs in the first 5 days versus remaining follow-up showed longer antibiotic courses were no more effective than shorter courses (1.02 [95% CI: 0.90–1.16] and 0.92 [95% CI: 0.75–1.12]). No variation by infection-type was observed.

Conclusions

Equal effectiveness was found between shorter and longer antibiotic courses and the reduction of infection-related hospitalizations. Stewardship programs should recommend shorter courses of antibiotics for acute infections. Further research is required for treating patients with a complex medical history. SummaryPrescribing of longer courses increased over the study period. The majority of hospitalizations occurred for patients receiving longer courses. Risk of developing a complication (immediate vs remaining follow-up) found longer courses were no more effective than shorter courses.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^6c9ec763]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Published data notably support the following:
The need for better identification of patients at risk of MDROs infection
More accurate diagnostic tools enabling a rule-in/rule-out approach for bacterial sepsis
An individualized reasoning for the selection of single-drug or combination empirical regimen
The use of adequate dosing and administration schemes to ensure the attainment of PK-PD targets
Concomitant source control when appropriate
A systematic reappraisal of initial therapy in an attempt to minimize collateral damage on commensal ecosystems through de-escalation and treatment shortening whenever conceivable

Several trials found PCT-guided antibiotic stewardship to reduce antibiotic exposure and associated side effects among patients with respiratory infection and sepsis. Decisions regarding antibiotic use in an individual patient are complex and should be based on the pre-test probability for bacterial infection, the severity of presentation, and the results of the PCT. In the context of a low pre-test probability for bacterial infections and a low-risk patient, a low PCT level helps to rule out bacterial infection and empiric antibiotic therapy can be avoided. In the context of a high pre-test probability for bacterial infections and/or a high-risk patient with sepsis, monitoring of PCT over time helps to track the resolution of infection and decisions regarding the early stop of antibiotic treatment. Although these concepts have been successful in several respiratory infection and sepsis trials, some studies failed to show an added benefit of PCT due to factors such as low protocol adherence and relying on single rather than repeat PCT measurements.

In this era of AMR, another interesting strategy is a therapeutic approach based on patient risk stratification. Especially for Gram-negative MDRO infections, an approach based on the patient risk stratification could improve outcomes and avoid antibiotic misuse.

This approach could help physicians to avoid antibiotic overuse as well as to start promptly with the most appropriate antibiotic regimen. Several risk factors for Gram-negative MDRO infections have been identified. These include prior infection or colonization with Gram-negative MDROs, antibiotic therapy in the past 90 days, poor functional status performance, hospitalization for more than 2 days in the past 90 days, occurrence five or more days after admission to an acute hospital, receiving hemodialysis, and immunosuppression. Moreover, prior receipt of carbapenems, broad-spectrum cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones has been associated specifically with MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### ESKAPE pathogens rapidly develop resistance against antibiotics in development in vitro [^89efb455]. Nature Microbiology (2025). High credibility.

Main

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections are a major public health concern and are responsible for a substantial proportion of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Paradoxically, many pharmaceutical companies have discontinued their antibiotic research programs. This may be linked to the rapid spread of MDR bacteria, which makes the commercial success of new antimicrobial drugs unpredictable. For example, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) spent US$15 million to acquire the GSK2251052 molecule and invested further money in its development; however, resistance to GSK2251052 emerged and the project was cancelled. Antibiotics released to the market can also lose utility and revenue in only a few years due to resistance. Dalbavancin is one of the few therapies available for treatment of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections, but resistance emerged after 2 years of commercialization.

Bacteria acquire resistance through diverse genetic mechanisms, including point mutations, amplification of genomic segments and horizontal transfer of resistance genes. The ability to predict the possible evolutionary routes towards resistance is clearly needed, especially at an early stage of antibacterial drug discovery, to develop antibiotics with limited susceptibility to resistance. However, this is a complex problem for three main reasons: (1) multiple and varied molecular mechanisms contribute to antimicrobial resistance, (2) numerous pathogenic bacteria need to be considered and (3) many potential antibacterial compounds need to be tested.

Here we asked whether antibiotic candidates show differences in their susceptibility to the development of resistance compared with antibiotics that are currently in use. By combining laboratory evolution and functional metagenomics, we studied in vitro emergence of resistance to antibiotics either introduced after 2017 or currently in development, compared with antibiotics that are currently in use.

17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION

Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide).

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females to inform their healthcare provider of a known or suspected pregnancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with VIBATIV and for 2 days after the final dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.3)]

Diarrhea

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics that usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as 2 or more months after having received the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Antibacterial Resistance

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including VIBATIV should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When VIBATIV is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may: (1) decrease the effectiveness of immediate treatment, and (2) increase the likelihood that the bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by VIBATIV or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

### How long should we treat this infection for? [^3cb1f7bb]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2013). Low credibility.

Infection accounts for approximately half of all paediatric admissions to hospital and an even greater proportion of primary care. Guidelines on duration of antibiotic therapy exist, but antibiotic therapy for children needs to be individualised. If a child is not improving the clinical condition and treatment should be reviewed and/or discussed with an expert. However, slavishly completing the recommended course of antibiotics in a child who is well, may not be appropriate. Recent studies on treatment duration advocate shortened courses with certain caveats, but guidelines and clinical practice do not always follow the evidence from the few randomised trials of treatment duration of infection.

### CDC grand rounds: getting smart about antibiotics [^193b244d]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2015). Low credibility.

Each year in the United States, approximately two million persons become infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, at least 23,000 persons die as a direct result of these infections, and many more die from conditions complicated by a resistant infection. Antibiotic-resistant infections contribute to poor health outcomes, higher health care costs, and use of more toxic treatments. Although emerging resistance mechanisms are being identified and resistant infections are on the rise, new antibiotic development has slowed considerably.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^91c8fd44]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

If the patient has NOT had a good response to any Type 2-targeted therapy — management steps include the following. Stop the biologic therapy. Review the basics for factors contributing to symptoms, exacerbations and poor quality of life, and consider additional investigations such as high resolution chest CT, induced sputum to confirm inflammatory phenotype, bronchoscopy for alternative or additional diagnoses, or referral. Reassess treatment options, including add-on low-dose azithromycin (adults only; first check sputum for atypical mycobacteria and check ECG for long QTc [and re-check after a month on treatment]; consider potential for antibiotic resistance). As last resort, consider add-on low-dose maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) with strategies such as alternate-day therapy and alert the patient to the need for additional corticosteroid therapy during illness or surgery; consider bronchial thermoplasty (+ registry); and stop ineffective add-on therapies, but do not completely stop inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).

### Continuous versus intermittent antibiotics for bronchiectasis [^a1d9ad2e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Bronchiectasis is a chronic airway disease characterised by a destructive cycle of recurrent airway infection, inflammation and tissue damage. Antibiotics are a main treatment for bronchiectasis. The aim of continuous therapy with prophylactic antibiotics is to suppress bacterial load, but bacteria may become resistant to the antibiotic, leading to a loss of effectiveness. On the other hand, intermittent prophylactic antibiotics, given over a predefined duration and interval, may reduce antibiotic selection pressure and reduce or prevent the development of resistance. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the current evidence for studies comparing continuous versus intermittent administration of antibiotic treatment in bronchiectasis in terms of clinical efficacy, the emergence of resistance and serious adverse events.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of continuous versus intermittent antibiotics in the treatment of adults and children with bronchiectasis, using the primary outcomes of exacerbations, antibiotic resistance and serious adverse events.

Search Methods

On 1 August 2017 and 4 May 2018 we searched the Cochrane Airways Review Group Specialised Register (CAGR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and AMED. On 25 September 2017 and 4 May 2018 we also searched www.clinicaltrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal, conference proceedings and the reference lists of existing systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We planned to include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of adults or children with bronchiectasis that compared continuous versus intermittent administration of long-term prophylactic antibiotics of at least three months' duration. We considered eligible studies reported as full-text articles, as abstracts only and unpublished data.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened the search results and full-text reports.

Main Results

We identified 268 unique records. Of these we retrieved and examined 126 full-text reports, representing 114 studies, but none of these studies met our inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

No randomised controlled trials have compared the effectiveness and risks of continuous antibiotic therapy versus intermittent antibiotic therapy for bronchiectasis. High-quality clinical trials are needed to establish which of these interventions is more effective for reducing the frequency and duration of exacerbations, antibiotic resistance and the occurrence of serious adverse events.

### Antibiotic strategies in the era of multidrug resistance [^044c473c]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

ICU patients are particularly at risk of developing infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, which are more prevalent in this environment. Appropriate and adequate antibiotic coverage is essential in the treatment of these patients. In the present update, we will discuss the mechanisms of development of resistance, before highlighting some of the key issues related to antibiotic management and possible approaches to prevent further development of resistance.

### Efficacy and safety of procalcitonin guidance in patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^d7faabcf]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Sepsis is a leading cause of mortality in noncoronary ICUs. Although immediate start of antibiotics reduces sepsis-related mortality, antibiotics are often administered for too long, leading to suboptimal treatment and, importantly, contributes to antimicrobial resistance. Prior literature suggests that procalcitonin correlates with infection and thus may help to guide the decision on when to stop antibiotic treatment. This study was conducted as part of a regulatory submission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and aimed to summarize the evidence of procalcitonin guidance on efficacy and safety outcomes in adult patients with sepsis.

Data Sources

PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.

Study Selection

English-language randomized controlled trials evaluating procalcitonin use among adult patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis published between January 2004 and May 2016.

Data Extraction

Inverse-variance weighting fixed and random effects meta-analyses were performed on the following efficacy and safety endpoints: antibiotic duration, all-cause mortality, and length of ICU stay. Two reviewers independently extracted data elements from identified studies and measured risk of bias with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.

Data Synthesis

From a total of 369 potentially eligible articles, 10 randomized controlled trials containing 3,489 patients were used for analysis. Procalcitonin-guided patients had shorter antibiotics duration compared with controls (7.35 vs. 8.85 d; weighted mean difference, -1.49 d; 95% CI, -2.27 to -0.71; p < 0.001). Procalcitonin use had no adverse impact on mortality (risk ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.79–1.03; p = 0.114) and length of ICU stay (11.09 d vs. 11.91 d; weighted mean difference, -0.84 d; 95% CI, -2.52 to 0.84; p = 0.329).

Conclusions

In adult patients with suspected or confirmed sepsis, procalcitonin guidance reduces antibiotics duration with no observed adverse effects on patient outcomes.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^cbef3023]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) plus clinical criteria for HAP/VAP antibiotic discontinuation — we suggest using PCT levels plus clinical criteria rather than clinical criteria alone to guide discontinuation (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence), noting it is not known if benefits apply where standard VAP therapy is already 7 days or less. Evidence from a systematic review found 14 trials with 4221 patients showing decreased antibiotic exposure (adjusted mean difference, −3.47 days; 95% CI, −3.78 to −3.17 days) without increased mortality or treatment failure. Trials specifically in VAP (2 published and 1 abstract) pooled 308 patients and showed shorter antibiotic duration with PCT plus clinical criteria (9.1 days vs 12.1 days; P < .00001) with no difference in mortality and no effects on mechanical ventilation duration, ICU or hospital length of stay, recurrent pneumonia, or resistance. The panel had low confidence due to risk of bias, indirectness, and imprecision (I2 = 21%), and noted usual short-course therapy is about 7–8 days; the evidence is predominantly from VAP, so recommendations for HAP are mostly based on VAP studies.

### Duration of contact precautions for acute-care settings [^053f704a]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (MDR-E) — policy for CP discontinuation and duration: "If a hospital uses CP for patients infected or colonized with MDR-E (ESBL-E and/or CRE), we recommend establishing a policy for discontinuation of CP for MDR-E that includes the following:" (a) "Maintaining CP for ESBL-E and CRE for the duration of the index hospital stay when infection or colonization with these bacteria is first detected"; and (b) "Considering discontinuation of CP on a case-by-case basis" when criteria are met, including "(1) at least 6 months have elapsed since the last positive culture;… (2) presence of a clinical infection and ongoing antibiotic use, where discontinuation of CP should be discouraged…; and (3)… at least 2 consecutive negative rectal swab samples obtained at least 1 week apart". Additionally, "We recommend that for extensively drug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae… with very limited treatment options (susceptible to ≤ 2 antibiotic classes used to treat that organism), hospitals should maintain CP indefinitely".

### Optimization of lag time underlies antibiotic tolerance in evolved bacterial populations [^8ab1ad02]. Nature (2014). Excellent credibility.

The great therapeutic achievements of antibiotics have been dramatically undercut by the evolution of bacterial strategies that overcome antibiotic stress. These strategies fall into two classes. 'Resistance' makes it possible for a microorganism to grow in the constant presence of the antibiotic, provided that the concentration of the antibiotic is not too high. 'Tolerance' allows a microorganism to survive antibiotic treatment, even at high antibiotic concentrations, as long as the duration of the treatment is limited. Although both resistance and tolerance are important reasons for the failure of antibiotic treatments, the evolution of resistance is much better understood than that of tolerance. Here we followed the evolution of bacterial populations under intermittent exposure to the high concentrations of antibiotics used in the clinic and characterized the evolved strains in terms of both resistance and tolerance. We found that all strains adapted by specific genetic mutations, which became fixed in the evolved populations. By monitoring the phenotypic changes at the population and single-cell levels, we found that the first adaptive change to antibiotic stress was the development of tolerance through a major adjustment in the single-cell lag-time distribution, without a change in resistance. Strikingly, we found that the lag time of bacteria before regrowth was optimized to match the duration of the antibiotic-exposure interval. Whole genome sequencing of the evolved strains and restoration of the wild-type alleles allowed us to identify target genes involved in this antibiotic-driven phenotype: 'tolerance by lag' (tbl). Better understanding of lag-time evolution as a key determinant of the survival of bacterial populations under high antibiotic concentrations could lead to new approaches to impeding the evolution of antibiotic resistance.
