## Question

treatment of metastatic lung cancer with L858R EGFR mutation, PDLI 75%

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with an EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation and PD-L1 expression of 75% as first-line and through progression. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how driver alterations (EGFR) prioritize therapy choices over PD-L1 status. Then, I should verify the guideline-concordant first-line recommendation and its evidence base. Next, I will examine whether high PD-L1 changes anything here and the risks of immunotherapy sequencing. After that, I should consider acceptable first-line alternatives in select situations. Finally, I will map the plan at progression, including resistance testing and evidence for post-TKI strategies, and I'll close with a concise synthesis and safety notes.

> Let me first confirm the principle that in metastatic NSCLC with a sensitizing EGFR mutation, genotype-directed therapy takes precedence over PD-L1 expression for initial management, and this is consistent across major guidelines, so PD-L1 75% does not drive first-line immunotherapy in this setting [^1168YxAS] [^114A591m].

> I need to ensure the preferred first-line therapy is clearly stated and justified; guidelines recommend osimertinib as the preferred first-line EGFR TKI for classic mutations (exon 19 deletion and L858R), owing to superior efficacy, CNS penetration, and tolerability versus earlier-generation TKIs, which makes osimertinib 80 mg daily the standard starting point here [^1168YxAS] [^112rwqGo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about PD-L1 75% implying immunotherapy; I should verify that single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade is not recommended first-line in EGFR-mutated disease regardless of PD-L1 level, and indeed ASCO explicitly recommends against single-agent ICI in this setting and first-line ICI approvals and pivotal trials either excluded EGFR/ALK or specify no EGFR/ALK alterations, so PD-L1 75% does not override EGFR-directed therapy here [^115x5QBj] [^112gHw4K] [^1169JvDq] [^111xwEam].

> Next, I will examine first-line alternatives if I need deeper or faster responses; ASCO allows consideration of osimertinib with platinum-pemetrexed or the combination of amivantamab plus lazertinib in selected patients after careful toxicity–benefit discussion, whereas ESMO notes EGFR TKI plus anti-angiogenic combinations (erlotinib with bevacizumab or ramucirumab) as options, though osimertinib remains the preferred standard for most patients [^1168YxAS] [^113mHZCo] [^117Sr6wL].

> Wait, I should double-check safety considerations around sequencing; severe immune-related adverse events are notably more common when PD-(L)1 blockade is followed by osimertinib in close temporal proximity, so I need to avoid initiating osimertinib soon after an ICI and consider adequate washout if an ICI was already given inadvertently or in a prior line, as this sequence carries heightened toxicity risk [^115UobqQ].

> I will now consider baseline and on-treatment assessment; given osimertinib's superior CNS activity, I should obtain a baseline brain MRI and then follow standard imaging every 8–12 weeks with closer interval as clinically indicated, while monitoring for class toxicities such as rash and diarrhea and leveraging osimertinib's CNS penetration for any asymptomatic brain disease detected at baseline or during surveillance [^112rwqGo].

> Next, I should review the plan at progression on first-line osimertinib; I need to check for resistance mechanisms with plasma ctDNA and, if feasible, tumor rebiopsy, and then move to platinum-pemetrexed chemotherapy with or without amivantamab as the standard next step in the absence of a new targetable alteration, per ASCO living guidance [^116pZDTZ] [^111gXfCy].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought that if T790M-positive resistance is detected, one could continue osimertinib and consider adding chemotherapy or amivantamab, but hold on, I should verify this sequencing nuance; T790M positivity is the canonical mechanism after first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs and indicates switching to osimertinib, while after frontline osimertinib, emergent T790M is uncommon and continuing osimertinib with added therapy is not a standard approach, so the evidence-based path is chemotherapy ± amivantamab or clinical trial after osimertinib progression, with targeted options guided by specific resistance (for example, MET amplification) when identified [^112dhmSc] [^116pZDTZ].

> I should confirm the role of immunotherapy after EGFR TKI resistance; pivotal randomized data do not support adding pembrolizumab to platinum-pemetrexed in the post-TKI setting and nivolumab-based chemoimmunotherapy strategies have similarly failed to improve outcomes in this population, so immunotherapy is not standard in EGFR-mutant disease even after TKI failure unless in carefully selected combinations or trials, and chemotherapy-based regimens remain the cornerstone [^1149qzgW] [^111WgZsH].

> Let me reconsider whether PD-L1 expression meaningfully stratifies outcomes within EGFR-mutant disease treated with osimertinib; exploratory analyses from FLAURA suggest PD-L1 expression in EGFR-mutant tumors is less common at high levels and not clearly predictive of differential benefit with EGFR TKIs, reinforcing that PD-L1 75% should not drive first-line ICI in this genotype [^112NCk9q].

> Putting this all together, I should conclude succinctly: first-line osimertinib is the evidence-based standard for metastatic L858R NSCLC irrespective of PD-L1 75%; reserve first-line ICI monotherapy for patients without EGFR/ALK alterations and avoid ICI→osimertinib sequencing due to toxicity; consider osimertinib plus platinum-pemetrexed or amivantamab plus lazertinib selectively; at progression on osimertinib, perform resistance testing and treat with platinum-pemetrexed ± amivantamab or targeted therapy if a tractable resistance mechanism is found, recognizing that adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy post-TKI has not improved outcomes in trials [^1168YxAS] [^115x5QBj] [^116pZDTZ] [^1149qzgW] [^112rwqGo].

---

For metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR L858R mutation and PD-L1 75%, **osimertinib is the preferred first-line therapy** [^1168YxAS] because it provides superior efficacy, CNS activity [^112rwqGo], and a favorable safety profile. Immune checkpoint inhibitors should **not be used first-line** [^115x5QBj] in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 level, due to low efficacy and high toxicity. If progression occurs, test for T790M [^notfound] and use osimertinib if positive [^112dhmSc]; if negative, use platinum-based chemotherapy with or without amivantamab [^111gXfCy]. Immunotherapy may be considered only after chemotherapy failure and with caution due to limited benefit and increased immune-related adverse events [^1149qzgW] [^115UobqQ].

---

## First-line therapy recommendations

### EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)

Osimertinib is the **preferred first-line EGFR TKI** for L858R-mutant NSCLC [^112rwqGo] due to superior efficacy, robust CNS penetration, and a favorable safety profile [^1168YxAS].

Alternative TKIs — erlotinib, gefitinib, afatinib, and dacomitinib — remain options [^114MFRZQ] but are generally less effective and more toxic than osimertinib [^112DKLoY] [^112QNW4g] [^1118ypPb].

---

### Role of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)

Single-agent ICIs (e.g. pembrolizumab, atezolizumab) are **not recommended as first-line therapy** in EGFR-mutant NSCLC, regardless of PD-L1 expression, owing to low efficacy and higher toxicity [^115x5QBj] [^111xwEam]. EGFR-mutant NSCLC typically has low tumor mutational burden and limited immune infiltration, leading to poor ICI responses [^116QBovp].

---

## Management of disease progression

### Progression on first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs

Upon progression on first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs, **test for T790M** [^112bQKE5]; if positive, switch to osimertinib [^112dhmSc]. If T790M is negative, proceed with platinum-based chemotherapy [^1134GR7i].

---

### Progression on osimertinib

Upon progression on osimertinib, **platinum-based chemotherapy is recommended** [^116pZDTZ]. In selected patients, adding amivantamab to chemotherapy may be considered [^111gXfCy].

---

## Role of PD-L1 expression in treatment selection

High PD-L1 expression (≥ 50%) alone does not justify first-line ICI use in EGFR-mutant NSCLC given limited efficacy and increased toxicity [^115x5QBj]. Treatment selection should be **driven primarily by EGFR mutation status** rather than PD-L1 expression [^1169JvDq].

---

## Safety considerations

Sequential use of EGFR TKIs and ICIs increases the risk of severe immune-related adverse events, such as pneumonitis and hepatitis [^115UobqQ]. Close monitoring is **required**, with prompt recognition and management of immune-related toxicities.

## Summary of treatment recommendations

| **Treatment line** | **Recommended therapy** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| First-line | Osimertinib | Superior efficacy, CNS penetration, favorable safety [^112rwqGo] [^114MFRZQ] [^1168YxAS] |
| Second-line (T790M-positive) | Osimertinib | Effective against T790M resistance [^1134GR7i] [^112dhmSc] |
| Second-line (T790M-negative) | Platinum-based chemotherapy | Standard of care [^1134GR7i] [^111gXfCy] |
| Progression on osimertinib | Platinum-based chemotherapy ± amivantamab | Recommended by guidelines [^111gXfCy] [^116pZDTZ] |
| ICIs | Not recommended first-line | Limited efficacy, high toxicity [^115x5QBj] [^1169JvDq] |

---

## Conclusion

For metastatic NSCLC with an EGFR L858R mutation and PD-L1 75%, **osimertinib is the preferred first-line therapy** [^1168YxAS]. ICIs are not recommended as first-line therapy due to limited efficacy and high toxicity [^115x5QBj]. Upon progression, test for T790M [^112bQKE5]; if positive, use osimertinib; if negative, use platinum-based chemotherapy with or without amivantamab [^111gXfCy].

### Comparative efficacy and safety of second-line treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with wild-type or unknown status for epidermal growth factor receptor: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113zWEL9]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Our review is, at the time of writing, the most comprehensive comparative effectiveness review for second-line treatments for advanced NSCLC with wild-type or unknown status for EGFR, involving 102 RCTs (36,058 patients). In terms of overall survival (OS), immunotherapy treatments such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab, and the combination of pemetrexed plus erlotinib, appeared to be more efficacious than the four recommended treatments, with no observed difference in effectiveness among these recommended treatments. Other approved treatments did not demonstrate statistically significant benefits compared to the four recommended treatments. Our review emphasized that only half of the trials reported safety outcomes, resulting in very uncertain results regarding safety. Additionally, for OS, all relative effects were informed by trials at low and moderate risk of overall bias, thus the quality of evidence was deemed moderate.

Our network meta-analysis (NMA) offers several advantages over the two previous NMAs, which focused on a subset of available treatments. Our exhaustive search strategy allowed us to identify a substantial number of unpublished trials, representing one-sixth of our data, and several reports on the same trial, with a median of two reports per trial (ranging from 1 to 17). This enabled us to compare results from each report and prioritize the report providing the best level of evidence. The unpublished trials were primarily phase III trials (9 out of 15, 60%) and encompassed negative trials evaluating unsuccessfully licensed drugs or small trials with fewer than 100 participants, including these trials decreased the risk of publication bias.

### Egfr mutations and PD-L1 expression in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer: A real-world data from a single center in Brazil [^114q6MsZ]. The Oncologist (2022). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide and is the leading cause of cancer-related death in many countries. The high mortality rate is directly influenced by the late diagnosis of this disease. In Brazil, approximately 30% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are diagnosed at early stages and hence treated with curative intent surgery, whether or not followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Although the number of early-stage patients with NSCLC that may benefit from curative intent treatment is currently scarce, it is projected to increase in the near future due to the uptake of lung cancer screening programs. Early-stage patients with NSCLC experience high recurrence rates, exhibiting a 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of approximately 30%-50%. Thus, adjuvant therapy is needed to reduce the risk of disease recurrence or death for resected patients with NSCLC. Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is currently considered the standard of care; however, at 5 years, the OS benefit is only 5%.

Over recent years, targeted therapies have dramatically improved the survival of patients whose tumors harbor somatic driver oncogenes, such as the mutant Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor gene (EGFRm). EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKis) are currently the standard of care for EGFRm NSCLC with advanced disease. Recently, osimertinib (a third-generation EGFR-TKi) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Agência Nacional de Vigilância Sanitária (ANVISA) as an adjuvant treatment.

### Pembrolizumab in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (KEYNOTE-001): 3-year results from an open-label, phase 1 study [^112Z6KKM]. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The anti-programmed death 1 monoclonal antibody pembrolizumab has shown antitumor activity and is a first-line and second-line treatment option for patients with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-expressing advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. We report updated 3-year safety and efficacy outcomes from the phase 1 study, KEYNOTE-001.

- **Methods**: KEYNOTE-001 is a multicohort, open-label, phase 1 study of pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks) in treatment-naive or previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with measurable disease at baseline. Two cohorts were randomly assigned to a pembrolizumab dose by use of a computer-generated randomization schedule at cohort-dependent ratios, and a further four cohorts were assigned to a pembrolizumab dose without randomization. We present 3-year outcomes for the full analysis set of patients who received at least one dose of study treatment, pooled for all pembrolizumab doses. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with objective response, analyzed here as investigator-assessed response according to immune-related response criteria. Secondary efficacy endpoints included overall survival, duration of response, and progression-free survival. Safety endpoints included the incidence of adverse events. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01295827, and is ongoing.

- **Findings**: Between May 8, 2012 and July 13, 2014, 550 patients (101 treatment-naive and 449 previously treated) were enrolled. Median follow-up was 34.5 months.

### Erlotinib [^112rpgst]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

- **Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) – First-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutations**: The safety and efficacy of erlotinib as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic NSCLC containing EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations was demonstrated in Study 1, a randomized, open-label, clinical trial conducted in Europe.

	- **One hundred seventy-four White patients were randomized 1**:1 to receive erlotinib 150 mg once daily until disease progression (n = 86) or four cycles of a standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (n = 88). Standard chemotherapy regimens were cisplatin plus gemcitabine, cisplatin plus docetaxel, carboplatin plus gemcitabine, and carboplatin plus docetaxel. The main efficacy outcome measure was progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator.

	- Randomization was stratified by EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) (0 vs. 1 vs. 2). EGFR mutation status for screening and enrollment of patients was determined by a clinical trials assay (CTA). Tumor samples from 134 patients (69 patients from the erlotinib arm and 65 patients from the chemotherapy arm) were tested retrospectively by the FDA-approved companion diagnostic, cobas®EGFR Mutation Test.

### Updated treatment recommendations for systemic treatment: From the ESMO non-oncogene-addicted metastatic NSCLC living guideline [^1132P3GS]. Annals of Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of non-small cell lung cancer, particularly in managing metastatic disease, the ESMO 2025 guidelines recommend offering immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy as first-line therapy. This is advised for patients with non-small cell lung cancer without driver alterations, who have a performance status of 2 and a PD-L1 expression of ≥ 50%, provided there are no contraindications to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

### Nivolumab plus chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer after disease progression on epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors: Final results of CheckMate 722 [^111WgZsH]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS), determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. Tumor progression or response was assessed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary end points included 9- and 12-month PFS rates, overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), and duration of response (DOR) according to RECIST v1.1 by BICR.

- **Exploratory end points**: Included PFS and OS subgroup analyses by baseline tumor PD-L1 status, PFS2 (PFS after next line of therapy), safety and tolerability in all treated patients, and patient-reported outcomes assessed using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. Post hoc analyses included PFS and OS by sensitizing/nonsensitizing mutation, by lines of previous EGFR TKI, as well as by baseline patient and disease characteristics.

EGFR mutations were determined by local laboratory testing. Patients could have multiple EGFR tumor mutations. For subtype analyses, the classic sensitizing EGFR mutations were exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations. All other EGFR mutations were classified as nonsensitizing, including L861Q, exon 20 insertion, G719X, and S768I. Although T790M mutation is known to be sensitive to osimertinib, such patients were eligible for enrollment only following a protocol amendment in November 2018. Patients with T790M-mutant tumors without another sensitizing mutation were categorized in the nonsensitizing mutation subgroup in the final EGFR mutation subanalyses. T790M-negative status was confirmed by a central or local laboratory.

### Outcomes with durvalumab by tumour PD-L1 expression in unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer in the PACIFIC trial [^112Buuhd]. Annals of Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

In the PACIFIC trial, durvalumab significantly improved progression-free and overall survival (PFS/OS) versus placebo, with manageable safety in unresectable, stage III non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients without progression after chemoradiotherapy (CRT). We report exploratory analyses of outcomes by tumour cell (TC) programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression.

- **Patients and methods**: Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive intravenous durvalumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or placebo for up to 12 months. They were stratified by age, sex, and smoking history, but not by PD-L1 status. Where available, pre-CRT samples were tested for PD-L1 expression using immunohistochemistry and scored at prespecified (25%) and post hoc (1%) TC cut-offs. Treatment-effect hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated from unstratified Cox proportional hazards models, with Kaplan-Meier-estimated medians.

- **Results**: In total, 713 patients were randomly assigned, with 709 receiving at least one dose of study treatment — either durvalumab (n = 473) or placebo (n = 236). Of these, 451 (63%) were PD-L1-assessable, with 35%, 65%, 67%, 33%, and 32% having TC ≥ 25%, < 25%, ≥ 1%, < 1%, and 1%-24%, respectively. As of 31 January 2019, the median follow-up was 33.3 months. Durvalumab improved PFS versus placebo across all subgroups (primary-analysis data cut-off, 13 February 2017) [HR, 95% confidence interval (CI); medians]: TC ≥ 25% (0.41, 0.26–0.65; 17.8 versus 3.7 months), < 25% (0.59, 0.43–0.82; 16.9 versus 6.9 months), ≥ 1% (0.46, 0.33–0.64; 17.8 versus 5.6 months), < 1% (0.73, 0.48–1.11; 10.7 versus 5.6 months), and 1%-24% [0.49, 0.30–0.80; not reached (NR)].

### Surgical results of the lung cancer mutation consortium 3 trial: A phase II multicenter single-arm study to investigate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with stages IB-select IIIB resectable non-small cell lung cancer [^114wE26S]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2023). Low credibility.

Surgery is considered the primary curative therapy for patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are medically fit for pulmonary resection. However, the 5-year overall survival (OS) for patients with resectable, locally advanced NSCLC (stage IB to IIIB disease) is only 26% to 68%. Patients who progress after resection typically develop distant metastatic disease. During the past 35 years, multiple clinical trials have shown that the addition of either adjuvant or neoadjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy to surgical resection in patients with locally advanced NSCLC is feasible and increases the 5-year OS.

Unfortunately, the absolute OS benefit with this approach is only approximately 5%, and patients experience significant toxicity. Although neoadjuvant therapy plus resection of locally advanced NSCLC has never been proven superior to postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy, it is widely used for locally advanced NSCLC. It has the potential advantages of early control of micrometastatic disease and is associated with better overall drug delivery because patients who start adjuvant therapy receive approximately 55% of the planned total dose. The neoadjuvant approach facilitates assessment of treatment safety and efficacy through serial scans before resection and pathologic evaluation of the degree of treatment response. It also enables pre- and post-treatment biomarker studies.

Multimodality treatment using platinum-based chemotherapy and either surgery or radiation for locally advanced NSCLC has remained at a therapeutic plateau for over two decades.

### Five-year outcomes with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 tumor proportion score ≥ 50 [^114h3e9d]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Among patients who completed 35 cycles, treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 87.2% (grade 3–4, 15.4%; no grade 5 events), consistent with the overall as-treated population. Treatment-related grade 3–4 AEs included diarrhea, autoimmune hepatitis, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, hyperglycemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, tubulointerstitial nephritis, and rash (all n = 1). Consistently, the incidence of immune-mediated AEs and infusion reactions was 30.8%, with grade 3–4 comprising 7.7% (one each of hepatitis, nephritis, and severe skin toxicity) and no grade 5 events.

- **Outcomes among patients who received a second course of pembrolizumab**: Twelve patients received a second course of pembrolizumab after an assessment of progression by the investigator. The median time from the last dose of the second course at the time of data cutoff was 15.2 months (range: 0.4–29.6). Among these 12 patients, eight (66.7%) were alive at the data cutoff. Four (33.3%) had an objective response post-second-course pembrolizumab (all partial responses), and six (50.0%) had stable disease as their best response per investigator assessment. One patient experienced progression after the second course, and one patient was not evaluable. At the data cutoff, five patients (41.7%) were alive without progression, and three (25.0%) had not received subsequent therapy. Five patients (41.7%) had treatment-related AEs during the second course; all were grade 1 or 2, with one event, grade 1 hypothyroidism, classified as an immune-mediated AE.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of second-line treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with wild-type or unknown status for epidermal growth factor receptor: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115VF1FT]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with a 5-year survival rate lower than 15%. Furthermore, it is the fifth leading cause of disability-adjusted life years in developed countries. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer cases, with most Western patients having wild-type or unknown status for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and do not present anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene rearrangement. Most patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease and are candidates for palliative systemic therapy.

Patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0–2 experiencing disease progression after first-line chemotherapy receive second-line treatments. In this context, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) clinical practice guidelines, updated in August 2015, recommend two cytotoxic drugs, docetaxel and pemetrexed (only for non-squamous cell carcinoma (NSCC) currently), and two EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors, erlotinib and gefitinib. However, several new treatments have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including a combination of docetaxel and ramucirumab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab. More than 40 treatments have been assessed in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC.

Conventional meta-analyses have only partially captured the available evidence for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. Specifically, 29 systematic reviews were published between 2009 and 2015 but did not incorporate all the emerging treatments and data.

### Programmed cell death ligand 1 expression in untreated EGFR mutated advanced NSCLC and response to osimertinib versus comparator in FLAURA [^112NCk9q]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2020). Low credibility.

EGFR mutated (EGFRm) NSCLC tumors occasionally express programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), although the frequency and clinical relevance are not fully characterized. We report PD-L1 expression in patients with EGFRm advanced NSCLC and the association with clinical outcomes following treatment with osimertinib or comparator EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the FLAURA trial, phase III, NCT02296125.

- **Methods**: Of 231 tissue blocks available from the screened population (including EGFRm-positive and -negative samples), 197 had sufficient tissue for PD-L1 testing using the SP263 (Ventana, Tucson, Arizona) immunohistochemical assay. Tumor cell (TC) staining thresholds of PD-L1 TC greater than or equal to 1%, TC greater than or equal to 25%, and TC greater than or equal to 50% were applied. Progression-free survival (PFS) was investigator-assessed, per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor, version 1.1, according to PD-L1 expressors (TC ≥ 1%) or negatives (TC < 1%) in randomized patients.

- **Results**: PD-L1 staining was successful in 193 of 197 patient formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks. Of these, 128 of 193 were EGFRm-positive and 106 of 128 patients were randomized to treatment (osimertinib: 54; comparator: 52). At the PD-L1 TC greater than or equal to 25% threshold, 8% (10 of 128) of EGFRm-positive tumors expressed PD-L1 versus 35% (23 of 65) of EGFRm-negative tumors. With the TC greater than or equal to 1% threshold, 51% (65 of 128) versus 68% (44 of 65) were mutation-positive and -negative, respectively.

### Severe immune-related adverse events are common with sequential PD-(L)1 blockade and osimertinib [^115UobqQ]. Annals of Oncology (2019). Low credibility.

We identified 126 patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with PD-(L)1 blockade and EGFR-TKI between March 2011 and September 2018 at MSKCC, inclusive of 180 distinct sequential drug exposures. Seventy-four (59%) patients received nivolumab, 27 (21%) pembrolizumab, 17 (14%) atezolizumab, and 8 (6%) durvalumab. Among our cohort, during their disease course, 104 (83%) received erlotinib, 58 patients (46%) received osimertinib, 23 (18%) received afatinib, and 2 (2%) received gefitinib.

- **Severe irAEs with PD-(L)1 inhibitors and osimertinib**: Forty-one patients were treated with sequential PD-(L)1 blockade followed by osimertinib, and 29 patients were treated with sequential osimertinib followed by PD-(L)1. This includes 9 patients who received osimertinib both before and after PD-(L)1 inhibition, who were counted in both groups due to distinct sequences of exposure and periods of irAE assessment. The clinical characteristics of these patients were typical of those with metastatic EGFR-mutant NSCLC.

### Clinical outcomes of first-line therapies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer: A systematic review of trials published between 2010 and 2020 [^115KNkeU]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). High credibility.

To analyze the evolution of clinical outcomes derived from clinical trials on first-line therapies for advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) published between 2010 and 2020, the study focuses on how these outcomes impact survival rates and management of patients.

- **Methods**: A systematic review of phase III and pivotal phase II clinical trials was conducted using a structured search on Medline and Embase. A comprehensive set of variables was collected to assess their influence on survival rates. The clinical benefit was estimated by applying the ESMO-MCBS v1.1, and the authors' conclusions were extracted.

- **Results**: Sixty-six studies involving 34,951 patients were included. Best survival outcomes were found for nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer, with OS and progression-free survival medians of 19.4 and 10.2 months, respectively. For those expressing molecular targets, the OS and progression-free survival medians were 23.8 and 11.0 months, respectively. No significant influence on survival rates was observed for industry funding and disease stage (IIIB/IV vs. IV). ESMO-MCBS v1.1 was applied in 45 positive studies and resulted in a meaningful clinical benefit score in 37.8%. Quality of life (QoL) was reported in 57.6% of the original publications and showed statistical significance favoring the experimental arm in 33.3%. Positive authors' conclusions (75.7% of trials) were based on OS and/or QoL in 34% and on surrogate endpoints in 66%.

Extended survival times and a steady improvement in QoL have been observed.

### Development and validation of a supervised deep learning algorithm for automated whole-slide programmed death-ligand 1 tumour proportion score assessment in non-small cell lung cancer [^117LAKF1]. Histopathology (2022). Low credibility.

The 5‐year survival rate of patients with stage IV non‐small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poor; combined with 2 million new patients annually, lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Immune checkpoint therapy (immunotherapy) targeting the programmed cell death protein 1/programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) pathway has greatly improved survival for NSCLC patients. However, response varies greatly between NSCLC patients; therefore, immunohistochemical PD‐L1 expression is currently used as a biomarker to select patients for immunotherapy.

Pathologists measure PD‐L1 expression by estimating the percentage of tumour cells with membranous PD‐L1 positivity [the tumour proportion score (TPS); see also Formula 1 in Data S1]. The TPS is a continuous score between 0% and 100%. Patients are further divided into three classes, i.e. TPS of 50%, as outlined in Figure 1. These classes have different treatment options, provided that no targetable mutation (EGFR) or fusion (ALK; ROS1) is detected.

- **Figure 1: Categories of programmed death‐ligand 1 (PD‐L1) expression, measured as the tumour proportion score (TPS) (Formula 1 in Data S1)**.
	- **Blue staining**: haematoxylin.
	- **Brown staining**: PD‐L1.
	- TPS of 50–100%.
	- TPS of 1–49%.
	- TPS of < 1%.

Unfortunately, this PD‐L1 expression scoring system has been proven to be imperfect. The study by Cooper et al. showed that problematic interobserver and intraobserver discordance exists, with disagreement between pathologists in 15.8% of cases around the 1% cutoff point (κ coefficient).

### Systemic treatment for advanced (stage IIIb/IV) non-small cell lung cancer: More treatment options; more things to consider. Introduction [^114nuveQ]. The Oncologist (2008). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is the most common and highly lethal cancer. Improvements in survival rates depend on advances in early detection and improved systemic therapies applied to surgery and/or irradiation in early-stage disease. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancers. Unfortunately, at diagnosis, most patients have advanced unresectable disease with a very poor prognosis. Indeed, 30%-40% of patients treated with first-line therapy will subsequently be candidates for second-line treatment.

U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved second-line treatments include docetaxel (a taxane), pemetrexed (a folate antimetabolite), and erlotinib (an epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI]). Gefitinib, another EGFR TKI, currently has limited use in North America and is not available in Europe. These and other new molecular-target-specific agents may maximize therapeutic benefit while minimizing toxicity to normal cells. Overexpression of EGFR is reported to occur in 40%-80% of NSCLC cases, and EGFR mutations are associated with a significantly higher response rate and longer duration of response following treatment with EGFR TKIs.

Another option is antiangiogenesis; the growth and persistence of solid tumors and their metastases are angiogenesis dependent. Antiangiogenic therapies, such as the use of TKIs that block the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, have been developed. In fact, many commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs exhibit antiangiogenic activity.

### Efficacy and safety of first line treatments for patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor mutated, non-small cell lung cancer: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112DKLoY]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

We included published and unpublished phase II/III randomized controlled trials that met the following criteria:

- **Eligibility criteria**:
	- Trials that enrolled patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced (stage III/IV/recurrent) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR activating mutations.
	- Trials that compared two or more different arms of first-line treatments for patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC.
	- Trials that reported on at least one of the following clinical outcome measures:
		- **Progression-free survival**: Defined as the time from randomization to first progression (locoregional or distant) or death.
		- **Overall survival**: Defined as the time from randomization until death from any cause.
		- **Objective response rate**: Defined as the proportion of patients achieving an objective response.
		- **Toxicity**: Regarding adverse events of grade 3 or higher, or specific adverse events defined and graded by the National Cancer Institute's common terminology criteria for adverse events.

- **Exclusion criteria**:
	- Studies not adhering to the inclusion criteria were excluded.
	- Trials reporting results for patients with EGFR mutated NSCLC from a subgroup analysis that was a potential source of uncertain randomization and therefore bias if patients failed to be originally randomized, due to the heterogeneity of patient characteristics.
	- Trials in which EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) were used as maintenance or neoadjuvant treatments, or as sequential treatments with chemotherapy.
	- Trials comparing treatments that have not been approved by any food and drug administration.

All study periods and durations of follow-up were eligible.

### Five-year outcomes with pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy for metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 tumor proportion score ≥ 50 [^113cSiRa]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

- **Study design**: Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 200 mg of intravenous pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks for 35 cycles or investigator's choice of platinum chemotherapy (carboplatin/cisplatin) plus pemetrexed or gemcitabine, or carboplatin plus paclitaxel for 4 to 6 cycles. Pemetrexed was permitted only for patients with nonsquamous tumors and could be administered as maintenance therapy. Random assignment was stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 or 1), histology (squamous or nonsquamous), and region (East Asian or non–East Asian enrollment). Treatment continued for the specified number of cycles until progressive disease (PD; per RECIST v1.1), adverse events (AEs) of unacceptable severity, or patient withdrawal. Patients with PD were permitted to continue study treatment if the investigator determined the patient to be clinically stable and deriving benefit.

	- Patients in the chemotherapy group could cross over to receive pembrolizumab 30 days after the last chemotherapy dose if safety eligibility criteria were met per the study protocol: patients with PD confirmed by blinded, independent central review (BICR) were eligible to cross over before the second interim analysis; after the second interim analysis, investigator-assessed PD was required.

	- Patients were eligible for a second course of pembrolizumab (up to 17 cycles) if PD occurred after completion of 35 cycles of pembrolizumab or after attaining confirmed complete response (CR) with at least 6 months of treatment and an additional two cycles of pembrolizumab after CR.

### Egfr exon 19 deletion is associated with favorable overall survival after first-line gefitinib therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients [^114j9hTi]. American Journal of Clinical Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Exon 19 deletion and L858R mutation in exon 21 of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are both common mutations that predict a good response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the existence of a clinically significant difference in sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors among different EGFR mutation subtypes is still a matter of debate.

The outcome of 60 EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC patients who received first-line gefitinib therapy (250 mg/d) was retrospectively analyzed according to EGFR mutation subtypes. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) after the initiation of gefitinib therapy for all patients were 11 and 26 months, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that patients with exon 19 deletion (n = 28) had significantly longer median PFS (20 vs. 8 months, P = 0.004) and OS (36 vs. 22 months, P = 0.001) compared with those with L858R mutation (n = 25) and uncommon or dual mutations (n = 7). Multivariate analysis revealed that exon 19 deletion (P = 0.007) was an independent prognostic factor of favorable PFS, with an independent association with poor PFS of male sex (P = 0.049). Exon 19 deletion was also independently associated with favorable OS (P < 0.0001), whereas male sex (P = 0.004) and primary metastatic disease (P = 0.032) were independent prognostic factors of poor OS.

The EGFR exon 19 deletion was associated with favorable PFS and OS in patients receiving first-line gefitinib treatment. The EGFR mutation subtype should be considered in the management of NSCLC.

### Updated analysis of KEYNOTE-024: Pembrolizumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50% or greater [^112gHw4K]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

In the randomized, open-label, phase III KEYNOTE-024 study, pembrolizumab significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival (OS) compared with platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a programmed death ligand 1 tumor proportion score of 50% or greater and without EGFR/ALK aberrations. We report an updated OS and tolerability analysis, including analyses adjusting for potential bias introduced by crossover from chemotherapy to pembrolizumab.

Patients were randomly assigned to pembrolizumab 200 mg every 3 weeks (for up to 2 years) or investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy (four to six cycles). Patients assigned to chemotherapy could cross over to pembrolizumab upon meeting eligibility criteria. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival; OS was an important key secondary endpoint. Crossover adjustment analysis was done using the following three methods: the simplified two-stage method, rank-preserving structural failure time, and inverse probability of censoring weighting.

Three hundred five patients were randomly assigned (pembrolizumab, n = 154; chemotherapy, n = 151). At data cutoff (July 10, 2017; median follow-up, 25.2 months), 73 patients in the pembrolizumab arm and 96 in the chemotherapy arm had died. Median OS was 30.0 months (95% CI, 18.3 months to not reached) with pembrolizumab and 14.2 months (95% CI, 9.8 to 19.0 months) with chemotherapy (hazard ratio, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.86).

### Single or combined immune checkpoint inhibitors compared to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer [^115DMuJH]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Low credibility.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have changed the first-line treatment of people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Single-agent pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) is currently the standard of care as monotherapy in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 50%, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy when PD-L1 expression is less than 50%. Atezolizumab (PD-L1 inhibitor) has also been approved in combination with chemotherapy and bevacizumab (an anti-angiogenic antibody) in first-line NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression. The combination of first-line PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies has also been shown to improve survival compared to platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC, particularly in people with high tumour mutational burden (TMB). The association of ipilimumab (an anti-CTLA-4) and nivolumab (PD-1 inhibitor) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in all patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. Although these antibodies are currently used in clinical practice, some questions remain unanswered, such as the best treatment strategy, the role of different biomarkers for treatment selection, and the effectiveness of immunotherapy according to specific clinical characteristics.

### Efficacy and safety of first line treatments for patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor mutated, non-small cell lung cancer: Systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1152fV8E]. BMJ (2019). Low credibility.

The present study had several limitations. Firstly, unavoidable confounding factors remain in this inherently observational network meta-analysis based on data entirely from clinical trials. For example, because most treatments were compared indirectly, and most direct evidence was from one trial in the present network, estimates should be interpreted with care for their reliance on previous distributions and assumptions of transitivity and consistency, even though only randomised controlled trials were included and assumptions were investigated. Additionally, methodological heterogeneity across studies was anticipated in this network meta-analysis. Thus, the same model selection (fixed effects model) was applied in both pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis, obtaining the highest generalisability in the pooled estimates.

Secondly, the present study also had potential publication and selection bias. For example, phase II clinical trials commonly present unclear randomisation sequence generations in small sample sizes. We did not use funnel plots to assess the publication bias and small study effects given the small number of trials included in each comparison. Therefore, sensitivity analysis including only phase III trials was conducted, and relatively robust results were ensured.

Thirdly, data on overall survival might cause heterogeneity when taken as an endpoint to evaluate each individual treatment's realistic effect. This heterogeneity could be possible for two reasons. Although we initially searched for the most updated overall survival…

### Best first-line therapy for people with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status [^117LBEfX]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Most people who are newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have advanced disease. For these individuals, survival is determined by various patient- and tumor-related factors, of which the performance status (PS) is the most important prognostic factor. People with PS 0 or 1 are usually treated with systemic therapies, whereas those with PS 3 or 4 most often receive supportive care. However, treatment for individuals with PS 2 without a targetable mutation remains unclear. Historically, individuals with a PS 2 cancer are frequently excluded from important clinical trials due to poorer outcomes and increased toxicity. We aim to address this knowledge gap, as this group of people represents a significant proportion (20% to 30%) of the total population with newly diagnosed lung cancer.

- **Objectives**: To identify the best first-line therapy for advanced lung cancer in people with performance status 2 without a targetable mutation or with an unknown mutation status.

- **Search methods**: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was 17 June 2022.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared different chemotherapy (with or without angiogenesis inhibitor) or immunotherapy regimens, specifically designed for people with PS 2 only or studies including a subgroup of these individuals.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were overall survival (OS), health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and toxicity/adverse events. Our secondary outcomes were…

### Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy for stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer with mutations beyond EGFR 19del, L858R, and ALK rearrangement [^112sceNG]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy (neoICT) is not currently recommended for patients with stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring oncogenic driver mutations, particularly those sensitizing to tyrosine kinase inhibitors like the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). This study aimed to compare the pathologic response and survival outcomes between neoICT and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (neoChT) in patients with stage II-IIIB NSCLC harboring driver mutations beyond EGFR exon 19 deletion (19del), exon 21 L858R, and ALK rearrangement.

- **Methods**: Patients with stage II-IIIB NSCLC harboring driver mutations (EGFR 20ins/EGFR G719X/KRAS/BRAF/c-MET/HER-2/ROS1/RET/PIK3CA) who underwent neoICT or neoChT followed by curative-intent resection were retrospectively enrolled between November 2019 and August 2023. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate recurrence-free survival (RFS), and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression identified factors influencing survival outcomes after propensity score matching (2:1).

- **Results**: A total of 52 and 24 patients received neoICT and neoChT, respectively. Kirsten rat sarcoma virus (KRAS) mutations were detected in 67.1% (51 of 76) of patients. The major pathologic response (MPR) rates were 53.8% and 4.2%, respectively. NeoICT conferred better RFS than neoChT (2-year RFS rate: 79.5% vs. 49.9%; log-rank P = 0.012). After matching, multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression demonstrated that neoICT was associated with improved RFS compared with neoChT (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14-).

### Therapy for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer with driver alterations: ASCO living guideline, version 2025.1 [^112dhmSc]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for non-small cell lung cancer, specifically in the context of metastatic disease, genotype-driven therapy, and EGFR mutation, the ASCO 2025 guidelines recommend offering osimertinib to patients with exon 19 deletion or exon 21 L858R substitution who develop EGFR T790M resistance alterations in the tumor after first- or second-generation EGFR TKIs.

### Therapy for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer without driver alterations: ASCO living guideline, version 2025.1 [^116UGen6]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

In the context of medical management for non-small cell lung cancer, particularly concerning the management of metastatic disease, first-line therapy for PD-L1 ≥ 50%, the ASCO 2025 guidelines suggest offering nivolumab and ipilimumab to patients with stage IV NSCLC with nonsquamous cell carcinoma or SCC histology and tumor PD-L1 ≥ 50%.

### Pembrolizumab plus concurrent chemoradiation therapy in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, stage III non-small cell lung cancer: The phase 2 KEYNOTE-799 nonrandomized trial [^1114H5Fo]. JAMA Oncology (2021). Low credibility.

Approximately 25% of patients diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) present with tumor stages IIIA to IIIC, a majority of which are unresectable. Until recently, platinum-doublet chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy (cCRT) was the standard of care, with reported 5-year survival rates between 16% and 32%. In 2018, durvalumab, a monoclonal antibody against programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), was approved by the European Medicines Agency for patients with locally advanced, unresectable NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on 1% or greater of tumor cells whose disease did not progress after cCRT, and by the US Food and Drug Administration irrespective of PD-L1 expression.

However, approximately 22% to 30% of patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC who begin cCRT experience disease progression (PD) or toxic effects and are unable to complete the prescribed cCRT. This substantial patient population does not meet the criteria for durvalumab as consolidative therapy. We postulated that administration of anti–programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) therapy and cCRT as initial therapy may provide treatment benefits to a greater proportion of patients with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III NSCLC.

Pembrolizumab, a highly selective humanized monoclonal anti–PD-1 antibody, inhibits the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, promoting T-cell–mediated antitumor activity. Pembrolizumab has demonstrated long-term survival and durable clinical benefit as first-line treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 tumor expression.

### How to integrate current knowledge in selecting patients for first line in NSCLC [^114FBBtv]. Annals of Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80% of all lung cancer and is the leading cause of cancer mortality. The majority of NSCLC patients present with advanced disease at diagnosis. Standard chemotherapy using platinum-containing doublets has reached a therapeutic plateau, with a median survival of approximately one year. The development of more effective strategies in the first-line setting remains challenging. In selected chemotherapy-naïve, advanced, non-squamous patients, the combination of bevacizumab with chemotherapy has shown better outcomes than chemotherapy alone.

The potential benefit of maintenance or sequential treatment after initial platinum-based chemotherapy should be discussed in detail with each patient. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation determination should be carried out in subgroups of patients characterized by a high prevalence of sensitizing mutations. When a mutation is present, first-line treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor may be considered.

A phase I study using an oral ALK inhibitor has produced promising results in NSCLC patients with ALK rearrangements, indicating that ALK represents a new therapeutic target in a molecularly defined subset of NSCLC. Ongoing studies in first-line therapy are focusing on targeted therapies and patient selection.

### Aeneas: A randomized phase III trial of aumolertinib versus gefitinib as first-line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations [^112bcJjz]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are one of the most common oncogenic driver mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Osimertinib, a third-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), was initially approved on the basis of the clinical efficacy demonstrated by the AURA program for the treatment of NSCLC patients with an EGFR T790M mutation and was subsequently approved for first-line treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC and EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations. In the pivotal FLAURA study, treatment with osimertinib resulted in a 54% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death compared with treatment with a first-generation EGFR TKI. However, the toxicities of rash and diarrhea are strongly associated with the inhibition of wild-type EGFR. There is a need for additional third-generation EGFR inhibitors that both offer effective first-line treatment of EGFR-mutant NSCLC and are well-tolerated.

Aumolertinib (proposed international nonproprietary name; formerly almonertinib; HS-10296) is a novel, irreversible, third-generation EGFR TKI developed by Hansoh Pharmaceutical Group Co, Ltd (Shanghai, China). Aumolertinib demonstrated higher selectivity against both EGFR-sensitizing and T790M mutations with less inhibition against wild-type EGFR than osimertinib. In March 2020, aumolertinib was approved in China, on the basis of APOLLO (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier), for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC and an EGFR T790M mutation.

On the basis of the preclinical and promising clinical profile of aumolertinib, further investigation and trials are warranted.

### Association of high tumor mutation burden in non-small cell lung cancers with increased immune infiltration and improved clinical outcomes of PD-L1 blockade across PD-L1 expression levels [^116QBovp]. JAMA Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Data are from the pooled cohort of 1552 patients with non–small cell lung cancer treated with programmed death ligand–1 blockade from the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Stand Up To Cancer/Mark Foundation data sets. HR indicates hazard ratio; NR, not reached.

Previous studies have shown that gradually increasing TMB levels are associated with progressively improving clinical outcomes of ICI across different tumor types, suggesting a more continuous association of TMB with ICI efficacy. We also noted that ORR, PFS, and OS progressively improved along with increasing TMB percentile cutoffs (eFigures 15A, 15B, and 15C in the Supplement). As this gradual improvement in outcomes could be influenced by TMB outliers, we examined the response rate and the HRs for PFS and OS in each TMB decile independently, relative to the lowest decile as reference. Only patients with a TMB at the uppermost percentiles had improved ORR, PFS, and OS after receiving immunotherapy.

### Nivolumab plus chemotherapy in epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer after disease progression on epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors: Final results of CheckMate 722 [^113QznhK]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: Eligible patients were aged 18 years and older with histologically confirmed stage IV reEGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This included mutations such as exon 19 deletion, L858R, T790M, L861Q, exon 20 insertion, G719X, S768I, and others. They exhibited measurable disease per RECIST v1.1 and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0–1. Patients had disease progression on previous first-line or second-generation EGFR TKI therapy and showed no evidence of EGFR T790M mutation, or they had disease progression on first- or second-line osimertinib regardless of EGFR T790M status following a protocol amendment during the enrollment period. Tumor tissue sample availability (either fresh or archival within 6 months before the first dose of the study drug) was required at enrollment; although an optional tumor biopsy was recommended, it was not mandatory at disease progression.

- **Eligibility Criteria**: Patients with EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC after disease progression on first-line, first- or second-generation TKI were eligible only if they also had disease progression on second-line osimertinib. The presence of treated or asymptomatic brain metastases or a history of smoking was allowed. However, patients with known ALK translocations or any previous systemic therapy other than the above-listed EGFR TKIs were excluded from the study.

### The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer consensus statement on optimizing management of EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer: Status in 2016 [^113amJzq]. Journal of Thoracic Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) represent one of the most frequent "actionable" alterations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Typified by high response rates to targeted therapies, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are now established first-line treatment options and have transformed the treatment paradigm for NSCLC. With the recent breakthrough designation and approval of the third-generation EGFR TKI osimertinib, available systemic and local treatment options have expanded, requiring new clinical algorithms that take into account individual patient molecular and clinical profiles.

In this International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer commissioned consensus statement, key pathologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic considerations, such as optimal choice of EGFR TKI and management of brain metastasis, are discussed. In addition, recommendations are made for clinical guidelines and research priorities, such as the role of repeat biopsies and use of circulating free DNA for molecular studies. With the rapid pace of progress in treating EGFR-mutant NSCLC, this statement provides a state-of-the-art review of the contemporary issues in managing this unique subgroup of patients.

### Phase III keynote-789 study of pemetrexed and platinum with or without pembrolizumab for tyrosine kinase inhibitor‒resistant, -mutant, metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer [^1149qzgW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2024). High credibility.

This randomized, double-blind, phase III study was conducted globally across 139 sites in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The study protocol (available online) and amendments were approved by the appropriate ethics body at each site. All patients provided written informed consent before participation. An external data monitoring committee assessed the overall risk-benefit ratio of the trial, safety at periodic intervals, and efficacy at one of the prespecified interim analyses (IAs).

Key eligibility criteria included patients 18 years and older with histologically or cytologically confirmed stage IV nonsquamous NSCLC (per American Joint Committee on Cancer, 8th edition), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1, tumor tissue sample for assessment, adequate organ function, locally assessed and documented DEL19 or L858R EGFR mutation, and investigator-determined radiographic PD per RECIST version 1.1 after EGFR-TKI treatment. Patients whose disease progressed on first-line osimertinib were eligible regardless of T790M mutation status, whereas patients whose disease progressed on erlotinib, afatinib, or gefitinib must have also progressed on osimertinib if T790M mutation was detected. Patients with previously treated, radiologically stable brain metastases were eligible.

Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to pembrolizumab 200 mg or saline placebo once every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles (approximately 2 years). All patients also received pemetrexed.

### Tarceva [^111LLvxM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2018). Low credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Tarceva as monotherapy for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) containing EGFR exon 19 deletions or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutations were demonstrated in Study 1, a randomized, open-label clinical trial conducted in Europe.

One hundred seventy-four White patients were randomized 1:1 to receive erlotinib 150 mg once daily until disease progression (n = 86) or four cycles of a standard platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (n = 88). Standard chemotherapy regimens included cisplatin plus gemcitabine, cisplatin plus docetaxel, carboplatin plus gemcitabine, and carboplatin plus docetaxel. **Main efficacy outcome measure**: Progression-free survival (PFS) as assessed by the investigator.

Randomization was stratified by EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or exon 21 (L858R) substitution) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) (0 vs. 1 vs. 2). **EGFR mutation status**: Screening and enrollment of patients were determined by a clinical trials assay (CTA). Tumor samples from 134 patients (69 from the erlotinib arm and 65 from the chemotherapy arm) were tested retrospectively by the FDA-approved companion diagnostic, cobas® EGFR Mutation Test.

### Pembrolizumab for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer [^117DZW4F]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2015). High credibility.

We assessed the efficacy and safety of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibition with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer enrolled in a phase 1 study. We also sought to define and validate an expression level of the PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) that is associated with the likelihood of clinical benefit.

- **Methods**: We assigned 495 patients receiving pembrolizumab (at a dose of either 2 mg or 10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks or 10 mg per kilogram every 2 weeks) to either a training group (182 patients) or a validation group (313 patients). We assessed PD-L1 expression in tumor samples using immunohistochemical analysis, with results reported as the percentage of neoplastic cells with staining for membranous PD-L1 (proportion score). Response was assessed every 9 weeks by central review.

- **Results**: Common side effects attributed to pembrolizumab included fatigue, pruritus, and decreased appetite, with no clear difference according to dose or schedule. Among all the patients, the objective response rate was 19.4%, and the median duration of response was 12.5 months. The median duration of progression-free survival was 3.7 months, and the median duration of overall survival was 12.0 months. PD-L1 expression in at least 50% of tumor cells was selected as the cutoff from the training group. Among patients with a proportion score of at least 50% in the validation group, the response rate was 45.2%. Among all the patients with a proportion score of at least 50%, the median progression-free survival was 6.3 months; the median overall survival was 12.0 months.

### American Society of Clinical Oncology clinical practice guideline update on chemotherapy for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer [^1135wYNX]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

The purpose of this article is to provide updated recommendations for the treatment of patients with stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer. A literature search identified relevant randomized trials published since 2002. The scope of the guideline was narrowed to chemotherapy and biologic therapy. An Update Committee reviewed the literature and made updated recommendations. A total of 162 publications met the inclusion criteria. Recommendations were based on treatment strategies that improve overall survival. Treatments that improve only progression-free survival prompted scrutiny of toxicity and quality of life.

For first-line therapy in patients with a performance status of 0 or 1, a platinum-based two-drug combination of cytotoxic drugs is recommended. Nonplatinum cytotoxic doublets are acceptable for patients with contraindications to platinum therapy. For patients with a performance status of 2, a single cytotoxic drug is sufficient. Stop first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy at disease progression or after four cycles in patients who are not responding to treatment. Stop two-drug cytotoxic chemotherapy at six cycles even in patients who are responding to therapy.

The first-line use of gefitinib may be recommended for patients with a known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation. For negative or unknown EGFR mutation status, cytotoxic chemotherapy is preferred. Bevacizumab is recommended with carboplatin-paclitaxel, except for patients with certain clinical characteristics. Cetuximab is recommended with cisplatin-vinorelbine for patients with EGFR-positive tumors.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of second-line treatments for advanced non-small cell lung cancer with wild-type or unknown status for epidermal growth factor receptor: A systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113HrkXv]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, we did not distinguish between the different types of data; namely, we considered the 11 trials (11%) only identified through a conference abstract as the same level of evidence as published trials in the quantitative analysis. However, when available, results obtained from the different reports were very similar.

Second, we could not formally assess the assumption of transitivity because, for most treatment comparisons, there are very few trials included. However, we observed small differences in terms of tumor histology and ethnicity, which are unlikely to violate the transitivity assumption. These differences might explain the small inconsistencies found for ObR and PFS. Nevertheless, our subgroup analyses did not reveal any important differences in the relative effects when these populations were analyzed separately (Additional file 1: Appendix Figure S5).

Third, for safety assessment, we focused on the number of SAEs because this allows a reproducible global assessment of severe toxicity. This outcome was actually the most frequently reported (52 of 102 trials, 51%), contrary to the number of grade 3–4 SAEs, which were only reported in 30 trials (29%). Reporting of specific adverse events is very heterogeneous across trials and did not allow the synthesis of evidence for each specific adverse event. Additionally, because of the lack of reporting of the number of SAEs across trials, we could not even infer on the effect of these treatments.

Fourth, providing a broad panorama of all available evidence by considering trials pe.

### Real-world treatment and outcomes for EGFR WT advanced/metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer: Pooled analysis from project LUMINATE-101 [^117Du4aa]. The Oncologist (2025). Low credibility.

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths in North America. In early 2022, 654,620 individuals with a history of lung cancer were recorded in the United States, with a further 238,340 new diagnoses and 127,070 deaths predicted in 2023. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent type of lung cancer, accounting for 84% of cases. Among NSCLC cases, non-squamous histology is the most common, comprising 70%-75% of cases. Most NSCLC cases are advanced or metastatic at diagnosis; an estimated 71% were at such stages in 2020, negatively impacting prognosis. However, recent advances in early diagnosis and targeted therapies have begun to improve patient survival. The 2-year relative survival rate has increased for both men and women with NSCLC, from 32% and 25% in 1975–1976 to 54% and 43% in 2017–2018, respectively.

### AENEAS: A randomized phase III trial of aumolertinib versus gefitinib as first-line therapy for locally advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations [^112vdXdT]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2022). High credibility.

In this article, we describe a randomized, phase III trial assessing aumolertinib as an intervention in the context of first-line treatment of patients with advanced EGFR-mutant NSCLC using gefitinib as an active comparator. First-generation EGFR inhibitors (e.g. gefitinib) were traditionally considered the standard of care for disseminated and EGFR-mutated NSCLC until the approval of osimertinib by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2018 for first-line use, as demonstrated by the FLAURA trial. Subsequently, in December 2020, osimertinib was also approved for use as an adjuvant therapy for resected NSCLC, based on the results of the ADAURA trial.

Inherent to this robust progress is the observation that a longer duration of therapy magnifies the importance of tolerability, toxicity, and the cost of component therapy. Given the approval of only one third-generation EGFR inhibitor, there is a standing need for another highly efficacious and well-tolerated agent to diversify the treatment armamentarium.

### Comprehensive characterization of PD-L1 expression and immunotherapy-related genomic biomarkers in early- versus advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer [^117NHKba]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression is a key biomarker for predicting the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). With the successful application of perioperative immunotherapy, understanding PD-L1-associated clinical and molecular characteristics in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is essential.

- **Methods**: We analyzed 3,185 NSCLC patients undergoing targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). Associations between PD-L1 expression and molecular profiles were compared across early- (I-III) and advanced-stage (IV) cohorts.

- **Results**: In early-stage NSCLC (n = 974), high PD-L1 expression was less common than in advanced-stage patients (lung adenocarcinoma [LUAD]: 7.52% vs. 15.98%, p < 0.001; lung squamous cell carcinoma [LUSC]: 18.33% vs. 20.84%, p = 0.058). For LUAD, high PD-L1 expression was more frequent in older patients, males, and smokers. Additionally, LUSC overall showed a higher rate of high PD-L1 expression than LUAD. In LUAD, early-stage patients had a lower proportion of tumor mutation burden-high (TMB-H) compared to advanced-stage patients (p < 0.001), but no significant difference was observed in LUSC (p = 0.597). Early-stage patients also had a lower proportion of immunotherapy resistance genes than advanced-stage (LUAD: 31.15% vs. 48.50%, p = 0.014; LUSC: 13.64% vs. 45.24%, p = 0.0067). Moreover, among LUAD patients with high PD-L1 expression and all LUSC patients, early-stage patients exhibited more significantly different genetic features compared to advanced-stage patients.

- **Conclusions**:
