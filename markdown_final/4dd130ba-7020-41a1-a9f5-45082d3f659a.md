## Question

ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is a too much invasive procedure? How many complications do occurs?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is "too invasive" and how many complications occur. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "too invasive" means clinically and how VPS compares to alternatives. Then, I should quantify complication rates from high-quality evidence. Next, I will categorize the types of complications and their relative frequencies. After that, I need to consider risk modifiers by age, etiology, and technique. Finally, I will synthesize a balanced conclusion and practical implications for counseling and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and definitions. VPS is the standard CSF diversion procedure for hydrocephalus, involving a burr hole, ventricular catheter, subcutaneous tunneling, and peritoneal catheter placement; alternatives include ETV, ventriculoatrial shunts, and lumboperitoneal shunts, each with distinct risk–benefit profiles and selection criteria [^112ZJgbD] [^111x5ZUs] [^116fD6au] [^112HJsHC]. Hold on, I should verify that "invasiveness" here refers to surgical trauma, infection risk, and lifelong device dependence rather than just incision size, because that frames the discussion appropriately [^1145bwYu] [^112PgWZ5].

> Now, I will examine whether VPS is "too invasive". Wait, let me verify the comparative landscape. Guidelines and comparative reviews indicate VPS and ETV are both acceptable options in children, and in adults with iNPH, VPS, LPS, and VA shunts yield broadly similar symptomatic benefit, suggesting VPS is not inherently "too invasive" when balanced against alternatives and patient-specific anatomy and physiology [^112ZJgbD] [^111pyUYC]. But wait, what if we consider LPS or ETV as "less invasive"? Some series suggest LPS avoids a cranial approach and may have lower infection risk, while ETV avoids a permanent implant; however, LPS has higher early revision rates in some cohorts and ETV is not universally applicable anatomically, so "less invasive" does not automatically mean "better" for all patients [^111WLuRj] [^11744wZr]. I should double-check that contemporary data still support VPS as a reasonable first-line choice in many settings, which it does [^111pyUYC].

> Next, I should review how often complications occur. Let me consider population-level data first. A large California cohort showed a 32% cumulative complication rate at 5 years, with children experiencing higher rates than adults (48% vs 27%), indicating substantial long-term risk but also heterogeneity by age [^112QmGYT]. Hold on, I should verify shorter-term benchmarks too; a UK multicenter study found 30-day and 1-year failure rates of 12.9% and 28.8% for new shunts, respectively, aligning with other multicenter datasets and supporting the notion that roughly one in three shunts requires revision within a few years [^112yfxEc]. I need to check adult-specific series as well; an 8-year adult surveillance study reported 17.2% mechanical dysfunction and 6.1% infection, reinforcing that complications are common though not universal [^113FEmTM].

> I will now categorize the types of complications to be precise. Mechanical failure predominates, including obstruction, disconnection, migration, and valve malfunction, with reported ranges from about 8% up to 64% depending on cohort and definitions, which underscores the device-dependence inherent to VPS [^111gP5GN]. Infection is the second major category, typically ranging from 3% to 12% per operation, with Staphylococcus species predominating and substantial morbidity when present [^111gP5GN]. Let me verify other clinically relevant events: subdural collections or hematomas from overdrainage occur in roughly 6% to 9% in iNPH cohorts, abdominal complications such as pseudocysts or perforation are reported in 1% to 24%, and rare but serious events include intracerebral hemorrhage and seizures, which, while uncommon, can be catastrophic [^111Rxcqk] [^111gP5GN]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought seizures might be as high as 20% to 32% after VPS; hold on, I should verify that estimate, which comes from older or heterogeneous series and is not representative of all modern cohorts, so I will qualify it as variable and context-dependent rather than a typical expectation today [^111gP5GN].

> Let me consider risk modifiers, because complication rates are not uniform. Age is a major determinant: neonates and infants have markedly higher infection and mechanical failure risks than older children or adults, with BASICS trial post hoc analysis showing infection risk several-fold higher in the first year of life and adult age ≥ 65 years conferring lower risk, which I should emphasize for counseling families [^116oBkNK]. Etiology matters too; posthemorrhagic and postinfectious hydrocephalus, as well as prior CSF leak or multiple revisions, increase complication risk, whereas hemorrhage-related adult hydrocephalus may paradoxically have lower reoperation rates, suggesting some transient shunt dependency patterns [^113FEmTM] [^114i2DGU]. I should also confirm that technique and setting influence outcomes: antibiotic-impregnated catheters reduce infection, laparoscopic or image-guided approaches can reduce distal failures in select patients, and adherence to infection-prevention bundles (for example, glove protocols) further lowers infection risk, though effect sizes vary across studies [^116oBkNK] [^112htUYL] [^1121FbLM] [^111qssPf].

> Next, I should review comparative complication profiles to avoid overstating VPS-specific risks. Meta-analyses comparing ETV versus VPS show no consistent difference in failure across randomized data, though prospective cohorts sometimes suggest fewer complications with ETV; this means VPS is not uniquely "high risk" relative to ETV when considering all-cause failure and complications in mixed populations [^11744wZr]. Similarly, VPS and VA shunts have broadly similar revision and infection rates in pooled analyses, and VPS versus LPS in iNPH show comparable efficacy with different complication patterns, reinforcing that "invasiveness" must be weighed against anatomy, surgeon expertise, and patient goals rather than assumed inferiority of VPS [^116fD6au] [^111pyUYC] [^111WLuRj].

> I should now translate this into practical counseling. For a typical patient, I would explain that VPS is effective and often necessary, but device-related complications are common, with roughly 30% requiring revision within 1 to 2 years and a cumulative 30% to 50% complication risk over 5 years, heavily influenced by age and etiology; most complications are manageable, though some require surgery and a minority can be life-threatening if unrecognized [^112yfxEc] [^112QmGYT] [^111gP5GN]. Hold on, I should verify that I am not overgeneralizing; indeed, adults with iNPH often have lower infection rates and programmable valves reduce subdural collections and revisions, so individualized risk estimates should be provided rather than a single number [^111Rxcqk] [^111pyUYC]. I need to ensure families understand red flags for malfunction and the need for urgent evaluation, given the potential for rapid deterioration with shunt failure [^112PgWZ5].

> Finally, I will synthesize the answer. Is VPS "too invasive"? No, not categorically; it is a major neurosurgical procedure with lifelong device dependence and a meaningful but acceptable complication burden when matched to patient anatomy and disease biology, and it remains a first-line therapy alongside ETV in children and among effective options in adults with iNPH [^112ZJgbD] [^111pyUYC]. How many complications occur? Across large cohorts, expect about 30% to 50% cumulative risk of any shunt-related complication over several years, with 10% to 30% requiring revision within 1 to 2 years, approximately 3% to 12% infection risk per operation, and 6% to 9% risk of subdural collections in iNPH, recognizing that age, etiology, and technique can shift these risks substantially in either direction [^112QmGYT] [^112yfxEc] [^111gP5GN] [^111Rxcqk]. I should confirm that these figures align with contemporary series and guidelines, which they do, and emphasize that structured follow-up, infection-prevention protocols, and judicious use of programmable valves can mitigate some risks even if they cannot eliminate them entirely [^111pyUYC] [^116oBkNK].

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement is a **minimally invasive neurosurgical procedure** that uses small incisions and catheter tunneling to divert CSF from the ventricles to the peritoneum, enabling rapid symptom relief and short hospital stays. VPS is generally safe, but **complications are common**, including infection (3–12%), mechanical failure (obstruction, migration, disconnection; 10–20%), and over/underdrainage (5–10%). Most complications are manageable, and modern techniques (laparoscopy, programmable valves, antibiotic-impregnated catheters) have reduced risks; nonetheless, **revision surgery is often needed** [^111pyUYC] [^116oBkNK] [^112htUYL] [^112yfxEc].

---

## Invasiveness of VPS placement

VPS is considered **minimally invasive** because it uses small incisions and catheter tunneling, avoiding large craniotomies or extensive dissection. Keyhole cranial openings and subcutaneous tunneling minimize tissue disruption, and laparoscopic or mini-laparotomy approaches for the peritoneal catheter further reduce invasiveness [^1174cbN6] [^111BkwG9]. Typical hospital stays are short (1–3 days), reflecting the procedure's minimal invasiveness and rapid recovery [^notfound].

---

## Frequency and types of complications

VPS complications are **common but manageable**; they include infectious, mechanical, and functional categories:

| **Complication type** | **Frequency** | **Description** |
|-|-|-|
| Infection | 3–12% | - Shunt infection (meningitis, ventriculitis, peritonitis) <br/> - Risk factors include age, prior surgery, and prolonged operating time [^113FEmTM] [^1132hGqQ] [^116oBkNK] |
| Mechanical failure | 10–20% | - Obstruction <br/> - Migration <br/> - Disconnection <br/> - Valve malfunction [^112mbrSt] [^111J5wpv] [^1113XWZK] |
| Overdrainage/underdrainage | 5–10% | - Subdural hematomas <br/> - Slit ventricle syndrome <br/> - Persistent symptoms [^111Rxcqk] [^116tBy77] |
| Abdominal complications | 1–5% | - Pseudocysts <br/> - Hernias <br/> - Perforation <br/> - Adhesions [^1142eFBo] [^115WQpvp] [^116Zhzi4] [^114bT7sH] |

---

Overall, **complication rates vary** with patient age, etiology, and surgical technique; pediatric patients have higher rates than adults, and modern programmable valves and antibiotic-impregnated catheters have reduced some risks [^116oBkNK] [^111pyUYC].

---

## Risk factors for complications

Several factors **increase complication risk**:

- **Age**: Neonates and infants have higher infection and mechanical failure rates [^116oBkNK].
- **Etiology**: Posthemorrhagic and postinfectious hydrocephalus carry higher risks [^116oBkNK].
- **Surgical factors**: Multiple revisions, prolonged operating time, and non-antibiotic-impregnated catheters increase infection risk [^116oBkNK] [^112xzfZ7] [^113FEmTM].
- **Patient factors**: Obesity, prior abdominal surgery, and immunocompromise elevate complication risk [^1121FbLM].

---

## Management of complications

Most VPS complications are **manageable** with revision surgery, antibiotics, or valve adjustments. Infections generally require shunt removal and antibiotics, mechanical failures often need revision or replacement, and over/underdrainage can be addressed with programmable valve adjustments or surgical revision [^1132hGqQ] [^111Rxcqk] [^111BrWuE]. Early recognition and prompt management are critical to prevent **neurological sequelae** [^112DSQyH] [^116tLnAL].

---

## Advances reducing complications

Recent advances have **reduced VPS complications**:

- **Programmable valves**: Allow noninvasive pressure adjustments, reducing over/underdrainage and revision rates [^111pyUYC].
- **Antibiotic-impregnated catheters**: Significantly reduce infection risk [^116oBkNK].
- **Laparoscopic placement**: Decreases distal failure and operative time, especially in complex abdomens [^112htUYL] [^1121FbLM].
- **Improved imaging**: Enhanced preoperative planning and intraoperative navigation reduce malposition and failure [^notfound].

---

VPS is a **minimally invasive procedure** with meaningful but manageable complication rates. Modern techniques have reduced risks, but **revision surgery remains common**; careful patient selection, adherence to best practices, and vigilant follow-up are essential to optimize outcomes [^111pyUYC] [^116oBkNK].

### Ventriculoatrial shunt versus ventriculoperitoneal shunt: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116fD6au]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is usually the primary choice for cerebrospinal fluid shunting for most neurosurgeons, while ventriculoatrial shunt (VAS) is a second-line procedure because of historical complications. Remarkably, there is no robust evidence claiming the superiority of VPS over VAS. Thus, we aimed to compare both procedures through a meta-analysis.

Methods

Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, the authors systematically searched the literature for articles comparing VAS with VPS. The included articles had to detail one of the following outcomes: revisions, infections, shunt-related mortality, or complications. In addition, the cohort for each shunt model had to encompass more than 4 patients.

Results

Of 1872 articles, 16 met our criteria, involving 4304 patients, with 1619 undergoing VAS and 2685 receiving VPS placement. Analysis of revision surgeries showed no significant difference between VAS and VPS (risk ratio [RR] = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.9–1.34; I2 = 84%, random effects). Regarding infections, the analysis also found no significant difference between the groups (RR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.36–1.25; I2 = 74%, random effects). There was no statistically significant disparity between both methods concerning shunt-related deaths (RR = 2.11, 95% CI: 0.68–6.60; I2 = 56%, random effects). Included studies after 2000 showed no VAS led to cardiopulmonary complications, and only 1 shunt-related death could be identified.

Conclusion

Both methods show no significant differences in procedure revisions, infections, and shunt-related mortality. The literature is outdated, research in adults is lacking, and future randomized studies are crucial to understand the profile of VAS when comparing it with VPS. The final decision on which distal site for cerebrospinal shunting to use should be based on the patient's characteristics and the surgeon's expertise.

### Outcomes of ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery for hydrocephalus in children in low-and middle-income countries: a systematic review [^1128RR4C]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Improving outcomes for pediatric patients with hydrocephalus in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) requires research on ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) complications and outcomes that may be comparable to studies conducted in high-income countries (HICs). The authors aimed to address this gap by conducting a systematic review to analyze VPS complications and outcomes among pediatric patients in LMICs.

Methods

This review adhered to PRISMA guidelines and the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR 2) quality assessment. The authors screened English-language publications on pediatric VPS surgeries in LMICs, excluding studies from HICs and adult populations (> 18 years), using 6 databases: PubMed/Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Global Index Medicus, and Google Scholar. The search was completed on August 31, 2023. Data extraction included patient demographics, diagnosis, management, complications, and outcomes. Descriptive analyses were performed using Google Spreadsheets and R.

Results

A total of 590 studies were included, revealing trends in VPS utilization across 6 continents. Among 25,950 patients, the majority were aged 0–5 years (13,044/15,008, 86.9%), with a slight male predominance (11,043/19,971, 55.3%). Key complications included infections (mainly involving Staphylococcus spp.), shunt failure, and obstruction. Outcomes were reported for 7185 patients, representing 27.7% of the total cohort. Favorable outcomes were observed in 68.1% (4893 patients) and unfavorable outcomes in 13.1% (938 patients), and the overall mortality rate was 18.8% (1354 patients).

Conclusions

This review provides a comprehensive profile of VPS complications and outcomes in pediatric patients in LMICs. Despite a predominance of observational studies, these findings offer critical insights that may inform health policy and practice in LMICs. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies to explore long-term outcomes, develop cost-effective approaches to reduce complications, and foster international collaborations to strengthen global neurosurgical capacity.

### Endoscopic third ventriculostomy versus ventriculoperitoneal shunt in pediatric and adult population: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11744wZr]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Treatment options for hydrocephalus include endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS). Some ambiguity remains regarding indications, safety, and efficacy for these procedures in different clinical scenarios. The objective of the present study was to pool the available evidence to compare outcomes among patients with hydrocephalus undergoing ETV versus VPS. A systematic search of the literature was conducted via PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library through 11/29/2018 to identify studies evaluating failure and complication rates, following ETV or VPS. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using random effects. Heterogeneity was assessed by the Cochrane Q test and the I 2 value. Heterogeneity sources were explored through subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Twenty-three studies (five randomized control trials (RCTs) and 18 observational studies) were meta-analyzed. Comparing ETV to VPS, failure rate was not statistically significantly different with a pooled relative risk (RR) of 1.48, 95%CI (0.85, 2.59) for RCTs and 1.17 (0.89, 1.53) for cohort studies; P-interaction: 0.44. Complication rates were not statistically significantly different between ETV and VPS in RCTs (RR: 1.34, 95%CI: 0.50, 3.59) but were statistically significant for prospective cohort studies (RR: 0.47, 95%CI: 0.30, 0.78); P-interaction: 0.07. Length of hospital stay was no different, when comparing ETV and VPS. These results remained unchanged when stratifying by intervention type and when regressing on age when possible. No significant differences in failure rate were observed between ETV and VPS. ETV was found to have lower complication rates than VPS in prospective cohort studies but not in RCTs. Further research is needed to identify the specific patient populations who may be better suited for one intervention versus another.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunt complications in California: 1990 to 2000 [^112QmGYT]. Neurosurgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Risk factors for ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt complications have not been assessed with population cohort data since the advent of modern surgical techniques. We examined demographic factors and VP shunt complications in a population-based retrospective cohort study of all nonfederal California hospital admissions between 1990 and 2000.

Methods

We identified all admissions in a statewide administrative hospital discharge database that indicated a VP shunt insertion. Repeat hospital admissions within California generating a discharge diagnosis of surgical shunt complication, defined as a shunt replacement, revision, removal, or exploration, represented the primary outcome of interest. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and Cox proportional hazards modeling to analyze sex, age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status based on payer status, and type of hydrocephalus in relation to the risk of shunt complications.

Results

The annual population incidence of VP shunt placement was 5.5 per 100,000. Among 14,455 individuals with 65,040 person-years of follow-up, the cumulative complication rate at 5 years was 32%. Children demonstrated a higher rate of shunt complications than did adults at 5 years (48 versus 27%, P < 0.0001). The following demographic factors were independently associated with increased risk of shunt complications: male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.2), low socioeconomic status (HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1–1.3), and age younger than 19 years (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4–1.7). Compared with communicating hydrocephalus, obstructive hydrocephalus was also associated with increased risk of shunt complications (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.5–1.9).

Conclusion

VP shunt complications are common, especially in children. Further study is needed to explain the associations between demographic factors and elevated shunt complication rates.

### Revision rate of pediatric ventriculoperitoneal shunts after 15 years [^111J5wpv]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Object

Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement remains the mainstay treatment for pediatric hydrocephalus. These devices have a relatively high complication and failure rate, often requiring multiple revisions. The authors present a single institution's experience of pediatric patients treated with VP shunts. With an average follow-up time of 20 years, this study is among the longest reports of VP shunt revision in the literature to date. Hydrocephalus origins, shunt revision rates, and causes of shunt failure are described. Patients who underwent their first shunt revision more than 10 years after initial shunt placement were also explored.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on all pediatric patients who underwent VP shunt placement from January 1990 through November 1996 at the University of Rochester Medical Center. Only patients who had at least 15 years of follow-up since their initial shunting procedure were included.

Results

A total of 234 procedures were performed on 64 patients, with a mean follow-up of 19.9 years. Patients ranged from a few days to 17.2 years old when they received their original shunt, with a median age of 4 months; 84.5% of the patients required 1 or more shunt revisions and 4.7% required 10 or more. Congenital defects, Chiari Type II malformations, tumors, and intraventricular hemorrhage were the most common causes of hydrocephalus. Overall, patients averaged 2.66 revisions, with proximal (27%) and distal (15%) catheter occlusion, disconnection (11%), and infection (9%) comprising the most common reasons for shunt malfunction. Notably, 12.5% of patients did not require their first shunt revision until more than 10 years after initial device placement, a previously undescribed finding due to the short follow-up duration in previous studies.

Conclusions

This long-term retrospective analysis of pediatric VP shunt placement revealed a relatively high rate of complications with need for shunt revision as late as 17 years after initial placement. Catheter occlusion represented a significant percentage of shunt failures. Cerebrospinal fluid shunting has a propensity for mechanical failure and patients with VP shunts should receive follow-up through the transition to adulthood.

### A comparison of ventriculoperitoneal and ventriculoatrial shunts in a population of 544 consecutive pediatric patients [^1145X7KL]. Neurosurgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS) remain the first-line option in most instances of pediatric hydrocephalus, the long-term efficacy of ventriculoatrial shunts (VAS) remains unknown.

Objective

To characterize the long-term outcomes and adverse occurrences associated with both VPS and VAS at our institution.

Methods

The authors retrospectively analyzed all cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunting procedures performed over a 13-yr period at a single institution. A total of 544 pediatric shunt patients were followed for at least 90 d (VPS: 5.9 yr; VAS: 5.3 yr).

Results

A total of 54% of VPS and 60% of VAS required at least 1 revision. VPS demonstrated superior survival overall; however, if electively scheduled VAS lengthening procedures are not considered true "failures", no statistical difference is noted in overall survival (P = 0.08). VPS demonstrated significantly greater survival in patients less than 7 yr of age (P = 0.001), but showed no difference in older children (P = 0.4). VAS had a significantly lower rate of infection (P < .05) and proximal failure (P < .001).

Conclusion

VAS can be a useful alternative to VPS when the abdomen is unsuitable, particularly in older children. Although VPS demonstrates superior overall survival, it should be understood that elective VAS lengthening procedures are often necessary, especially in younger patients. If elective lengthening procedures are not considered true failures, then the devices show similar survival.

### Gastrostomy sequence with ventriculoperitoneal shunting-does It matter? [^112xxTk7]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Neurological injury requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement often necessitates gastrostomy for nutritional support. The sequence of these procedures is debated over concerns for shunt infection and displacement requiring revisional surgery as a consequence of gastrostomy.

Objective

To determine the optimal sequence of VPS shunt and gastrostomy tube placement in adults.

Methods

In an all-payer database, adult patients undergoing gastrostomy and VPS placement were identified within 15 days between January 2010 and October 2021. Patients were categorized as receiving gastrostomy before, on the same day as, or after shunt placement. The primary outcomes of this study were rates of revision and infection. All outcomes were evaluated within 30 months after index shunting.

Results

In total, 3015 patients were identified as undergoing VPS and gastrostomy procedures within 15 days. After a 1:1:1 match, 1080 patient records were analyzed. Revision rates at 30 months were significantly lower among patients who received VPS and gastrostomy procedures on the same day compared with gastrostomy after VPS (odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.39–0.96). In addition, patients who received gastrostomy before VPS compared with those after had lower revision rates (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39–0.96) and infection (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21–0.99). No significant differences were noted in mechanical complication or shunt displacement rates.

Conclusion

Patients requiring VPS and gastrostomy may benefit from undergoing both procedures concurrently or with gastrostomy before VPS placement, secondary to lower revision rates. Patients undergoing gastrostomy before VPS have the added benefit of decreased infection rates.

### Assessing safety and timing of ventriculoperitoneal shunt and gastrostomy tube placement in newborns [^114WwRcZ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt placement (VPS) is a common surgical procedure for treating newborns with hydrocephalus. Due to poor feeding, these patients often require a gastrostomy tube (GT). There is controversy regarding safety and outcomes when patients require a VPS and GT.

Methods

The Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD) was queried from 2016 to 2020 for newborns who underwent VPS placement during newborn hospitalization. Patient characteristics and outcomes were compared between those also requiring GT placement to those undergoing VPS alone. The timing of surgeries was also investigated.

Results

4012 patients met inclusion criteria: 597 patients with VPS + GT placement and 3415 received only a VPS. Those undergoing VPS + GT had an increased proportion of shunt infection (3.2% vs. 1.1%) and mechanical complications (5.4% vs. 0.7%), often necessitating early removal (17% vs. 12%), all p < 0.05. The readmission rate was higher in those with VPS + GT, as were overall shunt complications upon readmission (11% vs. 8%, p = 0026). Regarding the timing of VPS and GT, those undergoing GT before VPS had higher rates of shunt and wound complications in newborn hospitalization, as well as shunt and GT complications upon readmission.

Conclusion

In this nationwide retrospective cohort analysis, placement of gastrostomy tubes during the same hospitalization as ventriculoperitoneal shunts increased shunt complications. In addition, the timing of shunt placement was found to be more favorable before gastrostomy placement. These findings should be considered for patients requiring both procedures.

Type Of Study

Retrospective cohort.

Level Of Evidence

Level III.

### Inferior short-term safety profile of endoscopic third ventriculostomy compared with ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement for idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus: a population-based study [^115yL6q3]. Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

In small series, endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) has been shown to potentially have efficacy similar to that of ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) for idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). Therefore, some clinicians have advocated for ETV to avoid the potential long-term complications associated with VPS. Complication rates for these procedures vary widely based on limited small series data.

Objective

We used a nationwide database that provides a comprehensive investigation of the perioperative safety of ETV for iNPH compared with VPS.

Methods

We identified discharges with the primary diagnosis of iNPH (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code 331.5 [ICD-9]) with ICD-9 primary procedure codes for VPS (02.34) and ETV (02.2) from 2007 to 2010. We analyzed short-term safety outcomes using univariate and hierarchical logistic regression analyses.

Results

There were a total of 652 discharges for ETV for iNPH and 12,845 discharges for VPS for iNPH over the study period. ETV was associated with a significantly higher mortality (3.2% vs 0.5%) and short-term complication (17.9% vs 11.8%) rates than VPS despite similar mean modified comorbidity scores. On multivariate analysis, ETV alone predicted increased mortality and increased length of stay when adjusted for other patient and hospital factors.

Conclusion

This is the first study that robustly assesses the perioperative complications and safety outcomes of ETV for iNPH. Compared with VPS, ETV is associated with higher perioperative mortality and complication rates. This consideration is important to weigh against the potential benefit of ETV: avoiding long-term shunt dependence. Prospective, randomized studies are needed.

### Outcomes of ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion in sub-saharan Africa [^1123LjQc]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Object

Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts in Sub-Saharan Africa are traditionally associated with high complication rates and poor outcomes. The aim of this study was to review one large institutional experience with VP shunts, to evaluate the feasibility of shunt insertion procedures with acceptable long-term outcomes in Africa, and to identify factors correlated with good and/or poor outcomes.

Methods

A retrospective study was conducted by reviewing the charts of all children who underwent primary (93%) or subsequent VP shunt insertions at the Kijabe Hospital between November 2004 and March 2007. Epidemiological data, clinical investigations, etiology of the hydrocephalus, details of the VP shunt insertion, outcome at follow-up, and morbidity and mortality data were collected. Outcomes were graded as good, fair, or poor, according to visual, motor, and seizure criteria.

Results

The authors analyzed 593 VP shunt insertions in 574 patients. The sex distribution was 53% male and 47% female. The mean age at shunt insertion was 8.5 months (range 0–309 months). The commonest etiologies for hydrocephalus were spina bifida (43.4%) and postinfectious (27.7%). Follow-up was available in 76% of children, with a mean follow-up period of 8.9 months (range 2–30.5 months). The median patient age was 3.3 months. The overall shunt function rate at 2 years was 65%, and the complication rate per procedure was 20%, with infection encountered in 9.1% and shunt malfunction in 11%. Complications were significantly related to hydrocephalus etiology and to sex (p = 0.03 and p = 0.01, respectively). Overall outcomes were good in 40.2% and poor in 59.8%. Overall mortality in the group was 7.1%. Younger patients who survived had an overall good outcome (p = 0.0001). Only 10% of patients with a head circumference greater than 60 cm had a good outcome.

Conclusions

Despite limited resources, VP shunt procedures can be carried out in Sub-Saharan Africa with acceptable complication rates and fair long-term outcomes.

### Experience with ventriculoperitoneal and lumboperitoneal shunting for the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a single institution series [^112xzfZ7]. Operative Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

CSF shunting is among the most widely utilized interventions in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) and lumboperitoneal shunting (LPS) are 2 possible treatment modalities.

Objective

To evaluate and compare complications, malfunction, infection, and revision rates associated with VPS compared to LPS.

Methods

Electronic medical records were reviewed to identify baseline and treatment characteristics for patients diagnosed with IIH treated with VPS or LPS.

Results

A total of 163 patients treated with either VPS (74.2%) or LPS (25.8%) were identified. The mean follow-up was 35 mo. Shunt revision was required in 40.9% of patients. There was a nonsignificant higher rate of revision with LPS (52.4%) than VPS (36.4%, P = 0.07). In multivariate analysis, increasing patient age was associated with higher odds of shunt revision (P = 0.04). LPS had higher odds of shunt revision, yet this association was not significant (P = 0.06). Shunt malfunction was the main indication for revision occurring in 32.7%, with a significantly higher rate with LPS than VPS (P = 0.03). In total, 15 patients had shunt infection (9.4% VPS vs 12.2% LPS P = 0.50). The only significant predictor of procedural infection was the increasing number of revisions (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

The incidence of shunt revision was 40.9%, with increasing patient age as the sole predictor of shunt revision. The incidence of shunt malfunction was significantly higher in patients undergoing LPS, while there was no significant difference in the incidence of shunt infection between the 2 modalities.

### Laparoscopic versus open approach for implantation of the peritoneal catheter during ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement [^111BkwG9]. Surgical Endoscopy (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is the mainstay of therapy for hydrocephalus. The aim of this study is to compare outcomes of laparoscopic (LVPS) versus open (OVPS) techniques for placement of distal VPS catheters.

Methods

All patients undergoing new VPS placement at a tertiary care center between January 2004 and August 2007 were included. Univariate analysis was performed. Wilcoxon rank-sum, chi-square, and Fisher's exact tests were used to make comparisons between LVPS and OVPS groups. Stepwise backward logistic regression was performed to predict complications requiring operative intervention. A Kaplan-Meier estimate of the survival function was calculated for shunt survival. All data is presented as median and range unless otherwise specified.

Results

Five hundred thirty-five consecutive patients underwent 579 VPS (258 LVPS, 321 OVPS). Median age (52.0 years) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score (3) were similar in LVPS and OVPS groups. Body mass index (BMI) [27.8 (17.0–64.9) kg/m² versus 25.9 (12.3–44.4) kg/m², p = 0.007], previous operations [0.8 ± 0.9 versus 0.6 ± 0.7, p = 0.004 (mean ± standard deviation)], estimated blood loss (EBL) [20 (0–175) mL versus 25 (0–500) ml, p < 0.001], operating room (OR) time [37.5 (17.0–152.0) min versus 52.0 (20.0–197.0) min, p < 0.001], and length of stay (LOS) [11 (1–77) days versus 14 (1–225) days, p = 0.016] were statistically different between the LVPS and OVPS groups, respectively. LVPS abdominal complication rate of 5.8% and OVPS rate of 6.9% were similar (p = 0.611). Previous abdominal operation [odds ratio (OR) 1.673, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.100–2.543, p = 0.016] and previous VPS (OR 1.929, 95% CI 1.147–3.243, p = 0.016) were significant predictors of complications requiring operative intervention. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated no difference in survival between LVPS and OVPS groups (p = 0.538), with overall shunt survival of 86.4% at 6 months and 83.0% at 1 year.

Conclusions

LVPS is associated with decreased OR time, less blood loss, and shorter LOS with no difference in complication rate when compared OVPS. The laparoscopic approach for VPS is a safe, effective, and readily reproducible alternative to the traditional open approach.

### The effectiveness of various CSF diversion surgeries in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115G8QFz]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is commonly treated using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion procedures, most commonly ventriculoperitoneal (VP) but also lumboperitoneal (LP), ventriculoatrial (VA) shunting, and endoscopic third-ventriculostomy (ETV). Despite the prevalence of these interventions and recent advancements in iNPH diagnostic processes, there is limited up-to-date evidence regarding surgical outcomes.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to analyse the effects of CSF diversion surgeries among iNPH patients. The primary outcome was efficacy of the CSF diversion procedure, defined as symptomatic improvement, and secondary outcomes included surgical complications. Several major databases were searched for original studies from inception up to June 4, 2024, which were evaluated using random-effects meta-analyses, meta-regression, and influence analyses. This study was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42023458526.

Findings

Out of the 1963 studies screened, 54 were included in this review, and 4811 patients were pooled. Overall, more than 74% of patients experienced improvement after surgical treatment (95% CI: 70–78%). VP shunting demonstrated an efficacy of 75% (95% CI 70–79%), VA shunting at 75% (95% CI: 70–80%), and LP shunting at 70% (95% CI: 52–83%). ETV had a success rate of 69% (95% CI: 58–78%). Gait improvement was high at 72% (95% CI: 67–77%), while urinary and cognitive dysfunction each improved in approximately 50% of patients. The efficacy of surgery did not increase between 2005 and 2024 (p = 0.54). Complications occurred in 20.6% of cases, with a surgery revision rate of 15.1%.

Interpretation

This meta-analysis found that the overall efficacy of CSF diversion procedures for iNPH remained unchanged from 2005 to 2024, with 74% of cases showing improvement. No procedure was found to be clearly superior, and only half of the patients saw improvements in urinary and cognitive dysfunction. The stagnant efficacy over time and frequent complications highlight the need for improved patient selection criteria to best identify those most likely to benefit from CSF shunting.

Funding

None for this study.

### Advancing treatment strategies for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review on studies comparing ventricular and lumbo-peritoneal shunts [^112U1PnZ]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Insights from these studies reaffirm the efficacy of shunt surgery in managing iNPH, with both VPS and LPS offering comparable improvements in functional and cognitive outcome. The analysis of the comparative studies included in this review did not show the presence of a standardized protocol for shunt selection, but the decision is mainly based on patient's preferences and the physician's judgment. Overall, although both techniques appear viable and may carry different profiles in terms of outcomes and complications, the current evidence remains inconclusive regarding their relative superiority. This highlights the need for a well-designed and adequately powered randomized controlled trial to directly compare the two approaches and provide clearer guidance for clinical decision-making.

### Acute breast implant periprosthetic cerebrospinal fluid collection after ventriculoperitoneal shunt migration: a case report and review of literature [^112L1RpD]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement is a common neurosurgical procedure with a high rate of distal catheter malfunction. Rarely, the catheter may migrate to other tissues in the body including the breast pockets. There are increasing odds that a patient may undergo both breast augmentation and VPS placement, because breast augmentation is the most common aesthetic surgical procedure. Complications are possible with both surgical procedures. Proximal migration of the distal aspect of a VPS into the breast pocket containing an implant is a rare complication. We hereby present a successful management of VPS migration with implant salvage and culture-directed antibiotics using a careful no touch technique by avoiding breast incision and washout, or percutaneous drainage, and using the existing VPS as an in situ drainage access point for CSF fluid aspiration and culture.

### The durability of endoscopic third ventriculostomy and ventriculoperitoneal shunts in children with hydrocephalus following posterior fossa tumor resection: a systematic review and time-to-failure analysis [^112QQayd]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Up to one-third of patients with a posterior fossa brain tumor (PFBT) will experience persistent hydrocephalus mandating permanent CSF diversion. The optimal hydrocephalus treatment modality is unknown; the authors sought to compare the durability between endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) and ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) therapy in the pediatric population. METHODS The authors conducted a systematic review of articles indexed in PubMed between 1986 and 2016 describing ETV and/or VPS treatment success/failure and time-to-failure rate in patients < 19 years of age with hydrocephalus related to a PFBT. Additionally, the authors conducted a retrospective review of their institutional series of PFBT patients requiring CSF diversion. Patient data from the systematic review and from the institutional series were aggregated and a time-to-failure analysis was performed comparing ETV and VPS using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS A total of 408 patients were included from 12 studies and the authors' institutional series: 284 who underwent ETV and 124 who underwent VPS placement. The analysis included uncontrolled studies with variable method and timing of CSF diversion and were subject to surgeon bias. No significant differences between cohorts were observed with regard to age, sex, tumor grade or histology, metastatic status, or extent of resection. The cumulative failure rate of ETV was 21%, whereas that of VPS surgery was 29% (p = 0.105). The median time to failure was earlier for ETV than for VPS surgery (0.82 [IQR 0.2–1.8] vs 4.7 months [IQR 0.3–5.7], p = 0.03). Initially the ETV survival curve dropped sharply and then stabilized around 2 months. The VPS curve fell gradually but eventually crossed below the ETV curve at 5.7 months. Overall, a significant survival advantage was not demonstrated for one procedure over the other (p = 0.21, log-rank). However, postoperative complications were higher following VPS (31%) than ETV (17%) (p = 0.012). CONCLUSIONS ETV failure occurred sooner than VPS failure, but long-term treatment durability may be higher for ETV. Complications occurred more commonly with VPS than with ETV. Limited clinical conclusions are drawn using this methodology; the optimal treatment for PFBT-related hydrocephalus warrants investigation through prospective studies.

### Laparoscopically assisted ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement: a prospective randomized controlled trial [^112htUYL]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2015). Low credibility.

OBJECT In ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt surgery, laparoscopic assistance can be used for placement of the peritoneal catheter. Until now, the efficacy of laparoscopic shunt placement has been investigated only in retrospective and nonrandomized prospective studies, which have reported decreased distal shunt dysfunction rates in patients undergoing laparascopic placement compared with mini-laparotomy cohorts. In this randomized controlled trial the authors compared rates of shunt failure in patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for peritoneal catheter placement with rates in patients who underwent traditional mini-laparotomy. METHODS One hundred twenty patients scheduled for VP shunt surgery were randomized to laparoscopic surgery or mini-laparotomy for insertion of the peritoneal catheter. The primary endpoint was the rate of overall shunt complication or failure within the first 12 months after surgery. Secondary endpoints were distal shunt failure, overall complication/ failure, duration of surgery and hospitalization, and morbidity. RESULTS The overall shunt complication/failure rate was 15% (9 of 60 cases) in the laparoscopic group and 18.3% (11 of 60 cases) in the mini-laparotomy group (p = 0.404). Patients in the laparoscopic group had no distal shunt failures; in contrast, 5 (8%) of 60 patients in the mini-laparotomy group experienced distal shunt failure (p = 0.029). Intraoperative complications occurred in 2 patients (both in the laparoscopic group), and abdominal pain led to catheter removal in 1 patient per group. Infections occurred in 1 patient in the laparoscopic group and 3 in the mini-laparotomy group. The mean durations of surgery and hospitalization were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS While overall shunt failure rates were similar in the 2 groups, the use of laparoscopic shunt placement significantly reduced the rate of distal shunt failure compared with mini-laparotomy.

### Patterns in neurosurgical adverse events: cerebrospinal fluid shunt surgery [^111gP5GN]. Neurosurgical Focus (2012). Low credibility.

Object

As part of a project to devise evidence-based safety interventions for specialty surgery, the authors sought to review current evidence in CSF shunt surgery concerning the frequency of adverse events in practice, their patterns, and the state of knowledge regarding methods for their reduction. This review may also inform future and ongoing efforts for the advancement of neurosurgical quality.

Methods

The authors performed a PubMed search using search terms "cerebral shunt", "cerebrospinal fluid shunt", "CSF shunt", "ventriculoperitoneal shunt", "cerebral shunt AND complications", "cerebrospinal fluid shunt AND complications", "CSF shunt AND complications", and "ventriculoperitoneal shunt AND complications". Only papers that specifically discussed the relevant complication rates were included. Papers were chosen to be included to maximize the range of rates of occurrence for the adverse events reported.

Results

In this review of the neurosurgery literature, the reported rate of mechanical malfunction ranged from 8% to 64%. The use of programmable valves has increased but remains of unproven benefit even in randomized trials. Infection was the second most common complication, with the rate ranging from 3% to 12% of shunt operations. A meta-analysis that included 17 randomized controlled trials of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis demonstrated a decrease in shunt infection by half (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.36–0.73). Similarly, use of detailed protocols including perioperative antibiotics, skin preparation, and limitation of OR personnel and operative time, among other steps, were shown in uncontrolled studies to decrease shunt infection by more than half. Other adverse events included intraabdominal complications, with a reported incidence of 1% to 24%, intracerebral hemorrhage, reported to occur in 4% of cases, and perioperative epilepsy, with a reported association with shunt procedures ranging from 20% to 32%. Potential management strategies are reported but are largely without formal evaluation.

Conclusions

Surgery for CSF shunt placement or revision is associated with a high complication risk due primarily to mechanical issues and infection. Concerted efforts aimed at large-scale monitoring of neurosurgical complications and consistent quality improvement within these highlighted realms may significantly improve patient outcomes.

### The role of shuntography in diagnosis of mechanic complications after implantation of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a retrospective clinical evaluation [^111wtMBi]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) of the elderly remains an enigmatic disease. Internal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion is established as the standard therapy, but in cases of poor outcome after ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) or secondary deterioration, it can be difficult to differentiate between non-responders and patients with mechanical shunt dysfunction. Thus, every neurosurgeon is familiar with the trade-off between wait and see, non-invasive diagnostics, invasive functional diagnostics, or even revision surgery. Sufficient diversion of CSF is the main task of the VPS in the management of the disease "hydrocephalus". In well-functioning VPS therapies, the clinical symptoms of iNPH such as gait disturbance, short-term memory disorder, and incontinence (Hakim triad), but also headaches and dizziness, are potentially reversible. Several types of shunts are available but those with abdominal lead are implanted most often. Typically, the VPS consists of three components: the proximal catheter (ventricular catheter), shunt valve, and the distal catheter (abdominal drainage tube). All of these segments of the shunt may interfere with the viability of the VPS due to obstruction or disconnection which can lead to a complete failure. As a result, under-drainage of CSF may occur in the case of obstruction with clinical deterioration of gait disturbance or incontinence, or over drainage in disconnection with the leading symptom of headache. Several studies have shown that more than 30% of patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus develop a mechanical complication due to obstruction of the VPS during the first year after shunt implantation. Only half of the newly implanted VPS function adequately during the second year, and less than one third works until the tenth year without revision. Clinical symptoms as well as assessments of internal and external CSF spaces on cranial imaging can signal shunt dysfunctions. However, these signs are not specific for mechanical complications in the course of the VPS therapy. In cases when the cause of a patient's clinical worsening is not evident, functional contrast-enhanced shuntography may be helpful. Mirfakhraee first described contrast medium-assisted shuntography in 1985. However, literature on experiences with shuntography is scant and mainly consists of studies with small case numbers. There are no guidelines for shuntography nor protocols for the procedure or consensus on image interpretation, which severely limits its' clinical validity. This retrospective cohort study aimed to analyze contrast-enhanced shuntography by a quantitative method and to evaluate its' clinical value for decision-making in patients with suspected VPS dysfunction. In addition, this study elaborates on a workflow for indicating, conducting, and interpreting shuntographies.

### The use of laparoscopy in ventriculoperitoneal shunt revisions [^114bT7sH]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPSs) are routinely placed in children with hydrocephalus. However, they often encounter problems, and revisions are frequent. We sought to evaluate our institutional experience with laparoscopic-assisted VPS revisions.

Methods

With institutional review board approval, a retrospective chart review of 17 consecutive patients who underwent 19 laparoscopic-assisted VPS revisions was conducted. Data extracted included patient demographics, indications for laparoscopic-assisted revision, complications, and shunt outcomes.

Results

The median age at revision was 12 years (0.4–20 years). Ten children (58.8%) had 2 or more previous VPS revisions. Indications for laparoscopic revision included adhesive obstruction, broken shunt retrieval, cerebrospinal fluid pseudocyst, diagnostic laparoscopy, and conversion from ventriculoatrial shunt to VPS. Three patients required repeat VPS revision for distal shunt failure, whereas 2 patients required repeat VPS revision for proximal dysfunction. Failures occurred 5 to 258 days after laparoscopic-assisted revision. Median follow-up was 21 weeks (interquartile range, 6–57 weeks). No patients developed abdominal infections postoperatively.

Conclusion

Laparoscopy is useful in select patients with distal VPS failure. Patients with multiple previous revisions, prior abdominal surgery, previous intraperitoneal infections, broken devices, or cerebrospinal fluid pseudocysts may benefit from this approach. Further prospective studies with long-term follow-up are needed to determine which patients benefit most from the laparoscopic-assisted approach.

### Investigation of a valve-agnostic cranial implant for adult hydrocephalus patients requiring ventriculoperitoneal shunting [^115xhCWe]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Currently, the most effective treatment strategy for adults with hydrocephalus involves cerebrospinal fluid diversion by means of a shunt system, most commonly ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS). Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is associated with high complication and/or revision rates, in part due to the high-profile programmable valve designs. Thus, the valve-agnostic cranial implant (VACI) was designed and investigated as a safe and effective method of reducing the valve's high profile and is currently undergoing clinical trials. As such, the objective of this study was to collate preliminary, multi-institutional data of early outcomes using a VACI approach for patients requiring VPS by way of an Institutional Review Board approved registry.

Methods

A total of 25 adult patients across 4 institutions and 6 surgeons underwent VACI placement for VPS based on preoperative evaluation and perceived benefit. Patient demographics, operative details, and preliminary outcomes are presented here.

Results

Valve-agnostic cranial implant placement via a limited size craniectomy at time of shunt revision was performed with no adverse events. Over an average follow-up period of 1 year (394 ± 178 days), 92% of patients experienced no major shunt-related or scalp-related complications. There were 2 cases with a major complication requiring reoperation: 1 shunt tubing extrusion and 1 case of meningitis. The most frequent postsurgical intervention seen in this study was related to adjustment of drainage: a non-invasively performed valve reprogramming after initial shunt placement when proper flow rate is being established. Of the 8 cases of drainage adjustment, all but 1 (88%) were receiving a VPS for the first time, with the exception undergoing a fourth shunt revision. All instances of improper flow were treated non-surgically and remediated effectively via shunt reprogramming in clinic. Removal of the VACI was not indicated in any treatment course. In this way, all complications as they relate to the shunt valve were minor and required nonsurgical intervention, and no complications reported were directly or indirectly caused by using the VACI.

Conclusion

Preliminary findings from this multicenter trial suggest promising outcomes with a low complication rate for patients with hydrocephalus undergoing VACI placement during VPS. Ongoing research will continue to provide a more robust clinical picture of VACI in hydrocephalus management as more data becomes available.

### Laparoscopic placement of distal ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheters [^116yEi4H]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Object

Ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPSs) are commonly placed into the peritoneal cavity via a small laparotomy or blindly by using a split trocar. Larger patients require larger incisions, and placement is made more difficult by previous abdominal operations and obesity. For general surgeons, laparoscopy has become the first-choice approach for abdominal procedures, using 1 or several very small incisions. The authors discuss their pediatric series of patients in whom laparoscopy was used to place distal shunt catheters.

Methods

The authors reviewed the medical records accrued over a 9-year period, noting VPS operations performed using laparoscopy. Complications, morbidity, and alterations of planned management were noted.

Results

One hundred thirty-seven VPS operations in 126 patients were identified, 92 performed by the senior author (M.H.H.) alone and 45 conducted with the assistance of a general surgeon. A second port was placed for lysis of adhesions or retrieval of old catheters in 7 cases. There were no immediate complications. The infection rate was 6.6%, comparable with the institutional norm (6.3%) over an 8-year period. There were 3 early failures due to abdominal malabsorption without infection. Five catheters later broke at the level where they were introduced into the abdomen due to shearing by the abdominal trocar.

Conclusions

Laparoscopic placement of distal VPS catheters is relatively safe and allows insertion via inconspicuous incisions. It can allow for inspection or lysis of adhesions and removal of foreign bodies, help determine if and where the abdomen can absorb shunt fluid, and make VPS surgery in the obese patient easier.

### Neuroimaging of ventriculoperitoneal shunt complications in children [^112mbrSt]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

The ventriculoperitoneal shunt is the mainstay of treatment for hydrocephalus. Despite its widespread use and safety record, it often malfunctions due to complications such as obstruction, breakage, migration and infection. This necessitates a systematic approach to diagnosing the etiology of shunt failure. Any evaluation should begin with an appraisal of the patient's symptoms. In acute malfunction, nausea, vomiting, irritability, seizures, headache, lethargy, coma and stupor are seen. In chronic malfunction, neuropsychological signs, feeding pattern changes, developmental delay, decline in school performance, headaches and increased head size are often seen. The next step in evaluation is a CT scan of the head to evaluate ventricular size. Prior imaging studies should be obtained for comparison; if the ventricles have enlarged over time, shunt malfunction is likely. If there is no such increase or dilation in the first place, other diagnoses are possible. However, "slit ventricle syndrome" should also be considered. When prior imaging is not available, pumping the reservoir, a radionuclide shuntogram, a shunt tap or even surgical exploration are options. The goals of this paper are to provide an algorithm for evaluating shunt malfunction and to illustrate the radiographic findings associated with shunt failure.

### Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: ongoing clinical challenges and future prospects [^111o97zG]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

CSF diversion

CSF diversion by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) and lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS) are the most widely used methods to divert CSF from the ventricle or subarachnoid space to peritoneal space. Ventriculoatrial shunt (VAS) is another alternative method to divert CSF from ventricle to right atrium.

LPS has the advantage of avoiding an intracranial approach, thus decreasing the incidence of surgery-related intracranial complications such as intracranial infection and subdural hemorrhage. However, it can cause cerebellar tonsillar descent leading to iatrogenic Chiari malformation. Other complications of CSF diversion are shunt infection, catheter migration, shunt obstruction, and overdrainage. LPS has a higher complication rate than VPS. Moreover, LPS often requires more revision and greater overall cost than VPS.–

In terms of clinical outcomes, LPS improved headache in 71%–92% of IIH patients who experienced progressive visual loss or were not responsive to medical treatment. However, recurrent headache was usually found during the follow-up period. Visual acuity was improved by LPS in 42%–91% of patients. Visual field and papilledema were also improved after the procedure. VPS and VAS were less studied than LPS in their role of IIH treatment. These procedures are also effective in improving headache and visual function in patients with IIH. Headache was improved in 60%–90% of the patients after the procedure.VPS and VPA effectively improved visual functions and papilledema. Visual acuity improved in 40%–100%, while papilledema resolved in 56%–87% of cases. Image-guidance is recommended for placement of VPS.

A recent case series including five patients with IIH refractory to standard periotoneal therapy reported the role of lumbopleural shunt to divert CSF. The complications of this procedure were pleural effusion, hydrothorax, and pneumothorax. The average survival time of the lumbopleural shunt was 48 months (ranged from 2 to 178 months). However, the clinical improvement of IIH was not reported in this study. Fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous placement of catheter in the perimedullary cistern is reported as an alternative CSF diversion method in two IIH patients with multiple proximal shunt failure.

In conclusion, most of the studies reported similar clinical outcomes (headache, visual function) between LPS and VPS/VAS. However, LPS has a higher shunt revision rate associated with increased shunt obstruction. Table 2 summarizes the studies on the CSF diversion in IIH treatment.

### Practice guideline: idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: response to shunting and predictors of response: report of the guideline development, dissemination, and implementation subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^111kLa9s]. Neurology (2015). Medium credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) shunt and diagnostic procedure risks — Shunting is associated with significant cost and potential morbidity and mortality, with one review reporting a pooled mean shunt complication rate of 38% and an overall combined rate of permanent neurologic deficit and death of 6%. Another publication reported mortality rates between 5% and 15% for the shunting procedure. In the recently reported SINPHONI multicenter trial, 22% of patients implanted with a VP shunt required shunt revisions. The prolonged lumbar drainage diagnostic procedure is associated with a risk of meningitis and death of 1.8%–6.9% and 0.2%, respectively, and several more recent studies describe complication rates of 15% to 28%.

### The survival of reimplanted shunts following externalization: a single-institution cohort study [^111hRobt]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The failure-free survival of ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPSs) following externalization for distal catheter infection or malfunction has not been adequately explored. Conversion to a ventriculoatrial shunt (VAS) may allow earlier reinternalization in lieu of waiting for the peritoneum to be suitable for reimplantation. This option is tempered by historical concerns regarding high rates of VAS failure, and the risks of rare complications are rampant.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, all patients undergoing externalization of a VPS at a single institution between 2005 and 2020 were grouped according to the new distal catheter terminus location at the time of reinternalization (VPS vs VAS). The primary outcomes were failure-free shunt survival and duration of shunt externalization. Secondary outcomes included early (< 6 months) shunt failure.

Results

Among 36 patients, 43 shunt externalization procedures were performed. Shunts were reinternalized as VPSs in 25 cases and VASs in 18 cases. The median failure-free survival was 1002 (interquartile range [IQR] 161–3449) days for VPSs and 1163 (IQR 360–2927) days for VASs. There was no significant difference in shunt survival according to the new distal catheter terminus (log-rank, p = 0.73). Conversion to a VAS was not associated with shorter duration of shunt externalization (Wilcoxon rank-sum, p = 0.64); the median duration was 7 (IQR 5–11) days for VPSs and 8 (IQR 6–15) days for VASs. No rare complications occurred in the VAS group.

Conclusions

Shunt failure-free survival rates following externalization are similar to published survival rates for nonexternalized shunts. There was no significant difference in survival between reinternalized VPSs and VASs. Although the VAS was not associated with a shortened duration of externalization, this finding is confounded by strong institutional preference for the VPS over the VAS. Early conversion to the VAS may be a viable treatment option in light of reassuring modern VAS survival data.

### Systematic review of ventricular peritoneal shunt and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy: a safe combination [^117YCZDm]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Various international and national gastrointestinal guidelines take different positions on whether ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) insertion is a contraindication to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). The objective of this meta-analysis was to try to answer the question of whether VPS insertion is a contraindication to PEG. METHODS A systematic review of the literature was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) criteria. Electronic databases PubMed and Embase were searched using variations of the terms "ventriculo-peritoneal shunt" and "percutaneous (endoscopic) gastrostomy". This search resulted in 70 studies, 9 of which were relevant. These were cross-referenced, and 1 additional study was found, resulting in 10 studies in this systematic review. RESULTS The 10 relevant studies in adult cohorts included 208 patients. All studies save one were retrospective and, in general, poor quality. Among the studies with relevant data, there were 26 (12.5% of 208 cases) VPS infections and 4 (4.4% of 90 cases) VPSs that malfunctioned. In 137 patients the VPS had been placed before the PEG tube, with a VPS infection rate of 4.4%. More VPS infections occurred among the 55 patients who first had a PEG and a subsequent VPS (21.8%) and in the 16 patients who had simultaneous PEG tube and VPS placement (50%). The heterogeneity of the studies in this analysis prohibited statistical comparisons of the timing of VPS and PEG tube placement. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review indicated that VPS placement in combination with a PEG has a high but acceptable VPS complication rate. Therefore, VPS insertion should not be considered a contraindication to the placement of a PEG tube. Preferably, a PEG tube should be placed after the VPS. Waiting 7–10 days between VPS insertion and a PEG seems reasonable, but this could not be corroborated in this review.

### Laparoscopic insertion of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in pediatric patients – A retrospective cohort study [^112JUsuZ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPSs) are the mainstay of treatment of hydrocephalus but have frequent complications including shunt failure and infection. There has been no comparison of laparoscopic versus open primary VPS insertion in children. We hypothesized that laparoscopic VP shunt insertion may improve patient outcomes.

Methods

A prospectively-maintained, externally-validated database of pediatric patients who underwent VPS insertion at a single center between 2012 and 2016 was reviewed. Outcomes including subsequent revisions, shunt infections, operative time, and hospital stay between open and laparoscopic groups were compared.

Results

210 patients underwent VPS insertion - 41 laparoscopically and 169 open. Operative time was longer for laparoscopic insertions. There was no difference in shunt infections, complications or length of stay. There was no difference between overall revisions or in confirmed peritoneal obstructions in the laparoscopic (12%) versus open VPS insertions (5%), p = 0.13.

Conclusions

This first cohort analysis of laparoscopic versus open VPS insertion in pediatric patients indicates no difference in confirmed peritoneal obstructions. With increasing use of laparoscopic placement in some centers, it remains important to elucidate if there is a subset of pediatric patients who might benefit from this technique; possible candidates may be those who are overweight/obese or have had previous intra-abdominal surgery.

### Endoscopic third ventriculostomy versus ventriculoperitoneal shunt for treating pediatric tuberculous meningitis hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1133bVXf]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is advocated as a shunt-free alternative for managing hydrocephalus to mitigate the complications associated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS). However, its efficacy in treating pediatric tuberculous meningitis-related hydrocephalus (TBMH) remains uncertain. The authors' review aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of ETV compared to VPS.

Methods

The authors searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for articles comparing ETV with VPS in the pediatric population. They included studies evaluated success rate, mortality, postprocedural complications, and infections. A random-effects model was used, with heterogeneity assessed with I2 and sensitivity analysis.

Results

A pooled analysis of 369 patients from 5 studies (2 randomized controlled trials and 3 observational studies), including 162 patients who underwent ETV and 207 VPS, revealed no significant difference in the success rates between ETV and VPS for TBMH (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.45–1.14, p = 0.159, I2 = 0%). Furthermore, no significant differences in the postoperative complication (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.08–4.17, p = 0.599, I2 = 75%), mortality (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.23–2.65, p = 0.684, I2 = 0%), or infection (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.09–2.87, I2 = 11%) rates were observed.

Conclusions

The authors' meta-analysis shows no significant differences in success rates, mortality risk, and incidence of complications and infections between ETV and VPS for children with TBMH. However, the broad confidence intervals and limited number of included studies introduce significant uncertainty. Therefore, while no statistically significant differences have been demonstrated, the equivalence of these treatments cannot be conclusively affirmed, and the potential for clinically significant differences remains.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunting after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: analysis of the indications, complications, and outcome with a focus on patients with borderline ventriculomegaly [^113NNMAB]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The goals of this study were to investigate the risk factors, indications, complications, and outcome for patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPSs) after subarachnoid hemorrhage and to define a subgroup eligible for future prospective studies designed to clarify indications for placement of a VPS.

Methods

Clinical characteristics of 236 prospectively evaluated patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage and 6 months of follow-up were analyzed. Hydrocephalus was estimated by the relative bicaudate index (RBCI) measured on computed tomographic scans at the time of shunting. Patients were divided into three groups by ventricle size: Group 1 included 121 patients with small ventricles (RBCI < 1.0), Group 2 included 88 patients with borderline ventricle size (RBCI 1.0–1.4), and Group 3 included 27 patients with markedly enlarged ventricles (RBCI > 1.4).

Results

Initially, 86 patients (36%) underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunting: 19 in Group 1 (16%), 43 in Group 2 (49%), and 24 in Group 3 (90%). Indications for placement of a VPS, risk factors, and outcome differed markedly by group. Four patients (3% of those not initially shunted) developed delayed hydrocephalus requiring a VPS, including one in Group 2 (2%). The 6-month shunt complication rate was 13%. Evaluation of patients in Group 2 indicated that functional status was an important factor in selecting candidates for shunting, and that patients receiving shunts and shunt-free patients demonstrated improvement in functional status during follow-up.

Conclusion

Although we currently use a proactive shunting paradigm for posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, this report demonstrates that a conservative approach to patients with borderline ventricle size (i.e. RBCI of 1.0–1.4) and normal intracranial pressure should be evaluated in a prospective randomized trial.

### The role of shuntography in diagnosis of mechanic complications after implantation of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a retrospective clinical evaluation [^1113XWZK]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Diagnosing a shunt malfunctions is a challenge. The incidences of shunt obstructions after implantations of a VPS increase over time. In contrast to previous studies, the present study identified obstruction of the VPS as a major mechanical complication in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus. Subclinical infections of the CNS and as a result increased protein contents with higher viscosity might be a reason for obstruction of the shunts. Other causes could be material failures such as defective valves and subclinical minor peritoneal inflammations with occlusion of the distal catheter. All the more it was important to establish an elegant, minimally invasive, and safe method for diagnosing shunt dysfunctions in this patient population. In an experienced team of neurosurgeons and radiologists, shuntographies take only about 15 min in clinical practice. The low infection rate and the straight-forward information in cases of obstructed or disconnected VPS profile speak in favor of contrast-enhanced shuntography. The high level of reliability of contrast-enhanced shuntography suggests that this simple method provides clinically reliable information about the patency of shunt systems. Neurosurgical follow-up is essential to determine if and why a patient's clinical condition deteriorates after shunt placement in patients with iNPH. According to the present study in almost every fourth patient a pathological shuntogram with signs of a mechanical complication can be anticipated. This result is of great importance for strict follow-up and management of these patients who always need surgical therapy. So far contrast-enhanced shuntography is standard of care in every neurosurgical clinic. Doctors might avoid to use this method because of their lack of experience. If mechanical shunt dysfunction is suspected, the VPS can be visualized on plain radiographs to exclude disconnections; obstructions can therefore not be detected. The most common consequence of such diagnostics is the replacement of the complete VPS. Shuntography also allows selective visualization of the location of a potential mechanical problem in the path of the VPS. This is a major advantage of this diagnostic procedure, since it is not always necessary to replace an entire VPS system, but only its "defective" part. The present work showed that about 60% of the patients would be exposed to unnecessary revision surgeries and associated complications. Other studies evaluating unnecessarily revised VPS systems do not exist at this time. On average shunt infections occur in up to 8% of cases. Shunt infections are always a definitive reason for revision surgery. However, literature also reports infection rates of up to 12%, especially in combination of shunt exposure and intraoperative functional testing of the shunt in cases of suspected mechanical complications. The latter approach is a widely used method. Contrast-enhanced shuntography however is a simple and effective method with a low-infection rate (2% of cases) to assess the patency of VPS in patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus and suspected mechanical complications. Therefore, it seems advisable to carry out a contrast agent-assisted shuntography before any revision surgery in order to localize mechanical problems more accurately and thus reduce the duration of revision surgeries and postoperative infection rates. In contrast to an alternative method of using radionuclides for shuntography, contrast-enhanced shunt imaging shows better spatial–temporal resolution, allowing focused local surgical revision. In our collective clinical outcome of those patients after revision surgery due to a pathological shuntogram and those patients after conservative therapy due to an inconspicuous shuntogram showed no significant difference. On the one hand, this could be attributed to the relatively small number of cases for sufficient statistical evaluation. On the other hand, surgical elimination of the obstruction in the shunt system is only one side of the coin. Complementary treatment of patients postoperatively (physiotherapy, educational measures, supportive medication) as well as close neurosurgical follow-up is probably just as important and the fundaments during exclusively conservative therapies in patients with persisting or recurrent symptoms after VPS placement.

### Case series of ventriculopleural shunts in adults: a single-center experience [^112husU4]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE The peritoneal cavity is widely used as the destination of choice for cerebrospinal fluid shunts. Various alternative sites have been used, particularly in the presence of certain contraindications. The pleural cavity has been used; however, a paucity of evidence details ventriculopleural (VPL) shunt survival, complication, and revision rates in adults. The aim of this study was to present a single center's experience with VPL shunts, identifying complication, revision, and survival rates. METHODS A single-center, retrospective case series analysis was conducted for VPL shunt insertions and revisions over a period of 5 years. Demographic as well as clinical data were collected. Ventriculopleural shunt survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier curves and the log rank (Cox-Mantel) test. RESULTS Twenty-two VPL shunts were inserted in 19 patients. Median survival of the VPL shunts was 14 months. Pathological indication for the VPL shunt did not significantly affect survival. A total of 10 complications was observed: 2 infections, 2 cases of overdrainage, 2 obstructions, 1 distal catheter retraction, 2 symptomatic pleural effusions, and 1 asymptomatic pleural effusion. CONCLUSIONS Ventriculopleural shunting is a safe and viable second-line procedure for cases in which ventriculoperitoneal shunts are unsuitable. While VPL shunts have a high revision rate, their complication rate is comparable to that of VP shunts. Ventriculopleural shunt survival can be improved by careful patient selection and the implementation of a combination of valves with antisiphon devices.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement following endoscopic third ventriculostomy failure in the treatment of pediatric hydrocephalus [^1179VUfA]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) failure on subsequent risk of ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed to identify pediatric patients receiving ETV followed by a VPS at Oklahoma Children's Hospital between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021. A control group of patients receiving a VPS alone was also gathered. Complication and shunt failure rates were compared between the 2 groups at 12 months postoperatively.

Results

A total of 222 patients were included in this study. The VPS placement after ETV failure (VPSEF) group included 21 patients; 53% were male and 47% were female, with a mean age of 2.2 years and standard deviation of 4.3 years. The etiology of hydrocephalus was chiefly intraventricular hemorrhage (43%) and neural tube defects (19%). At 12 months after VPS placement, the complication rate was 24%, predominantly including infection (19%) or CSF leakage (10%). The VPS-only (VPSO) group included 201 patients; 51% were male and 49% were female, with a mean age of 4.2 years and standard deviation of 6.5 years. The etiology of hydrocephalus was chiefly intraventricular hemorrhage (26%) and neural tube defects (30%). At 12 months postoperatively, the complication rate was 10%, predominantly including infection (6%) or catheter-associated hemorrhage (3%). The difference in complication rates between the VPSEF and VPSO groups was not significant at 12 months postoperatively (p = 0.07); however, on subgroup analysis there was a significantly higher rate of CSF leakage at 12 months in the VPSEF group compared to the VPSO group (p = 0.0371).

Conclusions

There was no difference in overall complication rates for the treatment of pediatric hydrocephalus by VPS following failed ETV compared to VPS placement alone, yet prior ETV may predispose patients to a higher rate of CSF leaks within 12 months of VPS placement. Further study is indicated to determine whether a prior ETV procedure predisposes patients to a higher complication rate on VPS placement.

### Comparison of techniques for ventriculoperitoneal shunting in 523 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage [^111XeeAg]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

It is common practice to use a new contralateral bur hole for ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients with an existing ventriculostomy. At Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Hospital for Neuroscience, the authors have primarily used the ventriculostomy site for the VPS. The purpose of this study was to compare the safety of the 2 techniques in patients with SAH.

Methods

The rates of VPS-related hemorrhage, infection, and proximal revision were compared between the 2 techniques in 523 patients undergoing VPS placement (same site in 464 and contralateral site in 59 patients).

Results

The rate of new VPS-related hemorrhage was significantly higher in the contralateral-site group (1.7%) than in the same-site group (0%; p = 0.006). The rate of VPS infection did not differ between the 2 groups (6.4% for same site vs 5.1% for contralateral site; p = 0.7). In multivariate analysis, higher Hunt and Hess grades (p = 0.05) and open versus endovascular treatment (p = 0.04) predicted shunt infection, but the VPS technique was not a predictive factor (p = 0.9). The rate of proximal shunt revision was 6% in the same-site group versus 8.5% in the contralateralsite group (p = 0.4). In multivariate analysis, open surgery was the only factor predicting proximal VPS revision (p = 0.05).

Conclusions

The results of this study suggest that the use of the ventriculostomy site for VPS placement may be feasible and safe and may not add morbidity (infection or need for revision) compared with the use of a fresh contralateral site. This rapid and simple technique also was associated with a lower risk of shunt-related hemorrhage. While both techniques appear to be feasible and safe, a definitive answer to the question of which technique is superior awaits a higher level of medical evidence.

### Rapid versus gradual weaning of external ventricular drain: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis [^112YydZY]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

External ventricular drain (EVD) insertion is one of the most common emergency procedures in neurosurgery. One of the leading indications for EVD is aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), for which up to 87% of patients require an EVD to treat acute hydrocephalus. In 17% of patients, a permanent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion in terms of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is required in the short or long term after EVD removal. Because of high dysfunction rates of VPS, with a consecutive rate of revision surgery of 23.3% over 8 years, reducing the rate of VPS insertion is of high socioeconomic importance. Once the acute phase is overcome, the EVD should be removed to reduce the risk of infections, and it can be withdrawn in two different ways. Either the EVD is gradually weaned, thereby gently decreasing the amount of CSF delivered, or it is rapidly closed. Whether a rapid or gradual EVD weaning influences the need for VPS insertion has been the focus of research, although no clear consensus exists. The aim of this systematic literature review and meta-analysis was to compare rapid and gradual EVD weaning protocols regarding the rate of VPS insertion, EVD-associated infections, and the length of stay (LOS) in the hospital and the intensive care unit (ICU).

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunt complications in the European idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus multicenter study [^111Rxcqk]. Operative Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VP-shunt) is the standard of treatment for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH). However, a thorough investigation of VP-shunt complications in this population is lacking.

Objective

To present the analysis and the rates of complications progressively occurring during the first year after shunt surgery in the patients with iNPH included in the European multicenter (EU-iNPH) study.

Methods

Patients (n = 142) were prospectively included in the EU-iNPH study by 13 institutions. All patients received a programmable VP-shunt. One hundred fifteen patients completed the 12-mo follow-up. Reexaminations were performed 1, 3, and 12 mo after surgery. Data regarding symptomatic over- or underdrainage, infections, malposition, subdural collections, and shunt surgery were collected and analyzed.

Results

Thirty patients (26%) experienced symptoms due to shunt underdrainage. Symptomatic overdrainage was reported in 10 (9%). Shunt adjustments were made in 43 (37%). Shunt malposition was recognized as the primary cause of shunt malfunction in 8 (7%), while only 1 infection (0.9%) occurred. Subdural hematoma was diagnosed in 7 (6%) and was treated by increasing the opening pressure of the valve in 5 patients. Hygroma was diagnosed in 10 (9%), requiring surgery in 1 patient. Overall, 17 patients (15%) underwent 19 shunt surgeries.

Conclusion

The advances in valve technology, a careful opening pressure setting, and rigorous follow-up allow a significant reduction of complications, which can be usually managed nonsurgically within the first 3 to 6 mo.

### How should we treat long-standing overt ventriculomegaly in adults (LOVA)? A retrospective cohort study [^115WGj2m]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Surgical details

In total, 92.3% were ETVs (n = 84), and 7.7% VPS (n = 7). VPS was selected as first-line treatment in four patients who presented with predominantly NPH symptoms (ataxia, cognitive decline and urinary incontinence, with symptom improvement following lumbar drain procedures), and in three patients with unfavourable anatomy (two atypical ventricular dilatation and one pre-pontine cistern effacement), indicating reduced probability of ETV success. VPS had a significantly higher frequency of surgical complications (42.9% vs 4.8%, p < 0.001) (Fig. 3). In the VPS group, there was one patient with an infected shunt, one patient with a wound and CSF leak, and one patient who developed abdominal sepsis from the operation, requiring an emergency laparotomy. In the ETV group, two patients had wound infections that resolved with antibiotics, one patient developed hospital acquired pneumonia, which resolved after being treated with intravenous antibiotics, and one patient had a CSF leak, requiring an external ventricular drain. Of the complications, none persisted within 30 days or caused mortality — one VP shunt was replaced after a wound leak, the shunt removed, and the infection treated with intrathecal antibiotics via an external ventricular drain.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunt 30-day failure rate: a retrospective international cohort study [^112yfxEc]. Neurosurgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

With the need for transparency of surgical results, 30-day outcome measures have become increasingly important. Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt failure is a substantial burden to patients and health care systems.

Objective

This study introduces the 30-day VP shunt failure rate as a possible barometer of surgical outcome and demonstrates its use in a national (United Kingdom [UK]) study and makes comparison with 2 published randomized, controlled trials (RCT).

Methods

A cohort study of all (except 1) pediatric neurosurgical centers in the UK and Ireland. All new and revision VP shunt operations were recorded for 2008 and 2009. Both newly placed and revised VP shunts were subject to Kaplan-Meier analysis, and 30-day failure rate was obtained. Data from 2 RCTs investigating new VP shunt technology were analyzed, and the 30-day failure rate was extracted for comparative purposes.

Results

The overall 30-day and 1-year failure rates for new shunts were 12.9% and 28.8%, respectively. The 30-day failure rate from 2 RCTs was comparable (14% and 16%, respectively). The failure rate of the subsequent revision of those new shunts was 20.7% at 30 days and 40.4% at 1 year. According to these data, shunt survival appears to be better if performed by a consultant pediatric neurosurgeon for revision surgery only.

Conclusion

VP shunt survival in the UK is comparable to the published multicenter data investigating shunt survival. The 30-day failure rate may represent a better barometer of surgical outcome and should be used as a separate outcome measure in the design of future trials.

### Impact of dual procedures: how combining VP shunt placement for hydrocephalus and myelomeningocele repair in newborns affects complication rates? [^1164iCSw]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

To discern the efficacy of simultaneous versus delayed VPS surgery in managing hydrocephalus linked with MMC repair: The debate over the concurrent or deferred placement of ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS) during myelomeningocele (MMC) repair in hydrocephalic neonates necessitates a nuanced evaluation of associated risks and benefits. While VPS placement can mitigate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and minimize wound dehiscence post-MMC repair, it concurrently introduces potential hazards such as infections and shunt-related malfunctions. This prospective cohort study focused on144 newborns with spinal myelomeningocele and hydrocephalus. Divided into two groups based on the timing of dysraphism repair and VPS placement, 101 children underwent concurrent procedures, while 43 received deferred VPS insertion post-MMC closure. Female patients constituted 60% of the cohort, with lumbar lesions being predominant. The median age for MMC closure was three days. Analysis revealed that the deferred insertion group exhibited higher rates of shunt malfunctions, CSF leaks, and wound dehiscence compared to the concurrent insertion group. Although indications hinted at a potential increase in shunt infections in the immediate insertion group, statistical significance was lacking. The study established a statistically significant association between the timing of shunt insertion during MMC repair and specific outcomes, such as CSF leaks and wound dehiscence. The findings suggest that concurrent shunt insertion during MMC repair may reduce the incidence of these complications compared to deferred insertion. However, no substantial differences emerged in terms of shunt infection and malfunction, emphasizing the persistent challenges associated with these major complications.

### Risk factors for pediatric surgical site infection following neurosurgical procedures for hydrocephalus: a retrospective single-center cohort study [^116tLnAL]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydrocephalus results from a disturbance of the normal pulsatile flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), resulting in its abnormal accumulation within the cerebral ventricles. This can be alleviated in the short term by insertion of a reservoir or external ventricular drain (EVD). Long term, definitive treatment is most commonly accomplished by placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) or by endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) with or without choroid plexus cauterization (CPC). Although the rate of surgical site infections (SSIs) after neurosurgery is generally low, the clinical and financial consequences of SSIs after CSF diversion procedures are substantial. Infections following neurosurgery can lead to significant complications such as seizures, neurological deficits, and malfunction of the shunt device. Therefore, the prevention of infection is a priority for managing these patients, and research over the years has identified modifiable risk factors and interventions. However, infections still persist, and greater effort needs to be directed towards understanding risk factors in order to identify new ways to lower SSI rates. To compare what has been reported with our recent experience, we conducted an observational, retrospective study to identify factors associated with SSIs after CSF diversion procedures in a pediatric cohort in a single institution.

### Endoscopic third ventriculostomy with or without choroid plexus coagulation for myelomeningocele-associated hydrocephalus: systematic review and meta-analysis [^117GCbjS]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

While ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) insertion is the standard treatment for myelomeningocele-associated hydrocephalus (MAH), it can be complicated by infection and shunt malfunction. As such, endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), with or without choroid plexus coagulation (CPC), has been proposed as an alternative. The aim of this review was to determine the success, technical failure, and complication rates of ETV with or without CPC in patients with MAH.

Methods

PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched from inception to June 2020 for case series, cohort studies, or randomized controlled trials reporting success, technical failure, or complication rates. Random-effects analysis was performed to determine the estimates for these outcome measures. Studies were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for quality and risk of bias.

Results

Thirteen studies with a total of 325 patients who underwent either ETV or ETV+CPC were included in the review. Using random-effects modeling, the pooled estimate of the success rate was 56% (95% CI 44%-68%, I2 = 78%), while the technical failure rate was 2% (95% CI 0%-6%, I2 = 32%). The estimate for the success rate had high heterogeneity, due to the type of surgical intervention (ETV vs ETV+CPC, p < 0.001). Random-effects analysis of 9 studies with 117 patients who underwent ETV alone yielded an estimated success rate of 48% (95% CI 0.39–0.57, I2 = 0%), while analysis of 4 studies with 166 patients who underwent ETV+CPC revealed a success rate of 75% (95% CI 67%-82%, I2 = 21%). The estimates for the mild/moderate, severe, and fatal complication rates were 0 (95% CI 0%-4%, I2 = 0%), 2% (95% CI 0%-10%, I2 = 52%), and 0 (95% CI 0%-1%, I2 = 0%), respectively.

Conclusions

ETV+CPC was associated with a higher success rate than ETV alone for MAH in a meta-analysis of published studies. ETV, with or without CPC, was technically feasible and safe for this patient population.

### Thrombosis associated with ventriculoatrial shunts [^1171xrUW]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

History of VAS

Gartner in 1896 suggested that the most physiological way for treating hydrocephalus would involve establishing a connection between the ventricles and the venous or lymphatic systems of the head and neck. VAS became the standard treatment for hydrocephalus since 1952. Three years later, in 1955, Scott proposed the first clinically successful iteration of the VPS and introduced the VAS technique. During the early experience, the initial VPS tubing, made of polyethylene, was plagued by unacceptably high rates of peritonitis and distal failure. By comparison, the VAS was the more attractive option at the time, and most cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts of the period were of this design. However, it was quickly noted that VAS were not without drawbacks over the subsequent years. The favorable intervention lead to notable concerns with the recognition of various range of severe and even life-threatening complications due to the specificity of cardiac placement and systemic drainage. Although all ventricular shunts are susceptible to malfunction due to obstruction, disconnection, and infection, patients with VAS are at risk for different complications than those with other types of shunts, the most unique of which are cardiopulmonary complications, such as atrial thrombi, PE, PH, cor pulmonale. Conversely, the complications associated with VPS are potentially less morbid and are more easily manageable. By the late 1960s, with the advent of silicone tubing, attention again shifted back to the peritoneal cavity as the preferred terminus for CSF reabsorption. Silicone shunt tubing was shown to have a significantly lower rate of distal obstruction and a less frequent peritonitis compared with the original polyethylene catheters. For these reasons, VAS is increasingly being superceded by VPS as the preferred means of CSF diversion by the 1970s. Even so, when VPS are contraindicated or not successful, there is a notable patient population that remains where VAS is needed. In recent decades, advances in surgical technique, radiographic guidances, and shunt design are expected to reduce the risk of shunt-related complications and to improve the prognosis of patients with hydrocephalus, popularizing the VAS method worldwide.

### Diffuse peritoneal dissemination of intracranial pure germinoma via ventriculoperitoneal shunt [^112EbSWh]. Neuroradiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Germinomas are malignant germ cell tumors that commonly arise in the pineal and suprasellar regions of the brain, with a male-to-female ratio of 3–4:1 and peak incidence at 11–15 years. Germinomas are known for their high sensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy, leading to favorable outcomes, with a 10-year survival rate of approximately 90%. Meanwhile, germinomas also have a propensity for cerebrospinal fluid dissemination, with reports indicating a 4.5–10% incidence at the time of diagnosis and a high incidence of hydrocephalus in up to 90% of pineal cases. Ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS) have been commonly used to alleviate hydrocephalus. However, the VPS can potentially serve as a route for peritoneal dissemination of germinomas, and now, endoscopic third ventriculostomy is the recommended therapeutic method with a lower risk of cerebrospinal fluid dissemination. Despite the known risk of peritoneal spread via VPS, the appearance of this complication on abdominal imaging is unknown. Neuroradiologists play a pivotal role in the diagnosis and management of patients with intracranial germinomas and VPS; thus, awareness of the abdominal imaging findings associated with this complication is essential. In this article, we report the imaging findings of diffuse peritoneal dissemination of intracranial pure germinoma via a VPS.

### Success and complication rates of endoscopic third ventriculostomy for tuberculous meningitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114TETU8]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Because ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) insertion for patients with hydrocephalus from tuberculous meningitis (TBM) can be complicated by shunt infection and malfunction, endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) has been proposed as an alternative. The aim of this review was to determine the success, technical failure, and complication rates of ETV in TBM in a meta-analysis and determine which factors are predictive of outcome. The PubMed, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases were searched from inception to April 2020 for case series, cohort studies, or randomized controlled trials reporting success, technical failure, or complication rates. For studies with individual patient data available, logistic regression analysis was done to determine whether age, sex, clinical grade, and type of hydrocephalus on imaging was predictive of outcome. Eight studies with a total of 174 patients were included in the review. Using random-effects modeling, the pooled estimate of success rate was 59% (95% CI 50–68%), with low heterogeneity (I 2 = 30%). The technical failure and complication rates were 5% and 15%, respectively, but these variables had moderate heterogeneity. In 36 patients with individual patient data, a non-communicating type of hydrocephalus on imaging was associated with an odds ratio of 5.90 (95% CI 1.1–32.9, p = 0.043) for success. In summary, ETV for TBM had a pooled success rate of 59%, technical failure rate of 5%, and complication rate of 15%. An imaging finding of non-communicating hydrocephalus was associated with increased success. High-quality randomized, prospective studies using VPS insertion as control are needed to further define the role of ETV in TBM.

### Do ventriculoperitoneal shunts increase complications after laparoscopic gastrostomy in children? [^1165ku1q]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients requiring gastrostomies, ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts are a frequently encountered comorbidity. The objective of this study is to evaluate the postoperative management of children with VP shunts that undergo laparoscopic gastrostomy placement and determine their incidence of complications.

Materials and Methods

Children 18 y old or younger who underwent laparoscopic gastrostomy placement at a freestanding academic children's hospital between January 2014 and October 2016 were reviewed. Data collected included demographics, management, and outcomes. Patients were compared based on their presence of a VP shunt before laparoscopic gastrostomy. Statistical analysis was performed using chi square, Fisher's exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.

Results

We reviewed the medical records of 270 children that underwent laparoscopic gastrostomy placement by 15 pediatric surgeons. Of these, 9% (25) had a previously placed VP shunt. In comparing patients with a VP shunt with those without a VP shunt, there was no significant difference in median age (4 versus 3 y, P = 0.92), gender (48% versus 51% males, P = 0.80), body mass index (15 versus 16, P = 0.69), preoperative diet (48% versus 47% nasogastric tube dependent, P = 0.60), or procedure time (43 versus 42 min, P = 0.37). The postoperative management of these children was similar: day of initiation of postoperative feeds (84% versus 73% on postoperative day #1, P = 0.70), method of initiation of feeds (60% versus 55% continuous, P = 0.25), and type of initial feeds (83% versus 71% Pedialyte, P = 0.24). Similarly, there was no difference in hospital length of stay, return to the emergency department, or postoperative complications within 90 d (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts do not have a higher rate of immediate complications after laparoscopic gastrostomy placement and may be managed similar to other children in the postoperative period.

### The role of shuntography in diagnosis of mechanic complications after implantation of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a retrospective clinical evaluation [^115ctg8n]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Materials and methods

This retrospective cohort study included a total of 49 patients with iNPH who underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunting in an urban center of maximum care between 2000 and 2020. All patients showed secondary clinical worsening suspicious of mechanical complications of the VPS. Clinical symptoms of the patients, change of ventricular width on follow-up cranial imaging, and obstruction or disconnection of the VPS documented by shuntography were analyzed. The need for revision operations or for changes of the valve-pressure settings was also recorded (Fig. 1). Kiefer score was used as a good clinical outcome parameter and was recorded before shuntography and subsequent specific treatment.

### Noninvasive CSF shunt patency evaluation by superb microvascular imaging [^1145bwYu]. Neurosurgical Review (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt implantation is the standard treatment for patients suffering from hydrocephalus, a condition of excess accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricular space. The main reason for hydrocephalus is an obstruction of normal CSF flow, which makes it a serious and life-threatening neurological disorder. First symptoms are heterogeneous and include cognitive decline, incontinence, and reduced vigilance. Subsequently, it can cause severe damage to the brain by increased intracranial pressure and consecutive ischemia.

VP shunt placement is a simple and effective neurosurgical procedure, established in 1960s. The shunt system allows drainage of excess CSF to regulate intracranial pressure by diversion of the fluid in the peritoneal space. Shunt implantation was first performed using thin elastic tubes, which subcutaneously extend to the peritoneal space. Most shunt systems are equipped with a pump reservoir and a valve in order to allow flow control and prevent reflux. Once a patient has a shunt system implanted, he/she usually remains dependent on the system for life.

In case patients with a VP shunt system present with acute symptoms of hydrocephalus in an acute setting, occlusion of the VP shunt system has to be excluded in order to plan further clinical treatment, potentially leading to surgical revision of the VP shunt system. The evaluation of the patient requires high clinical expertise, as acute symptoms are unspecific, including headache and vomiting. Additionally, rapid evaluation is mandatory, as unresolved shunt malfunction can quickly become life-threatening. The diagnosis of shunt obstruction and the localization of the obstruction site are still lacking adequate mechanical instrumentation. Upon hospital admission, patients showing clinical signs of shunt obstruction undergo investigations using ionizing radiation, invasive tests, and open surgical exploration, bearing several risks including the danger of possible brain damage. In the first year following implantation, up to 40% of patients need repeated surgery, and 10% will additionally undergo surgery annually after the first year. Possible reasons for shunt dysfunction include improper shunt placement, disconnection of shunt segments, breakage of the shunt catheter, and infection, component malfunction, and obstruction by accumulation of cellular materials mainly in the ventricular catheter.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunt complications in hydrocephalus patients with intracranial tumors: an analysis of relevant risk factors [^115SpDB3]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

Patients with intracranial tumors are predisposed to persistent hydrocephalus, often requiring a permanent CSF diversion procedure with shunts. This study reviews the long-term experience with ventriculoperitoneal shunts for the management of hydrocephalus in patients with intracranial tumors. Patients with intracranial tumors who underwent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement for hydrocephalus from October 1990 to October 2009 were included in this study. During the 19-year period, medical charts, operative reports, imaging studies, and clinical follow- up evaluations were reviewed and analyzed retrospectively for all patients. A total of 187 intracranial tumor patients with hydrocephalus were included. The median follow up was 391 days. Malignant tumors were present in 40% of the patients. Overall shunt failure was 27.8%. Single shunt revision occurred in 13% of the patients and 14% had multiple shunt revision. Tumor histology, age and a procedure prior to shunt placement (ventriculostomy/Ommaya reservoirs) were significantly associated with the shunt revisions. Shunt system replacement and proximal shunt complication were significantly attributed to multiple shunt revisions. The overall shunt revision within 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 5 years was 17.7%, 18.7%, 19.8% and 24.1%, respectively. The results of the study demonstrate that VP shunting is an effective for the management of hydrocephalus in patients with intracranial tumors. The overall incidence of shunt revision was 27.8%. Age, tumor histology, and a procedure prior to shunt placement (ventriculostomy/Ommaya reservoirs) were significantly associated with the shunt revisions. Additional studies using minimally invasive techniques are being explored for the management of hydrocephalus in patients with intracranial tumors.

### Reducing ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection with intraoperative glove removal [^1132hGqQ]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) insertion is a common neurosurgical procedure and firstline treatment for chronic hydrocephalus. Incidence of VPS infections varies from < 1% to 20%, – with reported mortality rates of 1%–22%.– Many VPS infections are due to skin flora, particularly Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus. VPS infection risk has been associated with male sex, low socioeconomic status, young age (≤ 18 years old), diabetes, previous VPS revision or infection, type of hydrocephalus, myelomeningocele, use of intraoperative single-glove technique, intraoperative duration of VPS insertion, number of surgeons and experience of surgeons performing VPS insertion, and postoperative CSF leak.

Management of VPS infection entails shunt removal and antibiotic treatment, and such infections may lead to shunt failure, prolonged hospitalization, neurological disability, increased hospital cost, and higher mortality. Strategies used to prevent VPS infection include preoperative use of chlorhexidine shampoo, cutaneous antisepsis (eg, use of chlorhexidine or povidone-iodine), rigorous aseptic technique, limiting shunt contact with the patient's skin during insertion, using instruments to handle the shunt intraoperatively, a no-shave policy, hematoma prevention, and laparoscopic VPS placement.

VPS infection risk can be significantly reduced by double gloving for shunt insertion and manipulation. Moreover, removing or changing the outer glove immediately prior to handling the VPS may further reduce infection risk, but the significance and magnitude of this effect has thus far been variable. In this literature review, we have summarized available evidence for surgical personnel to remove or change their outer gloves prior to handling shunt instrumentation.

### Advancing treatment strategies for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review on studies comparing ventricular and lumbo-peritoneal shunts [^114ZjR7m]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

The search algorithm initially retrieved 124 results. After applying predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 6 comparative studies evaluating VPS versus LPS were included in the final analysis. The selection process, detailing reasons for exclusion at each stage, is summarized in the PRISMA 2020 flowchart (Fig. 1). Risk of bias was assessed using the ROBINS-I V2 tool (Fig. 2), and study characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Table 1
Summary of the included studies

LPS lumbo-peritoneal shunt, VPS ventriculoperitoneal shunt, RTC randomized clinical trial, P prospective, R retrospective, iNPH idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus scale, NR Not reported

Qualitative analysis (systematic review)

The selected studies demonstrate that both LPS and VPS are effective surgical treatments for iNPH. However, due to substantial biases and deficiencies in the comparative data, definitive conclusions regarding significant differences in efficacy, complication rates, and overall safety profiles between these procedures are difficult to draw.

In 2016, as part of the SINPHONI-2 trial, Miyajima et al. compared LPS and VPS in iNPH patients by using the iNPH grading scale, which measures the severity of symptoms focusing on gait disturbances, cognitive decline, and urinary incontinence. Both groups demonstrated substantial improvements in iNPH grading scale scores, and significant reductions in Evans' index measuring the reduction in ventricular size. LPS patients showed a 75% improvement rate compared to 77% in the VPS group, with no significant difference in adverse events. An exception was seen in the VPS group, which carried a 1% risk of intraparenchymal hematoma, while no cases were observed in the LPS group.

### Management of sterile abdominal pseudocysts related to ventriculoperitoneal shunts [^1142eFBo]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

There are many known complications associated with CSF shunts. One of the more rare ones is a sterile abdominal pseudocyst due to decreased peritoneal absorption. This study was undertaken to detail the presentation, evaluation, and management of this unusual shunt-related event.

Methods

Patients presenting with ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS)-related sterile abdominal pseudocysts treated at two institutions between 2013 and 2018 were included. Patients who had undergone abdominal surgery or shunt revisions within a 12-month period preceding presentation were excluded. Information was collected regarding clinical characteristics; hospital course, including surgical intervention(s); and any subsequent complications. Special attention was given to the eventual surgery after pseudocyst resolution, including the use of laparoscopy for peritoneal catheter placement, distal shunt conversion (i.e., in the atrium or pleural cavity), endoscopic third ventriculostomy, or shunt removal. The timing and nature of any subsequent shunt failures were also noted.

Results

Twenty-eight patients met the study criteria, with a mean age of 10 years. The most common etiology of hydrocephalus was intraventricular hemorrhage of prematurity. All shunts were externalized at presentation. One shunt was removed without subsequent internalization. Distal catheters were re-internalized back into the peritoneal cavity in 11 patients (laparoscopy was used in 8 cases). Fourteen shunts were converted to a ventriculoatrial shunt (VAS), and two to a ventriculopleural (VPlS). Two VPSs failed due to a recurrent pseudocyst. The total all-cause failure rates at 1 year were as follows: 18% for VPSs and 50% for VASs.

Conclusions

Following treatment of a VPS-related sterile abdominal pseudocyst, laparoscopy-assisted placement of the distal catheter in the peritoneum is a viable and safe option for select patients, compared to a VAS or VPlS.

### The role of shuntography in diagnosis of mechanic complications after implantation of ventriculoperitoneal shunts in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a retrospective clinical evaluation [^111BrWuE]. Neuroradiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Mechanical obstruction of ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) during the first year after shunt implantation is a common complication and is widely described in the literature. In this paper, we evaluated the suitability of the shuntography for the diagnosis of mechanical complications of the VPS in patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH).

Methods

We retrospectively identified 49 patients with pathologic shuntography over of a period of 20 years in our hospital. The percentage of procedure-associated complications was determined.

Results

Ninety-eight percent (n = 48) of the patients who underwent shuntography showed clinical and radiographic signs of underdrainage prior to examination. Shuntography revealed mechanical complications of the VP shunt in 37% (n = 18) as a cause of clinical deterioration and following revision operation. During shuntography, mechanical obstruction was discovered in 78% (n = 14) and disconnection of shunt components in 22% (n = 4). In the obstruction group, in 50% (n = 7) the closure was detected in the ventricular catheter, in 29% (n = 4) in the distal catheter of the VPS, and in 21% (n = 3) in both sides of the VPS. In the case of an inconspicuous shuntography (63%, n = 31), the patients received symptomatic therapy (32%, n = 10) or re-adjustment of the valve setting (68%, n = 21). Fifty-seven percent of the patients who underwent surgical treatment improved clinically by at least one point according to the Kiefer score.

Conclusion

Shuntography can produce valuable clinical information uncovering mechanic complications after implantation VPS in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus. Patients with mechanical complications of their VPS needed revision surgery and showed clinical benefit after treatment.

### Advancing treatment strategies for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review on studies comparing ventricular and lumbo-peritoneal shunts [^111WLuRj]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Mechanical failures and revision rates

Malfunction, including occlusion, disconnection, and valve failure, is a critical concern in shunt surgery. In 2023, a systematic review by Ho et al. showed a significantly lower malfunction rate for LPS (3.99%) compared to VPS (8.31%). This likely reflects the absence of a ventricular catheter in LPS that can clog with choroid plexus or debris and the shorter length of the hardware. Ho et al. showed that across 25 included studies with 3654 patients, LPS was associated with roughly half the odds of mechanical failure compared to VPS.

However, some individual studies have reported higher revision rates with LPS. In the SINPHONI-2 trial, 7% of LPS patients required a shunt revision within 1 year versus only 1% of VPS. The authors supposed a role of the learning curve of the procedure and the need to fine-tune valve pressure settings to avoid under- or over-drainage. Consistently, it has been observed that many LPS revisions occur early, being correlated to incorrect valve pressure or catheter positioning. By comparison, long-term VPS revision rates is between 10–20% in most series. Thus, current evidence suggests no gross difference in long-term shunt survival between the two techniques, although LPS might necessitate more frequent initial adjustments or revisions to optimize function. However, anti-siphon control and newer programmable valves with siphon guards have mitigated this issue.

Factors influencing the choice of the procedure

The limited adoption of LPS in Western countries is probably due to factors such as historical preference, lower risk of displacement, concerns about CSF flow dynamics associated to LPS and surgical complications.

On the other hand, in Eastern countries, the preferable adoption of LPS is a practice dating back to the 1970 s for different reasons. Kazui et al. underlined that LPS should be the preferred option for iNPH given its minimal invasiveness, based on their controlled trial.

Therefore, nowadays the current difference stems from a greater level of experience and expertise in LPS placement in these regions.

However, the international literature supports that some patients' factors represent the main guidance for choosing the preferred procedure. For example, severe lumbar spinal canal stenosis or prior lumbar surgery, represent strong criteria to prefer VPS over LPS. Conversely, for in patients with slit ventricles or with contraindication to cranial surgery, e.g. anticoagulation that cannot be reversed, a LPS is still preferable. Finally, another LPS advantage is the possibility to be performed in local anesthesia in elderly patients.

### Laparoscopic-assisted versus mini-open laparotomy for ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement in the Medicare population [^1121FbLM]. Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Placement of the distal shunt catheter into the peritoneum during ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) surgery can be done with either laparoscopic assistance or laparotomy.

Objective

To compare outcomes in laparoscopic-assisted vs laparotomy for placement of VPS in the Medicare population.

Methods

Patients undergoing VPS placement, between 2004 and 2014, were identified by International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision and Current Procedural Terminology codes in the Medicare database. Demographic data including age, sex, comorbidities, and indications were collected. Six- and twelve-month complication rates were analyzed.

Results

A total of 1966 (3.2%) patients underwent laparoscopic-assisted VPS and 60030 (96.8%) patients underwent nonlaparoscopic-assisted VPS placement. Compared with traditional open VPS placement, the laparoscopic approach was associated with decreased odds of distal revision at 6- and 12-mo postoperatively (6 mo: odds ratio [OR] = 0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.21–0.74; 12 mo: OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.39–0.94). At 6- and 12-mo postoperatively, multivariable regression analysis demonstrated increased odds of distal revision in patients with a body mass index (BMI) > 30 kg/m², history of open abdominal surgery, and history of laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Additionally, history of prior abdominal surgery and BMI > 30 kg/m² were significantly associated with increase odds of shunt infection at 6 and 12-mo, respectively.

Conclusion

In the largest retrospective analysis to date, patients with a history of abdominal surgery and obesity were found to be at increased risk of infection and distal revision after VPS placement. However, the laparoscopic approach for abdominal placement of the distal catheter was associated with reduced rates of distal revision in this population, suggesting an avenue for reducing complications in well-selected patients.

### Slit ventricle syndrome [^116tBy77]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Slit ventricle syndrome (SVS) is a complication after ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) or cystoperitoneal shunt(CPS), mostly due to excessive drainage of cerebrospinal. The disease is most often seen in children and has a complex pathogenesis. Clinical manifestations are mainly intermittent headache, slow refilling of the shunt reservoir, and slit-like ventricles on imaging. Surgery is the main treatment. We present a 22-year-old female patient with a previous 14-year history of CPS. The patient recently presented with typical symptoms but her ventricular morphology was normal. We performed VPS after diagnosis of SVS. After the surgery, the patient's symptoms improved and her condition was stable.

### Superb microvascular ultrasound is a promising non-invasive diagnostic tool to assess a ventriculoperitoneal shunt system function: a feasibility study [^112DSQyH]. Neurosurgical Review (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) dysfunctions represent a true emergency, conceivably terminating lethally. VPS have a high failure rate up to 40% within the first year after initial implantation and up to 98% within the next 10 years. The most common complications are infections and mechanical dysfunction. Symptoms indicating this serious condition oftentimes vary extensively from headache, nausea and emesis to coma and death. Correspondingly, patients may deteriorate rapidly with far-reaching aftermaths. Importantly, 10% of all fatalities in children with implanted VP-shunts are due to a shunt dysfunction. In order to rule out VPS malfunction, multimodal emergency cranial imaging is necessary to evaluate e.g. ventricular size. Plain radiographic shunt series exclude disconnections or malposition and assess the valve setting in case of programmable systems. Elevated intraventricular pressure without ventriculomegaly can be found in long-term VPS patients with long-term inserted VPS leading to a reduced ventricular compliance with no or minimal change of the width of the ventricular system in cranial imaging despite elevated intracranial pressure. This possibility in a rapidly deteriorating symptomatic patient along with the absence of ventriculomegaly calls for explorative surgery and VPS revision. This may cause frustration of patients as well as physicians as revision surgery is associated with an high rate of subsequent VPS dysfunctions and infections. Hence, a strong call for reliable, predominantly non-invasive diagnostic tools has ascended recently. Being on the front burner, ultrasound (US) especially the contemporaneous advanced devices and techniques such as measuring of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), enables to steer coincident trend in diagnostics and treatment. Notably, none of these modern non-invasive methods available is embodied in the current standards of care yet. Using these in a preoperative diagnostic approach, especially as a bundle of non-invasive diagnostic procedures available may substantially expedite already very demanding time-consuming task and thus ameliorate patient outcomes in a real-world setting. Utilizing one of the contemporary advanced US techniques available, the aim of this feasibility study was to measure the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the VPS system using US with a special focus on low velocity flow after compressing the reservoir chamber in asymptomatic patients regardless of the indication of VPS implantation. This technique may spare future surgical explorations when comparing the current value to the patients' baseline.

### Thrombosis associated with ventriculoatrial shunts [^113VDDhY]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment of hydrocephalus

If atrial or pulmonary thromboembolus is found, it is recommended to remove the offending shunt. However, the directly withdrawal of the distal catheter may lead to free the thrombus with risk of PE. In general, the recommendations are to treat catheter-related thrombosis for 3 months with anticoagulation therapy followed by removal of catheter, or to directly remove the catheter by surgery. Removal of the VAS may not be an option in all patients. There have been reports of the use of thrombolytic agents and/or anticoagulation therapy to correct malfunction caused by thrombosis. But those patient are prone to have a recurrence of thrombosis following cessation of therapy. After removal of the catheter, the shunting device should be replaced at an extravascular site, such as ventriculopleural shunts (VPLS), ventriculosinus shunts (VSS), or ventriculovesical shunts (VVS). VPLS is a safe and viable second-line procedure for cases in which VPS are unsuitable. The current research results show that the complication rate of VPLS is comparable to that of VPS. The revision, infection, and survival rates between VAS and VPLS are similar, but it is free of the life-threatening cardiovascular complications. However, VPLS may be not useful in infants owing to fear of complications such as tension hydrothorax and pneumothorax. When the peritoneal and pleural cavity are impossible, the venous sinuses may be considered. Venous sinuses are the physiological drainage site. VSS have several advantages over the classic VPS and VAS. First, overdrainage is prevented by maintaining a natural, self-regulating antisiphon effect of the internal jugular vein. Second, shunting the ventricles to a cranial sinus would avoid the flow problems since both are intracranial structures with minimal alteration of pressure gradient with posture and activity. Thirdly, the shunt system is shorter in length and confined to the skull, which minimizes the risk of mechanical failure and infection. Regarding immediate and early complications, no venous sinus thrombosis has been reported in patients with placement of the VSS, but follow-up period was too short in the majority of patients to make a valid comment on delayed complications with this type of shunts. Another possible option is VVS. Vesical shunting of CSF was first described in the management of hydrocephalus by Charles in 1980. Later studies have shown that VVS may be considered for the treatment of patients with hydrocephalus who are not candidates for a VPS or VAS. When the above shunt placement is not possible and a low CSF output is known, CSF diversion to the gall bladder may be an acceptable alternative.

### Risk of early failure of VP shunts implanted for hydrocephalus after craniotomies for brain tumors in adults [^116MJSey]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Craniotomies for removal of brain tumors form the core treatment of these potentially deadly diseases and have been proven to prolong life and improve quality of life and overall survival. Nonetheless, infections, bleeding, surgical morbidity/mortality including neurological sequelae, and CSF disturbances are potential risks of surgery.

Hydrocephalus has been extensively studied with abundant evidence for its treatment with procedures such as external ventricular drainage (EVD), endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), and ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts. Although the main objective of treating hydrocephalus with VP shunts is to establish a permanent CSF diversion, achieving maximum VP shunt survival, defined as time from implantation to its malfunction, still remains challenging. Numerous studies have been published on postoperative shunting and shunt-survival rates with respect to the pediatric population, hemorrhage-related hydrocephalus, infections, shunting related to specific tumor types, and vascular brain malformations. However, studies on shunt-survival rates and risks leading to shunt failure with respect to brain tumors remain scarce.

In this study, we wished to determine timing of VP shunting and its longevity, and also to determine the risk of early shunt failure (within 90 days) implanted due to hydrocephalus after craniotomies for brain tumors in adults.

### One-year outcome in patients with idiopathic normal-pressure hydrocephalus: comparison of lumboperitoneal shunt to ventriculoperitoneal shunt [^112HJsHC]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is treated with cerebrospinal fluid shunting, and implantation of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is the current standard treatment. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of VPSs and lumboperitoneal shunts (LPSs) for patients with iNPH. METHODS The authors conducted a prospective multicenter study of LPS use for patients with iNPH. Eighty-three patients with iNPH (age 60 to 85 years) who presented with ventriculomegaly and high-convexity and medial subarachnoid space tightness on MR images were recruited from 20 neurological or neurosurgical centers in Japan between March 1, 2010, and October 19, 2011. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 1 year after surgery, and the secondary outcome included scores on the iNPH grading scale (iNPHGS). A previously conducted VPS cohort study with the same inclusion criteria and primary and secondary end points was used as a historical control. RESULTS The proportion of patients who achieved a favorable outcome (i.e., improvement of at least 1 point in their mRS score) was 63% (95% CI 51%-73%) and was comparable to values reported with VPS implantation (69%, 95% CI 59%-78%). Using the iNPHGS, the 1-year improvement rate was 75% (95% CI 64%-84%) and was comparable to the rate found in the VPS study (77%, 95% CI 68%-84%). The proportion of patients experiencing serious adverse events (SAEs) and non-SAEs did not differ significantly between the groups at 1 year after surgery (SAEs: 19 [22%] of 87 LPS patients vs 15 [15%] of 100 VPS patients, p = 0.226; non-SAEs: 24 [27.6%] LPS patients vs 20 [20%] VPS patients, p = 0.223). However, shunt revisions were more common in LPS-treated patients than in VPS-treated patients (6 [7%] vs 1 [1%]). CONCLUSIONS The efficacy and safety rates for LPSs with programmable valves are comparable to those for VPSs for the treatment of patients with iNPH. Despite the relatively high shunt failure rate, an LPS can be the treatment of choice because of its minimal invasiveness and avoidance of brain injury.

### Comparing ventriculoatrial and ventriculopleural shunts in pediatric hydrocephalus: a hydrocephalus clinical research network study [^115ssDa9]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

When the peritoneal cavity cannot serve as the distal shunt terminus, nonperitoneal shunts, typically terminating in the atrium or pleural space, are used. The comparative effectiveness of these two terminus options has not been evaluated. The authors directly compared shunt survival and complication rates for ventriculoatrial (VA) and ventriculopleural (VPl) shunts in a pediatric cohort.

Methods

The Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network Core Data Project was used to identify children ≤ 18 years of age who underwent either VA or VPl shunt insertion. The primary outcome was time to shunt failure. Secondary outcomes included distal site complications and frequency of shunt failure at 6, 12, and 24 months.

Results

The search criteria yielded 416 children from 14 centers with either a VA (n = 318) or VPl (n = 98) shunt, including those converted from ventriculoperitoneal shunts. Children with VA shunts had a lower median age at insertion (6.1 years vs 12.4 years, p < 0.001). Among those children with VA shunts, a hydrocephalus etiology of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) secondary to prematurity comprised a higher proportion (47.0% vs 31.2%) and myelomeningocele comprised a lower proportion (17.8% vs 27.3%) (p = 0.024) compared with those with VPl shunts. At 24 months, there was a higher cumulative number of revisions for VA shunts (48.6% vs 38.9%, p = 0.038). When stratified by patient age at shunt insertion, VA shunts in children < 6 years had the lowest shunt survival rate (p < 0.001, log-rank test). After controlling for age and etiology, multivariable analysis did not find that shunt type (VA vs VPl) was predictive of time to shunt failure. No differences were found in the cumulative frequency of complications (VA 6.0% vs VPl 9.2%, p = 0.257), but there was a higher rate of pneumothorax in the VPl cohort (3.1% vs 0%, p = 0.013).

Conclusions

Shunt survival was similar between VA and VPl shunts, although VA shunts are used more often, particularly in younger patients. Children < 6 years with VA shunts appeared to have the shortest shunt survival, which may be a result of the VA group having more cases of IVH secondary to prematurity; however, when age and etiology were included in a multivariable model, shunt location (atrium vs pleural space) was not associated with time to failure. The baseline differences between children treated with a VA versus a VPl shunt likely explain current practice patterns.

### Infant hydrocephalus in sub-saharan Africa: the reality on the Tanzanian side of the lake [^114jCKFN]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Infant hydrocephalus is estimated to affect more than 100,000 new infants each year in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Bugando Medical Centre (BMC), a government-funded and patient cost-shared referral center, serves over 13 million people in the Lake and Western regions of Tanzania. The goals of this study were to characterize the infant population affected by hydrocephalus who presented to BMC and were treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) to determine the rate of early complications associated with this surgical procedure and to assess its potential risk factors. METHODS Data were prospectively collected from all patients less than 1 year of age who, over a period of 7 months, were diagnosed with hydrocephalus and admitted to BMC for insertion of a primary VPS. Demographic data, maternal history, preoperative studies, surgical procedure, and surgical complications developing by the time of the first follow-up visit were analyzed. Risk factors associated with the surgical complications were determined. RESULTS During the 7-month study period, 125 infants eligible for the study were included in the analysis. Overall, 75% were younger than 6 months of age, and 56% were males. Only 7% of mothers had a gestational ultrasound, 98% did not receive preconception folic acid, and 25% delivered their child at home. In most patients with hydrocephalus the etiology was uncertain (56%), and other patients had postinfectious (22.4%) or myelomeningocele-associated (16%) hydrocephalus. Patients' mean head circumference on admission was 51.4 ± 6.3 cm. Their median age at shunt surgery was 137 days, and 22.4% of the patients were operated on without having undergone radiological assessment. The majority of shunts were placed in a right parietooccipital location. Thirteen patients had undergone a previous intraventricular endoscopic procedure. Overall, at least one surgical complication was found in 33.6% of patients up to the first follow-up assessment (median follow-up time of 70 days); shunt infection was the most common complication. The postoperative mortality rate was 9%. The risk factors associated with early surgical complications were tumor-related etiology, larger head circumference, and postoperative hospital stays of greater duration. CONCLUSIONS In a region of the continent where most infant hydrocephalus cases had an uncertain etiology, most patients presented to the hospital in a late stage, with no prenatal diagnosis and with large head circumferences. Standard preoperative investigations were not uniformly performed, and the surgical complications, led by VPS infection, were disturbingly high. Younger patient age, previous endoscopic procedure, surgeon involved, and cranial location of the VPS had no statistical relation to the surgical complications. This study shows that the positive results previously reported by SSA mission hospitals, subspecialized in pediatric neurosurgery, are still not generalizable to every hospital in East Africa. To improve maternal and neonatal care in the Lake region of Tanzania, the development of a fluxogram to determine hydrocephalus etiology, a strict perioperative protocol for VPS insertion, and an increase in the number of endoscopic procedures are recommended to BMC.

### Shunt failure clusters: an analysis of multiple, frequent shunt failures [^114MHhfz]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Repeated failure of ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPSs) is a problem familiar to pediatric neurosurgeons and patients. While there have been many studies to determine what factors are associated with the first shunt failure, studies of subsequent failures are much less common. The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence and associated risk factors of clustered shunt failures (defined as 3 or more VPS operations within 3 months).

Methods

The authors reviewed prospectively collected records from all patients who underwent VPS surgery from 2008 to 2017 at their institution and included only those children who had received all of their hydrocephalus care at that institution. Demographics, etiology of hydrocephalus, history of endoscopic third ventriculostomy or temporizing procedure, initial valve type, age at shunt placement, and other factors were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to test for the association of each variable with a history of shunt failure cluster.

Results

Of the 465 included children, 28 (6.0%) had experienced at least one cluster of shunt failures. Among time-independent variables, etiology of hydrocephalus (OR 0.27 for non-intraventricular hemorrhage [IVH], nonmyelomeningocele, nonaqueductal stenosis etiology vs IVH, 95% CI 0.11–0.65; p = 0.003), younger gestational age at birth (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85–0.97; p = 0.003), history of a temporizing procedure (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.12–6.85; p = 0.028), and smaller head circumference at time of initial shunt placement (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84–0.99; p = 0.044) showed significant association with shunt failure cluster on univariate analysis. None of these variables maintained significance in a multivariate model. Among children with a history of a shunt failure cluster, 21 (75%) had a shunt infection either prior to or during the shunt failure cluster. A comparison of the infecting organism between these children and 62 children with a history of infection but without a shunt failure cluster showed an association of cluster with gram-negative rod species.

Conclusions

Six percent of children in this institutional sample had at least one shunt failure cluster. These children accounted for 30% of the total shunt revisions in the sample. Shunt infection is an important factor associated with shunt failure cluster. Children with a history of prematurity and IVH may have a higher risk for failure cluster.

### Advancing treatment strategies for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review on studies comparing ventricular and lumbo-peritoneal shunts [^111sarUA]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Complications

Although overall complication rates were low, they varied significantly across studies. Miyajima et al. (2016) reported a higher rate of shunt revisions in the LPS group (7%) compared to the VPS group (1%), possibly reflecting intrinsic differences in device durability or function. On the other hand, the unnecessary ventriculostomy in LPS patients determined a lower incidence of hemorrhagic complications.

In agreement, Xie et al. (2021) stressed the higher safety profile of LPS by comparing the risk intracranial hemorrhage and tube blockages between the two groups.

A recent meta-analysis found intracranial hemorrhages were twice as common with VPS (5% vs 2.4% with LPS). Seizures were also more frequent after VPS (~ 2.6% vs 0.2%). Moreover, any shunt over-draining CSF can cause chronic subdural fluid collections or hematomas; this occurred more often in VPS patients in some series, likely because siphoning effects are greater when the ventricular catheter is elevated above the abdomen. In contrast, an LPS inlet and outlet lie roughly at the same horizontal plane when upright, minimizing siphon-driven over-drainage.

However, it is important that newer programmable valves and anti-siphon devices have markedly reduced this problem. In fact, Miyajima et al. reported that with modern programmable valves, the overall serious and non-serious adverse event rates for LPS were statistically no different than for VPS at 1 year (22% vs 15% for serious events, p = 0.23).

The infection risk may even be lower with LPS, as a shorter hardware is placed. Pooled data show shunt infections in only 1.5% of LPS cases versus 5% with VPS (OR ≈0.3, p < 0.0001) [Ho]. Distal complications like peritoneal catheter infections or abdominal pseudocysts appear instead comparable between the two shunts. Finally, LPS avoids direct brain injury, thus eliminating the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, seizures, and central nervous system infections.

However, both shunt types share common general risks such as catheter migration, occlusion, infection and abdominal complications.

### Evaluation of hydrocephalus and other cerebrospinal fluid disorders with MRI: an update [^113xpATa]. Insights Into Imaging (2014). Low credibility.

Evaluation of treatment procedures (third ventricle integrity, patency of ventriculostomy and ventriculo-peritoneal shunt)

Although the causes of hydrocephalus vary in a wide range, treatment procedures are basically alike (ventriculostomy or ventriculo-peritoneal shunt). It is still debated which group of patients would benefit more from which treatment. Today, mainly two methods are used in the treatment of hydrocephalus. The first one is the ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) including treatment with catheters that are placed proximal to the obstruction to take out excess CSF. Mortality, morbidity and complication rates are high for VPS and 50% of patients face various problems within 2 years. Thus, shunt revision is generally required for most of the patients. The second one [endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV)] is described as entering into the brain with an endoscopic procedure and opening a new drainage pathway that bypasses the obstruction inside of the brain. ETV is a more physiological treatment than VPS. The most important complication with this method is bleeding due to injury to the basilar artery or one of its branches that courses near the surgery site, and this may lead to death.

The CSF diversion procedures explained above are carried out according to previously determined anatomic landmarks without visualising the whole brain and intracranial structures. In some of the patients with hydrocephalus, deformation and displacement or asymmetric enlargement of ventricles can be seen, increasing the failure and complication rates in these procedures. This makes preoperative evaluation critical in patients who will undergo ETV and VPS procedures (especially ETV). The preoperative ETV evaluation should include detailed assessment of landmarks that the endoscope will pass through such as the ventricular system, integrity of the third ventricle, patency of the Liliequist membrane, and positions of basilar artery-mammillary bodies and basal cisterns. In the presence of spontaneous third ventriculostomy (STV), ETV is unnecessary. Therefore, it should be investigated in the preoperative period. T2W 3D-SPACE with the VFAM technique is usually sufficient for the preoperative evaluation.

### Just stick a scope in: laparoscopic ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement in the pediatric reoperative abdomen [^1112WBkY]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement into the reoperative abdomen can be challenging due to intraperitoneal adhesions. Laparoscopic guidance may provide safe abdominal access and identify an area for optimal cerebrospinal fluid drainage. The study aim was to compare laparoscopic-assisted VPS placement to an "open" approach in patients with prior abdominal surgery.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective review was performed of children undergoing VPS placement into a reoperative abdomen from 2009–2019. Clinical data were collected, and patients undergoing laparoscopy (LAP) were compared to those undergoing an open approach (OPEN).

Results

A total of 120 children underwent 169 VPS placements at a median age of 8 y (IQR 2–15 y), and a mean number of two prior abdominal operations (IQR 1–2). Laparoscopy was used in 24% of cases. Shunt-related complications within 30 d were lower in the LAP group (0% versus 19%, P = 0.001), as were VPS-related postoperative emergency department visits (0% versus 13%, P = 0.003) and readmissions (0% versus 13%, P = 0.013). Shunt malfunction rates were higher (42% OPEN versus 25% LAP, P = 0.03) and occurred sooner in the OPEN group (median 26 versus 78 wk, P = 0.01). The LAP group demonstrated shorter operative times (63 versus 100 min, P < 0.0001), and the only bowel injury. Time to feeds, length of stay, and mortality were similar between groups.

Conclusions

Laparoscopic guidance during VPS placement into the reoperative abdomen is associated with a decrease in shunt-related complications, longer shunt patency, and shorter operative times. Prospective study may clarify the potential benefits of laparoscopy in this setting.

### Correlation between ventriculoperitoneal shunts and inguinal hernias in children: an 8-year follow-up [^115WQpvp]. Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The goal of this study was to investigate the correlation between ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPSs) and inguinal hernias (IHs) in children.

Methods

Study subjects were identified from a nationwide cohort of 1 537 843 children aged 0 to 5 years from 1996 to 2000. They were assigned to the VPS group (n = 675), who received VPS, or a control group (n = 6704) of age- and gender-matched children. Both groups (N = 7379) were followed up for 8 years for IH. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were performed.

Results

After the 8-year follow-up, 353 of the 7379 study subjects (78 from the VPS group and 275 from the control group) underwent IH surgery. The 8-year cumulative incidence rate of IH-repair surgery was 13.3% in the VPS group, significantly higher than that in the control group (4.1%; P < .001). Children in the VPS group were more likely to develop IH than the control group (hazard ratio: 3.62; P < .001), even after adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities (adjusted hazard ratio: 6.63; P < .001). The average time interval between VPS and IH surgery was 1.73 years earlier in the VPS group than those in the control group (1.29 vs 3.02 years; P < .001).

Conclusions

Children who received a VPS when younger than 5 years were more likely to have IH; the highest risk was during the first 2 years after VPS surgery. A high index of suspicion for inguinal manifestations is recommended during their follow-up.

### Evaluation and management of shunt infections in children with hydrocephalus [^112UPUAJ]. Clinical Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Shunt infections constitute one of the main risks of shunt surgery for hydrocephalus, which is the single most common type of surgery performed by pediatric neurosurgeons. Infectious complications are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality, lengthy hospitalizations, and high cost. Most modern series report infection rates approaching 10% of all shunt procedures. Despite the high incidence of this complication, optimal management is still unknown, and research on prevention has been hampered by single-institution series and small numbers. This article will review the history, causes, presentation, management, and outcome from shunt infections in children. Pitfalls in diagnosis and management will be reviewed. Finally, prevention strategies and research questions still remaining in this area will be outlined.

### Congress of neurological surgeons systematic review and evidence-based guidelines on the treatment of pediatric hydrocephalus: update of the 2014 guidelines [^114yDNfA]. Neurosurgery (2020). High credibility.

Shunt component selection — an updated review yielded 71 new studies, with 20 selected for full text and 13 excluded; studies reported that valve type had no impact on shunt survival and did not influence risk of shunt failure, and therefore there is no new evidence to support a change in the original guidance recommendations.

### Diagnostic and therapeutic updates in leptomeningeal disease [^111fgTjR]. Current Oncology Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical Interventions

While surgical interventions play a minor role in the treatment of LMD, several neurosurgical procedures are commonly utilized in LMD patients to facilitate chemotherapy delivery and aid in the symptomatic management of hydrocephalus.

Ventricular Access Devices

Chemotherapy and some biologics can be delivered directly into the CSF (intrathecally, or IT) using either serial lumbar punctures (LP) or intraventricular (ICV) administration. LP is less invasive than ICV administration and generally has a lower risk of infectious complications. However, when repeat LPs are required, the risk for LP-related complications such as CSF leak, headache, and bleeding increases over time. Local toxicity from accidental injection into the epidural space can also occur. While more invasive than LPs, ICV administration has several advantages including higher CSF drug levels, a more uniform distribution within the subarachnoid space, and faster, less painful procedures. In breast cancer, ICV delivery is associated with better treatment response and OS compared to lumbar injection. An alternative to the ventricular access device is the chemoport, a bulkier device that is secured to the skull and can be used for chemotherapy delivery and, if connected to a CSF drainage system, utilized for extraventricular drainage.

Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt and Ventriculostomy

As discussed previously, LMD can result in either communicating or obstructive hydrocephalus, leading to increased ICP and potentially devastating neurologic sequelae. Select patients may be considered for placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) for the treatment of LMD-related hydrocephalus. Lin et al. found that in this population, patients treated with VPS had significant overall clinical improvement (41% was sustained longer than 6 months) and did not experience shunt infections. In some cases, a third ventriculostomy for LMD-associated hydrocephalus can be performed as an alternative to VPS. In our clinical practice, VPS and ventriculostomy are typically reserved for patients with further options for systemic therapy.

### Morbidity of ventricular cerebrospinal fluid shunt surgery in adults: an 8-year study [^113FEmTM]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt procedures have dramatically reduced the morbidity and mortality rates associated with hydrocephalus. However, despite improvements in materials, devices, and surgical techniques, shunt failure and complications remain common and may require multiple surgical procedures.

Objective

To evaluate CSF shunt complication incidence and factors that may be associated with increased shunt dysfunction and infection rates in adults.

Methods

From January 1999 to December 2006, we conducted a prospective surveillance program for all neurosurgical procedures including reoperations and infections. Patients undergoing CSF shunt placement were retrospectively identified among patients labeled in the database as having a shunt as a primary or secondary intervention. Revisions of shunts implanted in another hospital or before the study period were excluded, as well as lumbo- or cyst-peritoneal shunts. Shunt complications were classified as mechanical dysfunction or infection. Follow-up was at least 2 years. Potential risk factors were evaluated using log-rank tests and stepwise Cox regression models.

Results

During the 8-year surveillance period, a total of 14 275 patients underwent neurosurgical procedures, including 839 who underwent shunt placement. One hundred nineteen patients were excluded, leaving 720 study patients. Mechanical dysfunction occurred in 124 patients (17.2%) and shunt infection in 44 patients (6.1%). These 168 patients required 375 reoperations. Risk factors for mechanical dysfunction were atrial shunt, greater number of previous external ventriculostomies, and male sex; risk factors for shunt infection were previous CSF leak, previous revisions for dysfunction, surgical incision after 10 am, and longer operating time.

Conclusion

Shunt surgery still carries a high morbidity rate, with a mean of 2.2 reoperations per patient in 23.3% of patients. Our risk-factor data suggest methods for decreasing shunt-related morbidity, including peritoneal routing whenever possible and special attention to preventing CSF leaks after craniotomy or external ventriculostomy.

### Outcomes and complications of different surgical treatments for idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111pyUYC]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Different CSF diversion procedures (ventriculoperitoneal, ventriculoatrial, and lumboperitoneal shunting) have been utilized for the treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus. More recently, endoscopic third ventriculostomy has been suggested as a reasonable alternative in some studies. The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess overall rates of favorable outcomes and adverse events for each of these treatments. An additional objective was to determine the outcomes and complication rates in relation to the type of valve utilized (fixed vs programmable).

Methods

Multiple databases (PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus) were searched for studies involving patients with idiopathic ventriculomegaly, no secondary cause of hydrocephalus, opening pressure < 25 mm Hg on high-volume tap or drainage trial, and age > 60 years. Outcomes included the proportion of patients who showed improvement in gait, cognition, and bladder function. Adverse events considered in the analysis included postoperative ischemic/hemorrhagic complications, subdural fluid collections, seizures, need for revision surgery, and infection.

Results

A total of 33 studies, encompassing 2461 patients, were identified. More than 75% of patients experienced improvement after shunting, without significant differences among the different techniques utilized. Overall, gait improvement was observed in 75% of patients, cognitive function improvement in more than 60%, and improvement of incontinence in 55%. Adjustable valves were associated with a reduction in revisions (12% vs 32%) and subdural collections (9% vs 22%) as compared to fixed valves.

Conclusions

Outcomes did not differ significantly among different CSF diversion techniques, and overall improvement was reported in more than 75% of patients. The use of programmable valves decreased the incidence of revision surgery and of subdural collections after surgery, potentially justifying the higher initial cost associated with these valves.

Limitations

The present study has certain limitations. Some patients' records were incomplete which significantly reduced the number of included patients. In addition, the study includes patients with idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus which were treated with various valve types. Initial valve settings, onset and duration of symptoms, and the time between implantation of the VPS and shuntography are heterogenous in this retrospective cohort study.

### Repeated lumbar or ventricular punctures in newborns with intraventricular haemorrhage [^114vsqVv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although in recent years the percentage of preterm infants who suffer intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) has reduced, posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) remains a serious problem with a high rate of cerebral palsy and no evidence-based treatment. Survivors often have to undergo ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) surgery, which makes the child permanently dependent on a valve and catheter system. This carries a significant risk of infection and the need for surgical revision of the shunt. Repeated removal of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by either lumbar puncture, ventricular puncture, or from a ventricular reservoir in preterm babies with IVH has been suggested as a treatment to reduce the risk of PHH development.

Objectives

To determine the effect of repeated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) removal (by lumbar/ventricular puncture or removal from a ventricular reservoir) compared to conservative management, where removal is limited to when there are signs of raised intracranial pressure (ICP), on reduction in the risk of permanent shunt dependence, neurodevelopmental disability, and death in neonates with or at risk of developing posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH).

Search Methods

We used the standard search strategy of Cochrane Neonatal to search the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE via PubMed (1966 to 24 March 2016), Embase (1980 to 24 March 2016), and CINAHL (1982 to 24 March 2016). We also searched clinical trials databases, conference proceedings, and the reference lists of retrieved articles for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs.

Selection Criteria

RCTs and quasi-RCTs that compared serial removal of CSF (via lumbar puncture, ventricular puncture, or from a ventricular reservoir) with conservative management (removing CSF only when there were symptoms of raised ICP). Trials also had to report on at least one of the specified outcomes of death, disability, or shunt insertion.

Data Collection and Analysis

We extracted details of the participant selection, participant allocation and the interventions. We assessed the following outcomes: VPS, death, death or shunt, disability, multiple disability, death or disability, and CSF infection. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Four trials (five articles) met the inclusion criteria of this review; three were RCTs and one was a quasi-RCT; and included a total of 280 participants treated in neonatal intensive care units in the UK. The trials were published between 1980 and 1990. The studies were sufficiently similar regarding the research question they asked and the interventions that we could combine the trials to assess the effect of the intervention. Meta-analysis showed that the intervention produced no significant difference when compared to conservative management for the outcomes of: placement of hydrocephalus shunt (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.26; 3 trials, 233 infants; I² statistic = 0%; moderate quality evidence), death (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.44; 4 trials, 280 infants; I² statistic = 0%; low quality evidence), major disability in survivors (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.18; 2 trials, 141 infants; I² statistic = 11%; high quality evidence), multiple disability in survivors (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 2 trials, 141 infants; I² statistic = 0%; high quality evidence), death or disability (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 2 trials, 180 infants; I² statistic = 0%; high quality evidence), death or shunt (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11; 3 trials, 233 infants; I² statistic = 0%; moderate quality evidence), and infection of CSF presurgery (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.67; 2 trials, 195 infants; low quality evidence). We assessed the quality of the evidence as high for the outcomes of major disability, multiple disability, and disability or death. We rated the evidence for the outcomes of shunt insertion, and death or shunt insertion as of moderate quality as one included trial used an alternation method of randomisation. For the outcomes of death and infection of CSF presurgery, the quality of the evidence was low as one trial used an alternation method, the number of participants was too low to assess the objectives with sufficient precision, and there was inconsistency regarding the findings in the included trials regarding the outcome of infection of CSF presurgery.

Authors' Conclusions

There was no evidence that repeated removal of CSF via lumbar puncture, ventricular puncture or from a ventricular reservoir produces any benefit over conservative management in neonates with or at risk for developing PHH in terms of reduction of disability, death, or need for placement of a permanent shunt.

### Shunt devices for neurointensivists: complications and management [^112PgWZ5]. Neurocritical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid diversion has become the mainstay treatment in hydrocephalus for over 50 years. As the number of patients with ventricular shunt systems increases, neurointensivists are becoming the first-line physicians for many of these patients. When symptoms of a shunt malfunction are suspected and access to a neurosurgeon is limited or delayed, workup and temporizing measures must be initiated. The article highlights the functional nuances, complications, and management of current programmable shunt valves and their MRI sensitivity.

### Association of external ventricular drain wean strategy with shunt placement and length of stay in subarachnoid hemorrhage: a prospective multicenter study [^112sEZHc]. Neurocritical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Survivors of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) face a protracted intensive care unit (ICU) course and are at risk for developing refractory hydrocephalus with the need for a permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS). Management of the external ventricular drain (EVD) used to provide temporary cerebrospinal fluid diversion may influence the need for a VPS, ICU length of stay (LOS), and drain complications, but the optimal EVD management approach is unknown. Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of EVD discontinuation strategy on VPS rate.

Methods

This was a prospective multicenter observational study at six neurocritical care units in the United States. The target population included adults with suspected aneurysmal SAH who required an EVD. Patients were preassigned to rapid or gradual EVD weans based on their treating center. The primary outcome was the rate of VPS placement. Secondary outcomes were EVD duration, ICU LOS, hospital LOS, and drain complications.

Results

A rapid EVD wean protocol was associated with a lower rate of VPS placement, including a delayed posthospitalization shunt, in an adjusted Cox proportional analysis (hazard ratio 0.52 [p = 0.041]) and adjusted logistic regression model (odds ratio 0.43 [95% confidence interval 0.18–1.03], p = 0.057). A rapid wean was also associated with 2.1 fewer EVD days (p = 0.007) and saved an estimated 2.5 ICU days (p = 0.049), as compared with a gradual wean protocol. There were fewer nonfunctioning EVDs in the rapid group (odds ratio 0.32 [95% confidence interval 0.11–0.92]). Furthermore, we found that the time to first wean and the number of weaning attempts were important independent covariates that affected the likelihood of receiving a VPS and the duration of ICU admission.

Conclusions

A rapid EVD wean was associated with decreased rates of VPS placement, decreased ICU LOS, and decreased drain complications in survivors of aneurysmal SAH. These findings suggest that a randomized multicentered controlled study comparing rapid vs. gradual EVD weaning protocols is justified.

### Endoscopic third ventriculostomy: a feasible treatment option for pediatric hydrocephalus in a high-risk cohort-a single-center report [^1163jpEV]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Stepwise multiple logistic regression, which was performed to explain the probability of revision surgery by intervention, patient age, prematurity and/or gestational age and entity (or etiology of any kind), indicated that patient age is a potential risk factor for failure, with younger children having a higher risk. Similar to the increased risk of failure of ETV, this is even more pronounced for revision events within 120 days after surgery and is in line with the results obtained from the Cox regression analysis (modeling time to revision surgery). The entity of obstructive hydrocephalus did not differ from the posthemorrhagic entity in terms of risk of revision (all estimates for OR or HR comparing both entities were close to 1).

In summary, the independent risk of failure is higher for ETV and for younger children, particularly over a period of 120 days after the initial surgery. Etiology was not a predictor of failure.

Within the observation period, there was no major bleeding or lethal complication. The median number of revision surgeries per child was 1 (0, 7) in the ETV group vs 0 (0, 8) in the VP shunt group, thus leading to 30 revision procedures in the ETV group vs 25 procedures in the VP shunt group (p = 0.21). The data displayed in table 3 indicate the number and cause of revisions in both groups and in the group of children switched to VP shunt after failed ETV to attribute complications to the corresponding procedure.

Table 3
Complications leading to revision procedure during 18 months of follow-up

Overall, complications related to the shunt procedure were more frequent with an infection rate of 22.2% (n = 8) and a rate of CSF leakage of 27.8% (n = 10). The number of obturated ETVs leading to revision was comparably high (n = 10, 52.5%).

### Predictors of ventriculoperitoneal shunting following subarachnoid hemorrhage treated with external ventricular drainage [^113kZHeN]. Neurocritical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Objectives

Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is commonly associated with hydrocephalus due to subarachnoid hemorrhage blood products obstructing cerebrospinal fluid outflow. Hydrocephalus after aSAH is routinely managed with temporary external ventricular drainage (EVD) followed by standard EVD weaning protocols, which determine the need for ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS). We sought to investigate aSAH patients who initially passed EVD weaning trials and had EVD removal, but later presented with recurrent, delayed, symptomatic hydrocephalus requiring a VPS.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of all patients at our tertiary care medical center who presented with aSAH, requiring an EVD. We analyzed variables associated with ultimate VPS dependency during hospitalization.

Results

We reviewed 489 patients with aSAH over a 6-year period (2008–2014). One hundred and thirty-eight (28.2%) developed hydrocephalus requiring a temporary EVD. Forty-four (31.9%) of these patients died or had withdrawal of care during admission, and were excluded from final analysis. Of the remaining 94 patients, 29 (30.9%) failed their clamp trial and required VPS. Sixty-five (69.1%) patients passed their clamp trial and were discharged without a VPS. However, 10 (15.4%) of these patients developed delayed hydrocephalus after discharge and ultimately required VPS [mean (range) days after discharge, 97.2 (35–188)]. Compared to early VPS, the delayed VPS group had a higher incidence of symptomatic vasospasm (90.0% vs 51.7%; P = 0.03). When comparing patients discharged from the hospital without VPS, delayed VPS patients also had higher 6- and 12-month mortality (P = 0.02) and longer EVD clamp trials (P < 0.01) than patients who never required VPS but had an EVD during hospitalization. Delayed hydrocephalus occurred in only 7.8% of patients who passed the initial EVD clamp trial, compared to 14.3% who failed the initial trial and 80.0% who failed 2 or more trials.

Conclusion

Patients who failed their initial or subsequent EVD clamp trials had a small, but increased risk of developing delayed hydrocephalus ultimately requiring VPS. Additionally, the majority of patients who presented with delayed hydrocephalus also suffered symptomatic vasospasm. These associations should be further explored and validated in a larger prospective study.

### Lower incidence of reoperation with longer shunt survival with adult ventriculoperitoneal shunts placed for hemorrhage-related hydrocephalus [^114i2DGU]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

The incidence of reoperation for ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPS) in adults, although lower than in pediatric patients, is not insignificant. We hypothesize that adult VPS placed for hemorrhage-related hydrocephalus have a lower incidence of reoperation than those placed for other types of hydrocephalus.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all adult (≥ 20 yr) VPS initially placed from February 2001 to August 2006 at the University of Florida. We determined the incidence and time interval to reoperation. Follow-up was conducted by telephone interview and review of medical records.

Results

A total of 286 adult VPS were initially placed: 96 (34%) hemorrhage and 190 (66%) nonhemorrhage. A total of 15 (16%) hemorrhage patients underwent 22 shunt reoperations, compared with 50 (27%) nonhemorrhage patients who underwent 82 shunt reoperations (P = 0.0316). A Poisson regression analysis of the number of reoperations, factoring hemorrhage, age, and sex, demonstrated a significantly lower incidence of reoperation in hemorrhage patients (P = 0.0900). A Cox proportional hazards model analysis of time to first reoperation, factoring hemorrhage, age, and sex, demonstrated a significantly longer shunt survival in hemorrhage patients (P = 0.0404).

Conclusion

Adult VPS placed for hemorrhage-related hydrocephalus have a significantly lower incidence of reoperation and significantly longer shunt survival. This result may be related to an incidence of transient shunt dependency in patients with hemorrhage-related hydrocephalus. However, the precise mechanism remains unclear.

### Unilateral mydriasis in a child with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt for obstructive hydrocephalus: a diagnostic dilemma [^116hsRtr]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). High credibility.

BACKGROUND

Children with ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt for obstructive hydrocephalus can present acutely with symptoms of shunt blockage and any delay in diagnosis results in serious complications including death. A new onset neurological sign should be investigated urgently, but being aware of potential non-serious causes could avoid unnecessary neurological interventions from a diagnostic dilemma.

### Migration of ventriculoperitoneal shunt to the uterus in a child: a case report [^116Zhzi4]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

A ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) is usually placed inside the peritoneal cavity for cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Rarely, it can migrate to various pelvic visceral organs. Inside the pelvis, the distal end of the shunt can perforate anywhere from the uterus or adnexa to the vulva, and migration through the uterus is extremely rare.

Case

A three-and-a-half-year-old girl presented with a cerebrospinal fluid leak through the vagina after uterine perforation by a VPS. The diagnosis was made with an ultrasound. Her symptoms resolved after revision surgery.

Conclusion

In a patient with a VPS in situ, presenting with a watery fluid leak through the vagina, perforation of the fornix or uterus must always be kept in mind. Timely diagnosis and intervention can result in the prevention of complications.

### How should we treat long-standing overt ventriculomegaly in adults (LOVA)? A retrospective cohort study [^112CjZaY]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). Medium credibility.

Surgical success rates and follow-up

82.4% of patients experienced a clinical improvement after surgery (Table 2). This was a permanent improvement in 82.9% (n = 63), and transient in 17.1% (n = 13, symptom benefit lasting for a mean of 23.7 months, with symptoms returning to pre-surgery levels). There was no difference in the success rates for both ETV and VP shunt groups (82.1% vs 85.7%, p = 0.812) (Fig. 3).

Table 2
Treatment outcomes for patients undergoing surgical intervention

ETV endoscopic third ventriculostomy, VPS ventriculoperitoneal shunt

ETV resulted in a clinical improvement and reduction in ventricular size in 81.3% of cases, and clinical improvement with no reduction in ventricular size in 82.1% of cases (Fig. 3). At 1-year post follow-up, 75.0% (n = 63) had symptom resolution after an ETV, and 72.6% (n = 61) of ETV treated patients had symptom resolution at last follow-up.

Twenty-two patients (24.2%) had symptom recurrence after surgery. Twenty of these patients went onto have repeat surgery, with fourteen patients being treated with VP shunt (two replacing a previous VPS, twelve after unsuccessful ETV), and six with an ETV (repeat ETV in four patients, after failed VPS in two patients). Of these, fifteen improved (75.0%). The improvement seen after repeat surgery was similar in the ETV group compared to the VPS group (100% vs 57.1%, Fischer's exact test = 0.055). Two patients had a third surgery — one patient had two unsuccessful VP shunts that were later converted to a ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt, and one patient had a VP shunt that required revision due to valve blockage, followed by symptom recurrence, then an ETV, with subsequent symptom resolution. No patients were lost to follow-up, and 41.7% (n = 74) were discharged from routine monitoring by the end of the study period.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections cause acute abdomen and peritonitis: a case series [^115axVXV]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Patients with ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) often present to emergency departments with acute abdomen. It is challenging to distinguish between the abdominal problems caused by a VPS and acute surgical abdomen having another cause because VPS infections occasionally cause peritonitis. The frequencies and clinical features of acute abdomen caused by VPS infection are unknown.

Methods

This was a retrospective analysis of all patients with a VPS who presented with acute abdomen to emergency department for a 10-year period. Clinical data, diagnostic workflow, and subsequent treatment were assessed using patient medical records.

Results

In total, 1679 patients presented with acute abdomen; of these, 24 (1.4%) had a VPS at the time of presentation. Of the 24 patients, 12 had an acute surgical abdomen related to gastrointestinal sources with subsequent therapy. In the remaining 12 patients (50%), peritonitis was caused by a VPS infection; seven of these had erroneous abdominal surgeries because of misdiagnosis. Patients with shunt infections as a source of peritonitis underwent shunt surgeries within the past 10 wk (mean, 58 d). Patients with an acute surgical abdomen with gastrointestinal sources had their most recent shunt surgery at a mean of 4.7 y before presentation to the emergency department.

Conclusions

Acute abdomen and peritonitis are challenging in the presence of a VPS. Shunt infections frequently mimic acute surgical abdomen and may lead to misdiagnosis, unnecessary diagnostic procedures, unnecessary surgery, and delay in receiving the appropriate treatment. Shunt surgery in recent patient history is suggestive of VPS infection, and a shunt tap should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

### Lumboperitoneal shunts for the treatment of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus: a comparison of small-lumen abdominal catheters to gravitational add-on valves in a single center [^112mERag]. Operative Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), a disease with uncertain etiology that characteristically afflicts older adults, is characterized by cognitive decline, gait and balance impairments, and urinary incontinence. iNPH is commonly treated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunts, as this is the only treatment with clear evidence of effectiveness. Although the mechanism for recovery following shunt treatment remains unclear, research suggests that shunts improve CSF clearance and adjust the intracranial pressure (ICP). Subsequent studies have demonstrated that lymphatic transport is controlled by the brain's arousal level. The volume of the interstitial space in the brain expands significantly during sleep or anesthesia when compared with the awake state. CSF shunts may also facilitate the excretion of brain extracellular metabolites, which include neurotoxic proteins such as amyloid beta (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p -tau). A previous study reported elevated Aβ38 and Aβ42 levels following shunt implantation, likely owing to improved CSF clearance after surgery.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) implantation is currently the standard treatment for patients with iNPH. In Japan, however, a lumboperitoneal shunt (LPS), which is a less invasive treatment, is used more frequently.LPS treatment has been recognized as an effective approach for iNPH, though its higher revision rates compared with VPS and more-frequent complications due to CSF overdrainage (OD) are problematic. Although the mechanisms are unclear, OD seems to occur more frequently in tall and thin individuals. Some authors contend that the siphon effect in the standing position has the strongest influence on this mechanism. The programmable pressure valve (PPV), in which the pressure is adjusted according to the individual's ICP and body constitution, is known to be more effective than fixed pressure valves for preventing OD complications. However, the PPV cannot control the CSF shunt flow volume when there is a change in posture or an increase in ICP due to coughing or straining. This is a limitation that requires a solution.

### Transient binocular visual loss: a rare presentation of ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction [^113YjjxG]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

The authors report the case of a 27-year-old male with ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) for hydrocephalus presenting with episodic transient binocular visual loss (TBVL) and headache. Complete physical, bedside shunt examination and funduscopy were unremarkable. Laboratory investigation, shunt series and imaging studies failed to reveal any acute abnormalities. Interrogation of the shunt system identified a valve malfunction which was corrected with resultant symptomatic relief and the patient was discharged home in stable condition. VPS malfunction occurs secondary to infection or mechanical failure such as obstruction, tubing fracture, shunt migration and over drainage. Resultant raised intracranial pressure leads to symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting and gait abnormalities. Visual defects including blindness has been occasionally reported from shunt malfunction. Rare complications include cerebrospinal fluid oedema, colonic perforation, paraparesis and parkinsonism. TBVL due to shunt malfunction remains an uncommon presentation and requires a high index of clinical suspicion while evaluating these patients.

Pediatric myelomeningocele — hydrocephalus and ventriculomegaly management is described as variable, with some experts advocating choroid plexus coagulation and endoscopic third ventriculostomies (ETV), others expressing concerns about long-term efficacy and opting instead to insert a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) at birth, and other experts advocating conservative non-surgical management because of possible complications of VPS; additionally, the effects of hydrocephalus and ventriculomegaly on infants and children with SB have not been well reported.

### Management of hydrocephalus in patients with leptomeningeal metastases: an ethical approach to decision-making [^113jUAUg]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Current surgical options

Current options for management of LM-associated hydrocephalus include: (1) shunt placement; (2) repeated lumbar punctures; (3) intraventricular reservoir placement; (4) endoscopic third ventriculostomy; or (5) no intervention with focus on pain management.

CSF diversionary procedures: ventroperitoneal or lumbar shunting

VPS involves placement of a catheter in the lateral ventricle, connected into the peritoneal cavity. VPS allows for rapid normalization of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and is thus commonly employed to relieve symptoms of hydrocephalus. Table 1 depicts studies that have previously reported symptoms and outcomes for patients with leptomeningeal disease-associated HC who have undergone shunting. Overall, these retrospective series have demonstrated significant improvement in hydrocephalus-associated symptoms following VPS placement, with rates of symptom improvement ranging from 75 to > 90% (Table 1). Shunting has also led to marked patient improvements in performance status, with post-surgical Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) increases of 10–20 points. While it has not been standard-of-care to intervene on patients with low performance scores, the minimal published data suggests that VPS may improve quality-of-life even in patients with low KPS.

### Ventriculopleural shunts in a pediatric population: a review of 170 consecutive patients [^115Yty5n]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The authors sought to determine the outcome of using the pleural space as the terminus for ventricular CSF-diverting shunts in a pediatric population.

Methods

All ventriculopleural (VPl) shunt insertions or revisions done between 1978 and 2018 in patients at Children's Hospital Los Angeles were identified. Data recorded for analysis were age, sex, weight, etiology of hydrocephalus, previous shunt history, reason for VPl shunt insertion or conversion from a ventriculoperitoneal (VP) or ventriculoatrial (VA) shunt, valve type, nature of malfunction, presence of shunt infection or pleural effusion, and conversion to a different distal site.

Results

A total of 170 patients (mean age 14 ± 4 years) with a VPl shunt who were followed up for a mean of 57 ± 53 months were identified. The reasons for conversion to a VPl shunt for 167 patients were previous shunt infection in 57 (34%), multiple abdominal procedures in 44 (26%), inadequate absorption of CSF in 34 (20%), abdominal pseudocyst in 25 (15%), and obesity in 7 (4%). No VPl revisions were required in 97 (57%) patients. Of the 73 (43%) patients who did require revision, the most common reason was proximal obstruction in 32 (44%). The next most frequent complication was pleural effusion in 22 (30%) and included 3 patients with shunt infection. All 22 patients with a clinically significant pleural effusion required changing the distal end of the shunt from the pleural space. Pleural effusion was more likely to occur in VPl shunts without an antisiphon valve. Of the 29 children < 10 years old, 7 (24%) developed a pleural effusion requiring a revision of the distal catheter to outside the pleural space compared with 15 (11%) who were older (p = 0.049). There were 14 shunt infections with a rate of 4.2% per procedure and 8.2% per patient.

Conclusions

VPl shunts in children younger than 10 years of age have a significantly higher rate of symptomatic pleural effusion, requiring revision of the shunt's terminus to a different location. VPl shunt complication rates are similar to those of VP shunts. The technical difficulty of inserting a VPl shunt is comparable to that of a VP shunt. In a patient older than 10 years, all else being equal, the authors recommend that the distal end of a shunt be placed into the pleural space rather than the right atrium if the peritoneal cavity is not suitable.

### Reducing ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection with intraoperative glove removal [^111qssPf]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Our review has a number of limitations. Publication bias is possible due to the small number of studies that met our inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity of the studies was high, and the studies were underpowered. One study assessed only intraoperative glove removal or change, whereas the 3 others assessed intraoperative glove change as part of an infection prevention bundle. In the lone study that assessed glove change alone, the reduction in VPS infection rate only reached statistical significance at a 6-month follow-up. As such, the attributable effect of outer-glove removal alone is likely contributory to lower infection rates, but further research is needed to unequivocally confirm the impact of this preventative strategy.

In conclusion, reducing risk of a VPS infection may be achieved through a low-cost protocol of standardizing outer-glove removal or change as part of an infection control bundle prior to handling of the shunt during intraoperative insertion. Replacing the outer glove may be preferable in the event that the inner glove was contaminated due to unsuspected outer-glove perforation during a surgical procedure or during outer-glove removal. This intervention does not require purchase of new equipment, is easy to implement, and can be utilized in resource limited and well-resourced settings.

### Endoscopic third ventriculostomy: a feasible treatment option for pediatric hydrocephalus in a high-risk cohort-a single-center report [^112UHNK7]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Treating hydrocephalus in young childprimarily either byren and infants is still a demanding procedure with a high rate of surgery-related complications. The improvement of technology in pediatric intensive care has increased the chance of survival in very low birthweight infants, and therefore the risk for patients with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) has also increased. During the past 20 years, endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) has become a reasonable option for treating different types of hydrocephalus, especially in the challenging field of PHH after intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH). The reported main factors influencing the outcome of ETV are age at operation and etiology. The success rates of ETV are low in preterm and in infants less than 1 year of age, especially in patients with posthemorrhagic and infection-related hydrocephalus. Outcomes are more favorable in obstructive hydrocephalus, particularly idiopathic aqueductal stenosis in later childhood. Consequently, the reported survival rates after ETV vary up to 90%. However, the long-term outcome of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting is not superior to that of ETV. Beyond controversy, children during the first year of life, especially (preterm) neonates, must be considered high-risk patients in terms of failure rates and postoperative infections. The aim of the present study was to compare the outcome and risk of failure of ETV with VP shunting in children treated primarily for any kind of hydrocephalus during the first year of life at our institution.

### Factors affecting ventriculoperitoneal shunt revision: a post hoc analysis of the British antibiotic and silver impregnated catheter shunt multicenter randomized controlled trial [^116oBkNK]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The British Antibiotic and Silver Impregnated Catheter Shunt (BASICS) trial established level I evidence of the superiority of antibiotic-impregnated catheters in the prevention of infection of newly implanted ventriculoperitoneal shunts (VPSs). A wealth of patient, shunt, and surgery-specific data were collected from trial participants beyond that of the prespecified trial objectives.

Methods

This post hoc analysis of the BASICS survival data explores the impact of patient age, hydrocephalus etiology, catheter type, valve type, and previous external ventricular drain on the risk of infection or mechanical failure. Time to failure was analyzed using Fine and Gray survival regression models for competing risk.

Results

Among 1594 participants, 75 patients underwent revision for infection and 323 for mechanical failure. Multivariable analysis demonstrated an increased risk of shunt infection associated with patient ages < 1 month (subdistribution hazard ratio [sHR] 4.48, 95% CI 2.06–9.72; p < 0.001) and 1 month to < 1 year (sHR 2.67, 95% CI 1.27–5.59; p = 0.009), as well as for adults with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (sHR 2.75, 95% CI 1.21–6.26; p = 0.016). Age ≥ 65 years was found to be independently associated with reduced infection risk (sHR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10–0.69; p = 0.007). Antibiotic-impregnated catheter use was also associated with reduced infection risk (sHR 0.43, 95% CI 0.22–0.84; p = 0.014). Independent risk factors predisposing to mechanical failure were age < 1 month (sHR 1.51, 95% CI 1.03–2.21; p = 0.032) and 1 month to < 1 year (sHR 1.31, 95% CI 0.95–1.81; p = 0.046). Age ≥ 65 years was demonstrated to be the only independent protective factor against mechanical failure risk (sHR 0.64, 95% CI 0.40–0.94; p = 0.024).

Conclusions

Age is the predominant risk for VPS revision for infection and/or mechanical failure, with neonates and infants being the most vulnerable.

### Ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection… [^112dSt5N]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

A man in his 40s with a history of hydrocephalus treated with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt at age 18 years presented with multiple skin lesions on the anterior aspect of his neck and trunk that had developed over the last 2 years. He denied associated fever, headache, or abdominal pain. Physical examination results revealed several suppurative firm nodules and sinuses running along the course of the shunt tubing. Under clinical suspicion of chronic VPS infection, broad-spectrum antibiotics were prescribed and the patient was referred to the neurosurgery department for device removal. Intraoperative culture samples from different sections of the VPS were positive for Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium species, Bacteroides spp, and Fusobacterium spp. Fungal and mycobacterial culture results were negative. Seven surgical interventions and broad-spectrum antibiotics for 9 months were required for infection control and device removal.

At 3 years' follow-up, the patient was asymptomatic. López-Sánchez C, Rozas-Muñoz E, Mir-Bonafé JF. Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Infection. JAMA Dermatol. 2020;

### Keyhole surgery for the positioning of the distal catheter… [^1174cbN6]. ClinicalTrials (2012). Low credibility.

Keyhole Surgery for the Positioning of the Distal Catheter in Ventricular Peritoneal Shunt PlacementClinicalTrials. gov ID. The average patient necessitating VPS will undergo at least two shunt revisions every three years, with some patients requiring more than twenty revisions within the first year. Therefore, any technical improvement with a positive impact on the revision rate not only benefits the patient through a reduction of the surgical burden but may also have economic advantages. An alternative to laparotomy is the laparoscopic placement of the peritoneal catheter in VPS. Retrospective series have since shown the safety of this procedure and suggested an advantage of laparoscopic VPS in terms of operation duration, length of hospital stay and the rate of distal shunt dysfunction. However, the average patient having had VPS will undergo 2.

1 shunt revisions every 3 years of life, with a wide range from no revisions during the first decade to up to 21 revisions within the first year. For this reason technical improvements impacting positively on the revision rate and on the surgical burden are strongly needed. In the standard VPS procedure the proximal part of the shunt is first placed in one of the lateral ventricles. The distal part of the shunt is then tunneled subcutaneously from the head to the abdomen, where 20–25 cm of the distal catheter and the tip are introduced in the peritoneal cavity through a paraumbilical mini-laparotomy. Distal shunt failure has been reported to occur in 10–30% of cases. Secondary dislocation of the peritoneal catheter in the subcutaneous tissue or its improper placement in the peritoneal cavity during the procedure both contribute to this high shunt failure rate.

Furthermore, blind catheter placement in obese patients and in patients with adhesions from previous abdominal surgery can be a challenge and may lead to injuries of the intra-abdominal organs. 120 patients scheduled for VPS surgery were randomised for laparoscopic or open insertion of the peritoneal catheter. The primary endpoint was the rate of overall shunt complication/failure after 12 months. Secondary endpoints were distal shunt failure rate at 6 weeks, 6 months and 12 months, overall complication/failure at 6 weeks and 6 months, duration of surgery and hospitalisation, and morbidity.

Developed by top pediatric hospitals, the all-new Caring for the Hospitalized Child: A Handbook of Inpatient Pediatrics is sure to become your go-to resource from initial evaluation through hospital discharge management. 83: Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunt Complications Published: January 2018 Tamara D. Simon, MD, MSPH, FAAP, Jay Riva-Cambrin, MD, MSc, FRCS, "Cerebrospinal Fluid Shunt Complications", Caring for the Hospitalized Child: A Handbook of Inpatient Pediatrics, American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Hospital Medicine, Jeffrey C. Gershel, MD, FAAP, Daniel A. Rauch, MD, FAAP, FHM. Download citation file: Cerebrospinal fluid shunts are named for the positions of the proximal and distal catheters. Proximal catheters are in the lateral, third, or fourth ventricles or in an intracranial cyst and exit the skull via a burr hole.

Distal catheters are tunneled under the skin to their final location, which can be in the peritoneal space, right atrium, and pleural space, among others. Most commonly, ventriculoperitoneal shunts are placed. Between the proximal and distal catheters is a one-way valve system that allows drainage of CSF at a predetermined pressure differential. Some valves have adjustable pressure settings, and these must be.
