Pneumonia management

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step approach to community-acquired pneumonia management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about diagnostic confirmation and initial severity assessment. Then, I should verify site-of-care decisions using validated criteria. Next, I will review microbiologic testing strategies by setting. After that, I need to check empiric antibiotic choices for outpatients, inpatients, and severe CAP. I will then consider special populations and scenarios, including viral co-infection, immunocompromised hosts, aspiration risk, and MRSA/Pseudomonas coverage. Next, I should confirm antibiotic duration and the role of clinical stability criteria. I will now examine IV-to-PO transition, response assessment, and what to do if the patient is not improving. Finally, I need to ensure prevention and long-term care elements are addressed, including immunizations and cardiovascular follow-up [^112hi12x] [^114cq6uM].

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and initial severity. Radiographic confirmation of pneumonia with chest radiograph or lung ultrasound is preferred, and I should not rely on CT unless the diagnosis remains uncertain after standard imaging; clinical judgment remains essential, but objective imaging strengthens the diagnosis and supports severity tools and antibiotic decisions, so I need to ensure imaging is obtained early when feasible [^112hi12x] [^115qR2bM]. I should double-check severity with validated tools: PSI or CURB-65 for mortality risk, and the IDSA/ATS minor criteria for ICU-level monitoring; in patients not on vasopressors or mechanical ventilation, the minor criteria outperform generic mortality scores for identifying who needs a higher level of care, so I should prioritize those minor criteria in disposition decisions [^111TQhBn] [^1125ycQ2]. Wait, let me verify one nuance: I initially thought CURB-65 thresholds alone would drive ICU admission, but I should correct that — IDSA/ATS uses ICU admission for those with shock or respiratory failure, while CURB-65 ≥ 2 supports hospitalization, not necessarily ICU admission, so I must align disposition with the correct criteria [^115Akds1] [^113EgfRb].

> Next, I should review site-of-care decisions. I need to ensure that patients with shock requiring vasopressors or respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation are admitted to the ICU, and those without shock/ventilation but with multiple minor criteria are considered for a higher-acuity monitored setting given risk of deterioration; this balances safety with resource use [^115Akds1] [^111TQhBn]. Hold on, I should verify outpatient eligibility: PSI class I–III or CURB-65 0–1 generally support outpatient care, whereas PSI class IV–V or CURB-65 ≥ 2 support inpatient admission; I must integrate social supports and comorbidities into this decision to avoid unsafe discharges [^112hi12x] [^113EgfRb].

> I will now examine microbiologic testing. For severe CAP or patients with risk factors for drug-resistant pathogens, I should obtain blood cultures, sputum culture with Gram stain, and urine antigens for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella; I need to check local epidemiology and individual risk factors to decide on MRSA nasal PCR or Pseudomonas risk assessments, because unnecessary broad-spectrum therapy drives resistance and harm [^112hi12x] [^111Lpr3T]. For outpatients without severe disease, routine cultures are not required; however, I should reconsider if symptoms persist or worsen, as this changes pretest probability and stewardship opportunities [^112hi12x].

> Now, empiric antibiotic therapy for outpatients without comorbidities. Let me think about macrolide monotherapy: it is reasonable only when local pneumococcal macrolide resistance is under 25%, so I must confirm local antibiograms before choosing azithromycin or clarithromycin; if resistance is higher, a beta-lactam such as amoxicillin or amoxicillin-clavulanate is preferred, with doxycycline as an alternative option, balancing atypical coverage needs against resistance realities [^115Q2y7p] [^112hi12x]. I should confirm that in regions with high resistance or patient-specific risks, doxycycline or a beta-lactam alone can be reasonable choices guided by patient factors and local patterns, but I need to avoid routine fluoroquinolone use given collateral damage unless there is a compelling indication [^112hi12x].

> For outpatients with comorbidities, I need to ensure broader coverage. Combination therapy with a beta-lactam plus a macrolide, or monotherapy with a respiratory fluoroquinolone, is recommended; the choice should reflect comorbid conditions, recent antibiotic exposure, and local resistance data, and I should double-check drug interactions before selecting a fluoroquinolone [^112hi12x]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: if the patient is stable and local macrolide resistance is high, a beta-lactam plus doxycycline can be considered to mitigate macrolide failure risk while maintaining atypical coverage, though I should verify that this aligns with local guidance and stewardship principles [^112hi12x].

> For inpatients with non-severe CAP, I should confirm that a beta-lactam plus a macrolide, or a respiratory fluoroquinolone alone, are both acceptable regimens; I need to ensure that macrolide choice accounts for local resistance and QT risk, and that fluoroquinolone monotherapy is reserved for patients in whom macrolides are unsuitable or interactions are a concern [^112hi12x]. Wait, let me verify a common pitfall: using dual therapy "just in case" in low-risk inpatients without indications adds cost and adverse effects; guideline-concordant selection is preferred here [^112hi12x].

> For severe CAP, I should double-check that combination therapy is mandatory. A beta-lactam plus a macrolide, or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone, reduces mortality and should be initiated promptly; I need to ensure I am not extending MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage unless risk factors are present, as indiscriminate broad-spectrum therapy increases harm without benefit [^11724DLT] [^112hi12x]. Let me reconsider one point: if there is strong suspicion for aspiration, routine anaerobic coverage is not recommended in severe CAP; standard regimens suffice unless there is clinical evidence of lung abscess or empyema suggesting anaerobic infection [^115Lwwfx].

> Special scenarios deserve careful thought. If influenza is diagnosed, I should confirm that standard antibacterial therapy is still indicated for CAP in addition to timely antiviral therapy; bacterial co-infection is common, and delaying antibiotics worsens outcomes, so I must not withhold antibacterial treatment solely due to a positive influenza test [^115dbbUh] [^113otsea]. For viral-positive CAP without comorbidities, the 2025 ATS guidance suggests avoiding empiric antibiotics; however, I should verify clinical evolution closely, because early bacterial co-infection can present subtly, and I need a low threshold to add antibiotics if deterioration occurs or risk factors emerge [^112S2QnK] [^1153KRfw]. For immunocompromised patients, I should broaden diagnostics and empiric therapy early, including coverage for atypical and opportunistic pathogens per consensus statements, and tailor based on immune defect and local epidemiology [^117F8r49].

> Aspiration risk requires nuance. I should confirm that routine anaerobic coverage is not recommended for severe CAP with aspiration risk; instead, I should treat with standard CAP regimens and escalate only if there is clinical-radiographic evidence of anaerobic infection such as putrid sputum, abscess, or empyema, or if the patient fails to improve as expected [^115Lwwfx]. But wait, what if the patient has known MRSA colonization or prior MRSA pneumonia? In that case, I should add MRSA-active therapy up front and de-escalate based on cultures, aligning with local risk stratification tools and prior microbiology [^112hi12x].

> Duration of therapy should be driven by clinical stability, not a fixed calendar. I need to ensure at least 5 total days of therapy once the patient is clinically stable, defined by resolution of vital sign abnormalities, normal mentation, and ability to tolerate oral intake; extending therapy beyond 5 days is justified only if stability is not achieved or complications arise [^115BfusZ] [^1137eJC4]. Hold on, I should verify the 2025 update: for non-severe CAP inpatients who achieve stability, durations shorter than 5 days, down to 3 days, can be considered in select cases, but I must apply this cautiously and ensure close follow-up for recurrence or complications [^113DyKsv]. For severe CAP, I should confirm that at least 5 days after stability is prudent, and longer courses are reserved for slow response or complications [^111e2FjV].

> Transition from IV to oral therapy should be guided by objective clinical stability criteria rather than arbitrary day counts. I should double-check that temperature ≤ 37.8°C for 24–48 hours, heart rate ≤ 100/min, systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg, respiratory rate ≤ 24/min, oxygen saturation ≥ 90% on room air or baseline, normal mental status, and ability to take oral medications are met before switching; using these criteria reduces length of stay without increasing failure rates, supporting early switch when safe [^116oDx2e] [^112hi12x]. Wait, let me verify one more point: even if the patient looks "better", missing one stability criterion can predict relapse, so I should not rush the switch until all are satisfied [^112X81vp].

> Response assessment at 48–72 hours is critical. I should confirm that clinical improvement includes decreasing fever, improving oxygenation, and fewer respiratory symptoms; if there is no improvement or deterioration, I must re-evaluate the diagnosis, look for complications like empyema or abscess, and repeat imaging, cultures, and labs to guide therapy modification [^112hi12x]. Hold on, I should verify that persistent leukocytosis or rising procalcitonin can signal nonresponse, but biomarkers should augment, not replace, clinical judgment in this window [^112hi12x].

> If the patient is not improving, I need a structured approach. Let me first confirm the diagnosis: was the initial infiltrate truly pneumonia, or could this be pulmonary embolism, heart failure, malignancy, or a noninfectious process; I should repeat chest imaging and consider CT if the course is atypical or complications are suspected [^1168F72y]. Next, I should review microbiology and expand testing to include Legionella, MRSA, Pseudomonas, and fungal pathogens as indicated, and consider bronchoscopy with BAL for severe or ventilated patients to refine coverage and enable de-escalation [^112hi12x]. I should also reassess for complications such as parapneumonic effusion, empyema, abscess, or sepsis, and involve interventional radiology or thoracic surgery early if source control is needed [^1168F72y].

> Prevention and long-term care matter. I need to ensure influenza and pneumococcal vaccination status is addressed during or soon after recovery, and I should counsel on smoking cessation given its strong association with pneumonia risk and severity; these measures reduce recurrence and downstream complications [^112hi12x] [^116LA8Eg]. Let me also consider the cardiovascular aftermath: pneumonia increases risks of acute coronary syndromes and heart failure, so I should arrange follow-up to monitor for new or worsening cardiopulmonary disease and reinforce secondary prevention strategies [^114cq6uM].

> Finally, I should confirm that my plan aligns with evolving guidance. The 2019 ATS/IDSA guideline eliminated the HCAP category to curb unnecessary broad-spectrum therapy, emphasized early appropriate antibiotics, and discouraged routine corticosteroids; the 2025 ATS updates refine viral co-infection management and support shorter courses when stability is achieved, reinforcing stewardship and individualized care [^115U4hGg] [^112S2QnK] [^113DyKsv]. I need to ensure my local protocols reflect these shifts and that I document the rationale for deviations when patient-specific factors warrant them, maintaining alignment with evidence-based care pathways [^112hi12x].

Pneumonia management centers on **early recognition and risk stratification** to guide site of care and empiric therapy [^112hi12x] [^112bZTuo]. For **outpatients without comorbidities**, use a macrolide if local resistance is < 25% [^115Q2y7p]; otherwise, use doxycycline or amoxicillin [^112hi12x]. For **outpatients with comorbidities**, use a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a respiratory fluoroquinolone [^notfound]. For **inpatients with severe CAP**, use a beta-lactam plus a macrolide or a beta-lactam plus a respiratory fluoroquinolone [^11724DLT]; add MRSA or Pseudomonas coverage only if risk factors are present [^notfound]. Start antibiotics within 4–8 hours of presentation [^116oDx2e], tailor to culture results, and treat for a minimum of 5 days after achieving clinical stability [^115BfusZ] [^1137eJC4]. Provide supportive care, monitor for complications, and apply prevention strategies, including vaccination and smoking cessation [^116LA8Eg].

| CURB-65 0–1 | Outpatient |
| CURB-65 2 | Hospitalization |
| CURB-65 ≥ 3 | ICU or high-dependency care |

---

## Empiric antibiotic therapy

Empiric therapy should start **within 4–8 hours** of presentation and be tailored to severity, comorbidities, and local resistance patterns [^116oDx2e] [^114cq6uM].

| **Clinical setting** | **Recommended empiric therapy** |
|-|-|
| Outpatient, no comorbidities | Macrolide (if resistance < 25%) or doxycycline or amoxicillin [^115Q2y7p] [^11421XKj] |

- **Legionella and pneumococcal urinary antigens**: Consider in severe CAP or outbreaks [^notfound].

- **Molecular testing**: Use when available to identify atypical pathogens and resistance genes [^notfound].

---

## Duration of antibiotic therapy

Treat for a **minimum of 5 days**, ensuring clinical stability for 48–72 hours before discontinuation [^115BfusZ] [^1137eJC4]. Severe CAP may require 7–10 days, especially if complications occur or response is slow [^notfound].

---

## Supportive care

- **Fluid management**: Avoid overload; use cautious hydration [^notfound].

- **Analgesics and antipyretics**: Manage pain and fever [^notfound].

- **Respiratory support**: Non-invasive ventilation or intubation if indicated [^notfound].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Track temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation, and mental status, and repeat imaging if the patient fails to improve or deteriorates [^notfound]. Watch for **complications** such as respiratory failure, sepsis, pleural effusion, empyema, and lung abscess [^114cq6uM].

---

## Prevention strategies

Prevention includes **vaccination** — influenza, pneumococcal, and COVID-19 — and smoking cessation counseling [^116LA8Eg]. Hand hygiene and infection control measures should be emphasized, especially in healthcare settings [^notfound].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Immunocompromised patients**: Broader empiric coverage and aggressive diagnostic workup [^notfound].

- **Elderly patients**: Higher risk of complications; consider closer monitoring and longer therapy [^notfound].

- **Pediatric patients**: Amoxicillin is first-line; macrolides for atypical pathogens [^notfound].

---

## Emerging trends and controversies

- **Short-course therapy**: 3–5 days in select non-severe cases achieving early stability [^113DyKsv].

- **Corticosteroids**: Not routine; consider only in severe cases with refractory shock [^notfound].

- **Biomarkers**: Procalcitonin may guide antibiotic discontinuation in some settings [^notfound].

### Community-acquired pneumonia: what is relevant and what is not? [^116LA8Eg]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and is the most common cause of death from infectious diseases in North America. The purpose of this review is to highlight recent advances in epidemiology, risk factors, severity criteria and antibiotic therapeutic regimens used for community-acquired pneumonia management.

Recent Findings

All guidelines recommend early and appropriate empiric therapy directed against common typical organisms, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other atypical organisms, but clinicians should be aware of newer emerging pathogens such as community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative pathogens.

Summary

The optimum outcome in community-acquired pneumonia can be achieved by careful risk stratification using prediction rules together with appropriate antibiotic regimens. The mainstay of community-acquired pneumonia prevention is influenza and pneumococcal immunization. Promotion of smoking cessation will also help curtail the incidence of pneumococcal disease.

### How to approach a patient hospitalized for pneumonia who is not responding to treatment? [^1168F72y]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pneumonia constitutes one of the most frequent causes of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and it is the most frequent infection in ICU patients across all geographic regions.

After the administration of supportive care and antibiotic therapy, the clinical response of pneumonia is not immediate. Clinicians recognize that the first 48–72h of treatment are crucial for determining the course of the illness. Most hospitalized patients with pneumonia recover with timely and appropriate antibiotic therapy and generally follow an uncomplicated course. However, a sizable proportion of patients may experience non-response and treatment failure, leading to an increased risk of mortality, which can be greater than 40%. There is a lack of epidemiologic data on non-responders and little to no evidence concerning the best clinical approach for this situation. Currently available guidelines do not provide recommendations on how to manage these patients.

There are numerous arbitrary definitions for the critically ill patient with severe pneumonia who is not improving or who is deteriorating despite receiving presumed appropriate antibiotic therapy. The nuances associated with the definitions of "not resolving", "non-responding", or "progressive" pneumonia along with "treatment failure", are largely inconsequential to the clinician who is taking care of a critically ill patient with a diagnosis of pneumonia who is not improving or worsening.

This narrative review aims to give to the clinicians a structured approach on the management of non-responding pneumonia, namely the criteria to define a non-responder and its expected frequency, the differential diagnosis, the optimal diagnostic steps and treatment strategies.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the management of adult patients presenting to the emergency department with community-acquired pneumonia [^111MFSUi]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Recommendation levels — Level A recommendations are generally accepted principles that reflect a high degree of clinical certainty based on strength of evidence Class I or overwhelming evidence from Class II studies that directly address all issues; Level B recommendations identify strategies that reflect moderate clinical certainty based on Class II or Class III studies that directly address all issues; Level C recommendations are based on preliminary, inconclusive, or conflicting evidence or, if no published literature exists, on panel consensus; recommendations may be downgraded due to heterogeneity of results, uncertainty about effect magnitude and consequences, strength of prior beliefs, and publication bias; and recommendations are not intended to represent the only diagnostic and management options for emergency physicians.

### Bottlenecks, barriers, and solutions: results from multicountry consultations focused on reduction of childhood pneumonia and diarrhoea deaths [^112whkG6]. Lancet (2013). Excellent credibility.

Millions of children still die unnecessarily from pneumonia and diarrhoea, mainly in resource-poor settings. A series of collaborative consultations and workshops involving several hundred academic, public health, governmental and private sector stakeholders were convened to identify the key barriers to progress and to issue recommendations. Bottlenecks impairing access to commodities included antiquated supply management systems, insufficient funding for drugs, inadequate knowledge about interventions by clients and providers, health worker shortages, poor support for training or retention of health workers, and a failure to convert national policies into action plans. Key programmatic barriers included an absence of effective programme coordination between and within partner organisations, scarce financial resources, inadequate training and support for health workers, sporadic availability of key commodities, and suboptimal programme management. However, these problems are solvable. Advocacy could help to mobilise needed resources, raise awareness, and prioritise childhood pneumonia and diarrhoea deaths in the coming decade.

### Update in adult community-acquired pneumonia: key points from the new American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America 2019 guideline [^11421XKj]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released their joint guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The co-chairs of the guideline committee provide a summary of the guideline process, key recommendations from the new guideline and future directions for CAP research.

Recent Findings

The guideline committee included 14 experts from the two societies. Sixteen questions for the guideline were selected using the PICO format. The GRADE approach was utilized to review the available evidence and generate recommendations. The recommendations included expanded microbiological testing for patients suspected of drug-resistant infections, empiric first-line therapy recommendations for outpatients and inpatients including use of beta-lactam monotherapy for uncomplicated outpatients, elimination of healthcare-associated pneumonia as a treatment category, and not recommending corticosteroids as routine adjunct therapy.

Summary

CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Effective antibiotic therapy is available and remains largely empirical. New diagnostic tests and treatment options are emerging and will lead to guideline updates in the future.

### Best practices in the development and use of experimental models of bacterial pneumonia: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^115qzdLA]. American Journal of Respiratory Cell and Molecular Biology (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society workshop report — conclusions on experimental models of bacterial pneumonia emphasize that experimental models are required for the management and treatment of bacterial pneumonia to help identify and characterize mechanistic pathways alongside human translational and clinical studies. The report states that careful choice of nonanimal and animal models, including ethical and rational considerations, are needed to optimize the benefits of these approaches. It notes that attention to key variables that impact the bacterial pathogen and host animal will be important to ensure appropriate modeling and ensure rigor and reproducibility of findings. The goal is that insights from these experimental studies will contribute to significant improvement in approaches to manage pneumonia and respiratory bacterial infections.

### Clinical policy for the management and risk stratification of community-acquired pneumonia in adults in the emergency department [^112bZTuo]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

This clinical policy represents an approach that emphasizes key clinical information to determine the severity of CAP. By using this approach, a determination of whether the patient can be treated as an outpatient or inpatient may be made. Recommendations about the utility of ancillary studies and the use of antibiotics are also given. As more of the questions are answered through controlled studies, an evidence-based approach to this problem will become increasingly important in improving the outcome of patients with CAP.

### Community-acquired pneumonia in the emergency department: a practical approach to diagnosis and management [^112N586C]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Pneumonia is one of the most common conditions for which patients seek emergency care. It is a challenging infection in that the spectrum of illness ranges from the nontoxic patient appropriate for outpatient antibiotics to the critically ill patient requiring intensive care hospitalization. Current data and diagnostic technology provide the emergency physician with the tools for an appropriately rapid evaluation and consideration of the differential diagnosis. Key critical thinking and application of published findings allow for intelligent empirical antibiotic treatment and risk stratification for the best disposition. Although antibiotic-resistant organisms increasingly are being identified, patients continue to benefit from early institution of standard ED treatment. Coverage for atypical organisms improves patient response and outcome. Finally, identification and treatment of the complications of pneumonia and accompanying sepsis must be considered by the ED physician when evaluating critically ill patients.

### Pneumonia: challenges in the definition, diagnosis, and management of disease [^1122AJi7]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Defining health care-associated pneumonia, which includes both hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), is problematic and controversial. Aspiration pneumonia is often included as a subtype of HAP but may be related to community-acquired aspiration events. Scoring systems exist and new surveillance guidelines have been implemented to make early recognition of pneumonia more precise and objective. Management and prevention should follow recommendations, including early empirical therapy, targeted therapy, and limited duration of treatment. Patients with trauma present a challenge to the diagnosis and management of pneumonia, because of increased risk for aspiration and underlying chest and pulmonary injury.

### Diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia. An official clinical practice guideline of the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America [^112DXJyG]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2019). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline — scope and initial questions: This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the management of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), developed by a multidisciplinary panel that conducted pragmatic systematic reviews and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations. The panel addressed 16 specific areas spanning diagnostic testing, determination of site of care, selection of initial empiric antibiotic therapy, and subsequent management decisions, formulating recommendations and rationale on selected diagnostic and treatment strategies for adult CAP. Although some recommendations remain unchanged from the 2007 guideline, results from new therapeutic trials and epidemiological investigations led to revised recommendations for empiric treatment strategies and additional management decisions. The contents highlight early diagnostic questions for adults with CAP, including whether Gram stain and culture of lower respiratory secretions or blood cultures should be obtained at the time of diagnosis, and also list a third question beginning "Question 3: In Adults with CAP, Should Legionella and".

### Pneumococcal pneumonia: mechanisms of infection and resolution [^115uRDAm]. Chest (2012). Low credibility.

Vaccination and antimicrobial therapy remain the cornerstones of the management of pneumococcal pneumonia. Despite significant successes, the capacity of the pneumococcus to evolve in the face of the selective pressure of anticapsular immunity challenges immunization programs. Treatment focuses on antimicrobial therapy but ignores the central role of the dysregulated inflammatory response during pneumonia. Future therapeutic approaches need to build on the considerable recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of pneumococcal pneumonia, including those from models of pneumonia. Enhancement of the essential components of the host response that prevents most colonized individuals from developing pneumonia and strategies to limit inappropriate inflammatory responses to lower respiratory tract infection are approaches that could be exploited to improve disease outcome. This review highlights recent discoveries relating to the microbial and host determinants of microbial clearance and regulation of the inflammatory response, which provide clues as to how this could be achieved in the future.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^1136Dzsk]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Recommendation strength interpretation — strong versus weak (conditional): For a strong recommendation, most individuals should receive the intervention and the recommendation can be adopted as policy in most situations. For a weak (conditional) recommendation, recognize that different choices will be appropriate for individual patients and policymaking will require substantial debate and involvement of various stakeholders.

### Emergency management of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia: what is new since the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America / American Thoracic Society guidelines [^113ED6Wg]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a major health problem in the United States and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Patients with CAP commonly present to emergency departments where physicians must make critical decisions regarding diagnosis and management of pneumonia in a timely fashion, with emphasis on efficient and cost-effective diagnostic choices, consideration of emerging antimicrobial resistance, timely initiation of antibiotics, and appropriate site-of-care decisions. In light of the burden that pneumonia places on health care systems and the emergency department in particular, this article reviews significant developments in the management of CAP in the United States 5 years since the publication of the 2007 Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society consensus guidelines on the management of CAP in adults, focusing on recent studies and recommendations for managing CAP, the primary bacterial pathogens responsible for CAP, and trends in resistance, new diagnostic technologies, and newer antimicrobials approved for the treatment of CAP. These new data and additional guidelines pertaining to the treatment of CAP further our knowledge and understanding of this challenging infection. Furthermore, appreciation of the availability of new diagnostic testing and therapeutic options will help meet the demand for improved management of CAP.

### Outpatient antibiotic use and treatment failure among children with pneumonia [^116xmAuo]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

In children with pneumonia managed as outpatients, is receipt of antibiotics associated with decreased risk of treatment failure?

Findings

In this cohort study of 103 854 children with pneumonia treated in an outpatient setting, 20% did not receive antibiotics. Treatment failure was uncommon (8.7% received antibiotics and 10.7% did not receive antibiotics), and severe outcomes were rare, regardless of whether antibiotics were received (0.7% receiving antibiotics and 1.1% not receiving antibiotics).

Meaning

These findings suggest that future efforts to identify children with pneumonia who can safely be managed without antibiotics are warranted.

### Management of pneumonia in critically ill patients [^117CFqhd]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Severe pneumonia is associated with high mortality (short and long term), as well as pulmonary and extrapulmonary complications. Appropriate diagnosis and early initiation of adequate antimicrobial treatment for severe pneumonia are crucial in improving survival among critically ill patients. Identifying the underlying causative pathogen is also critical for antimicrobial stewardship. However, establishing an etiological diagnosis is challenging in most patients, especially in those with chronic underlying disease; those who received previous antibiotic treatment; and those treated with mechanical ventilation. Furthermore, as antimicrobial therapy must be empiric, national and international guidelines recommend initial antimicrobial treatment according to the location's epidemiology; for patients admitted to the intensive care unit, specific recommendations on disease management are available. Adherence to pneumonia guidelines is associated with better outcomes in severe pneumonia. Yet, the continuing and necessary research on severe pneumonia is expansive, inviting different perspectives on host immunological responses, assessment of illness severity, microbial causes, risk factors for multidrug resistant pathogens, diagnostic tests, and therapeutic options.

### British thoracic society community acquired pneumonia guideline and the NICE pneumonia guideline: how they fit together [^113M1h3W]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2015). Medium credibility.

Future directions

The BTS Standards of Care Committee will, at a later date, decide on the timing and scope of a future update of the BTS CAP Guideline building on the excellence of the NICE Pneumonia Guideline. Topics to be considered for inclusion in future BTS CAP Guideline include the management of pneumonia associated with viral pathogens, specifically influenza, and aspiration pneumonia.

The relative lack of major differences between the NICE and BTS guidelines might be viewed positively as demonstrating coherence and consistency in guidelines. However, it also highlights the relative lack of substantial innovation and advancement over recent years in the evidence base related to the clinical management of CAP. More attention to translational and clinical research is merited if further improvements in the care of patients with CAP are to be gained.

### Pneumonia in low and middle income countries: progress and challenges [^115VLaNe]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Pneumonia continues to present a major burden of morbidity and mortality in resource poor regions despite advances in preventative and management strategies. There is an urgent need for improved diagnostics to reliably identify aetiological agents. More widespread implementation and scale up of immunisation with improved conjugate vaccines against childhood pneumonia in LAMICs could substantially reduce childhood mortality and the burden of pneumonia. Implementation of current effective preventative and management strategies remains a challenge in many LAMICs although the available interventions can substantially reduce pneumonia burden, severity and outcome.

### Childhood pneumonia in low-and-middle-income countries: an update [^113sf4xa]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Globally, pneumonia is one of the major causes of death children under the age of five years. In 2015, approximately 700,000 children younger than 5 years died from pneumonia worldwide, despite general improvement in living conditions, improved nutrition and better vaccines. Furthermore, pneumonia continues to be the leading cause of morbidity for young children outside the neonatal period, particularly in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). Understanding the current epidemiology, and diagnostic and management strategies in these settings may improve preventive, diagnostic and treatment approaches.

The aim of this paper was to review the recent literature on (1) the epidemiology and aetiology of childhood pneumonia in LMICs; (2) diagnostic tools; and (3) prevention and management approaches.

### Antibiotic therapy for adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia: a systematic review [^116oDx2e]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Antibiotic therapy is the cornerstone of medical management for community-acquired pneumonia.

Objective

To assess the associations between 3 key aspects of antibiotic therapy (optimal time to antibiotic initiation, initial antibiotic selection, and criteria for the transition from intravenous to oral therapy) and short-term mortality in adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia.

Evidence Review

Bibliographic databases of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Collaboration were searched for studies of adults hospitalized with radiographically confirmed community-acquired pneumonia published from January 1, 1995, until November 5, 2015.

Findings

Twenty studies (17 observational and 3 randomized trials) met eligibility criteria. Among 8 observational studies identified, the 4 largest (study populations of 2878 to 1,170,022) found that antibiotic initiation within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with relative reductions of 5% to 43% in mortality; the 4 smallest studies (study populations of 451 to 2076) found no associations between the timing of antibiotic initiation and mortality. One cluster randomized trial (n = 1737) demonstrated noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy (n = 506) vs β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy (n = 566), with an absolute adjusted difference of 2.5% (90% CI, -0.6% to 5.2%) in 90-day mortality favoring β-lactam monotherapy. A second randomized trial (n = 580) failed to demonstrate noninferiority of β-lactam monotherapy vs β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy, with an absolute difference of 7.6% (1-sided 90% CI upper limit, 13.0%) in attainment of clinical stability on hospital day 7 favoring β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy. Six of 8 observational studies (study populations of 1188 to 24,780) found that β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy was associated with relative reductions of 26% to 68% in short-term mortality and all 3 observational studies (study populations of 2068 to 24,780) reported that fluoroquinolone monotherapy was associated with relative reductions of 30% to 43% in mortality compared with β-lactam monotherapy. One randomized trial (n = 302) reported significantly reduced hospital length of stay (absolute difference, 1.9 days; 95% CI, 0.6 to 3.2 days), but no differences in treatment failure when objective clinical criteria were used to decide when to transition patients from intravenous to oral therapy.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia, antibiotic therapy consisting of β-lactam plus macrolide combination therapy or fluoroquinolone monotherapy initiated within 4 to 8 hours of hospital arrival was associated with lower adjusted short-term mortality, supported predominantly by low-quality observational studies. One randomized trial supports the use of objective clinical criteria to guide the transition from intravenous to oral antibiotic therapy.

### Outpatient management of children with World Health Organization chest indrawing pneumonia: implementation risks and proposed solutions [^111cYS4N]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

The World Health Organization (WHO) Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines provide the basis for treatment recommendations for children with pneumonia in most low-resource settings. The IMCI guidelines were written for doctors, nurses, and other nonphysician clinicians working at first-level outpatient facilities in low-resource settings such as clinics, health centers, or outpatient departments of hospitals. In contrast, the WHO integrated community case management guidelines were envisioned to target lay, informally trained healthcare providers, often called community health workers, who staff community-level village clinics or conduct household-level care. The recommendations detailed in this Viewpoint are specific to the IMCI guidelines and the appropriate healthcare providers and health system levels for which these guidelines were intended.

IMCI implementation, dating back 2 decades, has contributed to global child pneumonia mortality reductions of > 30%. Despite laudable progress, pneumonia remains the leading cause of death in children aged 1–59 months worldwide. IMCI recommends home oral amoxicillin treatment, rather than hospitalization and parenteral antibiotics, for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–uninfected children 2–59 months of age with cough and/or difficult breathing, chest indrawing, and no general danger signs (chest indrawing pneumonia). Several multicountry randomized controlled trials that reported equivalent outcomes between oral and parenteral antibiotics for children with chest indrawing pneumonia provided evidence supporting this recommendation. Translating these trial results into widescale programmatic care poses significant challenges as there are several key issues that limit the generalizability of these trials to real-world settings. Unlike appropriately resourced and supervised clinical trials, effective guideline implementation in real-world settings hinges upon often inadequately trained, poorly supervised, and underresourced healthcare workers to correctly identify chest indrawing and exclude any accompanying clinical danger signs and underlying chronic illnesses that require hospitalization. We will discuss these issues here in this Viewpoint, revisiting evidence from the original studies that formed the basis of these guidelines to offer our alternative perspective. We will also review the physiology of chest indrawing and examine the risks, alongside proposed solutions, of implementing these guidelines in frontline outpatient facilities in low-resource settings.

Management, treatment and antibiotic regimens in adult pneumonia

Severity scores

Appropriate initial management of pneumonia relies on an accurate assessment of disease severity. To support clinical assessment, which is poorly predictive of disease outcome, several severity-scoring indices have been developed. These tools facilitate the prompt identification of individuals with severe disease, permitting the rapid institution of intensive care interventions. Equally, they help treating physicians to confidently identify individuals with low-severity disease who may be safely managed at home. Care provided in accordance with treatment guidelines based on an assessment of disease severity using a severity-scoring index is associated with improved outcome. Nonetheless, many severity assessment tools may actually underestimate disease severity in young people. This is of particular relevance in LAMICs where a greater burden of pneumonia is seen in younger adults. Similarly, differences in population comorbidity burden and aetiological spectrum of pneumonia may reduce the prognostic performance of most pneumonia severity assessment tools that were almost exclusively developed and validated in well-resourced settings. There is an urgent need for the development of validated severity assessment tools in LAMICs that can support clinical management decisions in these settings.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^114cq6uM]. Lancet (2021). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is not usually considered a high-priority problem by the public, although it is responsible for substantial mortality, with a third of patients dying within 1 year after being discharged from hospital for pneumoniae. Although up to 18% of patients with community-acquired pneumonia who were hospitalised (admitted to hospital and treated there) have at least one risk factor for immunosuppression worldwide, strong evidence on community-acquired pneumonia management in this population is scarce. Several features of clinical management for community-acquired pneumonia should be addressed to reduce mortality, morbidity, and complications related to community-acquired pneumonia in patients who are immunocompetent and patients who are immunocompromised. These features include rapid diagnosis, microbiological investigation, prevention and management of complications (eg, respiratory failure, sepsis, and multiorgan failure), empirical antibiotic therapy in accordance with patient's risk factors and local microbiological epidemiology, individualised antibiotic therapy according to microbiological data, appropriate outcomes for therapeutic switch from parenteral to oral antibiotics, discharge planning, and long-term follow-up. This Seminar offers an updated view on community-acquired pneumonia in adults, with suggestions for clinical and translational research.

### Integrated management of childhood illnesses (IMCI): a mixed-methods study on implementation, knowledge and resource availability in Malawi [^1172uyAj]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

Despite a reduction in under-five deaths globally from 12.5 million in 1990 to 5.3 million in 2018, progress has been uneven. The highest burden is seen in sub-Saharan Africa, with considerable national and sub-national variation. A key strategy in the success to date was the introduction of the WHOs Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines. At the time, the major causes of child mortality were pneumonia, malaria, measles, malnutrition and diarrhoea. More recently this has shifted to neonatal complications, while pneumonia remains the leading infectious cause of mortality in children under-five.

IMCI was intended for countries with under-five mortality rates higher than 40 per 1000 live births, and focuses on three components: improving case management skills, strengthening health systems and improving community health practices. While IMCI has been partially or fully adopted by 100 countries, a survey from 2016 reported only 44 countries were considered to be fully implementing it. Further, IMCI coverage was lowest in countries with the highest mortality rates; of the 26 countries to achieve the Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) — reducing under-five mortality by two-thirds, 20 had fully implemented IMCI.

Key strengths of IMCI are the holistic approach, rational use of medications and improved quality and efficiency of health service provision. However, implementation barriers and inconsistencies have been reported. For example, the WHO guidance for training contains seven modules taught over 11 days, but local adaptations have led to considerable differences, with examples of both shorter and distance learning approaches. Currently there is a lack of standardised guidance on the frequency, content, pedagogical approach and expected learning outcomes for refresher courses.

Malawi was an early adopter of IMCI, first implementing it in 2000, and was one of only 10 low-income countries in sub-Saharan Africa to achieve MDG4. This success has been attributed to proactive policies, scale-up and introduction of vaccinations, coverage of insecticide treated bed nets, IMCI and integrated community case management. However, Malawi is not currently on track to achieve the target set out in Sustainable Development Goal 3.2, and faces considerable challenges with an under-resourced health sector with workforce shortages. Previous studies have reported suboptimal IMCI implementation for pneumonia, with issues in clinical assessments, quality of diagnosis and antibiotic prescription.

### Comparing current US and European guidelines for nosocomial pneumonia [^113CKod4]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

In the last 2 years, two major guidelines for the management of nosocomial pneumonia have been published: The International European Respiratory Society/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases/Asociación Latinoamericana de Toráx guidelines for the management of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the American guidelines for management of adults with HAP and VAP; both the guidelines made important clinical recommendations for the management of patients.

Recent Findings

With the increasing emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) organisms, paired with a relative reduction in new antibiotic development, nosocomial infections have become one of the most significant issues affecting global healthcare today. Despite several stark differences between the European and American guidelines, they are in agreement about many aspects of nosocomial pneumonia management.

Summary

American and European guidelines promote prompt and appropriate empiric treatment which is immediately guided by local microbiological data, followed by an adequate de-escalation protocol based on culture results with a 1-week course of treatment. Both also questioned the use of biomarkers in HAP/VAP, whether as part of the diagnosis or daily assessment of patients. On the contrary, they have conflicting views in regards to the optimum method of diagnosis, the risk factors used to stratify patients, the use of clinical scoring systems and the various antibiotic classes used. All were presented with varying levels of evidence to support these differences in opinion, indicating that further research into these areas is required before a consensus can be agreed upon.

### Applying lessons learnt from research of child pneumonia management in Vietnam [^115S5bkQ]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Pneumonia is the leading cause of paediatric hospitalisation in Vietnam, placing a huge burden on the health care system. Pneumonia is also the main reason for antibiotic use in children. Unfortunately many hospital admissions for child pneumonia in Vietnam are unnecessary and inappropriate use of antibiotics is common, as in the rest of Asia, with little awareness of its adverse effects. We explored the value of an alternative approach that, instead of focusing on the identification of children with severe bacterial pneumonia, focuses on the identification of children with 'unlikely bacterial pneumonia' to improve patient care and rational antibiotic use. Implementing improved models of care require pragmatic management algorithms that are well validated, but it is ultimately dependent on financial structures, management support and evidence-based training of healthcare providers at all relevant levels. Apart from better case management, sustained reductions in the pneumonia disease burden also require increased emphasis on primary prevention.

### Advances in the causes and management of community acquired pneumonia in adults [^115zXsJX]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Community acquired pneumonia remains a common cause of morbidity and mortality. Usually, the causal organism is not identified and treatment remains empiric. Recent computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies have challenged the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, and epidemiologic studies are changing our perspective of what causes community acquired pneumonia, especially the role of viral pathogens and the frequent finding of multiple pathogens. The past decade has seen increasing overuse of empiric coverage of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic resistant Gram negative pathogens owing to inappropriate application of guidelines for healthcare associated pneumonia. Optimal treatment remains a matter for debate, especially in very sick patients, including the role of combination antibiotic therapy and corticosteroids. Pneumonia care bundles are being defined to improve outcomes. Increased recognition of both acute and long term cardiac complications is shifting our concept of pneumonia from an acute lung disease to a multisystem problem with adverse chronic health consequences.

### Community-acquired pneumonia [^111qE7Fs]. Lancet (2015). Excellent credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia causes great mortality and morbidity and high costs worldwide. Empirical selection of antibiotic treatment is the cornerstone of management of patients with pneumonia. To reduce the misuse of antibiotics, antibiotic resistance, and side-effects, an empirical, effective, and individualised antibiotic treatment is needed. Follow-up after the start of antibiotic treatment is also important, and management should include early shifts to oral antibiotics, stewardship according to the microbiological results, and short-duration antibiotic treatment that accounts for the clinical stability criteria. New approaches for fast clinical (lung ultrasound) and microbiological (molecular biology) diagnoses are promising. Community-acquired pneumonia is associated with early and late mortality and increased rates of cardiovascular events. Studies are needed that focus on the long-term management of pneumonia.

### How would you treat this patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia? grand rounds discussion from beth Israel deaconess medical center [^111p1VTX]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Community-acquired pneumonia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, leading to 1.5 million hospitalizations and at least 200 000 deaths annually. The 2019 American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America clinical practice guideline on diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia provides an evidence-based overview of this common illness. Here, 2 experts, a general internist who served as the co-primary author of the guidelines and a pulmonary and critical care physician, debate the management of a patient hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia. They discuss disease severity stratification methods, whether to use adjunctive corticosteroids, and when to prescribe empirical treatment for multidrug-resistant organisms such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### An evaluation of clinical stability criteria to predict hospital course in community-acquired pneumonia [^112X81vp]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2013). Low credibility.

A number of different methods exist to assess clinical stability, a key component of pneumonia management. We compared the prognostic value of different stability criteria through a secondary analysis of the Edinburgh pneumonia study database. We studied four clinical stability criteria (Halm's criteria, the ATS criteria, CURB and 50% or more decrease in C-reactive protein from baseline). Outcomes included 30-day mortality, need for mechanical ventilation or vasopressor support (MV/VS), development of a complicated pneumonia, and a combined outcome of the above. A total of 1079 patients (49.8% male), with a median age of 68 years (IQR 53–80), were included. Ninety-three patients (8.6%) died by day 30, 91 patients (8.4%) required MV/VS and 99 patients (9.2%) developed a complicated pneumonia. Patients with increasing severity of pneumonia on admission, assessed by both CURB-65 and PSI, took a progressively longer time to achieve clinical stability assessed by any method (p < 0.001 for all criteria). Halm's criteria had the highest area under the curve (AUC) for prediction of 30-day mortality (AUC 0.95 (0.94–0.96)), need for MV/VS (AUC 0.96 (0.95–0.97)) and combined adverse outcome (AUC 0.96 (0.95–0.97)). C-reactive protein had the highest area under the curve for complicated pneumonia (AUC 0.96 (0.95–0.97)). Adding C-reactive protein to Halm's criteria increased the area under the curve, but the difference was only statistically significant for complicated pneumonia. All of the criteria performed well in predicting adverse outcomes in patients with pneumonia. Halm's criteria performed best when identifying patients at low risk of complications.

### Pneumonia in low and middle income countries: progress and challenges [^1119NyKJ]. Thorax (2013). Low credibility.

Pneumonia remains the leading cause of childhood mortality and the most common reason for adult hospitalisation in low and middle income countries, despite advances in preventative and management strategies. In the last decade, pneumonia mortality in children has fallen to approximately 1.3 million cases in 2011, with most deaths occurring in low income countries. Important recent advances include more widespread implementation of protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type B and Streptococcus pneumoniae, implementation of case-management algorithms and better prevention and treatment of HIV. Determining the aetiology of pneumonia is challenging in the absence of reliable diagnostic tests. High uptake of new bacterial conjugate vaccines may impact on pneumonia burden, aetiology and empiric therapy but implementation in immunisation programmes in many low and middle income countries remains an obstacle. Widespread implementation of currently effective preventative and management strategies for pneumonia remains challenging in many low and middle income countries.

It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. IDSA considers adherence to these guidelines to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances. These guidelines are intended for use by healthcare professionals who care for patients at risk for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), including specialists in infectious diseases, pulmonary diseases, critical care, and surgeons, anesthesiologists, hospitalists, and any clinicians and healthcare providers caring for hospitalized patients with nosocomial pneumonia. The panel's recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of HAP and VAP are based upon evidence derived from topic-specific systematic literature reviews.

### International perspective on the new 2019 American Thoracic Society / Infectious Diseases Society of America community-acquired pneumonia guideline: a critical appraisal by a global expert panel [^115NsVZp]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

In 2019, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) issued a substantial revision of the 2007 guideline on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Despite the fact that generalization of infectious disease guidelines is limited because of substantial geographic differences in microbiologic etiology and antimicrobial resistance, the ATS/IDSA guideline is frequently applied outside the United States. Therefore, this project aimed to give a perspective on the ATS/IDSA CAP recommendations related to the management of CAP outside the United States. For this, an expert panel composed of 14 international key opinion leaders in the field of CAP from 10 countries across five continents, who were not involved in producing the 2019 guideline, was asked to subjectively name the five most useful changes, the recommendation viewed most critically, and the recommendation that cannot be applied to their respective region. There was no formal consensus process, and the article reflects different opinions. Recommendations welcomed by most of the international pneumonia experts included the abandonment of the concept of "health-care-associated pneumonia", the more restrictive indication for empiric macrolide treatment in outpatients, the increased emphasis on microbiologic diagnostics, and addressing the use of corticosteroids. Main criticisms included the somewhat arbitrary choice of a 25% resistance threshold for outpatient macrolide monotherapy. Experts from areas with elevated mycobacterial prevalence particularly opposed the recommendation of fluoroquinolones, even as an alternative.

### Management of community-acquired pneumonia in adults [^115WQTJY]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Despite many advances in medical science, the mortality rate from community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has changed little in the past four decades. Death and adverse outcomes from CAP result from a complex interplay between the pathogen and the host. Newer information about the effect of pneumonia on comorbidity and underlying diseases, especially long term, suggests this is an important additional axis that differs from the traditional triangular concept of pathogen, host defense, and antibiotic treatment. A number of clinical scoring systems have been developed to help physicians identify patients with CAP at risk of adverse outcomes. None of the criteria have been prospectively demonstrated to avoid late intensive care unit transfers or lower mortality, raising interest in the use of biomarkers such as procalcitonin. Quantitative bacterial genomic load represents a potentially important risk stratification. Optimal antibiotic management appears to include use of a macrolide, although the mechanism of benefit remains unclear. Attempts to improve CAP outcomes through setting measurable process of care standards are to be applauded, but making sure that these standards do not become the end in themselves, but rather that the entire process of care is improved, remains critical.

### Outpatient management of community-acquired pneumonia [^112fnaDL]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The first guidelines on community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) were published in 1993, but since then many of the challenges regarding the outpatient management of CAP persist. These include the difficulty in establishing the initial clinical diagnosis, its risk stratification, which will dictate the place of treatment, the empirical choice of antibiotics, the relative scarcity of novel antibiotics and the importance of knowing local microbiological susceptibility patterns.

Recent Findings

New molecular biology methods have changed the etiologic perspective of CAP, especially the contribution of virus. Lung ultrasound and biomarkers might aid diagnosis and severity stratification in the outpatient setting. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem that reinforces the importance of novel antibiotics. And finally, prevention and the use of anti-pneumococcal vaccine are instrumental in reducing the burden of disease.

Summary

Most of CAP cases are managed in the community; however, most research comes from hospitalized severe patients. New and awaited advances might contribute to aid diagnosis, cause and assessment of patients with CAP in the community. This knowledge might prove decisive in the execution of stewardship programmes that maintain current antibiotics, safeguard future ones and reinforce prevention.

### Management of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia [^1132wF1i]. Journal of Medical Virology (2021). Medium credibility.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has rapidly spread throughout the world since December 2019 to become a global public health emergency for the elevated deaths and hospitalizations in Intensive Care Units. The severity spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia ranges from mild to severe clinical conditions. The clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 disease is correlated with multiple factors including host characteristics (genetics, immune status, age, and general health), viral load and, above all, the host distribution of the airways and lungs of the viral receptor cells. In this review, we will briefly summarize the current knowledge of the characteristics and management of coronavirus disease 2019-pneumonia. However, other studies are needed to better understand the pathogenetic mechanisms induced by SARS-Cov-2 infection, and to evaluate the long-term consequences of the virus on the lungs.

### Treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompromised adults: a consensus statement regarding initial strategies [^117F8r49]. Chest (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) guidelines have improved the treatment and outcomes of patients with CAP, primarily by standardization of initial empirical therapy. But current society-published guidelines exclude immunocompromised patients.

Research Question

There is no consensus regarding the initial treatment of immunocompromised patients with suspected CAP.

Study Design and Methods

This consensus document was created by a multidisciplinary panel of 45 physicians with experience in the treatment of CAP in immunocompromised patients. The Delphi survey methodology was used to reach consensus.

Results

The panel focused on 21 questions addressing initial management strategies. The panel achieved consensus in defining the population, site of care, likely pathogens, microbiologic workup, general principles of empirical therapy, and empirical therapy for specific pathogens.

Interpretation

This document offers general suggestions for the initial treatment of the immunocompromised patient who arrives at the hospital with pneumonia.

### Severe community-acquired pneumonia: timely management measures in the first 24 hours [^116MYtde]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) has plagued humankind for millennia. Hippocrates described pneumonia as a disease which the "ancients" named, and stated that "when pneumonia is at its height, the case is beyond remedy if he is not purged". Prognosis remained bleak through the centuries. Osler, widely recognised as the father of modern medicine, called pneumonia the "captain of the men of death" in 1901. Although outcomes improved with the advent of antibiotics, CAP continues to be one of the world's leading causes of hospitalisation, morbidity, and mortality. Studies have shown that between 2 and 24% of patients presenting to hospitals with CAP require admission to an ICU. Hospital mortality rates for these patients range from 17 to 49% in large multicentre cohort studies, and there are conflicting data on whether these rates are increasing or decreasing over time.

Calls have been made to treat CAP as an emergency, with aggressive interventions to lower mortality. Unfortunately, while national and international clinical practice guidelines for CAP typically review severity assessment, diagnostic tools, and choice of antibiotics, they do not emphasise the importance of timely resuscitation and care of respiratory failure. In this review, we will explore how early and aggressive management measures may result in decreased mortality in severe CAP. We focus on the impact of management measures implemented within the first 24 hours and carried out both in the emergency department (ED) and in the ICU. These measures comprise those which specifically target severe CAP, such as identification and antibiotics, as well as those which target its complications, including septic shock and respiratory failure.

### Early weaning from oxygen therapy in African children with severe pneumonia [^11529WEz]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Major gaps exist between current treatment policies and the implementation of the potentially life-saving role of oxygen in clinical management, largely stemming from the lack of relevant research. Consequently, current treatment recommendations are based on weak evidence. The COAST trial was designed to address the evidence gaps in oxygen therapy in children with severe pneumonia. The design also reflected the contextual realities of the delivery of oxygen and respiratory support that have been widely reported across Africa. On the demand side, since children hospitalised with severe pneumonia remain a major public health concern, they constitute a substantial burden to the under-resourced health services for the adequate provision of oxygen. On the supply side, despite over two decades of investment by WHO technologies groups aimed at improving systems for delivering oxygen, this component of care appears not to have been afforded a high enough priority at both global and national levels. The issue of 'oxygen insecurity' remains a major barrier to the widespread implementation of current recommendations for severe pneumonia in hospitals with limited resources. Local data from East Africa corroborated these key barriers to oxygen implementation. In a 2019, a Ugandan survey of private and non-public hospitals (using WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care) found that only 37.5% of hospitals had oxygen for over 25% of the time. This fact was echoed in an assessment of healthcare-provider perceptions of barriers to oxygen therapy.

### The definition of pneumonia, the assessment of severity, and clinical standardization in the pneumonia etiology research for child health study [^111ayx3y]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

CLINICAL CASE DEFINITION

At the outset, we identified 5 criteria that would guide the development of a clinical case definition for PERCH: (1) It should be acceptable to and understandable by the majority of healthcare personnel throughout the developing world; (2) it should capture the essence of the global public health problem of pneumonia, which leads to 1.6 million deaths worldwide each year; (3) it should focus on children with severe pneumonia, to target a reduction in child mortality; (4) it should permit the findings of PERCH to bridge to published studies on pneumonia prevention and management over the last 30 years, and integrate with analyses of the global burden of pneumonia planned by the Child Health Epidemiology Research Group (CHERG); and (5) it should be reproducible within and between observers and within and between study sites.

Hospitalized Pneumonia

A key decision that needed to be made at the outset was how broadly to target pneumonia cases throughout the healthcare system. There is a compelling reason to begin by studying children in the community; the majority of pneumonia episodes are nonsevere and are managed in the community by healthcare workers (HCWs) at primary healthcare facilities. However, if the illness worsens, the child may progress through the hierarchy of the healthcare system from primary to secondary or tertiary care. At the same time, the etiology of pneumonia may also evolve, for example, from a viral upper respiratory tract infection to a viral lower respiratory tract infection and develop into a severe illness through superinfection of the lung by opportunistic colonizing bacteria. Studying children at all grades of severity would provide valuable insights into pneumonia pathogenesis.

However, the resources required to undertake a comprehensive etiology study at primary healthcare facilities, rather than referral hospitals, would be very considerable. The procedures used to define etiology, such as sputum induction, percutaneous lung aspiration, pleural aspiration, and gastric lavage, are not practicable without the support of an inpatient facility. The focus of the study is on severe and potentially fatal pneumonia, and the most efficient way to capture such patients is via hospital admissions.
