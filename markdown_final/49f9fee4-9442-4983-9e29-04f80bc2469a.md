## Question

Dosing for starting diltiazem drip for patient with atrial fibrillation with rvr in patient who weighs 91kg

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the correct initial dosing of a diltiazem IV continuous infusion for a 91 kg adult with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, and whether any weight-based calculation is needed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether continuous infusions are typically weight-based or fixed-rate. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled starting infusion rate and titration increments. Next, I will review guideline recommendations for infusion ranges and when to initiate. After that, I need to consider any dose adjustments for body size, age, or comorbidities. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, practical recommendation and safety considerations, anchoring to FDA labeling and major guidelines to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the standard practice, because I need to ensure we don't overcomplicate this. Diltiazem continuous IV infusions for AF/AFL with RVR are not weight-based; they start at a fixed rate and are titrated in fixed increments, unlike the loading bolus which is weight-based, so I should not try to multiply the infusion rate by 91 kg here [^115nCuxs] [^116Xz9ex].

> Wait, let me verify the labeled starting infusion rate so I don't misstate it. The FDA labeling specifies that immediately following the bolus, the recommended initial infusion rate is 10 mg/h, with the option to start as low as 5 mg/h in some patients, and titration in 5 mg/h increments up to a maximum of 15 mg/h as needed for rate control, which aligns with guideline tables listing 5–15 mg/h infusions [^114sWzoD] [^112o8Bdt].

> Hold on, I should confirm whether a bolus is required before the drip, because that affects how we interpret "starting". The FDA label and ACC/AHA guidance describe a sequence of a 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 minutes, with a second 0.35 mg/kg bolus after 15 minutes if needed, followed by the continuous infusion, so the infusion is intended to follow a bolus rather than be used in isolation in typical practice [^115nCuxs] [^112o8Bdt].

> I need to check whether body weight meaningfully alters the infusion rate selection. The fixed infusion range of 5–15 mg/h applies irrespective of body weight, and while pharmacokinetic reviews note diltiazem's large volume of distribution and lipophilicity, there is no recommendation to adjust the infusion rate for obesity or higher actual body weight, so I should not attempt a weight-based infusion calculation here [^116hBY1Q] [^115nCuxs].

> Let me consider special populations and comorbidities before finalizing. In older adults, starting at the lower end of the dosing range is prudent due to higher sensitivity, and in patients with borderline blood pressure or mild renal or hepatic impairment, beginning at 5 mg/h with cautious titration is reasonable. However, in decompensated heart failure or LVEF ≤ 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers like diltiazem are generally avoided or considered harmful, so I should confirm ejection fraction and hemodynamics before choosing diltiazem [^111WYYZm] [^114Wfo3r] [^113VKrgp].

> I should double-check the practical titration cadence and monitoring so the plan is complete. Typical practice is to reassess heart rate and blood pressure every few minutes initially, increasing by 5 mg/h every 5–15 minutes as tolerated to a maximum of 15 mg/h, with continuous ECG and frequent BP monitoring during IV therapy, and with a plan to transition to oral rate control within 24 hours when feasible [^115nCuxs] [^115Q85ip].

> Putting this together, I will now state the dosing clearly. For a 91 kg adult with AF with RVR, after administering the weight-based bolus of 0.25 mg/kg IV over 2 minutes (about 22.75 mg) and repeating with 0.35 mg/kg at 15 minutes if needed, start the continuous infusion at 10 mg/h and titrate by 5 mg/h increments every 5–15 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg/h based on heart rate and blood pressure response. If blood pressure is tenuous, consider starting at 5 mg/h and titrating more cautiously [^114sWzoD] [^112o8Bdt].

> But wait, what if someone argues for a weight-based infusion because of pharmacokinetic variability in obesity? Hmm, wait a minute, the clinical literature and labeling do not support weight-based infusion rates for diltiazem. While Vd is large, the infusion is designed as a fixed-rate titration to effect, and dose adjustments are driven by clinical response rather than body weight, so I should not extrapolate a weight multiplier to the infusion rate [^116hBY1Q] [^115nCuxs].

> Finally, I need to ensure safety guardrails are explicit. Monitor for hypotension and bradycardia, avoid coadministration with other AV nodal blockers in close proximity, and be prepared to reduce or stop the infusion if the patient becomes unstable. In patients with accessory pathway–mediated AF, diltiazem is contraindicated due to risk of accelerating ventricular response, so I should confirm the ECG and clinical context before proceeding [^117GJMKM] [^116915Yk].

---

For a 91 kg patient with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response, the recommended starting diltiazem drip is **10 mg/h IV** [^114sWzoD] after a 0.25 mg/kg IV bolus over 2 minutes [^112o8Bdt]. Titrate by 5 mg/h every 15 minutes to a maximum of 15 mg/h as needed for rate control [^112mpG8y]. Monitor ECG, blood pressure, and heart rate continuously during infusion [^115nCuxs].

---

## Recommended dosing protocol

### Initial IV bolus dose

The initial IV bolus dose is **0.25 mg/kg IV** over 2 minutes [^114sWzoD] [^112o8Bdt]. For a 91 kg patient, this equals 22.75 mg (round to 23 mg) [^114sWzoD]. If the response is inadequate after 15 minutes, administer a second bolus of **0.35 mg/kg IV** over 2 minutes (31.85 mg; round to 32 mg) [^114sWzoD] [^116Xz9ex].

---

### Continuous IV infusion (drip)

- **Initial infusion rate**: 10 mg/h IV immediately following the bolus [^114sWzoD].
- **Titration**: Increase by 5 mg/h every 15 minutes as needed, up to a maximum of 15 mg/h [^112mpG8y] [^115nCuxs].
- **Duration**: Continue infusion for up to 24 hours, then transition to oral therapy [^114sWzoD] [^115nCuxs].

---

## Clinical considerations and precautions

- **Hemodynamic monitoring**: Continuous ECG, blood pressure, and heart rate monitoring are essential during infusion [^115nCuxs].
- **Hypotension risk**: Diltiazem can cause hypotension; monitor closely and adjust infusion as needed [^113CQyxM].
- **Heart failure**: Use caution in patients with heart failure or impaired ventricular function [^114Wfo3r] [^113CQyxM].
- **Drug interactions**: Diltiazem is a CYP3A4 substrate and inhibitor; review concomitant medications for interactions [^112mpG8y] [^111CCwEU].

---

## Alternative rate control agents

If diltiazem is contraindicated or not tolerated, consider **metoprolol or esmolol** as alternatives for acute rate control in hemodynamically stable patients [^116MyH8A] [^114Y4yqy].

## Diltiazem dosing for 91 kg patient

| **Step** | **Dose** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Initial bolus | 23 mg IV over 2 min | 0.25 mg/kg |
| Second bolus (if needed) | 32 mg IV over 2 min | 0.35 mg/kg after 15 min |
| Initial infusion | 10 mg/h IV | Start immediately after bolus |
| Titration | Increase by 5 mg/h every 15 min | Max 15 mg/h |
| Duration | Up to 24 hours | Transition to oral therapy after |

---

The recommended starting diltiazem drip for a 91 kg patient with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response is **10 mg/h IV**, titrated to a maximum of 15 mg/h as needed, following the initial IV bolus dose [^114sWzoD].

### Adenosine versus fixed-dose intravenous bolus diltiazem on reversing supraventricular tachycardia in the emergency department: a multi-center cohort study [^117FTiPK]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a common and therapeutically challenging cardiac dysrhythmia in the emergency department (ED). Adenosine and diltiazem are the most used pharmacological agents for SVT management, but few comparative studies exist.

Objective

To compare the efficacy of bolus intravenous (IV) adenosine versus diltiazem in the termination of spontaneous SVT.

Methods

This was a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study conducted in EDs in North Texas. Eligible subjects were adult patients presenting with stable SVT who received either a bolus of IV adenosine or diltiazem as the initial treatment. The primary outcome was the rate of successful conversion, which was defined as a sustained sinus rhythm within 30 min of the initial treatment. Secondary outcomes included time to conversion and response doses.

Results

A total of 344 cases were incorporated into the final analysis, 310 in the adenosine-first group and 34 in the diltiazem-first group. The rate of successful conversion trended higher for diltiazem; however, the difference was not significantly different (66.8% adenosine, 82.4% diltiazem, p = 0.08). The median time to conversion was significantly shorter for the adenosine group (3.0 min) to the diltiazem group (6.0 min, p = 0.02), with median response dosages of 12 mg and 15 mg, respectively. Of the cases that failed adenosine monotherapy, 18 (35%) were successfully rescued by diltiazem. Diltiazem also successfully controlled 77% of conversions to atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter without hypotensive events.

Conclusion

This study showed that diltiazem and adenosine had similar conversion rates. In addition, diltiazem effectively rescued cases not responsive to adenosine.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

In domestic controlled trials in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in reducing heart rate by at least 20% in 95% of patients. Diltiazem hydrochloride injection rarely converts atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. Following administration of one or two intravenous bolus doses of diltiazem injection, response usually occurs within 3 minutes and maximal heart rate reduction generally occurs in 2 to 7 minutes. Heart rate reduction may last from 1 to 3 hours. If hypotension occurs, it is generally short-lived, but may last from 1 to 3 hours.

A 24-hour continuous infusion of diltiazem injection in the treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter maintained at least a 20% heart rate reduction during the infusion in 83% of patients. Upon discontinuation of infusion, heart rate reduction may last from 0.5 hours to more than 10 hours (median duration 7 hours). Hypotension, if it occurs, may be similarly persistent.

In the controlled clinical trials, 3.2% of patients required some form of intervention (typically, use of intravenous fluids or the Trendelenburg position) for blood pressure support following diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In domestic controlled trials, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm in 88% of patients within 3 minutes of the first or second bolus dose.

Symptoms associated with the arrhythmia were improved in conjunction with decreased heart rate or conversion to normal sinus rhythm following administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In controlled clinical trials, therapy with antiarrhythmic agents to maintain reduced heart rate in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or for prophylaxis of PSVT was generally started within 3 hours after bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride. These antiarrhythmic agents were intravenous or oral digoxin, Class 1 antiarrhythmics (e.g., quinidine, procainamide), calcium channel blockers, and oral beta-blockers.

### Weight-based versus non-weight-based diltiazem dosing in the setting of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^115TMwM7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

There is conflicting evidence to support the superiority of weight-based (WB) dosing of intravenous (IV) diltiazem over non-weight-based (NWB) dosing strategies in the management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

A retrospective review evaluated patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) in AFib with RVR and receiving IV diltiazem from 2015 to 2018. Those receiving a NWB dose were compared with those receiving a WB dose based on actual body weight (ABW). Secondary analyses evaluated safety profiles of the regimens and compared response in groups defined by ABW or ideal body weight (IBW).

Results

A total of 371 patients were included in the analysis. No significant difference was observed in achieving a therapeutic response (66.5% vs. 73.1%, p = 0.18) or adverse events between the groups. Patients receiving a WB dose were significantly more likely to have a HR < 100 bpm than those receiving a NWB dose (40.9% vs. 53.5%, p = 0.01). When groups were defined by IBW, WB dosing was associated with a significantly higher incidence of achieving a therapeutic response (62.7% vs. 74.3%, p = 0.02).

Conclusion

In patients presenting with AF with RVR, there was no significant difference in achieving a therapeutic response between the two strategies. A WB dosing approach did result in a greater proportion of patients with a HR < 100 bpm. The utilization of IBW for WB dosing may result in an increased achievement of a therapeutic response.

### Diltiazem hci [^113CQyxM]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of diltiazem hydrochloride IV (also known as Cardizem):
- **Drug-induced liver injury**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as diltiazem may cause acute liver injury with elevations in liver enzymes.
- **Exacerbation of HF**: use caution in patients with congestive HF or impaired ventricular function.
- **Hypotension**: use caution in patients with hemodynamically compromised supraventricular arrhythmias or taking other drugs decreasing peripheral resistance, intravascular volume, myocardial contractility, or conduction.
- **Premature ventricular contractions**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as transient premature ventricular contractions may occur on conversion of paroxysmal SVT to sinus rhythm.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control in noncardiac, nonthoracic postoperative atrial fibrillation [^112QN4a7]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Little guidance exists on effective management of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) following noncardiac, nonthoracic (NCNT) surgery.

Objectives

The purpose of this study was to identify whether a difference exists between intravenous (IV) metoprolol and diltiazem when used to achieve hemodynamically stable rate control in POAF following NCNT surgery.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study examined critically ill adult surgical patients experiencing POAF with rapid ventricular response. Inclusion in the metoprolol or diltiazem treatment group was determined by the initial rate control agent chosen by the prescriber. The primary end point was hemodynamically stable rate control, defined by heart rate (HR) < 110 beats/min and blood pressure > 90 mm Hg, maintained for 6 hours.

Main Results

Patients on metoprolol (n = 66) and diltiazem (n = 55) were similar in age, comorbidities, surgical procedure distribution, acuity of illness, and home rate and rhythm control medications continued during hospitalization; 76% of diltiazem-treated patients achieved hemodynamically stable rate control, compared with only 53% of those receiving metoprolol (P = 0.005). Safety end points were similar between groups, including the portion requiring a new vasopressor or fluid bolus for hemodynamic support.

Conclusions

In NCNT surgery, patients with POAF, IV diltiazem more effectively controlled HR and hemodynamics compared with metoprolol. Results warrant further research into optimal medical management of POAF in this population using these 2 agents.

### Evaluation of metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control of atrial fibrillation in the emergency department [^1154hvrQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of the metoprolol and diltiazem administration in the Emergency Department (ED) for rate control of supraventricular tachycardia.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of adult patients who presented to the ED with ventricular rates ≥ 120 beats per minute (bpm) and who received bolus doses of either intravenous metoprolol or intravenous diltiazem. The primary outcome was achievement of rate control, defined as heart rate < 110 bpm, at two hours after administration of the last bolus dose of metoprolol or diltiazem. Safety outcomes included occurrence of hypotension, defined as systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure < 60 mmHg, and bradycardia, defined as heart rate < 60 bpm.

Results

There were 166 patients receiving metoprolol and 183 patients receiving diltiazem included in the study. The primary outcome, rate control at two hours after the last bolus dose of metoprolol or diltiazem was similar between the two groups (45.8% vs 42.6%, p = 0.590, respectively). The percentage of patients achieving rate control was also similar (47.0% vs 41.6%, p = 0.333) at one hour. At 0.5 h HR had a significantly greater numerical (diltiazem: 29.3 ± 23.1 bpm vs metoprolol: 21.8 ± 18.9 bpm, p = 0.012) and percent decrease (21.1% vs 15.94%, p = 0.014) in the diltiazem group compared to metoprolol. There was no significant difference in occurrence of bradycardia in the two groups (diltiazem: 3.83% vs metoprolol: 1.2%, p = 0.179). More patients in the diltiazem group compared to the metoprolol group experienced hypotension (39.3% vs 23.5%, p = 0.002). The difference in systolic hypotension events was not significantly different (9.29% vs 5.42%, p = 0.221), while the difference in diastolic hypotension events was significantly different (37.7% vs 22.3%, p = 0.002).

Conclusion

There was no difference in acute rate control effectiveness two hours after the last bolus dose of diltiazem and metoprolol for supraventricular tachycardias. There was a significantly higher occurrence of hypotension in the diltiazem group which was driven by higher rates of diastolic blood pressures less than 60 mmHg.

### Reducing diltiazem-related hypotension in atrial fibrillation: role of pretreatment intravenous calcium [^111pupkx]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study evaluated the efficacy of intravenous (IV) calcium pretreatment for preventing diltiazem-induced hypotension and assessed its safety in adult patients with atrial fibrillation (AF)/atrial flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 217 adults with AF/AFL and a ventricular rate > 120 beats per minute, who were randomized into three groups: those who received an IV NaCl 0.9% placebo pretreatment prior to IV diltiazem (PD; 73 patients) and those who received 90 mg (C90D; 71 patients) and 180 mg (C180D; 73 patients) IV calcium chloride pretreatment before IV diltiazem. We compared participants' systolic blood pressure (SBP) and heart rate (HR) at baseline and at 5, 10, and 15 min post-treatment, as well as the incidence of adverse events (e.g., hypotension, urticaria, nausea) among the groups.

Results

The PD and C90D pretreatment groups had significantly lower HR measurements at 10 and 15 min compared to the C180D group. In addition, at 5 min, the mean SBP in the PD group was significantly lower compared to the C90D and C180D groups. At 10 min, the mean SBP was significantly higher in the C180D group than in the other groups. Furthermore, at 15 min, the mean SBP was significantly higher in both the C90D and C180D groups than in the PD group. There were no significant differences between the calcium pretreatment and placebo groups in terms of the need for additional diltiazem doses or the incidence of adverse events.

Conclusion

IV calcium pretreatment effectively prevents diltiazem-induced hypotension in patients with AF/AFL with RVR without compromising the efficacy of diltiazem in achieving and maintaining ventricular rate control.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of diltiazem did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

### Intravenous diltiazem infusions for rapid atrial fibrillation or flutter in the emergency department: a retrospective, exploratory analysis [^112ZnihR]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Emergency physicians commonly treat patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response, and intravenous (IV) diltiazem is the most commonly used medication for rate control of such patients. We sought to compare rate control success and safety outcomes for emergency department (ED) patients with AF or AFL who, after a diltiazem bolus, received a diltiazem drip compared to those who did not receive a drip.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study comparing outcomes of ED patients from a single hospital system with AF and AFL and a heart rate (HR) > 100 beats/min who received a diltiazem drip after an IV diltiazem bolus to those who received no drip. The primary outcome was a HR < 100 beats/min at the time of ED disposition. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay and safety (hypotension, electrical cardioversion, vasopressor use, and death). We compared groups using propensity score matching.

Results

Between January 1, 2020, and November 8, 2022, there were 746 AF or AFL patients eligible for analysis. Of those, 382 (51.2%) received a diltiazem drip and 364 (48.8%) did not. In the unadjusted analysis, the last recorded ED HR was < 100 beats/min in 55.2% of patients in the drip group compared to 65.9% in the no-drip group (difference 10.7%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.7 to 17.7). After propensity matching, diltiazem drip use was associated with lower likelihood of rate control in the ED (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48–0.99) and 22.5h (95% CI 12.2–36.8) longer hospital stay.

Conclusions

For patients with AF or AFL, the use of a diltiazem drip after an IV diltiazem bolus was associated with less rate control in the ED.

### Effect of obesity on the use of antiarrhythmics in adults with atrial fibrillation: a narrative review [^111FTv7R]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

3.2 Antiarrhythmics Not Influenced by Obesity and Body Weight

Four studies investigated the effect of obesity on dofetilide. All four studies were observational, in which three were conducted retrospectively investigating the superior dosing method in obese adults. The findings from these three studies were inconsistent. Cao et al. argued that dofetilide can be dosed based on the current method (i.e. actual body weight), whereas Anderson et al. and Wang et al. concluded that caution should be used when dosing is based on total body weight, especially in females. In contrast, the study by Ornelas‐Loredo et al. reported the influence of obesity only on sodium channel blockers, in agreement with findings from Cao et al.

Two studies investigated diltiazem (IV) dosing methods in different body weights. Ward et al. found no significant difference (66.5% vs. 73.1%; p = 0.18) between weight‐based and non‐weight‐based dosing to achieve a therapeutic response. However, patients who were dosed based on weight were more likely to have a heart rate below 100 beats per minute (40.9% vs. 53.5%; p = 0.01). Although this suggests that diltiazem is dependent on weight, the authors also found that when stratified based on ideal weight, the weight‐based dosing group achieved a significantly higher incidence of therapeutic response (62.7% vs. 74.3%; p = 0.02). Similar results were found by Zimmerman et al. who did not find a significant difference between the total dose (28.7 vs. 34.3 mg; p = 0.068) or time (2.3 vs. 2.3 h; p = 0.949) to reach the goal heart rate for patients weighing < 100 kg versus ≥ 100 kg.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial flutter — acute treatment (2015 ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline) lists Class I recommendations: I A — oral dofetilide or intravenous ibutilide is useful for acute pharmacological cardioversion in patients with atrial flutter, with intravenous ibutilide converting atrial flutter to sinus rhythm in approximately 60% of cases; the major risk is torsades de pointes, patients receiving ibutilide should undergo continuous ECG monitoring during administration and for at least 4 hours after completion of dosing, and pretreatment with magnesium can increase the efficacy and reduce the risk of torsades de pointes. I B-R — intravenous or oral beta blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil are useful for acute rate control in patients with atrial flutter who are hemodynamically stable. I B-NR — elective synchronized cardioversion is indicated to stabilize patients with well-tolerated atrial flutter when a rhythm-control strategy is being pursued, and I B-NR — synchronized cardioversion is recommended for acute treatment of patients with atrial flutter who are hemodynamically unstable and do not respond to pharmacological therapies. I C-LD — rapid atrial pacing is useful for acute conversion of atrial flutter in patients who have pacing wires in place as part of a permanent pacemaker or implantable cardioverter–defibrillator or for temporary atrial pacing after cardiac surgery; atrial pacing is effective at terminating flutter in > 50% of cases, and pace-termination is performed by pacing approximately 5% to 10% above the atrial flutter rate and by maintaining pacing for ≥ 15 seconds with repeated attempts at incrementally faster rates (reducing the pacing cycle length by 5 to 10 ms) until normal sinus rhythm or AF occurs.

### DOsing strategy effectiveness of diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^1174Gczn]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

To evaluate the dose-dependent comparative safety and effectiveness between weight-based and alternative dosing strategies for diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study included adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response who received treatment with intravenous diltiazem. Groups were retrospectively categorized according to the initial dose: low (< 0.1875 mg/kg), weight-based (0.1875 to 0.3125 mg/kg), and high (> 0.3125 mg/kg). The primary outcome was rate control (heart rate < 100 beats/min) within 30 minutes of treatment.

Results

Of 345 records, 252 were included. Because of scarcity (N = 6), outcomes for the high-dose group were not analyzed. By 30 minutes, the weight-based dosing group had more often achieved rate control (weight-based 55%; low 27%; difference 29% [95% confidence interval (CI) 17% to 40%]). Regression analysis identified the weight-based dosing group (odds ratio 3.63, 95% CI 2.06 to 6.39) and initial heart rate of less than 145 beats/min (odds ratio 2.56, 95% CI 1.46 to 4.51) as variables associated with the primary outcome. The weight-based dosing group less often required rescue therapy (weight-based 6%; low 17%; difference -12% [95% CI -20% to -4%]) relative to the low-dose group. Mortality was higher in the low-dose group than in the weight-based dosing group (low 7%; weight-based 1%; difference 6% [95% CI 1% to 11%]).

Conclusion

This study shows dose-dependent hemodynamic effects with diltiazem in patients with atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response. Weight-based diltiazem (0.25 mg/kg) was associated with greater rate control with no evidence of increased adverse effects. There was no perceived advantage in using lower, alternative doses.

### Hemodynamic comparison of intravenous push diltiazem versus metoprolol for atrial fibrillation rate control [^115j9vYP]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Intravenous push (IVP) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used for management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED). This study's objective was to determine if there was a significant difference in blood pressure reduction between agents.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients initially treated with IVP diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED from 2008 to 2018. Primary endpoint was mean reduction in systolic blood pressure (SBP) from baseline to nadir during the study period. Study period was defined as time from first dose of IVP intervention to 30 min after last dose of IVP intervention or first dose of maintenance therapy, whichever came first.

Results

A total of 63 diltiazem patients and 45 metoprolol patients met eligibility criteria. Baseline characteristics were similar except for initial ventricular rate (VR) and home beta-blocker use. Median dose of initial intervention was 10 [10–20] mg and 5 [5–5] mg for diltiazem and metoprolol respectively. Mean SBP reduction was 18 ± 22 mmHg for diltiazem compared to 14 ± 15 mmHg for metoprolol (p = .33). Clinically relevant hypotension was similar between groups 14% vs. 16% (p = .86). Rate control was achieved in 35 (56%) of the diltiazem group and 16 (36%) of the metoprolol group (p = .04).

Conclusion

IVP diltiazem and metoprolol caused similar SBP reduction and hypotension when used for initial management of AF with RVR in the ED. However, rate control was achieved more often with diltiazem.

### Acute rate control with metoprolol versus diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^1117qHaG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Compare heart rate control between parenteral metoprolol and diltiazem and identify safety outcomes in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AFib) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective, single-center, cohort study included adult patients with HFrEF who received intravenous (IV) metoprolol or diltiazem for AFib RVR in the emergency department (ED). The primary outcome was rate control defined as HR < 100 bpm or a HR reduction ≥ 20% within 30 min of first dose administration. The secondary outcomes included rate control within 60 min and 120 min from first dose, need for repeat dosing, and disposition. Safety outcomes included hypotensive and bradycardic events.

Results

Out of 552 patients, 45 patients met the inclusion criteria with 15 in the metoprolol group and 30 in the diltiazem group. Using bootstrapping method, patients treated with metoprolol were equally able to reach the primary outcome as those treated with diltiazem (BCa 95% CI: 0.14, 4.31). Hypotensive and bradycardia events remained zero in both groups.

Conclusion

Our study provides further evidence that short term use of diltiazem is likely as safe and effective as metoprolol in the acute management of HFrEF patients with AFib RVR and provides support for the use of non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (non-DHP CCBs) in this patient population.

### Comparison of weight-based dose vs. standard dose diltiazem in patients with atrial fibrillation presenting to the emergency department [^1114fh3d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Despite evidence-based recommended weight-based (WB) dosing of diltiazem for the initial treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR), many providers utilize lower initial doses of diltiazem.

Objective

We sought to determine whether a low, standard dose of diltiazem is noninferior to WB diltiazem as an initial bolus dose in the treatment of AF with RVR.

Methods

This retrospective review included patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) of an urban, academic tertiary medical center experiencing AF with RVR from November 2010 to August 2014. Adult patients were categorized by the dose of diltiazem received; 10 mg standard dose or 0.2–0.3 mg/kg WB dose. The primary outcome of successful treatment was defined as a composite of the following parameters 15 min after the initial bolus dose: heart rate (HR) < 100 beats/min, reduction of HR ≥ 20%, or a conversion to normal sinus rhythm.

Results

Four hundred and fifty-six patients who received diltiazem were included for study evaluation (standard dose: n = 255 patients, WB: n = 201 patients). Baseline characteristics, medical history, and medication use before ED presentation were similar between the groups. Significant differences at baseline between the groups included weight and HR at presentation. The primary outcome of successful treatment was attained in 60.8% of the standard dose patients and 68.7% of the WB patients (p = 0.082).

Conclusions

In patients presenting to the ED, we found that standard dose diltiazem was noninferior to WB dosing in the initial treatment of AF with RVR.

### What is the best agent for rate control of atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response? [^11737sxq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common dysrhythmia associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although many patients have stable AF, some patients can present with a rapid ventricular response (RVR). In these patients, it is important to lower their heart rate. However, there are several options available for rate control in the emergency department setting.

Clinical Question

What is the most effective agent for rate control for the patient with AF in RVR?

Evidence Review

Studies retrieved included two prospective, randomized, double-blind studies and six retrospective cohort studies. These studies provide estimates of the efficacy and safety of calcium channel blockers and β-blockers for rate control in those with AF with RVR.

Conclusion

Based upon the available literature, diltiazem likely achieves rate control faster than metoprolol, though both agents seem safe and effective. Clinicians must consider the individual patient, clinical situation, and comorbidities when selecting a medication for rate control.

Calcium channel blockers

Non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (verapamil or diltiazem) are not recommended in patients with significantly impaired left ventricular function due to their negative inotropic effects, although specific data are limited. In the Multicenter Diltiazem Postinfarction Trial, patients were randomized to diltiazem or placebo 3–15 days after the onset of myocardial infarction.HF patients, including 490 with evidence of pulmonary congestion, had an increase in the composite of cardiac death or non-fatal re-infarction (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.01–1.96). In subsequent analysis, diltiazem was found to increase late-onset HF in those with LVEF < 40%. Verapamil did not improve outcomes after myocardial infarction in patients who developed HF in the Danish Verapamil Infarction Trials.

Heart rate targets for atrial fibrillation in the context of heart failure and reduced ejection fraction

Following the publication of the Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RACE II) trial, patients with AF can initially be treated to a more lenient heart rate regime (< 110 beats/min resting heart rate). To summarize, 614 patients with permanent AF were randomized to a heart rate < 80 b.p.m. at rest and < 110 b.p.m. during moderate exercise or lenient control, with results showing a similar rate of composite clinical events in each arm. There were also no differences in functional outcomes, hospital admissions, or symptoms. Fifteen percent of the population had LVEF < 40% but it remains unclear if these targets apply to AF patients with HFrEF. However, these findings are consistent with other results, and would suggest that heart rate in AF is more a marker of disease than a therapeutic target and that a lenient heart rate may be acceptable if symptoms are controlled and tachycardia is avoided. It is worth noting that other guideline recommendations continue to advocate a resting heart rate < 80 b.p.m. in patients with symptomatic AF and left ventricular dysfunction.

Specific rhythm-control strategies

Cardioversion

The first step in rhythm control is the restoration of sinus rhythm, which often requires cardioversion. Urgent cardioversion is recommended in any patient with significant haemodynamic impairment secondary to AF. Elective cardioversion is indicated in individuals with symptomatic persistent AF. Unfortunately, recurrence of AF after successful cardioversion is a frequent problem (∼50% at 6 months), particularly in patients with HF. Over half of inpatients undergoing cardioversion for atrial arrhythmias have HF.

### Acute management of atrial fibrillation in congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in the emergency department [^1169NLP5]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute heart rate control for atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the emergency department (ED) is often achieved utilizing intravenous (IV) non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) or beta blockers (BB). For patients with concomitant heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the American Heart Association and other clinical groups note that CCB should be avoided due to their potential negative inotropic effects. However, minimal evidence exists to guide this current recommendation. The primary objective of this study was to compare the incidence of adverse effects in the HFrEF patient population whose AF with RVR was treated with IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED.

Methods

This single center, retrospective review included patients ≥ 18 years old with HFrEF who presented in AF with RVR and received IV diltiazem or metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was adverse effects of therapy defined as: 1) hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg requiring fluid bolus or vasopressors) or bradycardia (heart rate < 60 beats/min) within 60 min of medication administration 2) worsening heart failure symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirements within four hours or inotropic support within 48 h. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of rate control failure, patient disposition, ED length of stay, hospital length of stay, and in-hospital mortality.

Results

One hundred and twenty-five patients met inclusion criteria, with 57 receiving diltiazem and 68 receiving metoprolol. Overall adverse effects for diltiazem and metoprolol were similar (32% vs. 21%, P = 0.217). However, there was a significantly higher incidence of worsening heart failure symptoms within the diltiazem group (33% vs 15%, P = 0.019). Rate control failure at 60 min did not differ significantly between diltiazem and metoprolol (51% vs 62%, P = 0.277).

Conclusions

In HFrEF patients with AF, there was no difference in total adverse events in patients treated with IV diltiazem compared to metoprolol. However, the diltiazem group had a higher incidence of worsening CHF symptoms defined as increased oxygen requirement within four hours or initiation of inotropic support within 48 h.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE in SODIUM CHLORIDE) [^114Y7a1R]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The systemic clearance of diltiazem has been found to be decreased in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, compared to healthy volunteers. In patients administered continuous infusions at 10 mg/h or 15 mg/h for 24 h, diltiazem systemic clearance averaged 42 L/h and 31 L/h, respectively. The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 3.4 h. Total radioactivity measurement following short IV administration in healthy volunteers suggests the presence of other unidentified metabolites which attain higher concentrations than those of diltiazem and are more slowly eliminated; half-life of total radioactivity is about 20 h compared to 2 to 5 h for diltiazem.

After constant rate intravenous infusion to healthy male volunteers, diltiazem exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics over an infusion range of 4.8 to 13.2 mg/h for 24 h. Over this infusion range, as the dose is increased, systemic clearance decreases from 64 to 48 L/h while the plasma elimination half-life increases from 4.1 to 4.9 h. The volume of distribution remains unchanged (360 to 391 L).

Specific Populations

Renal insufficiency, or even end-stage renal disease, does not appear to influence diltiazem disposition following oral administration. Liver cirrhosis reduces diltiazem's apparent clearance and prolong its half-life.

In circumstances when a beta blocker cannot be used, administration of a nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist (diltiazem or verapamil) is recommended to control the ventricular rate in patients with AF and thyrotoxicosis. In patients with AF associated with thyrotoxicosis, oral anticoagulation (INR 2.0 to 3.0) is recommended to prevent thromboembolism, as recommended for AF patients with other risk factors for stroke. Once a euthyroid state is restored, recommendations for antithrombotic prophylaxis are the same as for patients without hyperthyroidism.

CONTRAINDICATIONS

Injectable forms of diltiazem are contraindicated in:

Patients with sick sinus syndrome except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with second- or third-degree AV block except in the presence of a functioning ventricular pacemaker.

Patients with severe hypotension or cardiogenic shock.

Patients who have demonstrated hypersensitivity to the drug.

Intravenous diltiazem and intravenous beta-blockers should not be administered together or in close proximity (within a few hours).

Patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract such as in WPW syndrome or short PR syndrome.

As with other agents which slow AV nodal conduction and do not prolong the refractoriness of the accessory pathway (e.g., verapamil, digoxin), in rare instances patients in atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter associated with an accessory bypass tract may experience a potentially life-threatening increase in heart rate accompanied by hypotension when treated with injectable forms of diltiazem. As such, the initial use of injectable forms of diltiazem should be, if possible, in a setting where monitoring and resuscitation capabilities, including DC cardioversion/defibrillation, are present (see OVERDOSAGE). Once familiarity of the patient's response is established, use in an office setting may be acceptable.

Patients with ventricular tachycardia. Administration of other calcium channel blockers to patients with wide complex tachycardia (QRS ≥ 0.12 seconds) has resulted in hemodynamic deterioration and ventricular fibrillation. It is important that an accurate pretreatment diagnosis distinguish wide complex QRS tachycardia of supraventricular origin from that of ventricular origin prior to administration of injectable forms of diltiazem.

### Diltiazem hydrochloride (DILTIAZEM HYDROCHLORIDE in SODIUM CHLORIDE) [^115nCuxs]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 General Considerations

Administer intravenous diltiazem in a setting with continuous monitoring of the ECG and frequent measurement of blood pressure. A defibrillator and emergency equipment should be readily available.

Diltiazem Hydrochloride in Sodium Chloride Injection is a ready to administer product that requires no further dilution prior to infusion. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit.

2.2 Intravenous Single Injection

The initial dose of diltiazem hydrochloride should be 0.25 mg/kg actual body weight administered over 2 minutes (20 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). If response is inadequate, a second dose may be administered after 15 minutes. The second dose of diltiazem hydrochloride should be 0.35 mg/kg actual body weight administered over 2 minutes (25 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). Subsequent intravenous bolus doses should be individualized.

2.3 Continuous Intravenous Infusion

Immediately following bolus, the recommended initial infusion rate of diltiazem hydrochloride is 5 mg/hour. Adjust the infusion rate in 5 mg/hour increments up to a maximum of 15 mg/hour as needed to achieve satisfactory rate control. Infusions longer than 24 hours have not been studied. Patients should generally be transitioned to other antiarrhythmic agents within 24 hours [see Clinical Studies (14)].

2.4 Physical Incompatibilities

Do not mix diltiazem hydrochloride with any other drugs in the same container. If possible, use a dedicated line for diltiazem hydrochloride.

Diltiazem hydrochloride has demonstrated physical incompatibilities with acetazolamide, acyclovir, aminophylline, ampicillin, ampicillin sodium/sulbactam sodium, cefamandole, cefoperazone, diazepam, furosemide, hydrocortisone sodium succinate, insulin (regular: 100 units/mL), methylprednisolone sodium succinate, mezlocillin, nafcillin, phenytoin, rifampin, and sodium bicarbonate.

### Management of atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response in patients with acute decompensated heart failure: a systematic review [^1168cN3w]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective was to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and safety of pharmacological and nonpharmacological management options for atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response (AFRVR) in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) in the acute care setting.

Methods

This study was a systematic review of observational studies or randomized clinical trials (RCT) of adult patients with AFRVR and concomitant ADHF in the emergency department (ED), intensive care unit, or step-down unit. The primary effectiveness outcome was successful rate or rhythm control. Safety outcomes were adverse events, such as symptomatic hypotension and venous thromboembolism.

Results

A total of 6577 unique articles were identified. Five studies met inclusion criteria: one RCT in the inpatient setting and four retrospective studies, two in the ED and the other three in the inpatient setting. In the RCT of diltiazem versus placebo, 22 patients (100%) in the treatment group had a therapeutic response compared to 0/15 (0%) in the placebo group, with no significant safety differences between the two groups. For three of the observational studies, data were limited. One observation study showed no difference between metoprolol and diltiazem for successful rate control, but worsening heart failure symptoms occurred more frequently in those receiving diltiazem compared to metoprolol (19 patients [33%] vs. 10 patients [15%], p = 0.019). A single study included electrical cardioversion (one patient exposed with failure to convert to sinus rhythm) as nonpharmacological management. The overall risk of bias for included studies ranged from serious to critical. Missing data and heterogeneity of definitions for effectiveness and safety outcomes precluded the combination of results for quantitative meta-analysis.

Conclusions

High-level evidence to inform clinical decision making regarding effective and safe management of AFRVR in patients with ADHF in the acute care setting is lacking.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Intravenous diltiazem hydrochloride 20 mg prolongs AH conduction time and AV node functional and effective refractory periods by approximately 20%. PR in healthy volunteers and HR in patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter are dependent on plasma level of diltiazem. Based on this relationship, the mean plasma diltiazem concentration required to produce a 20%, 30% and 40% decrease in heart rate was determined to be 80 ng/mL, 130 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL, respectively.

In patients with cardiovascular disease, diltiazem hydrochloride administered intravenously in single bolus doses, followed in some cases by a continuous infusion, reduced blood pressure, systemic vascular resistance, the rate-pressure product, and coronary vascular resistance and increased coronary blood flow. In a limited number of studies of patients with compromised myocardium (severe congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), administration of intravenous diltiazem produced no significant effect on contractility, left ventricular end diastolic pressure, or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. The mean ejection fraction and cardiac output/index remained unchanged or increased. Maximal hemodynamic effects usually occurred within 2 to 5 minutes of an injection. However, in rare instances, worsening of congestive heart failure has been reported in patients with preexisting impaired ventricular function.

### Comparison of sustained rate control in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: metoprolol vs. diltiazem [^117Nsyuh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare sustained rate control with intravenous (IV) diltiazem vs. IV metoprolol in acute treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

This retrospective chart review at a large, academic medical center identified patients with AF with RVR diagnosis who received IV diltiazem or IV metoprolol in the ED. The primary outcome was sustained rate control defined as heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute without need for rescue IV medication for 3 h following initial rate control attainment. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control, HR at initial control and 3 h, time to oral dose, admission rates, and safety outcomes.

Results

Between January 1, 2016 and November 1, 2018, 51 patients met inclusion criteria (diltiazem n = 32, metoprolol n = 19). No difference in sustained rate control was found (diltiazem 87.5% vs. metoprolol 78.9%, p = 0.45). Time to rate control was significantly shorter with diltiazem compared to metoprolol (15 min vs. 30 min, respectively, p = 0.04). Neither hypotension nor bradycardia were significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Choice of rate control agent for acute management of AF with RVR did not significantly influence sustained rate control success. Safety outcomes did not differ between treatment groups.

### Amiodarone versus diltiazem for rate control in critically ill patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias [^1137oYJU]. Critical Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the rate-lowering effect of diltiazem and two amiodarone regimens in critically ill patients with recent-onset atrial tachyarrhythmias.

Design

Prospective, randomized, controlled study.

Setting

Medical cardiologic intensive care unit in a university hospital.

Patients

Sixty critically ill patients (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] III score 70 ± 30, age 67 ± 10 yrs).

Interventions

Patients with atrial fibrillation (n = 57), atrial flutter (n = 2), or atrial tachycardia (n = 1, and a heart rate consistently > 120 beats/min over 30 mins were randomly assigned to one of three intravenous treatment regimens. Group 1 received diltiazem in a 25-mg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg/hr for 24 hrs, group 2 received amiodarone in a 300-mg bolus, and group 3 received amiodarone in a 300-mg bolus followed by 45 mg/hr for 24 hrs.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary study end point was a > 30% rate reduction within 4 hrs. The secondary study end point was a heart rate < 120 beats/min (a patient was considered to have uncontrolled tachycardia if heart rate was > 120 beats/min 4 hrs after study drug). The primary study end point was achieved in 14/20 (70%), 11/20 (55%), and 15/20 (75%) of patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively (chi2 = 1.95, p = .38). Uncontrolled tachycardia was more frequently observed in group 2 (0/20, 9/29 [55%], and 1/20 [5%] of patients in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively; chi2 = 17, p = .00016). In patients achieving tachycardia control, diltiazem showed a significantly better rate reduction (p = .0001 group 1 vs. group 3, p = .0001 over time; p = .0001 group 1 vs. group 2, p = .001 over time) when compared with the amiodarone groups. Premature drug discontinuation due to hypotension was required significantly more often in group 1 (6/20 [30%], 0/20, and 1/20 [5%] for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively; chi2 = 10, p = .01).

Conclusion

Sufficient rate control can be achieved in critically ill patients with atrial tachyarrhythmias using either diltiazem or amiodarone. Although diltiazem allowed for significantly better 24-hr heart rate control, this effect was offset by a significantly higher incidence of hypotension requiring discontinuation of the drug. Amiodarone may be an alternative in patients with severe hemodynamic compromise.

### Metoprolol vs. diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction [^117JARSL]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of metoprolol versus diltiazem in the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Methods

This retrospective cohort study of patients with HFrEF in AF with RVR receiving either intravenous push (IVP) doses of metoprolol or diltiazem was conducted between January 2012 and September 2016. The primary outcome was successful rate control within 30 min of medication administration, defined as a heart rate (HR) < 100 beats per minute or a HR reduction ≥ 20%. Secondary outcomes included rate control at 60 min, maximum median change in HR, and incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion to normal sinus rhythm within 30 min. Signs of worsening heart failure were also evaluated.

Results

Of the 48 patients included, 14 received metoprolol and 34 received diltiazem. The primary outcome, successful rate control within 30 min, occurred in 62% of the metoprolol group and 50% of the diltiazem group (p = 0.49). There was no difference in HR control at predefined time points or incidence of hypotension, bradycardia, or conversion. Although baseline HR varied between groups, maximum median change in HR did not differ. Signs of worsening heart failure were similar between groups.

Conclusions

For the acute management of AF with RVR in patients with HFrEF, IVP diltiazem achieved similar rate control with no increase in adverse events when compared to IVP metoprolol.

### Impact of intravenous calcium with diltiazem for atrial fibrillation / flutter in the emergency department [^116bHtap]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of early intravenous (IV) calcium on systolic blood pressure (SBP) when administered with IV diltiazem in subjects with atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter (AFL) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) in the Emergency Department (ED).

Methods

This was a multicenter, retrospective cohort study that evaluated adults admitted to the ED with documented AF or AFL, heart rate (HR) > 120 bpm, SBP 90 to 140 mmHg, and received treatment with IV diltiazem for rate control. The primary outcome was the change in SBP 60 min (± 30 min) after initial IV diltiazem administration. Secondary outcomes included time to initial rate control (HR < 100 bpm), time to sustained rate control (HR < 100 bpm for 3 h), change in HR, rates of hypotension, bradycardia, hypercalcemia, and line extravasation within 24 h of initial diltiazem administration.

Results

There were 198 subjects in the diltiazem monotherapy group and 56 subjects in the diltiazem with calcium group meeting the inclusion criteria. The primary outcome, median change in SBP 60 min after initial IV diltiazem administration, was similar between groups (-2 mmHg vs -1.5 mmHg; p = 0.642), but this difference was not statistically significant. All secondary outcomes were found to be similar between groups. Although not statistically significant, hypotension occurred more often in the diltiazem with calcium group (20.2% vs 32.1%; p = 0.060) while bradycardia occurred more often in the diltiazem monotherapy group (4.5% vs 0%; p = 0.213). In terms of achieving rate control, the administration of calcium with diltiazem did not significantly change the time to initial rate control (1.4 h vs 1.8 h; p = 0.141) or time to sustained rate control (7.9 h vs 7.7 h; p = 0.570) compared to diltiazem alone.

Conclusions

In the setting of AF/AFL with RVR, administration of IV calcium with IV diltiazem did not show a significant impact on clinical or safety outcomes compared to IV diltiazem monotherapy.

Atrial fibrillation acute rate control — comparative trials report that "Intravenous diltiazem was more effective than intravenous digoxin in 2 small RCTs.6,7" In one emergency department trial, investigators "randomized 150 patients with AF without major comorbidities and a ventricular rate > 120 bpm in a 1:1:1 ratio to intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, and amiodarone.6" with "time to reduce the heart rate < 90 bpm" shorter with diltiazem. Another RCT of "30 patients" found diltiazem "significantly decreased heart rate within 5 minutes versus 3 hours with intravenous digoxin.7" Diltiazem also reduced rate "more rapidly than intravenous digoxin in a double-blinded RCT in 40 patients with rapid AF after CABG, with similar control at 12 to 24 hours". Additional evidence shows "In another RCT of 84 patients in rapid AF who presented to the emergency department, intravenous amiodarone resulted in faster control of the ventricular response compared with intravenous digoxin.8" and "Finally, 52 patients with rapid AF were randomized to receive either an intravenous combination of diltiazem and digoxin or intravenous diltiazem alone, with a more rapid and durable response to the combination.9"

### The use of diltiazem for treating rapid atrial fibrillation in the out-of-hospital setting [^111VTWx5]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We sought to evaluate the use of intravenous diltiazem for treatment of rapid atrial fibrillation or flutter (RAF) in the out-of-hospital setting.

Methods

This study is a retrospective review of data with historical control subjects. Data were drawn from out-of-hospital patients reported to a statewide paramedic system who presented with atrial fibrillation or flutter and a ventricular response rate (VRR) of 150 beats/min or greater. The intervention (diltiazem) group included patients who received diltiazem during a 9-month period in 1999. The control group included patients from 1998 who did not receive diltiazem. Patients who were intubated or underwent cardioversion were omitted. Therapeutic response was defined as the occurrence of change to sinus rhythm, reduction of VRR to 100 beats/min or less, or reduction of baseline VRR by 20% or greater. Data were analyzed by using the chi(2) test, the Student's t test, and odds ratios (ORs). A Bonferroni adjusted P value of.005 was used to define statistical significance.

Results

Forty-three patients receiving diltiazem and 27 control subjects were included in the study. The mean total diltiazem dose was 19.8 mg (95% confidence interval 17.8 to 21.8). The diltiazem and control groups did not significantly differ with respect to age; sex; history of atrial fibrillation; prior use of digitalis, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers; concurrent out-of-hospital therapies; or baseline VRR or systolic blood pressure (P = 0.09 to 1.00). The difference in VRR reduction between the diltiazem and control groups was 38 beats/min (95% confidence interval 24 to 52); this difference was statistically significant (P < .001). The mean percentage reduction of VRR in the diltiazem group was -33.1%. The difference in systolic blood pressure change between the diltiazem and control groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.17). The diltiazem group had a higher prevalence of achieving VRR reduction to 100 beats/min or less than did the control group (OR 22.6; P < .001), of achieving a VRR reduction of 20% or greater (OR 19.3; P < .001), and of achieving overall therapeutic response (OR 19.3; P < .001). Few changed to sinus rhythm in either group (estimated OR 6.3; p = 0.15). No patients in the diltiazem group required treatment for hypotension, endotracheal intubation, resuscitation from cardiac arrest, or emergency treatment of unstable dysrhythmias.

Conclusion

The effects of diltiazem on RAF can be appreciated within the constraints of the out-of-hospital environment. Diltiazem should be considered as a viable field therapy for rate control of RAF.

Recommendation-specific supportive evidence — randomized trials of acute rate control report the following quantitative results: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of continuous intravenous diltiazem infusion for 24-hour heart rate control during AF and AFL, seventeen of the 23 patients (74%) receiving diltiazem infusion and none of the 21 with placebo infusion maintained a therapeutic response for 24 hours. In another randomized clinical trial of intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for ventricular rate control, at 24 hours, rate control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%), and the percentage who achieved rate control was higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). In a randomized, parallel, open-label study of esmolol versus verapamil in acute AF or AFL, fifty percent of esmolol-treated patients with new onset of arrhythmias converted to sinus rhythm, whereas only 12% of those who received verapamil converted, with mild hypotension observed in both treatment groups.

### Safety of diltiazem for acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction in the emergency department [^116zQBRj]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Diltiazem is an effective rate control agent for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (AF RVR). However, its negative inotropic effects may increase the risk for worsening heart failure in patients with a reduced ejection fraction (EF).

Objectives

This observational study aims to describe the incidence of worsening heart failure in patients who receive intravenous diltiazem for acute atrial fibrillation management.

Methods

Adult patients that received diltiazem in the emergency department (ED) for AF RVR (heart rate ≥ 100 beats/min) from 2021 to 2022 and had a prior documented EF were included. The primary outcome is worsening heart failure within 24 h of diltiazem administration. Secondary outcomes include return ED visits and death within 7 days. EF percentage was compared across outcomes using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Outcomes were compared by reduced EF (< 50%) and preserved EF (≥ 50%). Continuous data were summarized with medians and interquartile ranges, and categorical features were summarized with frequency counts and percentages. Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used for numeric outcomes and chi-squared tests or Fisher's exact tests for categorical outcomes, with a p-value < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Results

There were 674 patients with AF RVR that received diltiazem, and 386 patients met the inclusion criteria for analysis. Baseline demographics included a median age of 72 (64–81) years, with 14.5% of patients having a prior diagnosis of congestive heart failure. EF < 50% was identified in 13.7% of patients (n = 53), of which approximately 30% of these patients safely discharged home after receiving i.v. diltiazem. The primary outcome of worsening heart failure occurred in 7/41 (17%) and 10/207 (4.8%) patients with reduced and preserved ejection fractions, respectively, who were admitted to the hospital (p = 0.005).

Conclusion

The development of worsening heart failure is multifactorial and may include the use of diltiazem in critically ill patients requiring hospital admission.

### Diltiazem hci [^113B1CAL]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In domestic controlled trials in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in reducing heart rate by at least 20% in 95% of patients. Diltiazem hydrochloride injection rarely converts atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter to normal sinus rhythm. Following administration of one or two intravenous bolus doses of diltiazem hydrochloride injection, response usually occurs within 3 minutes and maximal heart rate reduction generally occurs in 2 to 7 minutes. Heart rate reduction may last from 1 to 3 hours. If hypotension occurs, it is generally short-lived, but may last from 1 to 3 hours.

A 24-hour continuous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection in the treatment of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter maintained at least a 20% heart rate reduction during the infusion in 83% of patients. Upon discontinuation of infusion, heart rate reduction may last from 0.5 hours to more than 10 hours (median duration 7 hours). Hypotension, if it occurs, may be similarly persistent.

In the controlled clinical trials, 3.2% of patients required some form of intervention (typically, use of intravenous fluids or the Trendelenburg position) for blood pressure support following diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

In domestic controlled trials, bolus administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection was effective in converting PSVT to normal sinus rhythm in 88% of patients within 3 minutes of the first or second bolus dose.

Symptoms associated with the arrhythmia were improved in conjunction with decreased heart rate or conversion to normal sinus rhythm following administration of diltiazem hydrochloride injection.

### Acute ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation: IV combination of diltiazem and digoxin vs. IV diltiazem alone [^115HLdau]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the efficacy of an IV combination of diltiazem and digoxin vs IV diltiazem alone for acute ventricular rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation.

Design

Prospective, randomized, open-label study.

Patients and Methods

Fifty-two patients with atrial fibrillation and uncontrolled ventricular rates were randomized to receive either an IV combination of diltiazem and digoxin or IV diltiazem alone and were observed for 12 h. The successful rate control was defined as a ventricular rate < 100 beats per minute (bpm) persisting for 1 h or conversion to sinus rhythm. The loss of rate control was defined as an increase in the ventricular rate to > 100 bpm persistently for > 30 min or rebound to atrial fibrillation.

Results

In both treatment arms (n = 26 each), all patients achieved successful and comparable ventricular rate control at 12 h. The mean (± SD) time taken to achieve successful rate control was shorter in the combination arm (15 ± 16 vs. 22 ± 22 min). Six patients in the combination arm and 11 in the diltiazem-alone arm experienced episodes of loss of rate control. This loss in the combination arm was less than that in the diltiazem-alone arm (14 vs 39 episodes; p = 0.05). The loss of rate control per patient in the combination arm was also less than that in the diltiazem-alone arm (2.0 ± 1.0 vs. 3.5 ± 1.9 episodes per patient; p = 0.04).

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that in patients with atrial fibrillation who have a rapid ventricular response, the IV combination of diltiazem and digoxin results in a more efficacious ventricular rate control with fewer fluctuations than that achieved by therapy with IV diltiazem alone.

### Effect of obesity on the use of antiarrhythmics in adults with atrial fibrillation: a narrative review [^116hBY1Q]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The two remaining potassium channel blockers (vernakalant and ibutilide) have limited information surrounding both their physiochemical properties and the influence, or lack of influence, of obesity and body weight on these drugs. There was only one additional study that has findings that conflict with those of Lindmayr et al. Friesen and Ducas showed that although the pharmacokinetic properties of ibutilide were affected by obesity and body weight, this was not to the same degree as amiodarone.

4.4 Diltiazem

Unlike the previously discussed antiarrhythmics, diltiazem is used for rate control and is a highly lipophilic drug with a large Vd (3.3 L/kg). This would suggest diltiazem be affected by obesity and body weight, but this review revealed no difference between weight‐based and actual weight‐based dosing. In contrast, Ward et al. found a weight‐based dosing approach resulted in a greater proportion of patients with an HR < 100 bpm. Our results appear to be consistent with other published studies on this topic, where Ross et al. and Patel et al. also found no difference between a standard diltiazem dosing and weight‐based dosing. Similarly, Erstad et al. found that the same loading dose based on total body weight was effective for both normal and morbidly obese patients.

### Intravenous metoprolol versus diltiazem for rate control in atrial fibrillation [^113ruAyP]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Currently, it remains unclear whether β-blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred for the acute management of atrial fibrillation (AF).

Objective

The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous (IV) metoprolol and diltiazem for rate control.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective cohort study of patients who presented to the emergency department between 2015 and 2019 with AF with rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and received IV metoprolol or diltiazem. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients who achieved rate control (defined as heart rate < 100 beats per minute). Secondary outcomes included time to rate control, percentage of patients requiring additional agents for rate control, and incidence of cardioversion, bradycardia, and hypotension.

Results

A total of 200 patients were included in this study. Rate control was achieved in 35% and 41% of the metoprolol and diltiazem groups, respectively (P = 0.38). Mean time to rate control was not significantly different between the metoprolol and diltiazem groups (35 vs 21 minutes, P = 0.23). One patient developed hypotension, no patient developed bradycardia, and 4 patients required electric cardioversion. No adverse events were observed in patients with ejection fraction ≤ 40%.

Conclusion and Relevance

There was no difference in the achievement of rate control between IV metoprolol and diltiazem. This is the largest study to date comparing the two classes of agents for acute rate control in AF. No patient-specific factors were identified that would influence the preferential use of one medication over the other.

### Diltiazem hci [^114sWzoD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION

Direct Intravenous Single Injections (Bolus)

The initial dose of diltiazem hydrochloride injection should be 0.25 mg/kg actual body weight as a bolus administered over 2 minutes (20 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). If response is inadequate, a second dose may be administered after 15 minutes. The second bolus dose of diltiazem hydrochloride injection should be 0.35 mg/kg actual body weight administered over 2 minutes (25 mg is a reasonable dose for the average patient). Subsequent intravenous bolus doses should be individualized for each patient. Patients with low body weights should be dosed on a mg/kg basis. Some patients may respond to an initial dose of 0.15 mg/kg, although duration of action may be shorter. Experience with this dose is limited.

Continuous Intravenous Infusion

For continued reduction of the heart rate (up to 24 hours) in patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, an intravenous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection may be administered. (For reconstitution of diltiazem hydrochloride for injection, see instructions contained within packaging.) Immediately following bolus administration of 20 mg (0.25 mg/kg) or 25 mg (0.35 mg/kg) diltiazem hydrochloride injection and reduction of heart rate, begin an intravenous infusion of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection. The recommended initial infusion rate of diltiazem hydrochloride injection or diltiazem hydrochloride for injection is 10 mg/h. Some patients may maintain response to an initial rate of 5 mg/h. The infusion rate may be increased in 5 mg/h increments up to 15 mg/h as needed, if further reduction in heart rate is required. The infusion may be maintained for up to 24 hours.

To compare the incidence of treatment failure between oral (PO) immediate release (IR) tablet and continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) diltiazem following an initial loading dose in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR).

Methods

This single center, retrospective cohort study evaluated patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2022 in AF with RVR who received oral or continuous diltiazem after an initial intravenous loading dose. The primary objective of this study is to identify the percentage of patients with treatment failure four hours after initiation of diltiazem IR PO tablet or continuous IV infusion. Secondary endpoints included hospital length of stay (LOS), ED disposition, and clinically significant hypotension.

Results

Of the 171 patients included, 85 received PO IR diltiazem and 86 received CIVI diltiazem. There was no significant difference in the composite outcome of treatment failure between the PO and CIVI groups (60% vs 59%, p = 0.93). Patients who received PO diltiazem were more frequently discharged from the ED (31.8% vs 4.7%, p < 0.001). There was no significant difference in hospital LOS (6.6 vs 6.5 days, p = 0.06) or clinically significant hypotension (11.7% vs 8.1% p = 0.428).

Conclusion

Initiating immediate-release oral diltiazem after an initial IV bolus does not result in more treatment failures than initiating a continuous infusion.

### Achieving ventricular rate control in patients taking chronic β-blocker therapy [^113qz7fv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

The objective of this study is to evaluate the difference in response to ventricular rate control with intravenous (IV) metoprolol compared to IV diltiazem in patients taking chronic beta-blocker therapy who present to the emergency department (ED) in atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular rate (RVR).

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of adult patients taking chronic oral metoprolol. Chronic metoprolol therapy was defined as patients prescribed and taking oral metoprolol within 5days of study inclusion. Rate control was defined as either a decrease in ventricular rate < 100bpm or < 120bpm if the decrease was at least 20% from the presenting heart rate.

Results

A total of 332 patients were included, with 16 patients in the IV diltiazem group and 316 patients in the IV metoprolol group. In the diltiazem arm, 68.8% of patients achieved successful rate control compared to 42.4% of patients in the metoprolol group (p = 0.067). Treatment with IV metoprolol resulted in more hospital admissions (58% vs. 6.25% with diltiazem, p < 0.001). Treatment with diltiazem was associated with a greater incidence of bradycardia compared to IV metoprolol (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.002).

Conclusions

The use of IV diltiazem was associated with a higher rate of successful response to rate control compared to IV metoprolol in patients in AF with RVR on chronic beta-blocker therapy, however the difference between groups was not statistically significant.

Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter in pregnancy — rate control: In hemodynamically stable pregnant patients with AF or AFL with rapid ventricular rates (RVR), intravenous beta-blockers are recommended as the first-line option and diltiazem or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, alone or in combination, are recommended as second-line options for initial rate control in the absence of preexcitation (Class 1, C-LD). In pregnant patients with AF or AFL with RVR, beta-blockers, digoxin, or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers alone or in combination, are reasonable for rate control with the choice of drug dependent on the underlying maternal cardiac substrate (Class 2a, C-LD).

Intravenous magnesium and rate-control agents — evidence in AF with rapid ventricular response: A meta-analysis including '6 RCTs (n = 745 patients)' reported intravenous magnesium superior for rate control '(63% versus 40%; OR, 2.49 [95% CI, 1.80–3.45])' and modestly effective for rhythm conversion '(21% versus 14%; OR, 1.75 [95% CI, 1.08–2.84])' versus standard methods, with subgroup results favoring a lower dose '(≤ 5 g) (24% versus 13%; OR, 2.10 [95% CI, 1.22–3.61])' over a higher dose '(> 5 g) (16% versus 13%; OR, 1.23 [95% CI, 0.65–2.32])' for rhythm control compared with placebo. In critically ill patients, a retrospective series 'of 38 patients' found intravenous amiodarone decreased heart rate without BP decrease versus intravenous diltiazem and digoxin, and a study of '60 critically ill patients' randomized to diltiazem 'a 25-mg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg/h for 24 hours', amiodarone 'a 300-mg bolus', or amiodarone 'a 300-mg bolus followed by 45 mg/h for 24 hours' showed a ' > 30% rate reduction within 4 hours' was not different, with diltiazem achieving better 24-hour rate control but more hypotension requiring discontinuation. In HFrEF populations, retrospective analyses associated diltiazem with increased acute kidney injury within 48 hours when 'LVEF ≤ 50%' compared with normal EF '(10% versus 3.6%; P = 0.002)' and with a higher incidence of worsening HF symptoms '(33% versus 15%; P = 0.019)', while 'Neither analysis noted an increase in the in-hospital mortality rate, need for a higher level of care, or hypotension'.

### Metoprolol vs diltiazem for atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate: systematic review and meta-analysis of adverse events [^112GLsyE]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intravenous (IV) diltiazem and metoprolol are commonly used to achieve rate control for atrial fibrillation with RVR (Afib with RVR), and are both recommended as first-line by current guidelines. While prior studies investigated the efficacy of these medications, there is little evidence available regarding the risk of adverse events (AEs) with their use.

Methods

We identified randomized controlled trials (RCT) and observational studies reporting rates of AEs following administration of IV diltiazem and metoprolol for Afib with RVR by searching PubMed, SCOPUS, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library. Our primary outcome was the incidence of AEs and specifically hypotension and bradycardia, which were examined individually as secondary outcomes. We performed random-effects meta-analysis to identify rates of each AE. We used moderator analysis and meta-regressions to evaluate risk factors. We used the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias 2 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale to assess study quality.

Results

We reviewed 13 studies and included 1660 patients, 888 (53%) treated with metoprolol and 772 (47%) with diltiazem. Metoprolol was associated with a 26% lower risk of AE (total incidence 10%) compared to diltiazem (total incidence 19%), (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56–0.98, p = 0.034) with a prediction interval of 0.50–1.10. Patients with higher initial heart rates faced higher rates of AEs (Correlation Coefficient 0.11, 95% CI 0.03–0.19, p = 0.006). There was no difference with respect to rates of bradycardia (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.15–1.30, p = 0.14) or hypotension (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.61–1.04, p = 0.10).

Conclusion

Afib with RVR treated with metoprolol had lower rates of AE (bradycardia and/or hypotension) compared to those treated with diltiazem. We found no difference in rates of hypotension or bradycardia when individually assessed. Existing data are limited by small sample sizes, variability in dosing, and limited representation of important patient subgroups.

Circulation (2011). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — dronedarone safety, interactions, and dosing are detailed as follows: In patients with recently decompensated heart failure and depressed LV function, dronedarone increased mortality after a median follow-up of only 2 months; 8.1% in the dronedarone group died and 3.8% in the placebo group died (HR 2.13; 95% CI, 1.07 to 4.25; P = 0.03). Therefore, dronedarone should not be administered to patients with depressed ventricular function and recent heart failure decompensation or NYHA class IV heart failure. The major adverse cardiac effects are bradycardia and QT prolongation, and torsades de pointes has been reported. Dronedarone inhibits renal tubular secretion of creatinine without reducing glomerular filtration rate and increases digoxin levels 1.7- to 2.5-fold. It is predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 with a half-life of approximately 19 hours; it should not be administered with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 but can be administered with verapamil or diltiazem using low initial doses titrated to response and tolerance. Dronedarone does not alter the international normalization ratio when used with warfarin. The recommended oral dose is 400 mg twice a day with meals, and an intravenous form is not available.

### Intravenous diltiazem is superior to intravenous amiodarone or digoxin for achieving ventricular rate control in patients with acute uncomplicated atrial fibrillation [^116bKBFd]. Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the clinical efficacy of intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, and amiodarone for acute ventricular rate (VR) control in patients with acute symptomatic atrial fibrillation (AF) necessitating hospitalization.

Design

Randomized control trial.

Setting

Acute emergency medical admission unit in a regional teaching hospital in Hong Kong.

Patients

One hundred fifty adult patients with acute AF and rapid VR (> 120 bpm).

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned in 1:1:1 ratio to receive intravenous diltiazem, digoxin, or amiodarone for VR control.

Measurements and Main Results

The primary end point was sustained VR control (< 90 bpm) within 24 hours; the secondary end points included AF symptom improvement and length of hospitalization. At 24 hours, VR control was achieved in 119 of 150 patients (79%). The time to VR control was significantly shorter among patients in the diltiazem group (log-rank test, p < 0.0001) with the percentage of patients who achieved VR control being higher in the diltiazem group (90%) than the digoxin group (74%) and the amiodarone group (74%). The median time to VR control was significantly shorter in the diltiazem group (3 hours, 1–21 hours) compared with the digoxin (6 hours, 3–15 hours, p < 0.001) and amiodarone groups (7 hours, 1–18 hours, p = 0.003). Furthermore, patients in the diltiazem group persistently had the lowest mean VR after the first hour of drug administration compared with the other two groups (p < 0.05). The diltiazem group had the largest reduction in AF symptom frequency score and severity score (p < 0.0001). In addition, length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in the diltiazem group (3.9 ± 1.6 days) compared with digoxin (4.7 ± 2.1 days, p = 0.023) and amiodarone groups (4.7 ± 2.2 days, p = 0.038).

Conclusions

As compared with digoxin and amiodarone, intravenous diltiazem was safe and effective in achieving VR control to improve symptoms and to reduce hospital stay in patients with acute AF.

### Diltiazem hci [^111bBdbB]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In patients with atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, a significant correlation was observed between the percent reduction in HR and plasma diltiazem concentration using the Sigmoidal Emax model. Based on this relationship, the mean plasma diltiazem concentration required to produce a 20% decrease in heart rate was determined to be 80 ng/mL. Mean plasma diltiazem concentrations of 130 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL were determined to produce reductions in heart rate of 30% and 40%.

Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism

Following a single intravenous injection in healthy male volunteers, diltiazem hydrochloride appears to obey linear pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 10.5 to 21 mg. The plasma elimination half-life is approximately 3.4 hours. The apparent volume of distribution of diltiazem hydrochloride is approximately 305 L. Diltiazem hydrochloride is extensively metabolized in the liver with a systemic clearance of approximately 65 L/h.

After constant rate intravenous infusion to healthy male volunteers, diltiazem exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics over an infusion range of 4.8 to 13.2 mg/h for 24 hours. Over this infusion range, as the dose is increased, systemic clearance decreases from 64 to 48 L/h while the plasma elimination half-life increases from 4.1 to 4.9 hours. The apparent volume of distribution remains unchanged (360 to 391 L). In patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, diltiazem systemic clearance has been found to be decreased compared to healthy volunteers. In patients administered bolus doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 38.5 mg, systemic clearance averaged 36 L/h. In patients administered continuous infusions at 10 mg/h or 15 mg/h for 24 hours, diltiazem systemic clearance averaged 42 L/h and 31 L/h, respectively.

Atrial fibrillation long-term rate control — recommendations emphasize first-line agents and safety limits. In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), beta blockers or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (diltiazem, verapamil) are recommended for long-term rate control, and for patients in whom measuring serum digoxin levels is indicated, it is reasonable to target levels < 1.2 ng/mL. In AF with heart failure (HF) symptoms, digoxin is reasonable for long-term rate control in combination with other rate-controlling agents, or as monotherapy if other agents are not preferred, not tolerated, or contraindicated. In AF with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 40%, nondihydropyridine calcium channel–blocking drugs should not be administered given their potential to exacerbate HF, and in patients with permanent AF who have risk factors for cardiovascular events, dronedarone should not be used for long-term rate control.

### Low-dose diltiazem in atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response [^1119RNHb]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

Diltiazem is one of the most commonly used medications to control the rapid ventricular response in atrial fibrillation (AF). The recommended starting dose is an intravenous bolus of 0.25 mg/kg over 2 minutes. To avoid hypotension, we have empirically used a lower dose of diltiazem. We compared the efficacy and safety of different doses of diltiazem in rapid AF.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was undertaken in patients who presented to the emergency department with rapid AF. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to diltiazem dosage: low dose (≤ 0.2 mg/kg), standard dose (> 0.2 and ≤ 0.3 mg/kg), and high dose (> 0.3 mg/kg). We compared the rates of therapeutic response (adequate rate control) and complications (such as hypotension). Multivariate regression analysis was used to determine the effect of diltiazem dose on the occurrence of complications.

Results

A total of 180 patients were included in the analysis. There were no significant differences in the rates of therapeutic response for the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups (70.5%, 77.1%, and 77.8%; p = 0.605). The rates of hypotension in the low-, standard-, and high-dose groups were 18%, 34.9%, and 41.7%, respectively. After adjusting confounding variables, the rate of hypotension was significantly lower in the low-dose group in comparison with the standard-dose group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.16–0.94).

Conclusions

Low-dose diltiazem might be as effective as the standard dose in controlling rapid AF and reduce the risk of hypotension.

### Association of atrial fibrillation risk alleles and response to acute rate control therapy [^1179nDHv]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

Given the sparse evidence for selection of first-line therapy for acute atrial fibrillation (AF) based on clinical factors alone, incorporation of genotype data may improve the effectiveness of treatment algorithms and advance the understanding of interpatient heterogeneity. We tested whether candidate nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to AF physiologic responses are associated with ventricular rate control after intravenous diltiazem in the emergency department (ED).

Methods

We conducted an analysis within a prospective observational cohort of ED patients with acute symptomatic AF, ventricular rate > 110 beats per minute within the first 2 hours, initially treated with intravenous diltiazem, and who had DNA available for analysis. We evaluated 24 candidate SNPs that were grouped into 3 categories based on their phenotype response (atrioventricular nodal [AVN] conduction, resting heart rate, disease susceptibility) and calculated 3 genetic scores for each patient. Our primary outcome was maximum heart rate reduction within 4 hours of diltiazem administration. Multivariable regression was used to identify associations with the outcome while adjusting for age, sex, baseline heart rate, and diltiazem dose.

Results

Of the 142 patients, 127 had complete data for the primary outcome. None of the genetic scores for AVN conduction, resting heart rate, or AF susceptibility showed a significant association with maximal heart rate response.

Conclusion

Using a candidate SNP approach, screening for genetic variants associated with AVN conduction, resting heart rate, or AF susceptibility failed to provide significant data for predicting successful rate control response to intravenous diltiazem for treating acute AF in the ED.

### Diltiazem hci [^117VpBxC]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Mechanisms of Action

Diltiazem inhibits the influx of calcium (Ca2+) ions during membrane depolarization of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The therapeutic benefits of diltiazem in supraventricular tachycardias are related to its ability to slow AV nodal conduction time and prolong AV nodal refractoriness. Diltiazem exhibits frequency (use) dependent effects on AV nodal conduction such that it may selectively reduce the heart rate during tachycardias involving the AV node with little or no effect on normal AV nodal conduction at normal heart rates.

Diltiazem slows the ventricular rate in patients with a rapid ventricular response during atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Diltiazem converts paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) to normal sinus rhythm by interrupting the reentry circuit in AV nodal reentrant tachycardias and reciprocating tachycardias, e.g. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW).

Diltiazem prolongs the sinus cycle length. It has no effect on the sinus node recovery time or on the sinoatrial conduction time in patients without SA nodal dysfunction. Diltiazem has no significant electrophysiologic effects on tissues in the heart that are fast sodium channel dependent, e.g. His-Purkinje tissue, atrial and ventricular muscle, and extranodal accessory pathways.

Atrial fibrillation — nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists (verapamil, diltiazem) are effective for rate control with specific use considerations. The nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists verapamil and diltiazem are commonly used for treatment of AF and are the only agents associated with improvement in quality of life and exercise tolerance; intravenous bolus is effective but usually requires continuous intravenous infusion, these agents should be used cautiously or avoided in HF due to systolic dysfunction, eight randomized studies found heart rate decreases with diltiazem, verapamil decreased heart rate both at rest by 8 to 23 beats per minute and during exercise by 20 to 34 beats per minute, and they may be preferred long term over beta blockers in patients with bronchospasm or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

### Calcium chloride before I.V. diltiazem in the management of atrial fibrillation [^111fxGgX]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Diltiazem is commonly used to treat atrial fibrillation or flutter (AFF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). Although it is very effective for rate control, up to an 18% prevalence of reported diltiazem-induced hypotension [defined by systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 90 mm Hg], and a mean of 9.7% hypotension have been reported from several studies totaling over 450 patients. This hypotension may complicate therapy. Our objective was to determine if calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) pre-treatment would blunt a SBP drop after i.v. diltiazem, while allowing diltiazem to maintain its efficacy. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted. Seventy-eight patients with AFF and a ventricular rate of ≥ 120 beats per minute were enrolled. Half received i.v. CaCl(2) pre-treatment; the other half received placebo. All patients then received i.v. diltiazem in a standard, weight-based dose. A second dose of CaCl(2) pre-treatment or placebo and diltiazem was given if clinically indicated for additional rate control. Both CaCl(2) and placebo pre-treatment groups had equal lowering of heart rate (p < 0.001). There were no adverse events in the calcium pre-treatment study arm. One patient in the placebo group became paradoxically more tachycardic and apneic after the diltiazem infusion. Although i.v. CaCl(2) seems to be equally safe compared to placebo as a pre-treatment in the management of AFF with RVR, we were unable to find a statistically significant blunting of SBP drop with CaCl(2) i.v. pre-treatment. Until further research determines a benefit exists, we cannot recommend i.v. CaCl(2) pre-treatment before diltiazem in the treatment of AFF with RVR.

Acute pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) — agent-specific notes: Intravenous esmolol may have modest efficacy for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset AF, but this has not been established by comparison with placebo; it is not useful in patients with persistent AF, a response may be expected within 1 h after initiation of intravenous infusion, and hypotension and bronchospasm are major adverse effects. Verapamil and diltiazem have not been found effective for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset or persistent AF but act rapidly to control the rate of ventricular response; negative inotropic effects might result in hypotension and caution should be used in patients with heart failure (HF). Digitalis glycosides are generally not more effective than placebo for conversion of recent-onset AF to sinus rhythm, may prolong episodes of paroxysmal AF, and manifestations of digitalis toxicity are dose related. Disopyramide has not been tested adequately for conversion of AF but may be effective when administered intravenously; adverse effects include drying of mucous membranes, constipation, urinary retention, and depression of left ventricular (LV) contractility, making it a relatively unattractive option. Sotalol has no proved efficacy for pharmacological cardioversion of recent-onset or persistent AF when given either orally or intravenously, but it does control the heart rate; in patients who tolerate AF relatively well, a wait-and-see approach using oral sotalol is an appropriate option, and side effects consist mainly of QT prolongation associated with torsades de pointes.

There are no well-controlled studies in pregnant women; therefore, use diltiazem hydrochloride in pregnant women only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus.

Nursing Mothers

Diltiazem is excreted in human milk. One report with oral diltiazem suggests that concentrations in breast milk may approximate serum levels. If use of diltiazem hydrochloride is deemed essential, an alternative method of infant feeding should be instituted.

Pediatric Use

Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.

Geriatric Use

Clinical studies of diltiazem did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter

In clinical studies with diltiazem hydrochloride injection for AF/Fl, 135 of 257 patients were over 65 years of age. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR) — acute rate control algorithm: The first decision point is 'Hemodynamically stable?' with 'Direct current cardioversion (1)' if no. If yes, the branch asks about decompensated heart failure, where 'Verapamil, diltiazem* (3: Harm)' are labeled harmful, with the note 'Contraindicated in patients with moderate-severe LV dysfunction regardless of decompensated HF'. In the absence of decompensated HF, listed options include 'Beta blockers, verapamil, or diltiazem (1)' and 'Addition of magnesium to AV nodal blockade (2a)'.

### Impact of an emergency department observation unit management algorithm for atrial fibrillation [^115Q85ip]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2016). Low credibility.

Initially, patients were assessed for stability, which was primarily determined by the discretion of the provider, with instability being suggested by chest pain, ST‐segment changes concerning for ischemia, respiratory distress, hypoxia, or hypotension. Patients deemed unstable were excluded from the treatment algorithm and were instead resuscitated as indicated by the clinical scenario.

After the initial evaluation and assessment of stability, intravenous (IV) diltiazem was recommended as the initial medication for rate control at an initial dose of 0.1 to 0.25 mg/kg or 10 to 20 mg IV over 2 minutes. This dose could be repeated 15 minutes later if the heart rate remained > 110 beats per minute (bpm) and blood pressure remained adequate. Simultaneously, 30 mg of oral diltiazem was recommended to be administered after the initial bolus was given, which would be scheduled to be given every 6 hours while the patient remained in the ED. If the patient's heart rate continued to be > 110 bpm after 2 doses of intravenous diltiazem and 30 mg of oral diltiazem, providers were instructed to consider initiation of a continuous diltiazem infusion at 5 mg/h titrated to a heart rate of 80 to 110 bpm, increased in increments of 3 to 5 mg/h every 5 minutes, as blood pressure allowed.
