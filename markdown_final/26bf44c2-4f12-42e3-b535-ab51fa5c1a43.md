## Question

Can acyclovir cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether acyclovir can cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current evidence-based treatments and natural history of ALS. Then, I should verify acyclovir's mechanism of action and labeled indications. Next, I will review the "viral hypothesis" of ALS and whether any antiviral strategies overlap with acyclovir's activity. After that, I need to check for any direct clinical or guideline evidence of acyclovir in ALS. Finally, I will synthesize a conclusion and ensure it aligns with authoritative guidelines and FDA labeling, using current ALS guidance and FDA drug information as anchors [^113XNGGB] [^114b7QAt].

> Let me first confirm the therapeutic landscape of ALS. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — ALS remains a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease without a cure, with median survival of roughly 2–5 years, and management focuses on modest disease-modifying effects plus symptomatic and supportive care [^112EGth9]. I should confirm the approved disease-modifying options: guidelines recommend riluzole to improve survival and allow consideration of edaravone to slow functional decline in selected patients; importantly, many ALS trials have failed to demonstrate efficacy, underscoring the disease's complexity and resistance to treatment [^113XNGGB] [^116A3itZ] [^114Ut16N]. Let me also note that oral edaravone (Radicava ORS) reflects the same efficacy evidence base as IV edaravone in a restricted patient population, not a cure [^111dLWRe].

> Next, I should review acyclovir's pharmacology and labeled uses. I need to ensure I'm precise: acyclovir is a guanine nucleoside analog activated by viral thymidine kinase, selectively inhibiting herpesvirus DNA polymerase — so its activity is specific to HSV and VZV infections rather than broadly "antiviral" against retroviruses or other families [^114b7QAt]. I should double-check indications: FDA labeling and compendia list HSV encephalitis, severe mucocutaneous HSV in immunocompromised patients, genital herpes, and VZV infections; off-label uses still cluster within herpesviruses and related contexts, with no indication for neurodegenerative diseases or ALS [^114b7QAt] [^114r8pPX].

> Now, let me consider the viral hypothesis of ALS. Hold on, I should verify what "viral" means here — several reviews suggest viruses might contribute to ALS pathogenesis via neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, or gene–environment interactions, but causality remains unproven and no specific antiviral therapy has emerged from this line of evidence [^1169pSXG] [^115B3BdW]. But wait, what if the HERV-K signal in ALS supports an antiviral approach? I need to check: HERV-K is an endogenous retrovirus signal distinct from herpesviruses; small case series and pilot studies in HIV-associated motor neuron disease and ALS cohorts examined combination antiretroviral therapy (reverse transcriptase and integrase inhibitors), not anti-herpes agents like acyclovir, with biomarker suppression of HERV-K and some clinical signals, though these remain preliminary and are not generalized ALS cures [^114X3QPw] [^112qYRZR]. This distinction matters mechanistically — acyclovir would not be expected to inhibit retroviral targets implicated by HERV-K hypotheses [^114b7QAt].

> I will now examine direct evidence for acyclovir in ALS. Wait, let me verify across guidelines and trial reviews: comprehensive ALS guidelines and consensus trial design documents do not list acyclovir as a disease-modifying or symptomatic therapy, and systematic reviews of disease-modifying drug trials similarly do not include acyclovir, which suggests no clinical trial evidence in ALS populations to date [^113XNGGB] [^116fKhZv] [^112NCoqc]. Hold on, I should double-check if any large negative-trial overviews mention it — broad summaries emphasize numerous failed agents, but acyclovir is not among studied ALS disease-modifying candidates, reinforcing the absence of evidence [^114Ut16N].

> Next, I should review off-label precedent and biological plausibility. Let me think about this carefully: acyclovir's off-label uses remain within herpesvirus diseases and complications; there is no precedent for use in neurodegenerative disorders like ALS, and the dominant pathogenic frameworks for ALS — hyperexcitability and glutamate excitotoxicity, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation — do not align with acyclovir's anti-herpes DNA polymerase inhibition mechanism, limiting biological plausibility for efficacy in ALS [^114r8pPX] [^1118twqS] [^1156tDJi]. I need to ensure I'm not overlooking any niche mechanistic bridge — none is evident in the cited literature or guidelines [^113XNGGB].

> Synthesizing this, I should confirm the conclusion clearly. There is no scientific evidence, mechanistic rationale, or guideline support for acyclovir as an ALS treatment, and certainly no evidence of cure; current evidence-based disease-modifying therapies remain riluzole and, in selected patients, edaravone, within a broader multidisciplinary care framework that addresses symptoms and quality of life, while ALS remains incurable at present [^113XNGGB] [^116A3itZ] [^112EGth9]. Final answer: No, acyclovir cannot cure amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; it is an anti-herpesvirus agent with no demonstrated role in ALS pathogenesis or treatment, and no clinical trial or guideline support in ALS [^114b7QAt] [^112NCoqc] [^116fKhZv].

Acyclovir **does not cure ALS** [^112EGth9] [^114Ut16N]. There is **no evidence** that acyclovir slows ALS progression or improves survival [^112NCoqc], and it is not recommended by clinical guidelines for ALS management [^113XNGGB] [^116A3itZ]. ALS is a neurodegenerative disease with complex mechanisms unrelated to herpesviruses [^116cHGsr], and acyclovir's antiviral action is not relevant to ALS pathophysiology [^1169pSXG] [^114b7QAt]. Current ALS care focuses on riluzole [^113XNGGB], edaravone [^116A3itZ], and multidisciplinary support [^117BRtsF]; acyclovir **should not be used for ALS outside of clinical trials**.

---

## Mechanism of action of acyclovir

Acyclovir is a guanosine analog that, after phosphorylation by viral thymidine kinase, **inhibits viral DNA polymerase** [^114b7QAt], thereby blocking viral DNA synthesis and replication. It is effective against HSV and VZV, which rely on this kinase for activation [^114r8pPX] [^112DSH6J]. ALS, however, involves motor neuron degeneration, protein aggregation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation — processes not targeted by acyclovir's antiviral mechanism [^116cHGsr] [^112p271S].

---

## Evidence regarding acyclovir in ALS

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting acyclovir for ALS: no randomized controlled trials or observational studies have evaluated it, and no preclinical data indicate any effect on ALS pathophysiology [^112NCoqc] [^114Ut16N]. ALS is not associated with HSV or VZV; therefore, acyclovir's antiviral activity is not relevant to the disease [^1169pSXG] [^114b7QAt].

---

## Current ALS treatments and guidelines

Current **ALS management** includes:

- **Riluzole**: Modestly prolongs survival and is recommended as first-line therapy [^114Ut16N] [^113XNGGB].

- **Edaravone**: May slow functional decline in selected patients [^111dLWRe] [^116A3itZ].

- **Multidisciplinary care**: Improves quality of life and may extend survival [^113n2uDR] [^117BRtsF].

Acyclovir is **not included in any ALS treatment guidelines or recommendations** [^113XNGGB] [^113n2uDR].

---

## Safety considerations

Acyclovir is generally safe for approved indications [^114b7QAt], but potential adverse effects include nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Using acyclovir in ALS without evidence of benefit exposes patients to **unnecessary risks** from these adverse effects.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Acyclovir **does not cure ALS** [^112EGth9], and there is **no scientific rationale** or clinical evidence supporting its use in this disease [^1169pSXG]. ALS management should follow established guidelines [^113XNGGB], including riluzole, edaravone [^116A3itZ], and multidisciplinary care [^117BRtsF]. Acyclovir **should not be used for ALS outside of clinical trials**.

### Preventing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Insights from pre-symptomatic neurodegenerative diseases [^114nRgqC]. Brain (2022). High credibility.

Significant progress has been made in understanding the pre-symptomatic phase of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While much is still unknown, advances in other neurodegenerative diseases offer valuable insights. It is increasingly clear that the well-recognized clinical syndromes of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal muscular atrophy, and frontotemporal dementia are also preceded by a pre-symptomatic or prodromal period of varying duration, during which the underlying disease process unfolds with associated compensatory changes and loss of inherent system redundancy. Key insights from these diseases highlight opportunities for discovery in ALS.

The development of biomarkers reflecting amyloid and tau has led to a shift in defining Alzheimer's disease based on inferred underlying histopathology. Parkinson's disease is unique among neurodegenerative diseases in the number and diversity of non-genetic biomarkers of pre-symptomatic disease, most notably REM sleep behavior disorder. Huntington's disease benefits from an ability to predict the likely timing of clinically manifest disease based on age and CAG-repeat length alongside reliable neuroimaging markers of atrophy. Spinal muscular atrophy clinical trials have highlighted the transformational value of early therapeutic intervention, and studies in frontotemporal dementia illustrate the differential role of biomarkers based on genotype. Similar advances in ALS would transform our understanding of key events in pathogenesis.

### Infectious agents and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: another piece of the puzzle of motor neuron degeneration [^115B3BdW]. Journal of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons (MN). This fatal disease is characterized by progressive muscle wasting and lacks an effective treatment. ALS pathogenesis has not been elucidated yet. In a small proportion of ALS patients, the disease has a familial origin related to mutations in specific genes, which directly result in MN degeneration. By contrast, the vast majority of cases are thought to be sporadic, in which genes and environment interact, leading to disease in genetically predisposed individuals.

Lately, the role of the environment has gained relevance in this field, and an extensive list of environmental conditions have been postulated to be involved in ALS. Among them, infectious agents, particularly viruses, have been suggested to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the disease. These agents could act by interacting with some crucial pathways in MN degeneration, such as gene processing, oxidative stress, or neuroinflammation.

This article reviews the main studies about the involvement of microorganisms in ALS, subsequently discussing their potential pathogenic effect and integrating them as another piece in the puzzle of ALS pathogenesis.

### Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Why so many negative trials and how can trials be improved [^114Ut16N]. The Lancet Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most rapidly progressive neurodegenerative diseases of unknown cause. Riluzole is the only drug that slows disease progression. More than 50 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of proposed disease-modifying drugs have failed to show positive results in the past half-century. In the past decade, at least 18 drugs have been tested in large phase 2 or 3 RCTs, including lithium, which was tested in several RCTs.

- **Potential reasons for negative results**: These can be classified into three categories. First, issues regarding trial rationale and preclinical study results; second, pharmacological issues; and third, clinical trial design and methodology issues.

Clinical trials for stem cell therapy and RCTs targeting pharmacological or non-pharmacological symptomatic treatment in ALS are examples of areas that need novel design strategies. Only through critical analyses of the failed trials can new and important suggestions be identified for the future success of clinical trials in ALS.

### Abnormal regulation of the antiviral response in neurological/neurodegenerative diseases [^116ByXxB]. Cytokine (2016). Low credibility.

Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis are a few examples of debilitating neurological/neurodegenerative diseases for which there are currently no curative treatments. Recent evidence has strongly suggested a role for neuroinflammation in both the onset and progression of these diseases. However, the mechanisms that initiate neuroinflammation are presently unclear.

Mounting evidence suggests that environmental factors are likely involved. One proposed mechanism linking both genetic and environmental factors is dysregulation of the antiviral response. Indeed, many mutations that have been linked to neurological conditions occur in genes related to the antiviral response. Although the products of these genes may have potent antiviral activities, they can also have deleterious effects when their expression is not appropriately regulated. For that reason, expression of antiviral genes is a tightly controlled process.

- **Interferonopathies and neurological conditions**: Herein, we review the various antiviral genes that have been linked to neurological conditions. We focus specifically on type I interferonopathies, the symptoms of which are often evident at birth, and neurodegenerative diseases, which frequently onset later in life.

### Phase 2b randomized controlled trial of NP001 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Pre-specified and post hoc analyses [^115sLC3z]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Low credibility.

In the study on the age distribution of NP001 and placebo non-progressors, thirteen participants in the phase 2b NP001 group and 12 in the placebo group did not progress out of a total of 117 participants who completed the study. A demographic analysis of these participants identified a non-random age association with NP001 non-progressors compared to placebo non-progressors (Fisher exact test, p = .002). All 13 NP001-treated non-progressors were within a 40- to 65-year-old age range. In contrast, placebo non-progressors were arrayed across the 32–76-year age range within the phase 2b study.

- **Age distribution of participants**:
	- The age distribution plot showed the increasing age (years) of participants on the X-axis and the number of participants in specific age categories on the Y-axis. The top panel represents the age distribution of treated non-progressors; all 13 treated non-progressors in the phase group fell into the 40- to 65-year-old age range (top panel, n = 13). However, only 5 out of 12 placebo non-progressors were in the 40- to 65-year age range (bottom panel, n = 12) (Fisher exact test, p = .002).

This non-random age association with NP001 treatment was further confirmed with a follow-up evaluation of NP001 non-progressors in the phase 2a study, where 6 out of 6 participants were in the 40- to 65-year age range.

### Managing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Slowing disease progression and improving patient quality of life [^1118twqS]. Annals of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

It is now possible to slow the disease progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but documented improvement in the quality of life of ALS patients has been difficult to quantitate. Putative mechanisms involved in motor neuron degeneration in ALS include oxidative damage, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, growth factor deficiency, and glutamate excitotoxicity.

Several pharmacological agents that target these potential mechanisms have demonstrated therapeutic potential in animal models with mutations in the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1). Many treatments that have been moderately effective in this animal model have not been successfully translated into effective treatments for humans with ALS. The only glutamate modulator, riluzole, has demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials and is approved for treating ALS.

- **Potential therapeutic strategies**: Combination treatments may represent a strategy to more robustly prolong life and preserve function. However, only vitamin E with riluzole has been formally studied in clinical trials, and at the time of writing, no combination treatments have been found to be more effective than currently available single agents.

### Randomized sequential trial of valproic acid in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^113VnsEK]. Annals of Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

To determine whether valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor that showed antioxidative and antiapoptotic properties and reduced glutamate toxicity in preclinical studies, is safe and effective in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a sequential trial design was used.

Between April 2005 and January 2007, 163 ALS patients received VPA 1,500 mg or placebo daily. The primary endpoint was survival. The secondary outcome measure was the decline of functional status, measured by the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale. Analysis was by intention to treat and according to a sequential trial design. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT00136110).

VPA did not affect survival (cumulative survival probability of 0.72 in the VPA group [standard error (SE), 0.06] vs. 0.88 in the placebo group [SE, 0.04] at 12 months, and 0.59 in the VPA group [SE, 0.07] vs. 0.68 in the placebo group [SE, 0.08] at 16 months) or the rate of decline of functional status. VPA intake did not cause serious adverse reactions.

Our finding that VPA, at a dose used in epilepsy, does not show a beneficial effect on survival or disease progression in patients with ALS has implications for future trials with histone deacetylase inhibitors in ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases. The use of a sequential trial design allowed inclusion of only half the number of patients required for a classic trial design and prevented patients from unnecessarily continuing potentially harmful study medication.

### Influence of a clinical trial in the decision-making processes of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^112mtGsc]. Journal of Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an incurable neurological disease, and patients diagnosed with ALS have a survival time of 2–5 years without life-sustaining therapy. Decision-making processes for the acceptance or decline of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) and tracheostomy with invasive ventilation (TIV) therapy are complex and multifaceted. In this study, we examined whether participation or lack of participation in clinical trials of ALS influences the decision-making processes of ALS patients.

- **Methods**: Fifty-seven consecutive ALS participants were recruited. Two participants did not wish to participate in any clinical trials, and twenty-two participants were enrolled in clinical trials. Twenty-three participants wished to participate but could not be enrolled in any of the clinical trials because they exceeded the number of participants in these trials or met the exclusion criteria.

- **Results**: At baseline, there was no significant difference in the preference rates for PEG and TIV between the participant and non-participant groups, but after the double-blind period of six months, both preference rates were significantly higher in the non-participant group than in the participant group. Notably, the rate of preferred TIV in the participant group drastically decreased after the double-blind period. A single regression analysis revealed that participation in clinical trials had a strong influence on the change of TIV preference for six months.

- **Conclusion**: Participation in a clinical trial decreases the willingness to prolong life after the cli.

### The scientific and therapeutic rationale for off-label treatments in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^117AWn3q]. Annals of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

There are no dramatically effective pharmacological treatments for most patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a complex disease with multiple underlying mechanisms, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome alteration, and antiretroviral activity. We examined 15 years of reviews by a group called ALSUntangled to identify eight alternative and off-label treatments that target one or more of these mechanisms and have at least one human trial suggesting meaningful benefits. Given the overlapping pathological mechanisms of the highlighted products, we suggest that combinations of these treatments targeting diverse mechanisms might be worthwhile for future amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy development.

### Acyclovir for mechanically ventilated patients with herpes simplex virus oropharyngeal reactivation: A randomized clinical trial [^113DvoT1]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

The role of herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation on morbidity and mortality in patients in the intensive care unit requiring mechanical ventilation remains unknown.

To determine whether preemptive treatment with intravenous acyclovir reduces the duration of mechanical ventilation in patients with HSV oropharyngeal reactivation, a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial was conducted. This took place in 16 intensive care units in France. Participants included 239 adults (age, > 18 years) who received mechanical ventilation for at least 96 hours and continued to receive mechanical ventilation for 48 hours or more, with HSV oropharyngeal reactivation. Patients were enrolled between February 2, 2014, and February 22, 2018.

Participants were randomized to receive intravenous acyclovir, 5 mg/kg, 3 times daily for 14 days or a matching placebo. The primary endpoint was ventilator-free days from randomization to day 60. Prespecified secondary outcomes included mortality at 60 days. Main analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.

Of the 239 patients enrolled and randomized, 1 patient withdrew consent, leaving 238 patients, with 119 patients in both the acyclovir and placebo (control) groups (median [IQR] age, 61 [50–70] years; 76 [32%] women) available for primary outcome measurement. On day 60, the median (IQR) numbers of ventilator-free days were 35 (0–53) for acyclovir recipients and 36 (0–50) for controls (P = 0.17 for between-group comparison).

### Zovirax [^113tTpbR]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

- **Use in specific populations**:

- **Pregnancy**: Acyclovir is minimally absorbed systemically following topical route of administration, and maternal use is not expected to result in fetal exposure to the Zovirax cream [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Experience with topical acyclovir use in pregnant women over several decades, based on published literature including observational studies, has not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Animal reproduction studies with systemic exposure to acyclovir have been conducted. Refer to acyclovir prescribing information for additional details. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Lactation**: Acyclovir is minimally absorbed systemically following topical route of administration, and breastfeeding is not expected to result in exposure of the child to Zovirax cream [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There are no data on the effects of Zovirax on the breastfed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Zovirax cream and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Zovirax cream.

### Efficacy and safety of CNM-Au8 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (RESCUE-ALS study): a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and open label extension [^1155Kfya]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). High credibility.

Within six weeks of the initial screening visit, eligible study participants returned for a baseline visit during which they were randomised between active and placebo assignments. Following randomisation, subsequent study visits for data collection and safety assessments occurred every six weeks. Intensive clinical visits were scheduled at weeks 12, 24, and 36, with phone-calls at weeks 3, 6, 18, and 30. A four-week safety follow-up visit occurred following completion of the 36-week double-blind period, early termination from the trial, or upon exit from the open-label extension (OLE).

After completing the 36-week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the trial, eligible participants were offered the opportunity to enter the OLE and receive CNM-Au8 30 mg. Key entry criteria for the OLE included completion of the double-blind period, absence of treatment compliance issues, and no laboratory abnormalities deemed clinically significant. Participants who qualified and elected to participate in the OLE provided written informed consent. Clinical site visits took place every 12 weeks during the OLE. Visits could be conducted remotely if required due to COVID-19 pandemic concerns or travel difficulties related to disease progression.

OLE participants and clinicians remained blinded to participants' original randomisation group. All participants in the OLE were provided with 30 mg daily doses of CNM-Au8 in identical single-use high-density polyethylene containers with the same dosing instruction.

### How do we get from hyperexcitability to excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^112p271S]. Brain (2024). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that, at present, has no effective cure. Evidence of increased circulating glutamate and hyperexcitability of the motor cortex in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis provides an empirical support base for the 'dying forward' excitotoxicity hypothesis. The hypothesis postulates that increased activation of upper motor neurons spreads pathology to lower motor neurons in the spinal cord in the form of excessive glutamate release, which triggers excitotoxic processes. Many clinical trials have focused on therapies that target excitotoxicity via dampening neuronal activation, but not all are effective. As such, there is growing tension between the rising tide of evidence for the 'dying forward' excitotoxicity hypothesis and the failure of therapies that target neuronal activation.

One possible solution to these contradictory outcomes is that our interpretation of the evidence requires revision in the context of appreciating the complexity of the nervous system and the limitations of the neurobiological assays we use to study it. In this review, we provide an evaluation of evidence relevant to the 'dying forward' excitotoxicity hypothesis and, by doing so, identify key gaps in our knowledge that need to be addressed. We hope to provide a roadmap from hyperexcitability to excitotoxicity so that we can better develop therapies for patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We conclude that studies of upper motor neuron activity and their synaptic output will play a decisive role in this endeavor.

### Revised Airlie House consensus guidelines for design and implementation of ALS clinical trials [^116fKhZv]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

To revise the 1999 Airlie House consensus guidelines for the design and implementation of preclinical therapeutic studies and clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a consensus committee was formed. This committee comprised 140 key members of the international ALS community, including researchers, clinicians, patient representatives, research funding representatives, industry professionals, and regulatory agencies. They addressed nine areas of need within ALS research:

- **Preclinical studies**: Focus on early-stage research.
- **Biological and phenotypic heterogeneity**: Addressing variability in ALS presentations.
- **Outcome measures**: Defining standards for assessing trial results.
- **Disease-modifying and symptomatic interventions**: Exploring treatments for ALS.
- **Recruitment and retention**: Ensuring participant engagement in studies.
- **Biomarkers**: Identifying biological indicators for ALS.
- **Clinical trial phases**: Structuring stages of research studies.
- **Beyond traditional trial designs**: Innovating trial methodologies.
- **Statistical considerations**: Drafted separately by statistical experts.

Committee members were assigned to one of eight sections to generate a draft set of guidelines. These were based on a "background" of developing a (pre)clinical question and a "rationale" that outlined the evidence and expert opinion. A two-day, face-to-face workshop at the Airlie House Conference Center led to a draft of consensus research guidelines developed using a modified Delphi process. These guidelines were reviewed and modified based on public comments. Statistical experts contributed a separate document focusing on statistical aspects (section 9).

In this report, we summarize 112 guidelines along with their associated backgrounds and rationales. The full list of guidelines, statistical considerations, and a glossary of terms are available in data from Dryad (appendices e-3-e-5, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.32q9q5d).

### The multifaceted role of kinases in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: genetic, pathological and therapeutic implications [^116jvARC]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most common degenerative disorder of motor neurons in adults. As there is no cure, thousands of individuals living with the disease will eventually succumb to it. In recent years, numerous causative genes and risk factors for ALS have been identified. Several of these recently identified genes encode kinases. Additionally, the hypothesis that (de)phosphorylation processes drive the disease process, resulting in selective motor neuron degeneration in different disease variants, has been postulated. We re-evaluate the evidence for this hypothesis based on recent findings and discuss the multiple roles of kinases in ALS pathogenesis. We propose that kinases could represent promising therapeutic targets. However, due to the comprehensive regulation of kinases, a better understanding of the disturbances in the kinome network in ALS is needed to properly target specific kinases in the clinic.

Regarding the use of acyclovir IV (also known as Zovirax) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: use only if benefits outweigh potential risks. No adequate or well-controlled studies have been conducted to evaluate the use of acyclovir during human pregnancy; however, published observational studies over decades of acyclovir use have not identified a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriages, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. The drug acyclovir IV (also known as Zovirax) is classified under category B3 in the Australian categorisation system for prescribing medicines in pregnancy. This drug has been taken by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of childbearing age, without an increase in the frequency of malformation or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the human fetus having been observed. Studies in animals have shown evidence of an increased occurrence of fetal damage, the significance of which is considered uncertain in humans.

### Announcement: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) awareness month - May 2016 [^112EGth9]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

May is Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Awareness Month. ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, is a progressive, fatal, neurodegenerative disorder of upper and lower motor neurons. The cause of ALS is not known, and no cure exists. Persons with ALS usually die within 2–5 years of diagnosis.

### HIV-associated motor neuron disease: HERV-K activation and response to antiretroviral therapy [^114X3QPw]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to determine whether there is activation of human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in HIV infection and whether it might respond to treatment with antiretroviral drugs.

- **Methods**: In this case series, we present five patients with HIV infection who subsequently developed motor neuron disease involving both upper and lower motor neurons. We monitored HERV-K levels in the plasma of four of these patients.

- **Results**: Three patients who received antiretroviral therapy experienced a reversal of symptoms within six months of the onset of neurologic symptoms, while the other two showed slow neurologic progression over several years. Three patients, in whom the levels were measured at the onset of neurologic symptoms, exhibited elevated HERV-K levels that responded to the optimization of antiretroviral therapy for CNS penetration.

- **Conclusions**: Motor neuron disease in individuals with HIV infection may be a treatable entity; however, early treatment with CNS-penetrating antiretroviral therapy may be necessary. Monitoring HERV-K levels may help guide treatment.

### ALS drug development guidances and trial guidelines: Consensus and opportunities for alignment [^114kLoyF]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

The study design outlined in the FDA draft drug development guidance strongly recommends that sponsors conduct randomized, placebo (or standard of care)-controlled double-blind studies because these studies are the most efficient way to demonstrate efficacy. The ALS Clinical Trial Guidelines and the Community Guidance also emphasize that randomized controlled trials remain the most robust way to demonstrate efficacy. However, these two documents emphasize the need for flexibility and innovation in clinical trial design, including unequal treatment groups and multiple drug comparisons. Overall, each of the documents highlights the potential utility of an adaptive clinical trial design.

The FDA draft drug development guidance strongly discourages the use of historical controls. Both the ALS Clinical Trial Guidelines and the Community Guidance are less prescriptive and suggest the possibility that well-matched historical controls may provide useful comparator information for middle-stage trials.

Predictive algorithms are not discussed in the FDA draft drug development guidance but are another avenue by which historical controls may be used. The ALS Clinical Trial Guidelines emphasize the potential utility of technology-assisted measurements as exploratory endpoints. The Community Guidance notes that although the Center for Devices and Radiological Health has qualification requirements for technology-assisted measurements, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has no such guideline. Furthermore, the Community Guidance suggests that predictive algorithms could be explored in the middle phase of trials.

### Placebo-controlled, randomized double-blind N-of-1 trial to study safety and potential efficacy of TJ-68 for improving muscle cramps in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A pilot study [^116WUXcR]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Muscle cramps affect 74%–95% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and are among the most common symptoms of ALS. In some patients, muscle cramps are the presenting symptom, preceding muscle weakness. Despite their prevalence, there have been few clinical trials specifically focused on treating muscle cramps in ALS. In clinical practice, only a few drugs are available to treat cramps.

Quinine, the most commonly used medication internationally, is advised against by the FDA despite its evidence base. Off-label medications, such as gabapentin, baclofen, and tizanidine, are used in clinical practice, despite sedation and fatigue being common side effects. Furthermore, there have been no formal studies assessing the benefits and side effects of these medications for the treatment of muscle cramps in ALS.

Over a little more than a decade, two clinical trials with mexiletine demonstrated a reduction in muscle cramps in ALS, but disease-modifying benefits could not be demonstrated. Although mexiletine has an FDA class of drug-related black box warning related to cardiac arrhythmia, no such events have been reported in these studies. While mexiletine can be tried with caution, ranolazine is often used based on limited evidence with an ongoing confirmatory study (NCT06527222). This underscores a clear need for the development of safe and effective medications for the symptomatic treatment of muscle cramps in ALS.

### Phase 2b randomized controlled trial of NP001 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Pre-specified and post hoc analyses [^116C7vhJ]. Muscle & nerve (2022). Low credibility.

Although the phase 2b clinical trial failed, the study provided insight into various roles inflammation might play in ALS pathogenesis. The ALS literature has suggested that patients with elevated levels of CRP progress more rapidly. CRP is generally produced in the liver in response to infection or tissue damage and represents an indirect measurement of these types of disease activity. CRP also augments the function of the innate immune system at clearing infected and apoptotic cells.

The NP001 phase 2b trial designers hypothesized that using elevated CRP levels at baseline as a selection criterion would select for a group of participants with more rapid disease progression, expecting they would be most likely to respond to NP001. However, both the placebo and drug-treated arms of the study progressed more slowly than many prior trials, leading to reduced statistical power to detect slowing of disease progression. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that not all ALS patients share the same type or contribution of inflammation to ALS disease progression.

The post hoc analyses presented in the second half of the manuscript were designed to explore, in a more select group of participants, disease characteristics responsive to NP001. Given the slowly progressive nature of the patients with hs-CRP > 1.13 mg/L described in these studies, another selection is needed to differentiate drug "responders" from exceedingly slow progressors, in order to document, if present, meaningful disease regulatory activity. In both NP001 trials, a novel endpoint was defined.

### EFNS guidelines on the clinical management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MALS) — revised report of an EFNS task force [^116iBJbY]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). High credibility.

The EFNS 2012 guidelines on the medical management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, particularly in the context of palliative care, recommend administering opioids alone or in combination with benzodiazepines for the symptomatic treatment of dyspnea and/or intractable pain, especially if anxiety is present. It is crucial to recognize that titrating the dosages against the clinical symptoms will rarely, if ever, result in life-threatening respiratory depression.

### Effect of RNS60 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A phase II multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^111BnDDt]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). High credibility.

A total of 155 protocol deviations occurred during the study (71 in the RNS60 group and 84 in the placebo group) across 100 patients (49 in the RNS60 group and 51 in the placebo group). Of these, 22 deviations (10 in the RNS60 group and 12 in the placebo group) were due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. The description of all protocol deviations that occurred during the study, along with the number of occurrences in each treatment group, is provided in Table S10.

- **Drug administration route**: The drug administration route required weekly visits to the participating center, causing significant discomfort for disabled patients. For this reason, testing the efficacy of a full treatment via the inhalation route only at the patient's home would have been preferred.

### A placebo arm is not always necessary in clinical trials of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^111dT8AE]. Muscle & Nerve (2009). Low credibility.

Riluzole is currently the only approved medication for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). While other potential neuroprotective agents have been tested in clinical trials, none has been effective, and few symptomatic treatments have been studied. Randomized placebo-controlled trials are necessary to establish the effectiveness of a drug, but an increasing number of potential therapies combined with limited resources means that only a few drugs at a time can be tested for efficacy in ALS. Therefore, priority must be given to agents that show an advantage in early phase trials before proceeding to Phase III efficacy trials.

New strategies are being used to screen different agents, along with their correct dose, in a variety of neurological illnesses, including ALS. Early phase trial designs conducted without a placebo arm improve efficiency, reduce cost, and appeal to patients. Dose-ranging, futility, and selection trials are examples of Phase I and II trial designs that can be conducted without placebo groups.

### Reviewing the evidence for viruses as environmental risk factors for ALS: A new perspective [^1169pSXG]. Cytokine (2018). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease whose etiology remains poorly understood. Since the genetic basis of the disease is known in only a small subset of cases, there has been substantial interest in determining whether environmental factors act as triggers of ALS. Viruses have received longstanding attention as potential ALS triggers; yet, existing studies have not provided a compelling case for causation. This review summarizes the evidence supporting a link between viral infection and motor neuron disease, with a focus on ALS.

- **Limitations of prior studies**: These are discussed and contextualized.
- **Recent work**: Recent studies have provided stronger mechanistic evidence for the role of viruses in disease pathogenesis.

Finally, we offer a new perspective on the association of viruses with ALS and underscore the need for multidisciplinary approaches bridging neurology and infectious diseases research to move the field forward in the future.

### A systematic review of non-motor symptom evaluation in clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^115PWCnP]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

We completed a systematic, unbiased search of trial registries including ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the European Union Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT), and PubMed on 16/09/2020 for Clinical Trials of an Investigational Medicinal Product (CTIMP). Using the search terms "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis" or "motor neuron* disease", we searched ClinicalTrials.gov for interventional trials of investigative medicinal products. We also searched the European Union Clinical Trials Register (EudraCT) and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) for trials of "amyotrophic lateral sclerosis", applying the filters "Phase II", "Phase III", and "Phase IV". Using the advanced search feature, we filtered PubMed with ("amyotrophic lateral sclerosis"[MeSH Terms] OR "motor neuron* disease" [MeSH Terms]), and applied the 'Clinical Trial' filter for article type, human trials only, and publication date within the criteria defined above.

Phase II, III, or IV trials assessing potential disease-modifying therapies in subjects with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that were registered, completed, or published between 01/01/1994 and 16/09/2020 were included. No language restrictions were applied. Extension trials, post hoc analysis papers, stem cell therapies, imaging studies, medical device studies, non-ALS subjects, and trials focused on symptom management were excluded.

### Early intervention with high-dose acyclovir treatment during primary herpes simplex virus infection reduces latency and subsequent reactivation in the nervous system in vivo [^112DSH6J]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

There remains a lack of agreement on the effect of antiviral therapy on herpes simplex virus (HSV) latency and subsequent reactivation. To gain insight into this important issue, a single-cell polymerase chain reaction assay was used to quantify the effects of high-dose acyclovir on latent infection in a mouse model. Treatment with 50 mg/kg of acyclovir every 8 hours reduced the number of latently infected neurons by more than 90% when treatment was begun before 24 hours after infection, and by 80% and 70% when begun at 48 or 72 hours after infection, respectively. The biological significance of these reductions was evaluated using a well-established in vivo reactivation model. The number of animals in which the virus reactivated was reduced significantly, even when acyclovir therapy was delayed until 72 hours after infection, a time when animals had developed lesions. These findings indicate that potent antiviral therapy during early primary HSV infection can reduce the magnitude of latent infection, resulting in a significant decrease in reactivation.

### Refining eligibility criteria for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis clinical trials [^111PRvg3]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

The effect of eligibility criteria on population characteristics and trial endpoints was estimated using a two-step approach. First, we systematically reviewed the literature to compose a list of commonly used criteria and meta-analyzed the baseline characteristics of the included trials. Subsequently, we applied the extracted criteria to an incidence cohort to estimate their effects on survival and functional decline.

- **Search strategy and trial selection**: Two authors individually searched the PubMed and Embase databases for publications dating from January 1, 2000, up to and including November 2017 using the following search terms: amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or motor neuron disease and clinical trial. To harmonize the comparison between clinical trials, we included only randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of a single pharmacologic agent. We excluded clinical trials investigating multiple agents, exclusively aiming to determine safety (phase I), having a nonclinical primary endpoint, or starting enrollment before the approval of riluzole in 1996.

- **Data extraction and harmonization**: For each trial, we extracted the eligibility criteria and baseline characteristics. If a trial included multiple dosing groups, groups receiving the experimental agent were collapsed using a fixed-effects within-study meta-analysis. Predicted vital capacity was recorded as either the forced vital capacity (FVC) or slow vital capacity because there is no true difference between the two values.

### Verdiperstat in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Results from the randomized HEALEY ALS platform trial [^11336cgz]. JAMA Neurology (2025). High credibility.

In this randomized clinical trial, despite the negative results of this particular regimen, it is worth mentioning that the adaptive platform trial design efficiently answered the important question about the clinical efficacy of verdiperstat in ALS. In this respect, the overall platform trial achieved its main objective of rapidly screening experimental drugs for a clinical efficacy signal in an adequately powered phase 2 randomized clinical trial and excluding drugs and/or targets if not relevant to ALS. This and other scientific, statistical, and operational efficiencies that the platform trial paradigm brings to ALS therapeutic development are detailed in the review by Paganoni et al.

### Neurofilament light chain in drug development for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: A critical appraisal [^115H2H8M]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Response biomarkers may be used to show that a biological response, potentially beneficial or harmful, has occurred in an individual who has been exposed to a medical product. In ALS, the current 'gold standard' clinical outcome measures are survival or significant slowing of the rate of disability accrual as indicated by the ALS Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), or a composite of the two such as the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS). Notably, steady-state NfL concentrations do not correlate with contemporaneously collected ALSFRS-R scores, which may continue to decrease. However, there is a robust association between higher steady-state NfL concentrations and faster future rates of progression, as measured by the change in ALSFRS-R over time and shorter survival time.

- **Pharmacodynamic biomarkers**: Pharmacodynamic biomarkers are a type of response biomarker that indicate biological activity of a medical product without necessarily drawing conclusions about clinical efficacy. For example, the international normalized ratio (INR) may serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker when evaluating response to treatment with the anticoagulant, warfarin.

- **Surrogate end-point biomarkers**: Surrogate end-point biomarkers are another type of response biomarker that serve as a substitute for a direct measure of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Importantly, surrogate end-points do not directly measure the clinical benefit or harm but are expected to predict it. For example, reduction in HIV viral load is a validated surrogate end-point.

### How can we improve clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^116523HX]. Nature Reviews Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Since the approval of Riluzole for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 17 years ago, more than 30 large clinical trials have been conducted, but none has proved successful. The failure to translate positive preclinical results into the clinical setting raises questions about the validity of the rodent model that is used to study ALS and about the quality of both preclinical and clinical studies. However, the greatest challenge is the disease itself as, with rare exceptions, the causes are unknown.

In this perspectives article, we highlight key issues related to the pathophysiology, preclinical studies, and clinical trials that should be addressed in the future. These areas include the relationships between different disease mechanisms, the challenges presented by the heterogeneity of the disease, and the need for early intervention, optimal dose selection, and effective biomarkers.

### A 40-week phase 2b randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of memantine in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^113Q7fE3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Due to the COVID‐19 pandemic, remote assessments for clinical trials became a necessity and were rapidly implemented. Typically, trials are limited to subjects living near the study site or to participants with the socioeconomic means to travel. These factors limit diversity, enrollment goals, and feasibility in rare diseases. Large, multi‐site trials can mitigate some challenges, yet the cost and administrative needs can then become a barrier. By quickly training our clinical staff and coordinators across our study sites, we were able to reach our prespecified enrollment goals. Remote assessments have been shown to improve diverse representation, expand access, and potentially reduce costs. However, remote evaluations present new challenges such as technological barriers related to study infrastructure and requirements for patients as well as burden on the patient to input data. The technological requirements for participants to engage in the study may also perpetuate inequities. Future ALS trials can aim to reduce burden on patients and their caregivers by remotely consenting patients and evaluating certain outcome measures remotely.

Limitations to our study include the sample size, which may have been too small to identify a small benefit of memantine. Additionally, there was incomplete data on a few participants due to limited visits, partially due to the COVID‐19 pandemic. FVC was not conducted in all participants, affecting more participants randomized to memantine. Additionally, six participants had only one ALSFRS‐R.

### The scientific and therapeutic rationale for off-label treatments in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^11354eNt]. Annals of Neurology (2024). Low credibility.

Neuroinflammation in ALS is cellularly heterogeneous and functionally dynamic. The CNS innate immune system, predominantly mediated by microglia, plays a role. Advances in imaging technology allow the visualization of reactive microglia infiltration in the motor cortices of PALS. Emerging evidence also supports a role of the peripheral immune system, and regulatory T lymphocytes have already entered ALS clinical trials. These immune cells may have distinct effects, such as neuroprotection or acceleration of motor neuron degeneration at different disease phases, although the mechanisms are not entirely clear.

Early motor neuron loss and disease is associated with reparative immunity through elevated anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4 and transforming growth factor-beta 1. These factors are largely secreted by microglia, Th2 lymphocytes, and regulatory T lymphocytes. In contrast, advanced disease is associated with a maladaptive phenotype, where microglia and T helper 1 and T helper 17 T lymphocytes secrete neurotoxic cytokines, such as IL-6, interferon gamma, and IL-17. Recently, natural killer cells, which are innate lymphocytes that possess cytotoxic capabilities akin to CD8 T cells but lack antigen specificity, tightly correlate with ALS progression rates and show direct motor neuron killing. Small molecule inhibitors of natural killer and myeloid cell activation, such as tofacitinib and masitinib, respectively, have shown interesting potential therapeutic efficacy. As such, communication between immune cells and motor neurons influences disease progression.

### Phase 2b randomized controlled trial of NP001 in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: Pre-specified and post hoc analyses [^113gjVRL]. Muscle & Nerve (2022). Low credibility.

The role of inflammation in ALS pathogenesis may need to be studied in greater detail to understand why different inflammatory signals or pathways track with subsets of ALS patients, potentially targetable with appropriate therapeutics. Although the results presented were largely post hoc, the use of absolute changes in ALSFRS-R scores as a measure of the magnitude of "response" may need to be revisited. The 1.7 units of ALSFRS-R slowing over 6 months in a slowly progressive cohort (36% slowing of decline) might be as clinically meaningful as absolute changes of 2.5 units observed in studies of other drugs conducted among a more rapidly progressive ALS patient subset. Further studies of this population and the relationship to other forms of ALS will be required to validate it as a unique target suitable for drug development.

### Cortical interneuron-mediated inhibition delays the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^116VmUhY]. Brain (2020). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a fatal disease resulting from motor neuron degeneration in the cortex and spinal cord. Cortical hyperexcitability is a hallmark feature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and is accompanied by decreased intracortical inhibition. Using electrophysiological patch-clamp recordings, we revealed parvalbumin interneurons to be hypoactive in the late pre-symptomatic SOD1*G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

- **Chemogenetic intervention**: We discovered that using adeno-associated virus-mediated delivery of chemogenetic technology targeted to increase the activity of the interneurons within layer 5 of the primary motor cortex, we were able to rescue intracortical inhibition and reduce pyramidal neuron hyperexcitability. Increasing the activity of interneurons in layer 5 of the primary motor cortex was effective in delaying the onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated motor deficits, slowing symptom progression, preserving neuronal populations, and increasing the lifespan of SOD1*G93A mice.

- **Conclusion**: Taken together, this study provides novel insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

### Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of disease activity and progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^117Vu4LS]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2022). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterised by progressive motor neuron damage. The disease is generally fatal within 2–4 years, but survival can vary largely among individual patients. The majority of patients do not present with a family history of ALS and are considered sporadic ALS, while about 10% of cases are familial, and over 50 genes associated with ALS pathogenesis have been identified.

Riluzole remains the only approved therapy in Europe, but treatment prolongs the patient's life only by a few months. Over 80 clinical trials have been conducted, although their outcomes have been hampered by the wide range of aetiological and clinical features of ALS. Thus, the heterogeneity of the ALS phenotype requires trial designs that stratify patients into more homogenous groups. Previous clinical trials have largely relied on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) or survival as clinical endpoints, which is time-consuming and insensitive to small therapeutic effects.

The importance of biomarkers in therapeutic development has been emphasised in the revised Airlie House consensus guidelines for ALS clinical trials. Reliable prognostic biomarkers aid in the stratification of patients and thereby may facilitate early and sensitive detection of therapeutic effects in clinical trials. Moreover, biomarker-based prognostication enables personalised patient management, which is accurately tailored to individual progression rates. Pharmacodynamic biomarkers provide direct feedback on whether a candidate drug achieves therapeutic endpoints.

### Functional loss and mortality in randomized clinical trials for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: To combine, or not to combine-that is the estimand [^114d8VRg]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Low credibility.

- **The while-alive strategy**: The critical issue with the hypothetical estimand is that it loses its relevance when death rates increase, irrespective of which method is chosen. For example, if only 50% of the patients survive until month X, how relevant is it for a patient to know their expected improvement in ALSFRS‐R at month X if they are unlikely to be alive at that time anyway? Therefore, as an alternative, we could estimate the treatment effect while the patient is alive.

This changes the information communicated to the patient. For example: "If you continue to take the treatment while you are alive, you can expect an efficacy response of Y% reduction in your ALSFRS‐R progression rate after X months or until death (whichever occurs first) ". In this case, the population‐level summary has changed from a mean difference at month X in the hypothetical estimand to a percent reduction in progression rate after X months or until death (whichever occurs first). Note that we also switch in the while‐alive strategy to progression rates rather than the actual value of our endpoint, and the effect size is no longer linked to any particular timepoint. As a consequence, the treatment effect applies to a patient who survives X months, but also to a patient who dies prior to that time.

### Acyclovir [^115RNmY8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The data presented below include references to peak steady-state plasma acyclovir concentrations observed in humans treated with 30 mg/kg/day (10 mg/kg every 8 hours, dosing appropriate for treatment of herpes zoster or herpes encephalitis) or 15 mg/kg/day (5 mg/kg every 8 hours, dosing appropriate for treatment of primary genital herpes or herpes simplex infections in immunocompromised patients). Plasma drug concentrations in animal studies are expressed as multiples of human exposure to acyclovir at the higher and lower dosing schedules.

Acyclovir was tested in lifetime bioassays in rats and mice at single daily doses of up to 450 mg/kg administered by gavage. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of tumors between treated and control animals, nor did acyclovir shorten the latency of tumors. At 450 mg/kg/day, plasma concentrations in both the mouse and rat bioassay were lower than concentrations in humans.

Acyclovir was tested in 16 in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicity assays. It was positive in 5 of the assays.

Acyclovir did not impair fertility or reproduction in mice (450 mg/kg/day, PO) or in rats (25 mg/kg/day, SC). In the mouse study, plasma levels were the same as human levels, while in the rat study, they were 1 to 2 times human levels. At higher doses (50 mg/kg/day, SC) in rats and rabbits (1 to 2 and 1 to 3 times human levels, respectively), implantation efficacy, but not litter size, was decreased.

### EFNS guidelines on the clinical management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (MALS) — revised report of an EFNS task force [^1172gjot]. European Journal of Neurology (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, specifically concerning therapies with no evidence of benefit, the EFNS 2012 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to support the use of the following:

- **Vitamins and supplements**: This includes testosterone, antioxidants (such as co-enzyme Q-10 and ginkgo biloba).
- **Immune system treatments**: IVIG, cyclosporin, interferons, and glatiramer acetate are not supported.
- **Peptides and neurotrophic factors**: KDI tripeptide and neurotrophic factors, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, IGF-1, and mecasermin rinfabate, lack evidence.
- **Other treatments**: The use of ceftriaxone, creatine, gabapentin, minocycline, stem cells, and lithium is not supported based on current evidence.

### Electrophysiologic endpoint measures in a multicenter ALS drug trial [^111cDDZs]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2001). Low credibility.

We report the analysis of a battery of secondary electrophysiologic measurements to assess the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in a two-center, six-month, double-blind, three-arm trial comparing branched-chain amino acids to L-threonine with pyridoxal 5-phosphate to placebo. The endpoint measurements were chosen to separately assess the effects of lower motor neuron loss and collateral reinnervation.

For tests of inter-center reliability, we found no differences that could not be readily explained by variations in electrophysiologic testing techniques. Since the drug study was negative for the primary endpoint measure (muscle strength), we combined data from both centers and the three treatment arms. For measures of progression, all measures changed in the expected direction during the 6 months of the trial. We conclude that a battery of electrophysiologic measures can be used in a multicenter ALS drug trial to provide information on changes in lower motor neuron numbers and the effects of collateral reinnervation.

### The scientific and therapeutic rationale for off-label treatments in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^116cHGsr]. Annals of Neurology (2024). High credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disease with different clinical phenotypes and molecular causes. This heterogeneity is reflected in the multiple underlying mechanisms that contribute to motor neuron degeneration in ALS, such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, microbiome alteration, and antiretroviral activity. Consequently, targeted therapies that address only one mechanism have had little to no effect on the disease course. There is no cure for ALS, and there is a significant need to identify more effective treatment options for people living with ALS (PALS).

An unexpected resource for identifying potentially interesting treatments for ALS is the growing literature on alternative and off-label treatments (AOTs). For decades, PALS have been using products in this category (including widely available vitamins and nutritional supplements, as well as prescription medications approved for other conditions) along with or instead of approved ALS treatments. A group called ALSUntangled has been systematically evaluating popular ALS AOTs since 2009, with a goal of helping PALS make more informed decisions about them. In this review, we begin by introducing the key ALS mechanisms commonly targeted by AOTs. We also discuss eight of the most interesting AOTs that ALSUntangled has reviewed thus far, which all have plausible mechanisms of action, as well as at least one clinically meaningful benefit in their best available clinical trial. We speculate that targeting specific combinations of these mechanisms might be worthwhile.

### How do we get from hyperexcitability to excitotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [^1156tDJi]. Brain (2024). Low credibility.

It has become increasingly evident that a key pathophysiological event in the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the induction of hyperexcitability of the motor cortex. Studies of patients with ALS have converged upon the conclusion that early motor cortex hyperexcitability, as defined by measures of cortical network function — such as reduced short intracortical inhibition and increased motor evoked potential amplitude — is a pathogenic feature. Such findings have significantly contributed to our understanding of this rapidly progressing neurodegenerative disease and have strengthened support for the "dying forward" hypothesis. This hypothesis traditionally describes the pathological spread as a feed-forward process that relies on glutamate excitotoxicity [see Shaw and Ince and King et al. for more detailed reviews].

Much attention has been directed towards developing therapies that aim to suppress the activation of neurons by glutamate as a treatment for ALS. However, apart from riluzole, most of these treatments have failed to extend patient lifespans or effectively treat their symptoms. Despite frequent glimmers of hope, the ALS research field has a history of therapeutic trials targeting excitotoxicity that fail to reach efficacy, beginning with lamotrigine and dextromethorphan close to 30 years ago.

There are many possible explanations for why the efficacy of new treatments targeting glutamate-mediated hyperexcitability is not consistently effective, such as the long delay in initiating treatment in clinical trials and individual variability in disease progression.

### Medical history of chemotherapy or immunosuppressive drug treatment and risk of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [^114ZxKsW]. Journal of Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

A recent population-based analysis demonstrated a lower risk of the lethal degenerative neuromuscular disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), associated with a history of the use of 'antineoplastic agents' and 'immunosuppressants'. To determine if this finding was generalizable to other ALS cohorts, we examined associations between the use of these agents and ALS risk in an independent case-control study of n = 414 ALS patients and n = 361 controls in an Eastern US population. Controls were sampled from the general population as well as among non-neurodegenerative disease patients.

A history of chemotherapy treatment was significantly associated with a decreased ALS risk (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.22–0.89, P = 0.026). However, we did not observe an association between the risk of ALS and immunosuppressant therapy use (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.50–1.02, P = 0.23). Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, and smoking. Our results support the prior report for chemotherapy treatment and lead to further discussion of the underlying mechanism.

### CDNF rescues motor neurons in models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis by targeting endoplasmic reticulum stress [^112Tao1n]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the spinal cord, brainstem, and motor cortex, leading to paralysis and eventually death within 3–5 years of symptom onset. At the time of writing, no cure or effective therapy is available. The role of chronic endoplasmic reticulum stress in the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, as well as a potential drug target, has received increasing attention.

Here, we investigated the mode of action and therapeutic effect of the endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor in three preclinical models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, exhibiting different disease development and aetiology:

- **The conditional choline acetyltransferase-tTA/TRE-hTDP43-M337V rat model**: Previously described.
- **The widely used SOD1-G93A mouse model**.
- **A novel slow-progressive TDP43-M337V mouse model**.

To specifically analyze the endoplasmic reticulum stress response in motor neurons, we used three main methods:

- **Primary cultures**: Derived from motor neurons of embryonic Day 13 embryos.
- **Immunohistochemical analyses**: Conducted on spinal cord sections with choline acetyltransferase as the spinal motor neuron marker.
- **Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses**: Performed on lumbar motor neurons isolated via laser microdissection.

We show that intracerebroventricular administration of cerebral dopamine neurotrophic factor significantly halts the progression of the disease and improves motor behavior in TDP43-M337V and SOD1-G93A rodent models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

### Treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - what is the next step [^113Nvkkf]. Journal of Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that was previously thought to be untreatable. However, recent evidence in both experimental animals and humans indicates that antiglutamatergic strategies are the first to influence its pathogenesis and slow down the disease process. Since the effect of drugs is still small, this progress should not only be seen as a success of the present but also as a basis for future developments.

How will future studies be designed? They will need to consider that the disease presumably has a long preclinical period and will utilize a number of novel compounds and treatment strategies that have been shown to be effective in transgenic animal models. This implies that we are likely to use a combination of therapies and aim to treat patients early. This early treatment approach will require a novel clinical attitude toward the diagnosis of the disease and the development of novel markers for both the preclinical period and the longitudinal course of the disease.

### Treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis — what is the next step [^114cfCmB]. Journal of Neurology (2000). Low credibility.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that was once considered untreatable. However, recent evidence in both experimental animals and humans indicates that antiglutamatergic strategies are the first to impact its pathogenesis and slow down the disease process. Although the effect of drugs remains small, this progress should not only be seen as a success of the present but also acknowledged as a foundation for future developments.

How will future studies be designed? They will need to consider the presumably long preclinical period of the disease and employ a variety of novel compounds and treatment strategies proven effective in transgenic animal models. This approach implies that a combination of therapies is likely, with an emphasis on early intervention. This will necessitate a novel clinical attitude toward the diagnosis of the disease, as well as the development of new markers for both the preclinical period and the longitudinal course of the disease.

### Radicava ORS [^111dLWRe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of Radicava ORS is based on a bioavailability study comparing Radicava and Radicava ORS [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The efficacy of Radicava for the treatment of ALS was established in a 6-month, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study conducted in Japanese patients with ALS who were living independently and met the following criteria at screening:

- **Functionality**: Retained most activities of daily living, defined as scores of 2 points or better on each individual item of the ALS Functional Rating Scale – Revised (ALSFRS-R; described below).
- **Normal respiratory function**: Percent-predicted forced vital capacity values of ≥ 80%.
- **ALS diagnosis**: Definite or probable ALS based on El Escorial revised criteria.
- **Disease duration**: 2 years or less.

The study enrolled 69 patients in the Radicava arm and 68 in the placebo arm. Baseline characteristics were similar between these groups, with over 90% of patients in each group being treated with riluzole.

Radicava was administered as an intravenous infusion of 60 mg given over a 60-minute period according to the following schedule:

- **Initial treatment cycle**: Daily dosing for 14 days, followed by a 14-day drug-free period (Cycle 1).
- **Subsequent treatment cycles**: Daily dosing for 10 days out of 14-day periods, followed by 14-day drug-free periods (Cycles 2–6).

The primary efficacy endpoint was a comparison of the change between treatment arms in the ALSFRS-R total scores from baseline to Week 24. The ALSFRS-R scale consists of 12 questions that evaluate fine motor and gross motor skills.

### Revised Airlie House consensus guidelines for design and implementation of ALS clinical trials [^111VbPFM]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Symptomatic interventions are those that do not modify the underlying pathophysiology but treat specific symptoms. In trials of disease-modifying interventions, symptom management (e.g. with noninvasive ventilation [NIV], nutrition, and gastrostomy) may alter results obtained using validated disease scales and affect other trial outcomes, including survival. Relatively few studies of symptomatic therapies or medical devices have been completed.

ALS is the result of a complex cascade involving multiple cell types and various mechanisms converging to result in motor neuron cell death. Thus, novel therapies could be aimed at multiple aspects of the disease cascade (i.e. multidrug trials). Combination drug therapies have proven effective for other diseases (e.g. HIV, lymphoma), even when the agents involved have not shown individual efficacy. Hence, it may not be necessary to demonstrate efficacy separately for single drugs prior to using them in multidrug ALS trials. Disease-specific biomarkers relative to the various mechanisms being tested will be needed to assess the contribution of each drug in a multidrug trial.

- **Guidelines**: When a symptomatic intervention is effective (e.g. NIV), the investigator should consider permitting its use for trial participants. Ethical implications and challenges to enrollment should be carefully considered if such a symptomatic intervention is used as an exclusion factor for participation. Investigators should plan a priori analyses and standardize and record the use of interventions.

### Inhibition of HERV-K (HML-2) in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients on antiretroviral therapy [^112qYRZR]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2021). Low credibility.

Reactivation of Human Endogenous Retrovirus K (HERV-K), subtype HML-2, has been associated with the pathophysiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We aimed to assess the efficacy of antiretroviral therapy in inhibiting HML-2 in patients with ALS and a possible association between the change in HML-2 levels and clinical outcomes. We studied the effect of 24 weeks of antiretroviral combination therapy with abacavir, lamivudine, and dolutegravir on HML-2 levels in 29 ALS patients. HML-2 levels decreased progressively over 24 weeks (P = 0.001) and rebounded within a week of stopping medications (P = 0.02).

- **Responders and non-responders**: The majority of participants (82%), defined as "responders", experienced a decrease in HML-2 at week 24 of treatment compared to pre-treatment levels. Differences in the evolution of some clinical outcomes could be seen between responders and non-responders. FVC decreased 23.69% (SE = 11.34) in non-responders and 12.71% (SE = 8.28) in responders. NPI score decreased 91.95% (SE = 6.32) in non-responders and 53.05% (SE = 10.06) in responders (P = 0.01).

Thus, participants with a virological response to treatment showed a trend for slower progression of the illness. These findings further support the possible involvement of HML-2 in the clinical course of the disease.

### A systematic review of attributes influencing preferences for treatments and interventions in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [^112YAez3]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Low credibility.

Understanding the preferences of patients towards treatments and interventions goes beyond assessing effectiveness; it evaluates the acceptability and desirability, revealing the underlying factors influencing adherence. Such insights can be used to adjust and tailor care to the wishes of the patient. Adopting this approach has consistently been shown to increase treatment satisfaction and adherence, ultimately improving patients' quality of life.

In many conditions without a cure, the focus of care is on improving quality of life. Patient-centered care allows healthcare interventions to consider individual needs, bringing about meaningful improvements to life. The treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) encompass both disease-modifying and symptomatic approaches. Disease-modifying drugs vary in efficacy, administration, side effects, and cost. Global regulatory differences further complicate treatment availability. As disease-modifying treatments offer only modestly effective benefits in altering the disease's progression, optimizing quality of life remains central to ALS care. Beyond drug therapies, nutritional support, psychosocial care, physiotherapy, and assistive equipment (including communication aids and respiratory support) are crucial for managing symptoms and enhancing quality of life. Digital health tools are also increasingly used to improve care accessibility and remote monitoring of the disease.

It is particularly important to measure preferences in ALS as treatment and intervention options are complex and may require trade‐offs.
