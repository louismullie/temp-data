## Question

antibiotic other than penicillins for acute bronchitis and sinusitis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about non-penicillin antibiotic options for acute bronchitis and acute sinusitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about distinguishing when antibiotics are indicated for each condition. Then, I should extract non-penicillin alternatives specifically studied or recommended for these entities. Next, I will verify labeled dosing and duration where available. After that, I need to consider resistance patterns and guideline cautions that would exclude some options. Finally, I will double-check that each recommendation is supported by the provided references and note any stewardship or allergy de-labeling considerations [^111A45hc] [^111khKvo] [^115oMEci].

> Let me first confirm indications, because prescribing hinges on whether antibiotics are appropriate. Acute bronchitis in patients without chronic lung disease is typically viral and self-limited; antibiotics yield only a small, clinically uncertain reduction in cough and should generally be avoided, so if antibiotics are considered, it is often in the context of bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis rather than uncomplicated acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy hosts [^111A45hc]. By contrast, acute bacterial rhinosinusitis should be considered for antibiotics when symptoms are severe for ≥ 3 days, worsen after initial improvement at 3–5 days, or persist ≥ 7 days, with amoxicillin or amoxicillin/clavulanate as first-line if no beta-lactam allergy, but our focus will be on non-penicillin alternatives for those who cannot receive penicillins [^111khKvo] [^11552ayP].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I initially thought "penicillins are first-line for both conditions when antibiotics are indicated", but wait — that does not apply to uncomplicated acute bronchitis, where antibiotics are usually unnecessary and offer limited benefit; that "first-line penicillin" statement pertains to sinusitis and not to routine bronchitis in otherwise healthy adults, so I need to keep the bronchitis discussion restricted to scenarios like acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis (AECB) where antibiotics were actually studied [^111A45hc] [^11552ayP].

> Now, for acute bronchitis scenarios where antibiotics are actually indicated (i.e. AECB), let me verify the non-penicillin options and dosing from labeled trials. Moxifloxacin 400 mg orally once daily for 5 days achieved 89% clinical success and was non-inferior to clarithromycin in a randomized controlled trial of AECB, making it a fluoroquinolone alternative that avoids penicillin class agents [^1176j7xN]. Clarithromycin 500 mg orally twice daily for 10 days also achieved 89% clinical success in AECB and has additional tolerability data favoring the XL formulation's gastrointestinal profile, although the overall benefit of antibiotics in uncomplicated acute bronchitis remains limited and should be weighed carefully against risks [^1176j7xN] [^114jEhjY] [^111A45hc].

> Next, I should review non-penicillin options for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, especially in patients with beta-lactam allergy. For adults with a true beta-lactam allergy, recommended alternatives include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; among the latter, moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 10 days was comparable to cefuroxime, and levofloxacin 500 mg daily for 10 days performed similarly to amoxicillin/clavulanate in ABS trials, supporting these as non-penicillin choices when indicated [^111khKvo] [^1176j7xN] [^114o1Y4f]. For children with non–type I penicillin hypersensitivity, clindamycin combined with a third-generation cephalosporin is an option, and cefdinir as a third-generation cephalosporin has supportive effectiveness data in ABRS, though the cephalosporin component remains a beta-lactam albeit not a penicillin, which still meets the "non-penicillin" request [^111khKvo] [^113acDkg].

> Wait, I should confirm resistance caveats for sinusitis, because they can exclude some non-penicillin choices. Current primary care guidance advises not to use trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or macrolide monotherapy for ABRS due to high resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, even though older studies suggested symptomatic improvement with clarithromycin, so macrolide monotherapy should be avoided for ABRS despite those earlier findings [^115oMEci] [^112L8ZPq]. More broadly, unnecessary antibiotic use fuels resistance, with at least one in three antibiotic prescriptions being unnecessary for respiratory infections, underscoring the need for stewardship and careful diagnostic thresholds before initiating therapy [^114bSWeV].

> I need to ensure allergy labeling is handled thoughtfully, since many patients labeled "penicillin allergic" are not truly allergic. Implementing penicillin skin testing protocols increases appropriate testing and can enable the safe use of first-line beta-lactams, while pediatric emergency department data show that a reported penicillin allergy drives broader-spectrum and alternative antibiotic use; where feasible, de-labeling can expand options and improve stewardship before defaulting to broader non-penicillin agents [^1173cYwQ] [^115XQx9g].

> Let me reconsider treatment durations for respiratory infections in light of evolving evidence. Although label trials for sinusitis commonly used 7–10 days and AECB used 5–10 days depending on agent, an umbrella review across respiratory infections generally supports shorter effective courses when clinically appropriate, so clinicians should align duration with up-to-date guidance while staying within the evidence used for the specific agent and indication noted in the labeled trials [^1115KrVP] [^1176j7xN] [^114o1Y4f].

> I should double-check that each agent I am listing is tied to a provided source and applied appropriately. Moxifloxacin for AECB and ABS with dosing is from the FDA label, clarithromycin for AECB is from the same label and tolerability data from the Biaxin label, doxycycline and respiratory fluoroquinolone alternatives for ABRS in beta-lactam allergy are from AAFP, levofloxacin for ABS is supported as a comparator in an ABS RCT, cefdinir effectiveness in ABRS is described in an otolaryngology review, and the "do not use macrolides or TMP/SMX for ABRS" caution is from the 2025 AAFP review, which aligns with the resistance concerns highlighted in broader antibiotic stewardship literature [^1176j7xN] [^114jEhjY] [^111khKvo] [^114o1Y4f] [^113acDkg] [^115oMEci] [^114bSWeV].

> Pulling this together concisely, here is the clinically actionable answer. For acute bronchitis, antibiotics are usually not indicated; when treating acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, non-penicillin options include moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 5 days or clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 10 days, recognizing the overall modest benefit and the need for stewardship in uncomplicated cases. For acute bacterial rhinosinusitis in patients who cannot take penicillins, use doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone (e.g., moxifloxacin 400 mg daily for 10 days or levofloxacin 500 mg daily for 10 days), and in children with non–type I reactions consider clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin such as cefdinir; avoid macrolide or TMP/SMX monotherapy due to resistance, and tailor duration to current guidance while respecting labeled evidence [^111A45hc] [^1176j7xN] [^114jEhjY] [^111khKvo] [^114o1Y4f] [^113acDkg] [^115oMEci] [^1115KrVP].

For acute bronchitis, **antibiotics are not routinely recommended** [^111A45hc] because most cases are viral; if bacterial infection is suspected in penicillin-allergic patients, use doxycycline or a macrolide (azithromycin or clarithromycin) [^111mYYWd]. For acute bacterial sinusitis in penicillin-allergic patients, **doxycycline is first-line** [^115oMEci]; if not tolerated, use a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin [^114o1Y4f] or moxifloxacin) [^1176j7xN] [^111khKvo]. Macrolides and TMP/SMX are not recommended for sinusitis due to high resistance [^115oMEci]. Cephalosporins may be used in non-anaphylactic penicillin allergies, but avoid in severe reactions [^115d74AE].

---

## Antibiotic alternatives for acute bronchitis

Antibiotics are generally **not recommended** for acute bronchitis because most cases are viral and self-limiting [^111A45hc]. However, when bacterial infection is suspected or confirmed — particularly in patients with chronic lung disease or immunocompromise — non-penicillin alternatives may be considered.

---

### Recommended alternatives

- **Doxycycline**: Effective against common bacterial pathogens associated with acute bronchitis, including atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae [^111mYYWd].

- **Macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin)**: Useful for atypical pathogens and in patients with mild penicillin allergies. However, increasing resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae limits their use [^115oMEci].

- **Fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin)**: Reserved for severe cases or when other antibiotics are contraindicated due to potential serious adverse effects and resistance concerns [^114bSWeV].

---

## Antibiotic alternatives for acute bacterial sinusitis

Acute bacterial sinusitis (ABRS) is commonly treated with penicillins; however, **alternatives are needed** for patients with penicillin allergies or when resistance is a concern [^11552ayP].

---

### Recommended alternatives

- **Doxycycline**: First-line alternative for patients with penicillin allergies [^115oMEci]. Effective against common pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis [^111khKvo].

- **Respiratory fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin)**: Recommended for patients with severe penicillin allergies or when doxycycline is contraindicated [^1176j7xN]. These antibiotics provide broad coverage but should be reserved due to potential serious adverse effects and resistance concerns [^111khKvo].

- **Cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefdinir, cefpodoxime)**: Suitable for patients with mild penicillin allergies (non-anaphylactic reactions). These antibiotics provide effective coverage against common sinus pathogens [^113acDkg].

---

## Clinical considerations and guidelines

When selecting alternative antibiotics, **clinicians should consider**:

- **Allergy severity**: Cephalosporins may be used in patients with mild penicillin allergies, but should be avoided in patients with severe allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) [^115d74AE].

- **Resistance patterns**: Local resistance patterns should guide antibiotic selection to ensure effective treatment [^111tAzL4].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and potential drug interactions should be considered when selecting alternative antibiotics [^114RCeCn].

### Acute rhinosinusitis: Rapid evidence review [^115oMEci]. American Family Physician (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, specifically with respect to antibiotic therapy, second-line AAFP 2025 guidelines recommend not using TMP/SMX or macrolide antibiotics alone for the treatment of ABRS due to high rates of resistance among S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae.

### Are antibiotics effective in the treatment of acute bronchitis [^111A45hc]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

In patients without underlying lung disease, antibiotics in acute bronchitis appear to decrease cough. However, the clinical significance of this decrease is uncertain. Their use should be weighed against the cost and potential adverse effects for the treatment of a self-limiting disease.

### Acute rhinosinusitis: Rapid evidence review [^111khKvo]. American Family Physician (2025). Low credibility.

Acute rhinosinusitis causes more than 30 million patients to seek health care per year in the United States. Respiratory tract infections, including bronchitis and sinusitis, account for 75% of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. Sinusitis is a clinical diagnosis; the challenge lies in distinguishing between the symptoms of bacterial and viral sinusitis. Cardinal features of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis are unilateral facial pain or pressure, fever greater than 102°F (39°C), and purulent nasal discharge with obstruction of the nasal passages.

Antibiotics should be considered for patients with three or more days of severe symptoms, significant worsening after three to five days of symptoms, or seven or more days of symptoms. Diagnostic testing for acute rhinosinusitis with antral puncture is impractical because of its invasiveness. Point-of-care testing for elevated C-reactive protein may be helpful, but it is not widely available. Studies have shown that amoxicillin is as effective as amoxicillin-clavulanate as a first-line treatment for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis for those without a beta-lactam allergy. For patients with a beta-lactam allergy, appropriate antibiotics include doxycycline or a respiratory fluoroquinolone; clindamycin plus a third-generation cephalosporin is an option for children with non-type I hypersensitivity to beta-lactam antibiotics. Supportive care for rhinosinusitis, including use of saline irrigation, nasal steroids or antihistamines, and decongestants, may help reduce the severity of symptoms. Most episodes of rhinosinusitis are self-limiting.

### Does the penicillin allergy label affect outcomes of complicated odontogenic infections [^1173sNtH]. Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (2023). High credibility.

Penicillins are a potent antibiotic in managing odontogenic infections, but 10% of the population is labeled as allergic to these drugs. This has limited their use and resulted in increased utilization of healthcare resources, as well as complications associated with alternative antibiotics. The purpose of the study was to measure the association between patients labeled as penicillin allergic and treatment outcomes in a sample of patients treated for complicated odontogenic infections. Additionally, the study sought to investigate antibiotic resistance patterns in these patients.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective cohort study was performed at the Michigan Medicine healthcare system, including patients treated for complicated odontogenic infections by oral and maxillofacial surgery between 2016 and 2020. A complicated odontogenic infection was defined as any infection requiring admission and surgical management in the operating room. The primary predictor variable was the penicillin allergy label, determined by chart review and not confirmed with formal testing. Outcomes were measures of disease severity. The primary outcome variable was hospital length of stay. Secondary outcome variables were ICU admission (yes/no), repeat computed tomography scan(s), repeat surgery (yes/no), and re-admission (yes/no). Co-variates included age, sex (male/female), tobacco use status, diabetes, immunocompromised state, number of spaces involved, white blood cell count upon admission, and insurance status.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^115QzjR6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Another mechanism whereby bacteria could cause mucosal inflammation without causing an infection is by releasing super-antigens. The best evidence for this process occurring in CRS has been found in the mucosa of patients colonised with Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in cases of CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). However, if super-antigens were a key component of the pathogenesis of CRS, it may reasonably be anticipated that CRS would respond more consistently to anti-Staphylococcal agents than it does in clinical practice.

The clinical relevance of a single, cultured bacterial species within the context of the polymicrobial communities of the sinonasal mucosa, many members of which are recalcitrant to standard culture efforts, remains unclear. Such an approach may poorly represent the in vivo processes involved in the pathogenesis of CRS. Standard culture techniques provide a limited range of conditions for microbial growth and thus may fail to detect taxa that require specific conditions. The disparity between the identification of microbes by culture and those (viable but nonculturable) identified by molecular methods has been termed "the great plate count anomaly", with estimates of the nonculturable portion of microbial communities ranging between 25% and 99%.

Modern culture-independent (molecular) techniques have vastly improved our understanding of the microbiology of CRS. Recent studies have better captured the complexity of the microbial communities associated with CRS, rather than focusing on the effects of a single isolated (and culturable) organism.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^113oNzHc]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Topically administered antibiotics would potentially have the advantages of minimal systemic absorption and associated adverse effects while managing to deliver significantly greater concentrations to the desired site. However, topical therapies in unoperated sinuses have limited penetrance and are usually not included in medical regimens prescribed for CRS. With the recognition of S. aureus as a pathogenic disease modifier of CRS, the effect of treating surgically recalcitrant postoperative patients with topical mupirocin has been studied, and some efficacy has been demonstrated. However, there is also evidence that mupirocin irrigation may lead to resistance and the predominance of resistant bacteria such as P. aeruginosa. After mupirocin lavages are stopped, colonization with S. aureus tends to recur.

In patients with a background of CF or primary dyskinesia, in whom P. aeruginosa is often the dominant pathogen, topical gentamicin may be administered either by nebulization or addition to lavage bottles. However, long-term treatment has been shown to induce a moderate incidence of gentamicin resistance. In both the idiopathic CRS population and in the CF population, the available evidence does support short-term treatment with topical antibiotics for exacerbations.

Novel topical antibiotic delivery methods, such as co-delivering antibiotics with fibrin sealant at the completion of functional endoscopic sinus surgery and applying a drug-eluting stent containing an ivacaftor-ciprofloxacin mixture, are being studied.

### Are cephalosporins safe for surgical prophylaxis in patients with penicillin allergy [^115sPQXG]. The Laryngoscope (2024). Low credibility.

Cefazolin, also known as Ancef, is a first-generation cephalosporin antibiotic often used in surgery to treat or prevent bacterial infection of the surgical site. Ancef is safe for most of the population; however, many physicians use alternative, less effective medications in patients with penicillin allergy due to a fear of cross-reactivity between Ancef and one's penicillin allergy. In this article, we aim to examine if cefazolin is safe for patients with penicillin allergy.

### Treatment options for chronic rhinosinusitis [^112Dt9y7]. Proceedings of the American Thoracic Society (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is defined as persistent symptomatic inflammation of the nasal and sinus mucosa. Although insights into the pathophysiology of CRS have largely expanded over the last two decades, the exact etiology is still unknown and is likely due to multiple host and environmental factors. Treatments are aimed at reducing mucosal inflammation, controlling infection, and restoring mucociliary clearance within the sinuses. The principal goal of this article is to outline a rational approach to the treatment of chronic sinus disease based on currently available diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Emphasis is placed on the management, therapeutic response, and objective evaluation of therapeutic efficiency.

### Sinuva [^117QFdpd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Study 1 monitored patients from Day 90 through 6 months. Hypersensitivity (4% (n = 2) vs. 0), chronic rhinosinusitis (11% (n = 6) vs. 9% (n = 4)), and upper respiratory tract infections (8% (n = 4) vs. 2% (n = 1)) were reported in more than two subjects in the treatment group and more commonly than the control group during this time period.

The safety of repeat administration of the Sinuva sinus implant was evaluated in Study 3, which was an open-label, single-arm, multicenter study involving 50 patients. All patients underwent an in-office bilateral placement of the Sinuva sinus implant in each ethmoid sinus, totaling two implants, and were followed for 365 days. Patients were required to use mometasone furoate nasal spray once daily (200 mcg of mometasone furoate) through 365 days. At 90 days, the remaining implants were removed. To maximize the size of the safety population, patients with ethmoid sinus polyps grade ≥ 1 on any side were considered for repeat implant placement. Repeat placement was not performed if the polyp grade was < 1, or if the patient declined it. Of the 50 patients, 41 received repeat implant placement (33 bilaterally and 8 unilaterally). Common adverse reactions in at least three subjects who underwent repeat placement during the study period included acute sinusitis (29%, n = 12), upper respiratory infection (17%, n = 7), epistaxis (12%, n = 5), nasal discomfort or rhinalgia (12%, n = 5), and headache (7%, n = 3).

- **Postmarketing experience**: The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of the Sinuva sinus implant. These events have been…

### Safety of antibiotic irrigations for acute exacerbations of chronic rhinosinusitis in patients with identical drug allergies or adverse reactions: A pilot study [^113Qn5mj]. Ear, Nose, & Throat Journal (2023). Low credibility.

Use of topical antibiotics in the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic rhinosinusitis (AECRS) represents a viable option prior to the initiation of parenteral antibiotics when no oral antibiotic alternatives are available due to patient allergy or adverse reactions. The main objectives of this pilot study were to determine the safety and efficacy of antibiotic irrigations in the treatment of AECRS in patients with documented adverse reactions to the oral form of the drug.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was performed on patients diagnosed with AECRS treated with antibiotic irrigations. Inclusion criteria included a documented allergy or adverse event to the systemic form of the same antibiotic. Patient demographics, medical history, prior sinus surgery, nasal endoscopy findings, and microbiology results were obtained. Side effects to the antibiotic irrigations were recorded.

- **Results**: Six patients met the inclusion criteria, resulting in seven treated cases of AECRS. Four patients with adverse effects to oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) received TMP/SMZ irrigations, and one patient with an adverse reaction to oral ciprofloxacin was treated with ciprofloxacin irrigations. One patient with adverse effects to both oral TMP/SMZ and levofloxacin was treated with TMP/SMZ and levofloxacin irrigations during two separate AECRS episodes. Following treatment, one case (14.3%) resulted in complete resolution of infection, one (14.3%) had partial improvement, and five (71.4%) had minimal to no endoscopic improvement at the subsequent clinic visit.

### Biaxin [^114jEhjY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

In the acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute maxillary sinusitis studies, overall gastrointestinal adverse events were reported by a similar proportion of patients taking either Biaxin tablets or Biaxin XL tablets. However, patients taking Biaxin XL tablets reported significantly less severe gastrointestinal symptoms compared to patients taking Biaxin tablets. In addition, patients taking Biaxin XL tablets had significantly fewer premature discontinuations for drug-related gastrointestinal or abnormal taste adverse events compared to Biaxin tablets.

In community-acquired pneumonia studies conducted in adults comparing clarithromycin to erythromycin base or erythromycin stearate, there were fewer adverse events involving the digestive system in clarithromycin-treated patients compared to erythromycin-treated patients (13% vs. 32%; p < 0.01). Twenty percent of erythromycin-treated patients discontinued therapy due to adverse events compared to 4% of clarithromycin-treated patients.

In two U.S. studies of acute otitis media comparing clarithromycin to amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate in pediatric patients, there were fewer adverse events involving the digestive system in clarithromycin-treated patients compared to amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate-treated patients (21% vs. 40%; p < 0.001). One-third as many clarithromycin-treated patients reported diarrhea as did amoxicillin/potassium clavulanate-treated patients.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^112tjjJt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

If acute and chronic cases are combined, rhinosinusitis (RS) is currently the most common indication for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in the United States. There are several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses demonstrating no evidence of benefit from antibiotics for the common cold/acute RS (ARS), and some evidence supporting the efficacy of antibiotics in the treatment of a select group of patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS). However, there are only two published placebo-controlled randomized trials of antibiotic efficacy for chronic RS (CRS), defined as RS symptoms lasting more than 12 weeks.

Guidelines differ regarding whether antibiotics should be included as part of the regimen for medical therapy for CRS, which reflects both the paucity of rigorous and consistent evidence supporting their efficacy and the persisting uncertainty about the role of microbes in the pathogenesis of CRS. This article reviews the rationale for and against antibiotic treatment of CRS based on available clinical evidence as well as the understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition. We will focus primarily on diffuse primary CRS in adults, but antibiotic recommendations for some special considerations will also be discussed. The review will not cover the role of antifungals in the treatment of fungal sinusitis.

CRS encompasses a complex, heterogeneous group of debilitating chronic inflammatory sinonasal diseases. The changing of treatment recommendations over time reflects the evolution of understanding in this field.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114uHCQS]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Several non-placebo-controlled randomized studies compared parallel, short-term antibiotic regimens in cases of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Fan et al. found that patients in a higher dose clarithromycin group demonstrated better nasal symptom scores, as well as improved Lund-Kennedy and Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-20 (SNOT-20) scores at weeks 2 and 4 compared to both baseline values and the low dose clarithromycin group. Namyslowski et al. showed improvement in CRS or acute exacerbation of CRS (AECRS) symptoms at days 3 to 5 in patients taking amoxicillin/clavulanate, compared to those taking cefuroxime. However, by days 15 to 18, there was no significant difference in clinical cure rates or bacteriologic eradication between the groups. The other five studies had some nuanced results, but, to summarize, showed no difference in symptomatology outcomes between head-to-head comparisons of various antibiotics given in short-term courses. The absence of a placebo arm in these studies precludes substantive conclusions. A minority of these studies evaluated outcomes after one month.

There have been a number of studies on the efficacy of long-term macrolide and non-macrolide antibiotics in CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) and CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Several phase 4 studies have demonstrated symptom improvement, but each study has methodological flaws that limit the conclusions that can be drawn from the results. These studies have been reviewed in great detail elsewhere.

At the time of writing, there have been only two published double-blind randomized controlled trials (DBRCTs) of long-term antibiotic therapy for CRS. Both studies evaluated 12-week treatment with macrolides. Wallwork et al. evaluated roxithromycin at 150 mg daily in 64 patients.

### Augmentinxr [^114o1Y4f]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2010). Low credibility.

- **Clinical studies**: Adults with a diagnosis of acute bacterial sinusitis (ABS) were evaluated in three clinical studies. In one study, 363 patients were randomized to receive either Augmentin XR 2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours or levofloxacin 500 mg orally daily for 10 days in a double-blind, multicenter, prospective trial. These patients were clinically and radiologically evaluated at the test of cure (day 17–28) visit. The combined clinical and radiological responses were 83.7% for Augmentin XR and 84.3% for levofloxacin at the test of cure visit in clinically evaluable patients (95% CI for the treatment difference = -9.4, 8.3). The clinical response rates at the test of cure were 87.0% and 88.6%, respectively.

- **The other two trials**: These were non-comparative, multicenter studies designed to assess the bacteriological and clinical efficacy of Augmentin XR (2,000 mg/125 mg orally every 12 hours for 10 days) in the treatment of 2,288 patients with ABS. Evaluation timepoints were the same as in the prior study. Patients underwent maxillary sinus puncture for culture prior to receiving study medication. At test of cure, the clinical success rates were 87.5% and 86.6% (intention-to-treat) and 92.5% and 92.1% (per protocol populations).

### Systemic and topical antibiotics for chronic rhinosinusitis [^115NsxWK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

This review is one of six examining primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterized by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses, leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure or pain, and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Systemic and topical antibiotics are used to eliminate infection in the short term and, in some cases, to reduce inflammation in the long term, with the goal of normalizing nasal mucus and improving symptoms.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

- **Search methods**: The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL (2015, Issue 8); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP, and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 September 2015.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing systemic or topical antibiotic treatment to (a) placebo, (b) no treatment, or (c) other pharmacological interventions.

- **Data collection and analysis**: We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity, and the commonest adverse event — gastrointestinal disturbance. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, and computerized tomography (CT).

### Utility of prophylactic antibiotics in nonoperative facial fractures [^111TWBJk]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Facial fractures are commonly managed nonoperatively. Patients with facial fractures involving sinus cavities commonly receive 7 to 10 days of prophylactic antibiotics, yet no literature exists to support or refute this practice. The aim of this study was to compare the administration and duration of antibiotic prophylaxis on the incidence of soft tissue infection in nonoperative facial fractures.

A total of 289 patients who were admitted to our level I trauma center with nonoperative facial fractures from the beginning of 2012 to the end of 2014 were studied. Patients were categorized into three groups: no antibiotic prophylaxis, short-term antibiotic prophylaxis (1–5 days), and long-term antibiotic prophylaxis (> 5 days). The primary outcome was the incidence of facial soft tissue infection and Clostridium difficile colitis. Fifty patients received no antibiotic prophylaxis, sixty-three patients completed a short course of antibiotic prophylaxis, and 176 patients received long-term antibiotics. Ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, or a combination of both were used in 216 patients. Twenty-three patients received clindamycin due to penicillin allergy. Short and long courses of antibiotic prophylaxis were administered more commonly in patients with concomitant maxillary and orbital fractures (P < 0.0001). No mortality was found in any group. Soft tissue infection was not identified in any patient. C. difficile colitis was identified in one patient who had received a long course of antibiotic prophylaxis (P = 0.7246).

### Appropriate use of short-course antibiotics in common infections: Best practice advice from the American College of Physicians [^111gsSaf]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of cellulitis, particularly in relation to antibiotic therapy duration, ACP 2021 guidelines recommend completing a 5- to 6-day course of antibiotics active against streptococci in patients with nonpurulent cellulitis. This is especially advised for patients capable of self-monitoring and who have close follow-up with primary care.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^111hf1vB]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

The study of a 12-week course of azithromycin failed to show a significant improvement in subjective or objective outcomes at the completion of the course. However, 12 weeks after completion of the antibiotics, 50% of the azithromycin group reported an improvement or cure compared to 9% in the placebo group (p < 0.05). The single dosing per week is a notable feature of this study, and the authors felt that azithromycin may have been ineffective due to underdosage.

Macrolides have been shown to reduce TH1-mediated non-eosinophilic inflammation when used for durations of at least three months. It may be that there are specific endotypes that will respond better to macrolides than others.

There are no published DBRCTs of long-term non-macrolide antibiotics in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), but there are a few studies with less rigorous experimental designs. Dubin et al. performed a study of non-macrolide antibiotics for the treatment of CRSsNP. In this study, culture-directed antibiotics (clindamycin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate) were given to patients with CRSsNP. Sequential computerized tomography (CT) scans were obtained at 3 and 6 weeks and compared to baseline scans. There was an improvement in CT scores between baseline and week 3, but no significant improvements between week 3 and week 6. The authors concluded that a longer course of antibiotics may achieve radiographic improvement and disease resolution in some patients. Study weaknesses included a small analysable sample size (n = 16), a lack of a washout period, and the inclusion of patients who were already on antibiotics (an average of four previous antibiotic treatments).

### Chlamydophila pneumoniae [^111mYYWd]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2009). Low credibility.

Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection is ubiquitous and accounts for 10% of community-acquired pneumonias, as well as 5% of cases of pharyngitis, bronchitis, and sinusitis in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. It is also involved in the exacerbations of chronic bronchitis and asthma. Moreover, C. pneumoniae has been reported as a possible cause of atherosclerosis and central nervous system disorders. The reference standard for serological diagnosis of acute infection is microimmunofluorescence testing, although molecular detection techniques may soon become the reference diagnostic tests.

Tetracyclines and erythromycin exhibit good in vitro activity and have been the most commonly employed drugs in the treatment of C. pneumoniae infection. New macrolides, ketolides, and fluoroquinolones are other potentially effective drugs. This review analyzes the most recent data concerning the involvement of C. pneumoniae in human diseases.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114bSWeV]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Some unanswered questions in CRS antibiotic research are listed in Table II. Several expert guidelines call for RCTs to study the widespread practice of antibiotics for CRS. Due to the variable quality of much of the existing evidence, it remains uncertain whether the use of short or long-term antibiotics has an impact on patient outcomes in adults with CRS. Further randomized studies with larger population sizes are needed. Unlike macrolides, the combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate is not believed to have direct sinonasal anti-inflammatory properties, and therefore studies are needed to determine conclusively its effectiveness in CRS given the frequency of its prescription for CRS.

Antibiotic resistance is a major threat to public health that demands ongoing attention. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that more than 2 million patients suffer from complications of antibiotic resistance, with 23,000 patients dying from such complications annually in the United States. Furthermore, the CDC estimates that at least 1 in 3 prescriptions for antibiotics are unnecessary, and the majority of unnecessary antibiotics are prescribed for respiratory diseases caused by viruses. Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is critical to combating antibiotic resistance. CRS is an ideal condition to clarify the appropriateness and efficacy of antibiotic prescriptions, which is very pertinent in the context of the global crisis of resistance to antibiotics.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^114LHdAn]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Given that a clear link between bacteria and CRS has not yet been established, an increasing number of researchers have shifted the focus of their research to immunological factors underlying CRS. Some have postulated that CRS is a purely immune-mediated disease in which the observed microbial changes are either secondary or limited to causing exacerbations. Increasingly sophisticated analysis of the inflammatory pathways altered in CRS has revealed many new potential targets for pharmacological intervention, encouraging further research in this field.

- **Inflammatory mechanisms**: CRS has been historically classified by simple clinical phenotyping into CRSwNP and CRS without nasal polyps (CRSsNP). In the contemporary model of CRS pathogenesis, research focus has moved toward the identification of the molecular pathways (or endotypes) that have been activated. In cases of CRS, mucosal barrier disruption may initiate a chronic inflammatory response that fails to resolve. The inflammatory changes may utilize types 1, 2, or 3 inflammatory pathways, either alone or in combination.

Type 1 responses are directed against intracellular pathogens, most commonly viruses, and are characterized by cytokine interferon-γ. Type 2 responses are directed against large, extracellular parasites, and are characterized by cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 as well as activation and recruitment of eosinophils and mast cells. Type 3 responses are directed against extracellular bacteria and fungi and are characterized by cytokines IL-17 and IL-22. Each type of response is mediated by an innate lymphocyte.

### Penicillin G potassium [^1114uRYM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma (see WARNINGS). Whenever allergic reactions occur, penicillin should be withdrawn unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy. Penicillin G Potassium, USP, administered intravenously in high doses (above 10 million units) should be given slowly due to potential adverse effects from the potassium content. Each million units of Penicillin G Potassium for Injection, USP, contains 1.68 mEq of potassium and 0.3 mEq of sodium. The use of antibiotics may lead to overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Indwelling intravenous catheters can encourage superinfections. Should superinfection occur, appropriate measures should be taken. When indicated, incision and drainage or other surgical procedures should be performed alongside antibiotic therapy.

Prescribing Penicillin G Potassium for Injection, USP, in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to benefit the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

- **Laboratory tests**: Periodic assessment of organ system function, including frequent evaluation of electrolyte balance, hepatic, renal, and hematopoietic systems, and cardiac and vascular status, should be performed during prolonged therapy with high doses of intravenous penicillin G (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Introduction of a practice guideline for penicillin skin testing improves the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy [^1173cYwQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

We hypothesized that the introduction of a practice guideline for penicillin skin testing would increase the appropriateness of skin testing and reduce antibiotic costs for patients with a history of penicillin allergy who have infections caused by penicillin-susceptible pathogens. We measured the appropriateness of skin testing and daily antibiotic costs before and after the introduction of a guideline for penicillin skin testing.

For patients who had negative results of skin testing and were subsequently treated with penicillin instead of an alternative antibiotic, we calculated the difference between the actual costs and the projected costs of continuing alternative antibiotics without skin testing. After the guideline was introduced, the appropriateness of skin testing increased from 17% to 64%, but daily antibiotic costs did not change. For patients who had negative results of skin testing and who were subsequently treated with penicillin, there was no difference between actual costs and the projected costs if they had not been skin tested.

We conclude that the introduction of a guideline for penicillin skin testing increases the percentage of eligible patients who have a skin test, and it does so without increasing costs.

### Quality of life in treatment of acute rhinosinusitis with clarithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate [^112L8ZPq]. The Laryngoscope (2004). Low credibility.

Clarithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate (A/C) are first-line antibiotics used to treat uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis (ARS). This study examined the efficacy of clarithromycin and A/C for the treatment of ARS relative to the patient's quality of life (QOL).

- **Study design**: Twenty-two patients with uncomplicated ARS were randomly assigned treatment (single-blinded relative to the investigator) using clarithromycin or A/C. Patients underwent assessment to confirm the diagnosis and treatment outcome at the initial screening and on completion of antibiotics (diagnosis + 14 days and 28 days). QOL was evaluated using the Allergy Outcomes Survey (AOS), the Rhinoconjunctivitis QOL Questionnaire (RQLQ), the Short Form 36 survey (SF-36), an instantaneous six-item Symptom Severity Survey (SSS-6), and a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Surveys were completed at the time of diagnosis, on completion of antibiotics, and at 28 days after diagnosis.

- **Results**: Twenty patients completed the study. The SSS-6 and the RQLQ demonstrated significant improvement for all patients at week 4 (P = 0.002 and P = 0.003, respectively). The SSS-6 demonstrated significant improvement for clarithromycin at 14 days (P = 0.02) and at 28 days (P = 0.029), whereas A/C patients demonstrated significant improvement in symptoms only at 28 days (P = 0.046). The RQLQ, which reflects the previous 2 weeks, demonstrated significant improvement for the A/C patients at 28 days (P = 0.01). The Allergy Survey, the SF-36, and the VAS failed to demonstrate significant improvement in the combined data analysis.

All 31 patients had a history of acute respiratory tract illness, with symptoms initially occurring 5 to 20 days (mean, 11.6 days) before sinus aspiration. Eighteen of the 31 patients (58%) presented bilateral radiographic findings in the maxillary sinuses, while 13 patients (42%) showed unilateral findings. Among these patients, 12 (39%) experienced prolonged fever, 5 (16%) reported buccal pain or headaches, and 18 (58%) exhibited a productive cough. Notably, 20 patients (65%) were unresponsive to antibiotic treatment, predominantly amoxicillin. Additionally, 17 of the 31 patients (55%) had received a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV).

### The evidence base for the optimal antibiotic treatment duration of upper and lower respiratory tract infections: an umbrella review [^1115KrVP]. The Lancet Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Many trials, reviews, and meta-analyses have been conducted comparing short versus long antibiotic treatment durations in respiratory tract infections, generally supporting shorter treatment. This umbrella review aims to assess the soundness of the evidence base for optimal antibiotic treatment duration.

- **Methods**: A search in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and Clarivate Analytics Web of Science Core Collection was conducted on May 1, 2024, without date and language restrictions. Systematic reviews addressing treatment durations in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD), hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), acute sinusitis, and streptococcal pharyngitis, tonsillitis, or pharyngotonsillitis were included. Studies from both inpatient and outpatient settings were included, while reviews in pediatric populations were excluded. Outcomes of interest included clinical and bacteriological cure, microbiological eradication, mortality, relapse rate, and adverse events. The quality of the reviews was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool, with the risk of bias for all included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluated using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (version 1). The overall quality of evidence was determined according to GRADE.

- **Findings**: We identified 30 systematic reviews meeting the criteria; generally, they were of low to critically low quality. Of these, 21 reviews conducted a meta-analysis. Specifically for CAP outside the intensive care unit (ICU), there were 14 reviews, with eight performing a meta-analysis. For AECOPD, there were eight reviews, of which five included a meta-analysis.

### Nafcillin [^1125QnEF]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2011). Low credibility.

Nafcillin should generally not be administered to patients with a history of sensitivity to any penicillin. Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma. Whenever allergic reactions occur, penicillin should be withdrawn unless, in the opinion of the physician, the condition being treated is life-threatening and amenable only to penicillin therapy. The use of antibiotics may result in the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms. If new infections due to bacteria or fungi occur, the drug should be discontinued and appropriate measures taken.

The liver/biliary tract is the primary route of nafcillin clearance. Caution should be exercised when patients with concomitant hepatic insufficiency and renal dysfunction are treated with nafcillin. Serum levels should be measured, and the dosage adjusted appropriately to avoid possible neurotoxic reactions associated with very high concentrations [see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION].

Prescribing Nafcillin for Injection, USP in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of developing drug-resistant bacteria.

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including Nafcillin for Injection, USP, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold).

### Management update of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis and the use of cefdinir [^113acDkg]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis, bacteriology, diagnosis, and antimicrobial treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is reviewed. Most cases of ABRS arise as complications of the rhinosinusitis of colds and other acute viral respiratory infections. Nose blowing during colds may be a risk factor for ABRS by propelling bacteria-laden nasal fluid into the sinus cavity. The bacterial causes of ABRS continue to be S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, other streptococcal species, M. catarrhalis, anaerobes, and S. aureus. Clinical diagnosis of ABRS is based on obtaining a history of a cold or influenza-like illness that is no better or worse after seven or more days. A 10-day course of treatment with an antimicrobial effective against resistant S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae is recommended. A clinical trial was reviewed in which cefdinir was effective in treating ABRS.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride [^1176j7xN]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Acute bacterial sinusitis**: In a controlled double-blind study conducted in the US, moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily for ten days) were compared with cefuroxime axetil (250 mg twice daily for ten days) for the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis. The trial included 457 patients valid for the efficacy analysis. Clinical success (cure plus improvement) at the 7 to 21 day post-therapy test of cure visit was 90% for moxifloxacin and 89% for cefuroxime.

	- An additional non-comparative study was conducted to gather bacteriological data and evaluate microbiological eradication in adult patients treated with moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days. All patients (n = 336) underwent antral puncture in this study. Clinical success rates and eradication/presumed eradication rates at the 21 to 37 day follow-up visit were 97% (29 out of 30) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, 83% (15 out of 18) for Moraxella catarrhalis, and 80% (24 out of 30) for Haemophilus influenzae.

- **Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis**: Moxifloxacin tablets (400 mg once daily for five days) were evaluated for the treatment of acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis in a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial conducted in the US. This study compared moxifloxacin with clarithromycin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) and enrolled 629 patients. Clinical success was assessed at 7 to 17 days post-therapy. The clinical success for moxifloxacin was 89% (222/250) compared to 89% (224/251) for clarithromycin.

### Antibiotics for clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis in adults [^1129kxFt]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

In primary care settings, the diagnosis of rhinosinusitis is generally based on clinical signs and symptoms as technical investigations are neither routinely performed nor recommended. Individual trials show a trend in favor of antibiotics, though the balance of benefit versus harm remains unclear.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effect of antibiotics in adults with clinically diagnosed rhinosinusitis in primary care settings.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2012), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February week 4, 2012), and EMBASE (January 1974 to February 2012).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antibiotics versus placebo in participants with rhinosinusitis-like signs or symptoms were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We contacted trial authors for additional information and collected data on adverse effects from the trials.

- **Main results**: We included 10 trials involving 2,450 participants. Overall, the risk of bias in these studies was low. Irrespective of the treatment group, 47% of participants were cured after one week and 71% after 14 days. Antibiotics can shorten the time to cure; however, only five more participants per 100 will cure faster at any time point between 7 and 14 days if they receive antibiotics instead of placebo (number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 18; 95% confidence interval (CI) 10 to 115, I(2) statistic 0%, eight trials). Purulent secretion resolves faster with antibiotics.

### Temporal patterns of antibiotic prescribing for sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis: A longitudinal study of general practitioner registrars [^114z68kx]. Family Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Antibiotics provide minimal benefit for sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis. Antibiotic stewardship, with reduced prescribing, is required to address antibiotic resistance, especially since most antibiotic prescribing occurs in general practice. As prescribing habits develop early, general practitioner (GP) trainees (registrars) are crucial for effective antibiotic stewardship.

- **Objectives**: To establish temporal trends in Australian registrars' antibiotic prescribing for acute sore throat, acute otitis media, and acute sinusitis.

- **Design**: A longitudinal analysis of data from the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study from 2010 to 2019.

- **Participants**: ReCEnT is an ongoing cohort study of registrars' in-consultation experiences and clinical behaviours. Before 2016, 5 of 17 Australian training regions participated. From 2016, 3 of 9 regions (42% of Australian registrars) participated.

- **Main measures**: The outcome was prescription of an antibiotic for a new acute problem/diagnosis of sore throat, otitis media, or sinusitis. The study factor was year (2010–2019).

- **Key results**: Antibiotics were prescribed in 66% of sore throat diagnoses, 81% of otitis media cases, and 72% of sinusitis cases. Prescribing frequencies decreased between 2010 and 2019 by 16% for sore throat (from 76% to 60%), by 11% for otitis media (from 88% to 77%), and by 18% for sinusitis (from 84% to 66%). In multivariable analyses, "Year" was associated with reduced prescribing for sore throat (OR 0.89; 95% CI 0.86–0.92; p < 0.001), otitis media (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.86–0.94; p < 0.001), and sinusitis.

### Long-term macrolide treatment of chronic inflammatory airway diseases: Risks, benefits and future developments [^1138o3xP]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2012). Low credibility.

Macrolide antibiotics were discovered over 50 years ago, and following their use as antimicrobials, it became apparent that this group of antibiotics also possessed anti-inflammatory properties. Subsequent clinical trials showed benefits of macrolides as long-term adjuncts in the treatment of a spectrum of chronic inflammatory respiratory diseases, particularly diffuse panbronchiolitis, cystic fibrosis, post-transplant bronchiolitis obliterans, and more recently, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The evidence for the efficacy of macrolides in the long-term treatment of chronic asthma and bronchiectasis is less well established.

The mechanism(s) of action of macrolides in the treatment of these diseases remains unexplained, but may be due to their antibacterial and/or anti-inflammatory actions, which include reductions in interleukin-8 production and neutrophil migration and/or function. Macrolides have additional potentially beneficial properties, including anti-viral actions and the ability to restore corticosteroid sensitivity. The increased prescribing of macrolides for long-term treatment could result in the development of microbial resistance and adverse drug effects.

New macrolides have been developed which do not possess any antimicrobial activity and hence lack the ability to produce microbial resistance, but still retain immunomodulatory effects. Potentially, novel macrolides may overcome a significant barrier to the use of this type of drug for the long-term treatment of chronic inflammatory airway diseases.

### Documented penicillin allergies on antibiotic selection at pediatric emergency department visits [^115XQx9g]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Low credibility.

Penicillin or amoxicillin are the recommended treatments for the most common pediatric bacterial illnesses. Allergies to penicillin are commonly reported among children but are rarely true. We evaluated the impact of reported penicillin allergies on broad-spectrum antibiotic use overall and for the treatment of common respiratory infections among treat-and-release pediatric emergency department (ED) visits.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study of pediatric patients receiving antibiotics during a treat-and-release visit at a large pediatric ED in the Northeast from 2014 to 2016. Study exposure was a reported allergy to penicillin in the electronic medical record. Study outcomes included the selection of broad-spectrum antibiotics and alternative (second-line) antibiotic therapy for the treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) and group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis. We used unadjusted and adjusted generalized estimating equation models to analyze the impact of reported penicillin allergies on the selection of broad-spectrum antibiotics. We used unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models to determine the probability of children with a documented penicillin allergy receiving alternative antibiotic treatments for AOM and GAS.

- **Results**: Among 12,987 pediatric patients, 810 (6.2%) had a documented penicillin allergy. Penicillin allergies increased the odds of children receiving a broad-spectrum versus narrow-spectrum antibiotic (adjusted odds ratio, 13.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 11.34–16.18). In our adjusted logistic regression model, the probability of child…

### Clinical practice guideline (update): Adult sinusitis [^114RCeCn]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

This update of a 2007 guideline from the American Academy of Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery Foundation provides evidence-based recommendations to manage adult rhinosinusitis, defined as symptomatic inflammation of the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. Changes from the prior guideline include the addition of a consumer to the update group, evidence from 42 new systematic reviews, enhanced information on patient education and counseling, a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships, expanded opportunities for watchful waiting (without antibiotic therapy) as initial therapy of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis (ABRS), and three new recommendations for managing chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS).

The purpose of this multidisciplinary guideline is to identify quality improvement opportunities in managing adult rhinosinusitis and to create explicit and actionable recommendations to implement these opportunities in clinical practice. Specifically, the goals are to improve diagnostic accuracy for adult rhinosinusitis, promote appropriate use of ancillary tests to confirm diagnosis and guide management, and promote judicious use of systemic and topical therapy, including radiography, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography, and testing for allergy and immune function. Emphasis was also placed on identifying multiple chronic conditions that would modify management of rhinosinusitis, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, immunocompromised states, and ciliary dyskinesia.

The update group made strong recommendations that clinicians should distin

### No "one-size-fits all": Chronic "carryover" diagnoses dilute antibiotic prescribing rates for sinusitis among adults in primary and urgent care settings [^11323Ttx]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Low credibility.

We included all adult telemedicine and office encounters from January 2021 to March 2022 categorized as sinusitis encounters by associated ICD-10 codes from two academic urgent care and eight primary care clinics. To identify these encounters, we used an internal data model to categorize most discharge encounter diagnoses by ICD-10 into tiers — those for which antibiotics are almost always (tier 1), sometimes (tier 2), or almost never (tier 3) indicated. All sinusitis ICD-10 codes are considered Tier 2. In the case of encounters with multiple ICD-10 codes, we classified the encounter by the ICD-10 with the lowest tier. For example, if an encounter was associated with both a Tier 1 (lowest tier) ICD-10 and a sinusitis ICD-10 (Tier 2), it would be classified as a Tier 1 encounter and not included in this analysis. This was done to increase the likelihood that the associated antibiotic prescription was intended for sinusitis. We extracted encounter date, location, ICD-10, and antibiotic prescriptions from the electronic health record.

We calculated sinusitis antibiotic prescribing rates (APRs) by dividing the number of encounters associated with an antibiotic by the total number of encounters. Sinusitis encounters were defined as acute or chronic based on the billed ICD-10 code. We compared overall, acute, and chronic sinusitis APRs by clinic type to assess the impact of ICD-10 definition on APR.

We randomly selected 50% of chronic sinusitis encounters in 2021 as well as 100 acute sinusitis encounters for manual chart review to assess symptom documentation and if antibiotic prescriptions were indicated.

### Penicillin V potassium [^1154S3ux]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Penicillin should be used with caution in individuals with histories of significant allergies and/or asthma. Prescribing penicillin V potassium in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

The oral route of administration should not be relied upon in patients with severe illness, or with nausea, vomiting, gastric dilatation, cardiospasm, or intestinal hypermotility. Occasionally, patients will not absorb therapeutic amounts of orally administered penicillin. In streptococcal infections, therapy must be sufficient to eliminate the organism (10-day minimum); otherwise, the sequelae of streptococcal disease may occur. Cultures should be taken following completion of treatment to determine whether streptococci have been eradicated.

Prolonged use of antibiotics may promote the overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi. Should superinfection occur, appropriate measures should be taken. Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including penicillin V potassium, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g. the common cold). When penicillin V potassium is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of the medication may lead to treatment failure and increased resistance.

### Antibiotic recommendations for acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis: Conundrum no more [^111b1Y38]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2018). Low credibility.

There has been a substantial change in the prevalence and microbiologic characteristics of cases of acute otitis media secondary to the widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines. Trends in nasopharyngeal colonization and the microbiology of acute otitis media support a change in the recommendation for antibiotic management of acute otitis media and acute bacterial sinusitis in children.

### Temporal patterns of antibiotic prescribing for sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis: A longitudinal study of general practitioner registrars [^112sapWh]. Family Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Antibiotic overprescribing is common and problematic. Antibiotic resistance, of which overprescribing is a significant driver, was directly responsible for an estimated 1.27 million deaths in 2019. Without effective intervention, this number will continue to increase. Most antibiotic prescribing occurs in primary care and is, thus, a contributor to antibiotic resistance.

Respiratory and ear-nose-and throat infections are the most common conditions for which antibiotics are prescribed in Australia. Much of this prescribing is unnecessary. Antibiotics are not routinely recommended for sore throat, otitis media, or sinusitis. While there has been a steady decline in antibiotic prescribing rates by Australian general practitioners (GPs) during the period 2010 to 2019, prescribing rates for these three conditions are still well above both Australian and international benchmarks. The decision to prescribe antibiotics for these conditions can be complex, and antibiotics are sometimes indicated. However, evidence suggests limited benefit of antibiotics for sore throat, otitis media, and sinusitis. Therefore, there is a need to further reduce Australian prescribing rates for these conditions.

Prescribing patterns are formed early in a GP's career, and individual GPs' established antibiotic prescribing approaches may persist over time. This makes early-career GPs a focus point for addressing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing. GP specialist vocational trainees (in Australia, termed "registrars") made up approximately 13% of the Australian GP workforce by headcount in 2020–2021.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults [^117Dg7Rm]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Sinusitis is one of the most common diagnoses among adults in ambulatory care, accounting for 15% to 21% of all adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions. However, the role of antibiotics for sinusitis is controversial.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of antibiotics in adults with acute maxillary sinusitis by comparing antibiotics with placebo, antibiotics from different classes, and the side effects of different treatments.

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL 2013, Issue 2, MEDLINE (1946 to March week 3, 2013), EMBASE (1974 to March 2013), SIGLE (OpenSIGLE, later OpenGrey, accessed 15 January 2013), reference lists of the identified trials, and systematic reviews of placebo-controlled studies. We also searched for ongoing trials via ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We imposed no language or publication restrictions.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults. We included trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, confirmed or not by imaging or bacterial culture.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data, and assessed trial quality. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for differences between intervention and control groups regarding treatment failure. All measures are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We conducted the meta-analyses using either the fixed-effect or random-effects model.

### Clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of group A streptococcal pharyngitis: 2012 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^115d74AE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2012). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, particularly in the context of antibiotic therapy, the IDSA 2012 guidelines recommend initiating one of the following regimens in penicillin-allergic patients:

- **First-generation cephalosporin**: Prescribe for 10 days, if the patient is not anaphylactically sensitive.
- **Clindamycin or clarithromycin**: Administer for 10 days.
- **Azithromycin**: Administer for 5 days.

### Different antibiotic treatments for group A streptococcal pharyngitis [^114AaBsW]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). High credibility.

Antibiotics provide only modest benefit in treating sore throat, although their effectiveness increases in people with positive throat swabs for group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (GABHS). It is unclear which antibiotic is the best choice if antibiotics are indicated. This is an update of a review first published in 2010, and updated in 2013, 2016, and 2020.

- **Objectives**: To assess the comparative efficacy of different antibiotics in (a) alleviating symptoms (pain, fever); (b) shortening the duration of the illness; (c) preventing clinical relapse (i.e. recurrence of symptoms after initial resolution); and (d) preventing complications (suppurative complications, acute rheumatic fever, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis). Additionally, to assess the evidence on the comparative incidence of adverse effects and the risk-benefit of antibiotic treatment for streptococcal pharyngitis.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following databases up to 3 September 2020: CENTRAL (2020, Issue 8), MEDLINE Ovid (from 1946), Embase Elsevier (from 1974), and Web of Science Thomson Reuters (from 2010). Clinical trial registers were also searched on 3 September 2020.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised, double-blind trials comparing different antibiotics and reporting at least one of the following: clinical cure, clinical relapse, or complications and/or adverse events.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently screened trials for inclusion and extracted data using standard methodological procedures as recommended by Cochrane. We assessed the risk of bias of included studies.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: Randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^112QyKPU]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

Patients included in the study provided self-assessment of symptoms, adverse events, and preference of dose regimen. No patients were involved in setting the research question, nor were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, design, or implementation of the study. Additionally, no patients were asked to advise on the interpretation or writing up of results. The results will be publicly available on the home page of the Public Health Agency of Sweden.

### Update on the diagnostic considerations for neurogenic nasal and sinus symptoms: A current review suggests adding a possible diagnosis of migraine [^115XRjBX]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2018). Low credibility.

Treatment of rhinosinusitis (RS) is one of the leading reasons for prescriptions of antibiotics, although they often fail to provide symptomatic relief. Appropriately diagnosing and treating patients presenting with RS for whom antibiotic therapy has failed or who have normal CT findings is a controversial topic. One explanation is that what these patients are experiencing is misinformation from the trigeminal nerve and autonomic nervous system. Midfacial pain and pressure with rhinorrhea and nasal congestion do not represent an infectious, or even inflammatory, condition within the sinus or nasal cavities, but rather a mirage that is best treated as a migraine variant.

Observations indicate that although there is not enough research to definitively prove this alternate etiology, we are reaching a tipping point where the clinical implications, real-world experience, and evolving literature support this possible alternate etiology.

- **Pathophysiology**: Pathophysiology literature offers a model of how migraine attacks could replicate clinical presentations of RS.
- **Clinical presentation**: Patients with infectious RS and midfacial migraine have similar symptomatic presentation, similar demographics, but poorly correlated radiological information.
- **Diagnosis**: Clinical studies support the proposition that there are alternative diagnostic tools for distinguishing patients with midfacial migraine.
- **Prognosis**: Select RS patients show significant improvement with migraine treatment.

In conclusion, the information suggests reassessing the diagnostic approach for neurogenic nasal and sinus symptoms and considering the potential diagnosis of migraine as an alternative cause for the symptoms described.

### Penicillin V four times daily for five days versus three times daily for 10 days in patients with pharyngotonsillitis caused by group A streptococci: Randomised controlled, open label, non-inferiority study [^113CsrQF]. BMJ (2019). High credibility.

Sore throat is a common reason for prescribing antibiotics and accounts for about 11% of all antibiotic prescriptions in primary healthcare in Sweden, which is a country with low prescribing rates. Among approximately 29 consultations per 1000 inhabitants for sore throat in 2013, about two-thirds were labeled as tonsillitis, and within this group, 80% received an antibiotic prescription. Group A streptococcus is the most common pathogen in acute tonsillitis and is present in about 33% of patients with acute sore throat. However, other bacteria and viruses are also potential pathogens.

The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) Sore Throat Guideline Group and Swedish guidelines for the management of sore throat focus on patients who are more likely to benefit from antimicrobial treatment. These patients typically have a higher symptom burden and an infection caused by group A streptococcus. The recommendation is that antibiotic treatment should be offered to patients with three or four Centor criteria (fever, tender cervical lymph nodes, coatings of the tonsils, and lack of cough) and a positive rapid antigen detection test for group A streptococcus.

In Sweden, the recommended treatment regimen for adults is 1000 mg penicillin V three times daily for 10 days. This duration of treatment is similar to other countries, but the dosage and total exposure (30 g) are relatively high. The historical reason for antimicrobial treatment is primarily to avoid serious complications such as acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. These conditions are currently extremely rare in high-income countries.

### Defining the optimum treatment regimen for azithromycin in acute tonsillopharyngitis [^112euuzS]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Pharyngitis is one of the most common infectious diseases affecting children. Group A streptococci are the leading bacterial cause of pharyngitis in children and adults. Because inappropriate antibiotic treatment for pharyngitis is becoming a major issue, only true group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) infections, proven by rapid antigen test or culture, should be treated with antibiotics. GABHS pharyngitis is often a mild and self-limiting infection in the absence of antimicrobial therapy. However, antimicrobial treatment must be administered to eradicate the pathogen from the throat, limit the spread of the infection, and prevent possible progression to rheumatic fever, suppurative disease, or toxin-mediated complications.

Penicillin V for 10 days is the standard therapy and is effective in the management of GABHS pharyngitis. However, there are drawbacks to penicillin V therapy, including the length of the dosing regimen, which are leading to decreasing penicillin prescription rates in many countries. In addition, bacteriologic treatment failures have been documented in up to 35% of GABHS patients treated with penicillin V, particularly in children under 6 years old. A number of mechanisms may be responsible for these failures, but poor compliance with the standard 10-day penicillin treatment is likely to be a major factor.

There is growing evidence to suggest that children with GABHS pharyngitis can be effectively treated with non-penicillin V antibiotics, which have the advantage of simpler and shorter dosing regimens compared with penicillin V. Among the antibiotics, th

### Algorithm for the management of primary diffuse chronic rhinosinusitis [^1154npqP]. Allergy (2025). Low credibility.

One hopes that in the near future, biologicals indicated in this algorithm become widely available worldwide. Moreover, we expect more biologics with broader potential to become available. We also foresee that new indications for treatment options for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) will follow our endotype-based classification instead of using unreliable phenotyping as has been done in the past.

Most patients with primary diffuse CRS respond favorably to appropriate medical treatment, such as nasal corticosteroids and saline rinsing. The concept of "treatable traits" further guides us towards our goal of precision medicine.

When patients remain uncontrolled, it is important to endotype the patient before deciding on the next steps. For patients with type 2-dominant disease, a short course of systemic corticosteroids on top of nasal corticosteroids can be an option. In young atopic patients with asthma and sensitization to fungi, allergic fungal rhinosinusitis should be considered, especially in warm and humid climates. In these patients, further radiological evaluation and functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) are advised.

For non-type 2 disease, a treatment of several weeks to months with antibiotics, preferably a macrolide, can be considered, although the evidence is very limited.

For patients with all endotypes that need further treatment, FESS is advised. A majority of patients respond favorably to FESS. Many surgeons, however, believe the results in type 2-dominant disease to be less favorable than in non-type 2 disease, although evidence is limited.

### Upper respiratory infections [^113K2TR4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

It is estimated that more than 24 million cases of acute bacterial sinusitis occur annually in the United States. Recently, a number of medical societies have issued guidelines to aid in the management of upper respiratory tract infections (URIs). Although these guidelines are intended to assist practitioners in the proper use of antibiotics, confusion remains due to the disparity and outdated nature of some guideline recommendations. This review presents three illustrative case studies designed to provide clarity regarding these guidelines.

- **Case 1**: A typical presentation of a patient with worsening sinus conditions over the previous two weeks.
- **Case 2**: A more challenging case of a patient with a sinus condition accompanied by a penicillin allergy, ultimately requiring referral to an otolaryngologist.
- **Case 3**: An atypical case with symptoms of a sinus infection accompanied by a normal sinus computed tomography scan.

It is hoped that the presentation and discussion surrounding these cases will provide helpful insights into the management of patients with URIs.

### Antibiotic-resistant bacteria in pediatric chronic sinusitis [^1156M711]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Limited information exists on emerging bacterial resistance patterns in pediatric chronic sinusitis.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review (1995 to 1998) of the aerobic microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children at a tertiary care children's hospital was conducted. One hundred nineteen children (mean age, 4.9 years) with maxillary sinusitis of more than 8 weeks' duration and no known immunodeficiency or cystic fibrosis who underwent antral irrigation were included.

- **Results**: One hundred sixty-one of 240 (67%) aerobic cultures were positive, yielding 274 isolates. Eighty-eight positive cultures were polymicrobial. The most frequent isolates were nontypable Haemophilus influenzae (24%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (19%), Moraxella catarrhalis (17%), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (6%), alpha-streptococci (6%), diphtheroids (5%), Staphylococcus aureus (3%), and Neisseria spp. (3%).

	- Rates of nonsusceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae were 64% for penicillin (24% high-grade resistance), 40% for cefotaxime, 18% for clindamycin, and 0% for vancomycin. Rates of nonsusceptibility of S. pneumoniae did not change significantly during the study period.

	- Thirty-nine percent of H. influenzae isolates were beta-lactamase-positive, and 44% were nonsusceptible to ampicillin (41% high-grade resistance). Beta-lactamase positivity of H. influenzae decreased during the study period (P = 0.06). All M. catarrhalis isolates tested were beta-lactamase-positive.

- **Conclusion**: This study indicates that the aerobic pathogens in pediatric chronic sinusitis include bacteria typical of acute sinusitis as well.

### Clinical practice guideline: Surgical management of chronic rhinosinusitis [^1161kfWB]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Regarding perioperative care for chronic rhinosinusitis, specifically concerning preoperative medical therapy, the AAO-HNSF 2025 guidelines recommend not endorsing or requiring a predefined, one-size-fits-all regimen or duration of medical therapy. This includes therapies such as antibiotics, corticosteroids, or antihistamines, as prerequisites to sinus surgery for patients with CRS.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^113YiLhx]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

There are no clinical studies whose results support the administration of systemic antibiotics immediately prior to sinus surgery.

According to the classification of surgical wounds, endoscopic sinus surgery is a 'clean-contaminated' operative field, although the grading would change to 'contaminated' if acute, non-purulent inflammation were encountered. An acute inflammatory flare-up or acute sinusitis with purulence would warrant prophylactic antibiotics; however, a clean-contaminated wound does not require prophylactic antibiotics. A survey among American Rhinologic Society members revealed that 54% routinely administered antibiotics on induction, but there is no evidence to support this practice.

The same survey revealed that 62% of respondents routinely administered postoperative antibiotics, with 76% citing a reduction in the risk of postoperative infection as the reason. While culture-directed antibiotic usage in the setting of overt purulence is generally accepted, there is limited evidence for this. The culturing of S. aureus from intraoperative swabs has been associated with worse surgical outcomes. However, a randomized study demonstrated that the general short-term outcomes of surgery did not alter with a course of postoperative antibiotics. Furthermore, while some observed a reduction in early postoperative crusting, others used Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) scores to demonstrate that non-culture-dependent empiric antibiotics led to a reduction in quality-of-life gain in the early postoperative period.

### Is there a role for antibiotics in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis [^116GSbUg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

Rhinosinusitis is one of the most common reasons for adult outpatient antibiotic prescriptions, though there is little clinical evidence to support this practice, especially for chronic rhinosinusitis. Despite considerable research, the etiology of chronic rhinosinusitis, including the pathogenic role of microbes, remains poorly understood. Rigorous studies of the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of chronic sinusitis are surprisingly few in number, and the results are somewhat conflicting. This article will review the rationales for and against the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with antibiotics based on evidence and understanding of pathophysiology, and it will also summarize the guidelines.

### Microbiological profiles and patterns of resistance in patients with sinus infections after endoscopic sinus surgery [^117HdYJq]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Identify common pathogens and antibiotic resistances in chronic rhinosinusitis patients post-endoscopic sinus surgery presenting with an active sinus infection.

- **Study design**: Retrospective chart review.

- **Setting**: Single-institution rhinology private practice in Southeast Florida.

- **Methods**: Recorded postoperative endoscopically-guided sinus cultures from symptomatic patients with purulent drainage on endoscopy from August 2020 to December 2023. Pre- or intraoperatively cultured organisms were collected when available.

- **Results**: Of 125 patients, 50.4% were female with a mean age of 51.0. In 34.4% of patients who underwent revision surgery, 76% had nasal polyps and 26.4% had asthma. Of 301 cultures, 264 (87.7%) were positive, 53 (17.6%) were polymicrobial, and 37 (12.3%) were negative. Of 351 total isolates, 165 (47%) were Gram-negative, 125 (35.6%) Gram-positive, 14 (4%) fungi, and 10 (2.8%) anaerobic. Postoperative organisms were not cultured preoperatively in 46.9% of cases. Gram-negative bacteria included Enterobacteriaceae (17.7%), Pseudomonas spp. (10.5%), and Serratia spp. (5.1%). Gram-positive bacteria included Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA, 17.1%) and Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, 8%). Antibiotic resistances included MSSA resistance to penicillins (52.8%) and clindamycin (32.8%), and MRSA resistance to quinolones (53.6%) and clindamycin (35.7%). Enterobacteriaceae were 42% resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and 37.1% to penicillins, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 17.7% resistant to quinolones.

- **Conclusion**: Return_values for sinus infections. Results highlight the challenge in predicting postoperative microbial profiles based on preoperative cultures.

### Antibiotics for acute maxillary sinusitis [^117Mxw2q]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Expert opinions vary on the appropriate role of antibiotics for sinusitis, one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions among adults in ambulatory care.

- **Objectives**: We examined whether antibiotics are effective in treating acute sinusitis, and if so, which antibiotic classes are the most effective.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2007, Issue 3); MEDLINE (1950 to May 2007); and EMBASE (1974 to June 2007).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotics with placebo or antibiotics from different classes for acute maxillary sinusitis in adults were included. We focused on trials with clinically diagnosed acute sinusitis, whether or not confirmed by radiography or bacterial culture.

- **Data collection and analysis**: At least two review authors independently screened search results, extracted data, and assessed the quality of trials. Risk ratios (RR) were calculated for differences in the intervention and control groups to determine if the treatment failed. In meta-analyzing the placebo-controlled studies, data across antibiotic classes were combined. The primary outcomes were the clinical failure rates at 7 to 15 days and 16 to 60 days follow-up.

- **Main results**: Fifty-seven studies were included in the review: six placebo-controlled studies and 51 studies comparing different classes of antibiotics. Five studies involving 631 participants provided data for the comparison of antibiotics to placebo, with clinical failure defined as a lack of cure or improvement at 7 to 15 days.
