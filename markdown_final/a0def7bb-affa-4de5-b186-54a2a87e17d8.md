## Question

What is primary source of production of estrogen in females?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the primary source of estrogen production in females. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the reproductive life stage because the source changes with menopause. Then, I should verify which estrogen is the principal form and where it is produced in premenopausal women. Next, I will examine what happens after menopause, including the role of adrenal androgens and peripheral aromatization. Finally, I should double-check quantitative ranges and reconcile any apparent discrepancies across sources to ensure accuracy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: the answer depends on whether we are talking about normally cycling adult women or postmenopausal women, because the dominant source shifts at menopause. I need to ensure I state both scenarios clearly and quantify the production where possible [^1135Db1P] [^117CKDda].

> In normally cycling adult women, I should confirm the principal estrogen and its source. Estradiol (E2) is the principal intracellular estrogen and is produced primarily by the ovarian follicle, with granulosa cells aromatizing androgens to estradiol under gonadotropin stimulation, and the FDA labeling consistently states that the ovarian follicle secretes approximately 70–500 micrograms of estradiol per day depending on menstrual phase, which aligns with standard teaching that the ovary is the primary source in reproductive-age women [^1135Db1P] [^113Js1Nq] [^112MhkXo] [^116sykky].

> Wait, let me verify the postmenopausal shift. After menopause, ovarian estradiol production ceases and circulating estrogens are generated predominantly by peripheral conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens (androstenedione and, to a lesser extent, testosterone) to estrone and then to estradiol via aromatase in extragonadal tissues such as adipose, bone, muscle, skin, and brain, making estrone and estrone sulfate the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women [^1135Db1P] [^117LmXxB] [^115nFBSr] [^112PJ4Uj].

> Hold on, I should verify the quantitative aspect. I initially thought the postmenopausal estradiol range was 10–25 pg/mL and estrone 25–42 pg/mL, but I need to check units and context because some sources report in picomolar concentrations. Indeed, clinical reviews note postmenopausal plasma estrone around 50–70 pM and estradiol around 12–20 pM, which correspond to roughly 13–19 pg/mL for estrone and 3–5 pg/mL for estradiol, so my earlier pg/mL figures were too high and I should correct to the pM-based ranges to avoid confusion [^116RYczs] [^115nFBSr].

> I should also confirm the mechanistic basis. Aromatase (CYP19) catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens, and in postmenopausal women this extragonadal aromatization becomes the principal source of circulating estrogens, with adipose tissue being a major contributor and with tissue-specific promoter usage regulating local estrogen synthesis, which explains why obesity increases postmenopausal estrogen exposure and risk for estrogen-sensitive conditions [^117LmXxB] [^112PJ4Uj] [^115nFBSr].

> But wait, what if the question is about absolute daily production rates after menopause? I need to ensure I don't overstate precision because exact postmenopausal production rates are less standardized than the premenopausal 70–500 mcg/day figure, and while circulating levels are low, local tissue concentrations can be higher due to intracrine and paracrine effects, so I should avoid assigning a specific daily microgram value and instead emphasize relative sources and concentrations [^1135Db1P] [^112S1Vzy] [^113LjdpT].

> Putting this together, the primary source of estrogen in females is the ovarian follicle producing estradiol in premenopausal women, whereas after menopause the primary source shifts to peripheral tissues that convert adrenal and ovarian androgens to estrogens via aromatase, with estrone predominating in circulation and adipose tissue being a key site of conversion. I should double-check that I've clearly distinguished the life-stage dependency to avoid ambiguity in the final answer [^1135Db1P] [^117LmXxB] [^113LjdpT].

The primary source of estrogen in females is the **ovarian follicle** [^1135Db1P], which secretes estradiol during the reproductive years [^113Js1Nq]. After menopause, estrogen production shifts to **peripheral conversion** of adrenal androgens (androstenedione) to estrone in adipose and other tissues [^117LmXxB] [^113LjdpT]. Estradiol is the most potent estrogen [^1135Db1P] and is regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis [^116xdiuB]; its levels drop sharply at menopause, driving symptoms and health risks [^112f97GB].

## Primary source of estrogen in reproductive-age females

- **Ovarian follicles**: In normally cycling adult women, the ovarian follicle is the primary source of estrogen, specifically estradiol (E2) [^1135Db1P], the most potent estrogen [^113Js1Nq].

- **Estradiol production**: The ovarian follicle secretes 70–500 mcg of estradiol daily, varying with the menstrual cycle phase [^1135Db1P] [^113Js1Nq].

- **Regulation**: Estradiol production is tightly regulated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis [^116xdiuB], with feedback loops modulating gonadotropin secretion [^1135Db1P].

---

## Changes in estrogen production after menopause

- **Decline in ovarian estrogen**: At menopause, ovarian estrogen production ceases, causing a sharp drop in circulating estradiol [^115MiLai] [^112f97GB].

- **Peripheral conversion**: Postmenopause, most estrogen is produced by peripheral conversion of adrenal androgens (androstenedione) to estrone (E1) in adipose, muscle, bone, and breast tissues [^1135Db1P] [^117LmXxB] [^113LjdpT].

- **Estrone dominance**: Estrone and its sulfate conjugate (estrone sulfate) become the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women [^1135Db1P] [^115nFBSr].

## Role of estrogen in female physiology

Estrogen is central to **female physiology**, regulating the menstrual cycle, supporting reproductive tissues, and influencing secondary sexual characteristics [^1135Db1P] [^115bm9ac]. It also modulates bone density, cardiovascular health, and metabolic homeostasis [^117CKMfr] [^117PchYC]. The decline in estrogen at menopause contributes to symptoms (hot flashes, vaginal dryness, osteoporosis) and increased chronic disease risk [^111ju7Ne] [^117PchYC].

---

## Clinical implications of estrogen deficiency

Estrogen deficiency has **significant clinical implications**:

- **Menopausal symptoms**: Hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and mood changes are common [^111ju7Ne].

- **Bone health**: Reduced bone density and increased osteoporosis risk [^115cFNQX].

- **Cardiovascular risk**: Higher risk of cardiovascular disease after menopause [^112f97GB].

- **Metabolic effects**: Altered glucose and lipid metabolism, contributing to metabolic syndrome [^115xDEeP].

The primary source of estrogen in females is the **ovarian follicle** during reproductive years [^1135Db1P], with a shift to **peripheral conversion** of adrenal androgens after menopause [^117LmXxB]. This transition underlies many menopausal symptoms and health risks, highlighting the importance of estrogen in female physiology [^117PchYC].

### Estrogen, brain structure, and cognition in postmenopausal women [^113Vm64X]. Human Brain Mapping (2021). Medium credibility.

HT may influence brain structure through several pathways. One possible mechanism might be through genetic or other naturally occurring variation in estrogen receptor expression. Continuous exposure to exogenous estrogen may continue to promote estrogen receptor expression. Genetic variations, including those yet to be discovered, may mediate the differential effects of estrogen on the human female brain. Yet another key factor is timing and duration of estrogen use. Review of multiple prior animal studies suggested a critical window of time in which estrogen use may be beneficial for preserving brain structure and function (Daniel, 2013). Estrogen administered near the time when normal endogenous hormone function ceases was maximally useful for brain health. In contrast, if too much time has elapsed from endogenous estrogen production and exogenous administration, no beneficial effect of estrogen on the brain was observed. Uncertainty remains about how these intervals translate to a human population and what genetic or environmental factors may modulate any such interval (Wang, Mishra, & Brinton, 2020). We were unable to detect a significant effect of such an interval in our study. This may be attributable to the limited availability of the data at baseline (1989–1990), which is not in close proximity to acquisition of the high resolution MRI data obtained in year 11 (1998–1999).

### Primary ovarian insufficiency [^115DFdNF]. Lancet (2010). Excellent credibility.

Primary ovarian insufficiency is a subclass of ovarian dysfunction in which the cause is within the ovary. In most cases, an unknown mechanism leads to premature exhaustion of the resting pool of primordial follicles. Primary ovarian insufficiency might also result from genetic defects, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. The main symptom is absence of regular menstrual cycles, and the diagnosis is confirmed by detection of raised follicle-stimulating hormone and declined oestradiol concentrations in the serum, suggesting a primary ovarian defect. The disorder usually leads to sterility, and has a large effect on reproductive health when it arises at a young age. Fertility-preservation options can be offered to some patients with cancer and those at risk of early menopause, such as those with familial cases of primary ovarian insufficiency. Long-term deprivation of oestrogen has serious implications for female health in general; and for bone density, cardiovascular and neurological systems, wellbeing, and sexual health in particular.

### Defining the cell and molecular origins of the primate ovarian reserve [^1139nwdF]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Ovarian follicles are the functional unit of the ovary, composed of a single dictate arrested oocyte surrounded by granulosa cells. The most immature follicles are referred to as primordial follicles. These make up the ovarian reserve, and upon activation are essential for sex-hormone production and fertility. In primates, primordial follicles are established in late gestation; in humans, these are first observed around week 19–20 post conception (W19–20), and around W17–20 in the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). After birth, the infant pituitary gland begins to produce follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which stimulate estrogen and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) production by the infant ovary –. This creates a state referred to as mini puberty, a critical period for brain and body development lasting from birth to around 6 months. For those born with fewer primordial follicles (such as in Turner Syndrome) or with differences in sex development, mini puberty may not occur normally. This creates a window of opportunity for diagnosis and in some cases treatment for reproductive disease. Furthermore, as the ovarian reserve does not self-renew, the generation of fewer follicles prior to birth is also associated with a faster decline in sex-hormone production, primary ovarian insufficiency, and ultimately infertility. Therefore, the establishment of ovarian follicles in late gestation is an understudied area of science with tremendous impact, given the importance of the ovary to overall health.

### Hormonal changes in menopause and implications on sexual health [^1161Mrx6]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

The menopause is characterized by an array of changes to the female body caused by modulations which occur in the production of estrogens and androgens. The ovaries are important sites of testosterone production in the peri- and postmenopausal women, but the contribution of testosterone pro-hormones from the adrenal glands falls precipitously to the extent where the ovaries cannot correct the deficit. This results in a net decline in circulating testosterone levels.

Aims

This paper gives an overview of this interesting subject area. Researchers have cogitated on the relationship between the physical effects of the menopause and the observed declines in testosterone levels, but it is now much clearer that falling testosterone levels cannot explain all of these changes.

Main Outcome Measures

The cessation of follicular functioning results in a steep decline in the production of estrogens. This modulation is responsible for the physical manifestations of the menopause — hot flushes, sleep disturbances, mood changes, bleeding problems, local urogenital problems, vaginal changes, etc.

Methods

A review of the pertinent literature was conducted to investigate hormonal changes around the menopause. A précis of the salient information is presented here.

Results

Although the most obvious and well-known effects of the menopause are due to the decline of estrogen levels, the effects of falling testosterone levels are subtle, but by no means less significant. Reductions in sexual motivation, sexual arousal, vaginal lubrication, etc. are all associated with plummeting androgen levels.

Conclusions

Today, several options exist for the treatment of the endocrinological changes associated with the menopause. Estrogen deficiency can be corrected with hormone replacement therapy and topical preparations for the genitalia. A new transdermal system for the administration of testosterone shows a great deal of potential for the treatment of androgen deficiency.

### The potency and clinical efficacy of aromatase inhibitors across the breast cancer continuum [^115MiLai]. Annals of Oncology (2011). Low credibility.

the aromatase enzyme and estrogen disposition in postmenopausal women

While the aromatase enzyme has been studied for decades, its crystallographic structure was first reported in 2009. The gene harbors at least 10 different promoters, subject to different ligand stimulations in different tissue compartments.

Ovarian estrogen production ceases at menopause. Postmenopausal estrogens are synthesized from circulating androgens, mainly androstenedione, which is converted into estrone. In addition, a minor pathway includes aromatization of circulating testosterone into estradiol. Plasma (and tissue) estradiol seems to have a dual origin, some arising from the direct aromatization of testosterone, with the rest synthesized from the reduction of estrone. While the adrenal gland is the main contributor of circulating androgens, conflicting evidence indicates a minor contribution of circulating androgens from the postmenopausal ovary.

Interestingly, it has been known for more than two decades that estradiol levels are elevated in tissue, in particular breast cancer tissue, compared with plasma. This in general has been attributed to local expression of the aromatase enzyme. However, there may be alternative explanations. In a recent study, we found elevated tissue concentrations of estradiol but reduced levels of estrone in breast tumors compared with the surrounding normal breast tissue. Moreover, elevated estradiol concentrations were seen among estrogen receptor (ER)-positive tumors only. Thus, recent results suggest a strong correlation between intratumor estradiol levels and plasma estradiol but also intratumoral ER expression as well as negative to dehydrogenase 2 but positive to dehydrogenase 7 levels, indicating that intratumor estradiol may arise from estrone reduction. Such a hypothesis actually fits well with observations that circulating estrogen levels correlate with intratumoral expression of estrogen-regulated genes and subsequent breast cancer risk as well as to time to relapse in hormone-sensitive breast cancer. These findings may have significant implications in future therapeutic strategies aiming at tumor-specific manipulation of estrogen synthesis.

### Endocrine therapy for the management and risk reduction of hormone receptor positive breast cancer [^117CKDda]. ASBrS (2024). High credibility.

Aromatase inhibitors in postmenopausal women — estrogen production occurs in adipose tissue, the adrenal glands, muscle, and breast tissue where aromatase converts androgens into estrogen; the nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors (AIs) anastrozole and letrozole bind reversibly to aromatase, while exemestane, a steroidal AI, irreversibly binds to aromatase. The resulting decrease in estrogen negatively impacts bone health and serum cholesterol and increases the risk of cardiac events, and common side effects include arthralgias, hair thinning, and vaginal atrophy and dryness. Standard doses for therapeutic and risk-reducing indications are anastrozole 1 mg daily, letrozole 2.5 mg daily, and exemestane 25 mg daily. AI indications include the treatment of HR+ breast cancer, and clinical trial data supports the off-label use of anastrozole and exemestane as risk-reducing agents for high-risk women.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^115bm9ac]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Actions of sex steroid hormones — estrogens (Table 3) — indicate that estrone (E1) is synthesized from cholesterol and rostenedione intermediate in gonads and adipose tissue; formed from estradiol by 17βHSD in the liver, uterus, and mammary gland; binds to ERα and ERβ receptors (less potent than estradiol), with unclear effects whose main actions are through conversion to estradiol; estradiol (E2) is synthesized from cholesterol in ovarian follicles, testicles, adrenal glands, fat, liver, breasts, and brains; binds to ERα and ERβ receptors and is the most potent estrogen, with effects including breast development, female fat distribution, and regulation of menstrual cycle, also acting on mammary glands, uterus, vagina, bone, fat, skin, liver, brain; estriol (E3) is synthesized by placenta in pregnancy, present at low levels in the nonpregnant state, binds to ERα and ERβ receptors (far less potent than estradiol), and promotes uterine growth during pregnancy; estetrol (E4) is synthesized exclusively in the liver by the human fetus and its biological function remains unknown.

### Estradiol (Elestrin) [^1141chUD]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to ELESTRIN nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### The importance of biological sex and estrogen in rodent models of cardiovascular health and disease [^112U9AZp]. Circulation Research (2016). Low credibility.

Nearly one-third of deaths in the United States are caused by cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. In the past, CVD was thought to mainly affect men, leading to the exclusion of women and female animals from clinical studies and preclinical research. In light of sexual dimorphisms in CVD, a need exists to examine baseline cardiac differences in humans and the animals used to model CVD. In humans, sex differences are apparent at every level of cardiovascular physiology from action potential duration and mitochondrial energetics to cardiac myocyte and whole-heart contractile function. Biological sex is an important modifier of the development of CVD with younger women generally being protected, but this cardioprotection is lost later in life, suggesting a role for estrogen. Although endogenous estrogen is most likely a mediator of the observed functional differences in both health and disease, the signaling mechanisms involved are complex and are not yet fully understood. To investigate how sex modulates CVD development, animal models are essential tools and should be useful in the development of therapeutics. This review will focus on describing the cardiovascular sexual dimorphisms that exist both physiologically and in common animal models of CVD.

### Endothelial nitric oxide synthase regulation in female genital tract structures [^114Xni4u]. The Journal of Sexual Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) is a major component of female sexual dysfunctions, affecting 25–70% of women. The mechanisms of FSAD are poorly understood. Estrogen contributes to the control of genital blood flow during the sexual response. Vascular effects of estrogen are mostly attributed to its regulation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production. However, the role of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and the mechanisms that regulate eNOS in female genital tract structures are largely unknown.

Aim

To review available evidence of the mechanisms of eNOS regulation in female genital tract structures.

Methods

This article reviews the literature that relates to the role of NO and eNOS in female sexual arousal and its modulation by estrogen.

Main Outcome Measures

Association between female sexual arousal, NO, and eNOS.

Results

The NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway is believed to have a primary role in the regulation of clitoral and vaginal blood flow, and smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal. Estrogen is critical for maintaining vaginal and clitoral blood flow and vaginal transudate production. Estrogen regulates eNOS by genomic mechanisms, involving augmented mRNA transcription and protein synthesis, and by non-genomic mechanisms, which occur without alterations in gene expression. However, limited studies have evaluated the physiological role of endothelial NO and the molecular mechanisms of eNOS regulation in the female genital tract.

Conclusions

The effects of estrogen on increasing genital blood flow and smooth muscle relaxation have been attributed mostly to regulation of eNOS. However, the exact mechanisms of eNOS regulation in female genital tract structures and the molecular basis for the eNOS defect with aging and vascular diseases warrant further investigation.

### Adipose tissue sex steroids in postmenopausal women with and without menopausal hormone therapy [^112PJ4Uj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Extragonadal production of sex steroids is highlighted after the cessation of ovarian estrogen synthesis at menopause. Most circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women are produced in peripheral tissues, particularly in adipose tissue (AT), from androgen precursors predominantly produced in the adrenal glands and ovaries. Androgen and estrogen concentrations in AT exceed circulating levels, reflecting the role of AT as an important reservoir and site of metabolism of sex steroids.

Sex steroids also regulate body AT deposition and function. At menopause, circulating levels of androgens decrease less than those of estrogens because androgens continue to be produced by the postmenopausal ovaries and through the conversion of adrenal precursor steroids, such as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and androstenedione (A 4), to active androgens in peripheral tissues. A lower estrogen to androgen ratio in the circulation has been associated with an increased relative amount of visceral compared to subcutaneous AT. Moreover, adiposity may correlate positively with testosterone (T) levels in serum from postmenopausal women. Visceral, or android, obesity is associated with an unfavorable inflammatory marker and adipokine profile, leading to AT dysfunction and metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and an increased risk for postmenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

### Estradiol and levonorgestrel (climara pro) [^114zAHpz]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Levonorgestrel inhibits gonadotropin production resulting in retardation of follicular growth and inhibition of ovulation.

Studies to assess the potency of progestins using estrogen-primed postmenopausal endometrial biochemistry and morphologic features have shown that levonorgestrel counteracts the proliferative effects of estrogens on the endometrium.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to Climara nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Health of adipose tissue: oestrogen matters [^113LjdpT]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Menopausal women are more likely than premenopausal women to gain weight in the form of excess adipose tissue, which becomes preferentially deposited in the viscera. This body composition shift, largely driven by declining oestrogen levels, increases cardiometabolic disease risk. Oestrogens are key hormones involved in many metabolic processes, including in adipose tissue. Given the strong influence that adipose tissue health has on systemic metabolism, additional insights into mechanisms by which oestrogens affect adipose tissue phenotype and function are critical. Not only is adipose tissue affected by oestrogen signalling, adipose tissue is also a major source of circulating oestrogens, and the only appreciable source of oestrogens for men and postmenopausal women. Therefore, women with obesity have higher circulating levels of oestrogens, but whether this fact contributes to the diverse comorbidities of obesity (such as, cancer, metabolic syndrome and osteoporosis) remains unclear. Loss of the effects of oestrogen in adipose tissue later in life could underlie the tissue's functional decline and expanded mass during menopause and beyond. In this Review, we discuss the roles of oestrogens in adipose functional health, and how these functions influence obesity and metabolic disease risk.

Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. Progestins exert their effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes. Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, and central nervous system.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to Activella nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisions across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Estrogen replacement therapy: effects on the endogenous androgen milieu [^114JsgmK]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the impact of exogenous estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) on the production, binding, and metabolism of ovarian and adrenal androgens.

Design

Review of the scientific literature from January 1966 through June 2001 using MEDLINE.

Conclusion(S)

Although no precipitous drop in androgen production is apparent at the time of the menopause, androgens decrease slowly and progressively from early adulthood until old age. The impact of aging and of estrogen replacement therapy, particularly oral ERT, significantly reduces androgen bioavailability after menopause. The combined effects of reduced production with aging and the pharmacologic effects of oral ERT dramatically reduce the endogenous bioavailable androgen milieu. These changes may have adverse clinical implications for susceptible individuals.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^113rpqey]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Sex differences in athletic performance — scope and definitions: The primary goal is to provide updated scientific knowledge for the sex-based differences in athletic performance and it highlights: the magnitude of sex differences across athletic pursuits; the differences in anatomy and physiology between males and females that determine responses to acute exercise, exercise training, and athletic performance across the life span; the role of sex steroid hormones (particularly testosterone and estrogen) and their effects on physiology and adaptability to training; models that provide insight into the role of sex steroid hormones including addition and suppression; and gaps in the knowledgebase and strategies to fill these gaps. For terminology, the statement defines sex and gender according to the US National Institutes of Health, with sex referring to biological differences between females and males (including chromosomes, sex organs, and endogenous sex hormone profiles) and gender referring to socially constructed and enacted roles and behaviors that vary by historical and cultural context over time.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. Progestins exert their effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes. Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, and central nervous system.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to Abigale or Abigale Lo tablets nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisions across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Mechanisms of estradiol in fear circuitry: implications for sex differences in psychopathology [^113hD1vw]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Types of estrogens

Estrogens are the primary female sex hormones and are produced by the ovaries and adrenal gland. The four primary steroidal estrogens are estrone (E1), estradiol (E2), estriol (E3) and estetrol (E4). E2 is the most potent in nonpregnant females whereas E1 is predominant during menopause and E3 and E4 are greatest during pregnancy. Estrogen synthesis also occurs in males. Although the adrenal glands and testes produce low levels of estrogens, males rely on the conversion of testosterone, by the enzyme aromatase, into estrogen for physiological functioning. In both sexes, high levels of aromatase localize in the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, midbrain and cortex, thus denoting sites of estrogen synthesis. As 17β E2 is the most potent circulating estrogen in males and nonpregnant females, we focus our discussion on this type of estrogen.

### Estrogen and bone – a reproductive and locomotive perspective [^114hRR54]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

The primary function of the skeleton is locomotion, and the primary function of estrogen is reproduction. When the skeleton is considered within this locomotive context, the onset of estrogen secretion at puberty leads to packing of mechanically excess mineral into female bones for reproductive needs. Accordingly, the unpacking of this reproductive safety deposit at menopause denotes the origin of type I osteoporosis.

Introduction

According to the prevailing unitary model of involutional osteoporosis, female postmenopausal bone loss can be described as having an initial accelerated, transient phase (type I), followed by a gradual continuous phase (type II). Estrogen withdrawal is generally accepted as the primary cause of the type I osteoporosis. Thus, the quest to uncover the origin of type I osteoporosis has focused on the estrogen withdrawal-related skeletal changes at and around the menopause. However, considering that the cyclical secretion of estrogen normally begins in early adolescence and continues over the entire fertile period, one could argue that focusing on perimenopause alone may be too narrow.

Materials and Methods

This is not a systematic review of the literature on the skeletal function of estrogen(s), but rather, an introduction of a novel structure- and locomotion-oriented perspective to this particular issue through pertinent experimental and clinical studies.

Results and Conclusions

When considering locomotion as the primary function of the skeleton and integrating the classic findings of the pubertal effects of estrogen on female bones and the more recent hypothesis-driven experimental and clinical studies on estrogen and mechanical loading on bone within this context, a novel evolution-based explanation for the role of estrogen in controlling female bone mass can be outlined: the onset of estrogen secretion at puberty induces packing of mechanically excess bone into female skeleton for needs of reproduction (pregnancy and lactation). Accordingly, the unpacking of this reproductive safety deposit of calcium at menopause denotes the accelerated phase of bone loss and thus the origin of type I osteoporosis.

### The biological basis of sex differences in athletic performance: consensus statement for the American College of Sports Medicine [^116XaLXJ]. Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise (2023). High credibility.

Estrogen — forms, levels, and selected performance-relevant physiology — includes four major estrogens (estrone [E1], 17β-estradiol [E2], estriol [E3], and estetrol [E4]). Circulating E2, the primary female sex steroid hormone, increases during puberty and, on average, is ~4-fold higher in adult females than males until menopause, with monthly fluctuations alongside luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), progesterone, and other hormones. In males, estradiol concentrations do not seem to be related to muscle strength and bone microarchitecture in older men; overtraining in male athletes was associated with increased E2 and decreased testosterone levels; and increased skeletal muscle estrogen receptor expression was demonstrated in endurance-trained males compared with moderately active males.

### The regulation of steroid action by sulfation and desulfation [^112y2mXE]. Endocrine Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

1. Breast

Most breast cancers are initially estrogen responsive and exhibit increased intratumoral estrogen concentrations compared to adjacent normal breast tissue. Hence, it is of interest that the highest incidence of breast cancer is observed in postmenopausal women despite cessation of ovarian estrogen synthesis and the consequent drop in circulating estrogen concentrations. Estrogens can still be produced in postmenopausal women by tissue-specific local conversion of androstenedione to E 1, and to a lesser extent T to E 2, by aromatase. However, estrogens are sulfated by E 1 sulfotransferase (SULT1E1) and phenol sulfotransferase (SULT1A1), and this accounts for the high circulating E 1 S concentrations observed in postmenopausal women, with this E 1 S pool acting as a reservoir for peripheral conversion to E 1 by STS.

Significant scientific discussion surrounds the relative importance of the two primary pathways for active estrogen generation, E 1 S desulfation, and androgen aromatization in hormone-dependent breast cancer. Whereas increased aromatase protein expression parallels increased intratumoral E 2 concentrations, there is currently limited support for STS expression directly correlating with locally increased E 2 concentrations. However, STS activity can be 50–200 times higher than aromatase activity in breast cancer tissue, and STS mRNA is frequently detected in breast tumors, whereas aromatase levels are relatively low. This suggests that STS, rather than aromatase, may be the primary driver for local E 1 production in hormone-dependent breast cancer. Enzyme kinetic studies show that STS activity is higher than aromatase not only in cancerous tissue but also in normal breast. In addition to local estrogen metabolism via STS and aromatase, serum estrogen levels for E 1, E 1 S, E 2, and E 2 sulfate (E 2 S) have been reported to fall after surgical removal of STS-positive breast cancer in postmenopausal women, implying an additional systemic effect and indicative of the importance of STS activity in forming active estrogens.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^114dx8Ls]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

NO INCREASED RISK OF BREAST CANCER BY ESCALATED LEVELS OF ESTROGENS FROM OVARIAN STIMULATION

Despite a short duration, fertility treatments, such as IVF or assisted reproductive technology (ART), have raised a concern for a potential increase in breast cancer risk, because such treatments markedly increase the endogenous production of estrogens. IVF or ART commonly involves ovarian stimulation by the administration of gonadotropins to render the maximum number of eggs harvested in a single IVF cycle. During an IVF cycle, gonadotropins spur the growth and maturation of multiple follicles, simultaneously, into preovulatory follicles, thereby releasing supraphysiological levels of particularly E 2 (500–4000 pg/ml) in the follicular phase. – After the final maturation of the oocytes in the preovulatory follicles by an injection of human chorionic gonadotropin, the oocytes are recovered via follicle aspiration. The luteal phase of an IVF cycle, however, is defective due to inadequate corpus luteum function leading to insufficient progesterone production. Typically, the luteal-phase defect requires the administration of exogenous progesterone to prepare the endometrium for the implantation of transplanted embryos and to improve pregnancy rates. Thus, women undergoing an IVF or ART procedure are exposed to transiently yet acutely elevated concentrations of endogenous estrogens, as high as 10 times the levels in a normal menstrual cycle.

### Are estrogens of import to primate / human ovarian folliculogenesis? [^11383Xvn]. Endocrine Reviews (2001). Low credibility.

The notion that estrogens play a meaningful role in ovarian folliculogenesis stems from a large body of in vitro and in vivo experiments carried out in certain rodent models, (e.g., rats) wherein the stimulatory role of estrogen on granulosa cell growth and differentiation is undisputed. However, evidence derived from these polyovulatory species may not be readily generalizable to the monoovulatory subhuman primates, let alone the human. Only recently, significant observations on the ovarian role(s) of estrogen have been reported for the primate/human. It is thus the objective of this communication to review the evidence for and against a role for estrogens in primate/human ovarian follicular development with an emphasis toward the application of the concepts so developed to contemporary reproductive physiology and to the practice of reproductive medicine. The role(s) of estrogens will be examined not only by analyzing the physiological evidence to the effect that these hormones control ovarian function and follicular growth, but also by summarizing the molecular evidence for the existence and distribution of the cognate receptors.

### Endocrine and intracrine sources of androgens in women: inhibition of breast cancer and other roles of androgens and their precursor dehydroepiandrosterone [^111KoLp1]. Endocrine Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Serum androgens as well as their precursors and metabolites decrease from the age of 30–40 yr in women, thus suggesting that a more physiological hormone replacement therapy at menopause should contain an androgenic compound. It is important to consider, however, that most of the androgens in women, especially after menopause, are synthesized in peripheral intracrine tissues from the inactive precursors dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S) of adrenal origin. Much progress in this new area of endocrine physiology called intracrinology has followed the cloning and characterization of most of the enzymes responsible for the transformation of DHEA and DHEA-S into androgens and estrogens in peripheral target tissues, where the locally produced sex steroids are exerting their action in the same cells in which their synthesis takes place without significant diffusion into the circulation, thus seriously limiting the interpretation of serum levels of active sex steroids. The sex steroids made in peripheral tissues are then inactivated locally into more water-soluble compounds that diffuse into the general circulation where they can be measured. In a series of animal models, androgens and DHEA have been found to inhibit breast cancer development and growth and to stimulate bone formation. In clinical studies, DHEA has been found to increase bone mineral density and to stimulate vaginal maturation without affecting the endometrium, while improving well-being and libido with no significant side effects. The advantage of DHEA over other androgenic compounds is that DHEA, at physiological doses, is converted into androgens and/or estrogens only in the specific intracrine target tissues that possess the appropriate physiological enzymatic machinery, thus limiting the action of the sex steroids to those tissues possessing the tissue-specific profile of expression of the genes responsible for their formation, while leaving the other tissues unaffected and thus minimizing the potential side effects observed with androgens or estrogens administered systemically.

### Adipocyte fatty acid storage factors enhance subcutaneous fat storage in postmenopausal women [^1155vCYa]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Increases in body weight are associated with greater risks of type 2 diabetes, and weight gain in postmenopausal women are of special concern. Estrogen has remarkable effects on body fat distribution, and the decreased sex hormone production after menopause is associated with increased total body fat, especially in the central/abdominal region. Hormone replacement therapy in early menopause may mitigate these changes in body composition and may decrease central adiposity. Despite the strong evidence that female sex steroids have a major influence on total body fat and body fat distribution, the cellular mechanisms mediating these effects are unknown. To address this lack of understanding, we measured the storage of dietary fatty acids (FAs) and circulating free fatty acids (FFAs) into adipose tissue in premenopausal and postmenopausal women carefully matched for age and body composition. These physiological measures were combined with measures of the adipose tissue content of a number of proteins/enzymes required for adipocyte FA storage.

The FA stored in adipose tissue originates primarily from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (i.e. chylomicrons and VLDL); however, there is also a component of FA redistribution via the direct FFA reuptake pathway. FFAs are the products of adipose tissue lipolysis, which is virtually the sole source of FFA in the postabsorptive state. Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins require lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to liberate the FA from the glycerol backbone of the triglyceride molecule. Regardless of whether FAs are derived from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins or circulating FFA, the FA can enter the adipocyte either via a passive (flip-flop) mechanism or via protein facilitated diffusion. Once inside the adipocyte, FA must undergo a series of enzymatic reactions to be stored as triglyceride. Although it is known that estrogen can modulate LPL activity by suppressing gene transcription, little else is understood about whether estrogen affects adipocyte storage steps, including protein-facilitated transport and the enzymes needed for triglyceride synthesis.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these gonadotropins seen in postmenopausal women.

Parenterally administered medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) inhibits gonadotropin production, which in turn prevents follicular maturation and ovulation; although available data indicate that this does not occur when the usually recommended oral dosage is given as single daily doses. MPA may achieve its beneficial effect on the endometrium in part by decreasing nuclear estrogen receptors and suppression of epithelial DNA synthesis in endometrial tissue. Androgenic and anabolic effects of MPA have been noted, but the drug is apparently devoid of significant estrogenic activity.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Currently, there are no pharmacodynamic data known for PREMPRO or PREMPHASE tablets.

### Molecular mechanisms of sex bias differences in COVID-19 mortality [^112oFvPD]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Emerging evidence shows that patients with severe COVID-19 can have a coagulopathy characterized by hypercoagulability with fibrin formation and polymerization leading to thromboembolism and worse outcomes, especially in men compared to women. This might be partially explained by the fact that estrogen can reduce plasma levels of fibrinogen and increase antithrombin III and decrease plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1).

A reasonable question is that if the mechanism of organ protection is female sex hormones, why is there still a difference in COVID-19 mortality in postmenopausal women? In premenopausal women, the ovaries are the principal source of 17β-estradiol. In postmenopausal women, estrone, the least powerful form of estrogen, is produced in the ovaries in high quantities. Moreover, in postmenopausal women, and in men, estrogen is no longer solely an endocrine factor. Instead, it is produced in a number of extragonadal tissues and acts locally at these sites as a paracrine or even intracrine factor. These tissues include the mesenchymal stromal cells of the adipose tissue and subsequent differentiated bone chondrocytes and osteoblasts, aortic and endothelium, vascular smooth muscle cells, skin, skeletal muscle, and numerous brain regions. Thus, circulating levels of estrogen reflect estrogen action in postmenopausal women and in men as a result of the estrogen that escapes from local metabolism and enters the circulation after production by extragonadal tissues. Despite low circulating levels, high local concentrations indicate the potential of paracrine, autocrine, and intracrine actions of estrogens in tissues. However, it is unknown whether the distribution and expression of estrogen in the local tissue contribute to the lower COVID-19 mortality in postmenopausal females compared to males.

### Influence of SULT1A1 genetic variation on age at menopause, estrogen levels, and response to hormone therapy in recently postmenopausal white women [^112AqySA]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

The onset of menopause, symptom severity, and the response to menopausal hormone therapy (HT) vary among women. This variation is thought to be multifactorial involving gene-environment interactions, with the heritability estimates of age at menopause ranging from 31% to 78%. - Although menopause is an important health issue that will ultimately affect all women, the influence of genetic variation on menopausal physiology is currently not well understood.

As estrogen production by the ovaries decreases, circulating estrogen levels drop by approximately 90% and the conversion of androgens to estrogens by aromatase in the adipose tissue and skin becomes the predominant source of endogenous estrogens. Estrone (E 1) and 17β-estradiol (E 2) are both ligands for estrogen receptors (ERs), but ERs have higher affinity for E 2, which is considered the main ligand for ER-mediated processes. Although estrogen conjugation is an important step in inactivation, conjugated estrogens may also have biologic activity and be important in delivery of estrogens to target tissues, where the sulfate moiety can be removed by sulfatase.

### Pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone II as a possible mediator of positive estrogen feedback [^116xdiuB]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The role that luteinizing hormone (LH) plays in controlling ovarian function is already well established. For example, in female primates the pulsatile release of this glycoprotein from the adenohypophysis is known to stimulate the ovarian production of estrogens. Furthermore, during the late follicular phase of the primate menstrual cycle, a surge of LH serves as the primary humoral trigger for ovulation to occur. On the other hand, the neuroendocrine factors that regulate the pulsatile and surge modes of LH from pituitary gonadotropes are less clear, especially in humans and nonhuman primates. For many years it was assumed that pulsatile release of gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GNRH) from the hypothalamus was sufficient to stimulate both the tonic and surge modes of LH release, depending on the level of estrogen in circulation. Later studies involving direct measurement of GNRH concentrations in the medial basal hypothalamus (or in the third ventricle) showed that primates, like rodents and sheep, release GNRH as a large surge at the time of ovulation. These findings gave added credence to the idea that GNRH plays a dual role in regulating the human menstrual cycle: (1) During the early follicular phase of the cycle, pulsatile GNRH stimulates ovarian estrogen production, which in turn exerts negative feedback on the GNRH‐producing cells; (2) during the late follicular phase of the cycle, the rising estrogen concentrations exert positive feedback on the GNRH‐producing cells causing them to release the peptide as a large surge, which in turn stimulates a preovulatory surge of LH.

### Recognizing rare disorders: aromatase deficiency [^116aF5rY]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Aromatase deficiency is rare in humans. Affected individuals cannot synthesize endogenous estrogens. Aromatase is the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of androgens into estrogens, and if aromatase is nonfunctional because of an inactivating mutation, estrogen synthesis cannot occur. If the fetus lacks aromatase activity, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate produced by the fetal adrenal glands cannot be converted to estrogen by the placenta, so is converted to testosterone peripherally and results in virilization of both fetus and mother. Virilization manifests as pseudohermaphroditism in female infants, with hirsutism and acne in the mother; the maternal indicators resolve following delivery. To date, only seven males and seven females with aromatase deficiency have been reported. Affected females are typically diagnosed at birth because of the pseudohermaphroditism. Cystic ovaries and delayed bone maturation can occur during childhood and adolescence in these girls, who present at puberty with primary amenorrhea, failure of breast development, virilization, and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism. Affected males, on the other hand, do not present with obvious defects at birth, so are diagnosed much later in life, presenting with clinical symptoms, which include tall stature, delayed skeletal maturation, delayed epiphyseal closure, bone pain, eunuchoid body proportions and excess adiposity. Estrogen replacement therapy reverses the symptoms in male and female patients.

### The influence of estrogen on migraine: a systematic review [^113ySQzn]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Menstrual migraine affects approximately 50% to 60% of female migraineurs, but knowledge regarding the role of hormones, especially estrogen, appears incomplete.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review to determine the role of hormones on menstrual migraine.

Evidence Acquisition

MEDLINE (January 1966 through September 1, 2005) and EMBASE Drugs and Pharmacology (January 1991 through September 1, 2005) were searched for articles published in the English language using the keywords migraine, estrogen, menstrual migraine, pure menstrual migraine, true menstrual migraine, menstrually-associated migraine, menstrually-related migraine, pregnancy, breast-feeding, perimenopause, menopause, nitric oxide, and estrogen receptors. A total of 643 unique articles were reviewed for relevance, scientific rigor, and generalizability. For each relevant citation, the bibliography was reviewed to identify additional sources of pertinent data.

Evidence Synthesis

The influence of estrogen on migraine is evident by a 3-fold greater prevalence among women compared with men, and by significant changes in migraine incidence with changes in female reproductive status. Menstrual migraines are usually more resistant to treatment, generally not associated with aura, of longer duration, and associated with more functional disability compared with attacks at other times of the month. Biochemical and genetic evidence suggest central and peripheral roles for estrogen in the pathophysiology of menstrual migraine, with potential interactions with excitatory circuits, including serotonergic components. Although evidence for estrogen as a preventive treatment for menstrual migraine is inconsistent, serotonin receptor agonists (triptans) provide acute relief and also may have a role in prevention.

Conclusions

Epidemiological, pathophysiological, and clinical evidence link estrogen to migraine headaches. Triptans appear to provide acute relief and also may be useful for headache prevention. Clear, focused, and evidence-based treatment algorithms are needed to support primary care physicians, neurologists, and gynecologists in the treatment of this common condition.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^116BMtQ8]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society preclinical lung disease models — major recommendations for incorporating sex as a biological variable (SABV) emphasize, for in vivo models, to consider the stage of the estrous cycle, timing of experimental interventions, circadian rhythms, endpoint assessments, dietary factors, use of tamoxifen, strain differences, and environmental factors that can lead to or confound sex-based differences in endpoints and phenotypes; consider the organizational and activational effects of gonadal hormones and local production of sex steroids in the lung; consider the role of sex chromosomes; consider the differential sex-biased effects of puberty, menopause, and aging; and consider the appropriate experimental design and power to accurately and transparently report findings based on biological sex. For in vitro models, verify and document the cellular sex of commercially sourced cell lines and primary cells and, when derived from patient samples, report the donor's sex, ethnic background, age, menopausal status, hormone therapy use, and pregnancy history; document culture conditions and avoid media components that can activate sex steroid receptor signaling, using phenol red–free and charcoal-stripped media if experimental conditions allow; consider the potential autocrine or paracrine effects of sex steroids, catalog sex hormone and receptor levels, formulate media to control hormonal and growth factors, and replicate sex-specific physiologic conditions; consider how donor sex can introduce variability in reprogramming, pluripotency, and differentiation in models using iPSCs and ESCs; and consider the sex of cells when building complex 3D models, recognizing the increased potential for sex-based variability.

Regarding medical management for primary ovarian insufficiency, more specifically with respect to hormone therapy, ACOG 2017 guidelines recommend to achieve replacement levels of estrogen as a first-line approach for hormone therapy (either PO or transdermally). Do not obtain serum estradiol level testing to monitor the effects of treatment.

### Conjugated estrogens (Premarin) [^116zki9X]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these gonadotropins seen in postmenopausal women.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Currently, there are no pharmacodynamic data known for PREMARIN vaginal cream.

### Estrogen sulfotransferase: intracrinology meets metabolic diseases [^115xDEeP]. Diabetes (2012). Low credibility.

Over the past two decades, the female hormone 17β-estradiol (estrogen) has emerged as an important contributor to energy homeostasis in both males and females. Early clinical evidence involved the observation that men lacking estrogen synthesis secondary to mutations in aromatase — the enzyme that converts androgen to estrogen — or men harboring estrogen resistance secondary to mutation of the estrogen receptor (ER)α, develop visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and/or glucose intolerance. As an experimental confirmation, it was observed that elimination of the aromatase or ERα genes in male and female mice produced the same metabolic syndrome as in humans. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that although men have lower circulating estrogen concentrations than premenopausal women, aromatization of circulating androgen to estrogen in target metabolic tissues equilibrates cellular estrogen concentrations, and ER activation is critical in both sexes in promoting fuel homeostasis. This is consistent with the paradigm that estrogen functions as a circulating hormone in premenopausal women. Conversely, in men and in postmenopausal women — in whom estrogen concentrations are low — estradiol does not function as a hormone; instead, it is synthesized in extragonadal sites such as breast, brain, bone, and fat where it acts locally as a paracrine or intracrine factor. Thus, in men and in postmenopausal women, the driver of estrogen action is not circulating estrogens; rather, it depends on estrogen biosynthesis from a circulating source of androgenic precursors such as testosterone. A logical consequence of these observations is that estrogen metabolism or inactivation that shortens the duration of estrogen activity is an essential parameter of cellular estrogenic output.

Estrogen sulfotransferase (EST) is a cytosolic enzyme that provides a molecular switch in target cells to inhibit estrogen activity by conjugating a sulfonate group to estrogens, thereby preventing binding to the ER and enhancing estrogen urinary excretion. Thus, EST protects male reproductive tissues from estrogen-induced feminization. With regard to metabolism, EST is not detectable in white adipose tissue (WAT) of normal-cycling female mice but is highly expressed in male WAT and is induced by testosterone in both sexes. Transgenic female mice overexpressing EST in adipose tissue at the level of males — which inactivates estrogen in this tissue — show impaired adipocyte differentiation and smaller WAT depots in subcutaneous and parametrial areas associated with WAT insulin resistance, a phenotype reminiscent of partial lipoatrophy. EST is also expressed in human subcutaneous adipose tissue.

### Androgen production in women [^1121aGrA]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the sources, production rates, circulating concentrations, and regulatory mechanisms of the major androgen precursors and androgens in women.

Design

Review of the major published literature.

Result(S)

Quantitatively, women secrete greater amounts of androgen than of estrogen. The major circulating steroids generally classified as androgens include dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS), dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenedione (A), testosterone (T), and dihydrotestosterone in descending order of serum concentration, though only the latter two bind the androgen receptor. The other three steroids are better considered as pro-androgens. Dehydroepiandrosterone is primarily an adrenal product, regulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and acting as a precursor for the peripheral synthesis of more potent androgens. Dehydroepiandrosterone is produced by both the ovary and adrenal, as well as being derived from circulating DHEAS. Androstenedione and testosterone are products of the ovary and the adrenal. Testosterone circulates both in its free form, and bound to protein including albumin and sex steroid hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), the levels of which are an important determinant of free testosterone concentration.

Conclusion(S)

The postmenopausal ovary is an androgen-secreting organ and the levels of testosterone are not directly influenced by the menopausal transition or the occurrence of menopause. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is primarily a peripheral product of testosterone metabolism. Severe androgen deficiency occurs in hypopituitarism, but other causes may lead to androgen deficiency, including Addison's disease, corticosteroid therapy, chronic illness, estrogen replacement (leads to elevated SHBG and, therefore, low free testosterone), premenopausal ovarian failure, or oophorectomy.

### Metabolic messengers: oestradiol [^117CKMfr]. Nature Metabolism (2025). High credibility.

Oestradiol (E2), a steroid hormone derived from cholesterol, has long been recognized for its central role in female reproduction and pathobiology of menopause. However, accumulating evidence underscores a critical role for E2 in the regulation of systemic metabolism in both women and men. The metabolic actions of E2 are predominantly mediated by oestrogen receptor α (encoded by ESR1), a nuclear receptor with heritable expression patterns and tissue-specific transcript levels highly correlated with indices of metabolic health in both sexes. Here we provide an overview of the cell-specific actions of E2 and its receptors (α and β) in modulating key metabolic pathways. We contextualize these mechanistic preclinical studies with epidemiological data linking the menopausal transition to a marked rise of metabolic disease risk and provide evidence that E2 replacement mitigates this risk by preserving metabolic health.

### The role of cellular senescence in ovarian aging [^112f97GB]. Npj Aging (2024). Medium credibility.

The cyclical production of female reproductive hormones plays a significant role not only in follicular development but also in women's overall health. Antral follicles are the primary source of ovarian estrogen secretion in women of reproductive age. Due to the reduction in ovarian reserve, the number of antral follicles also reduces with age, decreasing ovarian steroid hormone output, and affecting female health. As the ovulatory cycles end due to severe depletion of ovarian reserve with age, there is a drastic drop in circulating levels of estradiol, marking the onset of menopause. Thus, menopause is associated with increased metabolic dysfunction and mortality. During menopause, women experience a variety of symptoms and conditions associated with changes in steroid levels and aging. This stage of reproductive life significantly increases susceptibility to various metabolic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, hypertension, diabetes mellitusand ovarian cancer. Women experiencing early menopause (< 45 years) further increase these risks, with a substantial impact on public health. In mice, a similar process is observed. Female mice tend to live longer than males, however, when ovaries are surgically removed, life expectancy is reduced, indicating a clear relationship between reproductive and somatic longevity. Indeed, old female mice receiving ovarian transplants from young mice experience an increase in longevity.

The reduction of estradiol levels is one of the primary effects of menopause, and several studies highlight the benefits of exogenous estradiol replacement therapy. However, longevity extension from ovarian tissue transplantation was higher when young ovaries were depleted of follicles with VCD (4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide) before transplantation. Additionally, women with more reproductive cycles are at an increased risk of certain pathologies. In mice, cycling generates a microenvironment that may exacerbate the effect of estrogen-dependent mutagenesis in the endometrium. Therefore, while preserving the ovarian reserve is beneficial for lifespan extension in most studies in mice and humans, it may contribute to the development of certain pathologies due to increased number of cycles tissues are exposed.

### Pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone II as a possible mediator of positive estrogen feedback [^115Ldbra]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast, GNRH2 neurons have been shown to be involved in non‐hypophysiotropic functions like nutrition‐related sexual behaviors in teleost fish, and modulation of food intake in the musk shrew. Conservation of the GNRH2 gene suggests a critical but divergent function across vertebrates. Here we further the notion that in rhesus macaques, GNRH2 also functions as a hypophysiotropic hormone, responding to estrogens in a positive manner, possibly playing a role in triggering the preovulatory LH surge. While a plausible alternate hypothesis, it is nevertheless also based on two major assumptions: (1) That the detected GNRH2 mRNA in the hypothalamus is translated into a physiological neuropeptide, and (2) that secreted GNRH2 peptide is able to reach gonadotropes within the adenohypophysis. To address these two concerns, we used a battery of endocrine, molecular and histological techniques to assess the expression and distribution of GNRH1 and GNRH2 mRNA and protein in the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland of female rhesus macaques that were maintained under different estrogen environments. In addition, we developed a novel LC‐MS/MS assay to readily distinguish between GNRH1 and GNRH2 molecules and used it to quantify the influence of estradiol on the hypothalamic and pituitary content of GNRH1 and GNRH2. Overall, our results show that the presence of GNRH2 /GNRH2, but not GNRH1 /GNRH1, is significantly enhanced in the pituitary gland by estradiol. Importantly, they provide further support for the hypophysiotropic role of GNRH2, and as a possible mediator of estrogen positive feedback in primates, while GNRH1 is the primary mediator of negative estrogen feedback. Taken together the results suggest that the reproductive neuroendocrine axis of rhesus macaques, and by inference also women, is orchestrated by a heterogenous population of GNRH‐producing cells that respond differentially to estrogen feedback.

### Aromatase activity and bone homeostasis in men [^111bLXAH]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

It is known that sex steroid hormones play an important role in the maintenance of bone mass in males as well as in females. Even though androgens are the major sex steroids in men, their primacy in regulating male skeletal remodeling has been increasingly questioned as direct and indirect evidence emerged suggesting that estrogens may also play a major role in male skeletal health. Recent data suggested that a threshold level of bioavailable estradiol is needed to prevent bone loss, and that with aging an increasing percentage of elderly men begin to fall below this level. The testes account for, at most, 15% of circulating estrogens in the male; the remaining 85% comes from peripheral aromatization of androgen precursors in different tissues, including bone. Human models of aromatase deficiency were the first to demonstrate the critical importance of the conversion of circulating androgens into estrogen in regulating male skeletal homeostasis. All four cases of aromatase-deficient men reported to date showed an identical skeletal phenotype, characterized by tall stature due to continued longitudinal growth, unfused epiphyses, high bone turnover, and osteopenia. Studies using knockout mice along with experimental observations in rats treated with an aromatase inhibitor provided useful information about the importance of aromatase in the male skeleton. Confirmatory evidence comes from recent interventional studies in adult men using aromatase inhibition, which confirmed that estrogens are critically important to the male skeleton by helping to control rates of bone remodeling. Intriguingly, common polymorphisms at the human aromatase (CYP19) gene have been associated with differences in aromatase activity, bone turnover, and rates of bone loss in elderly men, suggesting that variations in aromatase efficiency may also be relevant for skeletal homeostasis. Several additional mechanisms have been proposed in which aromatase activity could be modulated under certain circumstances in different tissues. Additional studies are needed to identify how these genetic, environmental, pathological, and pharmacological influences might modulate aromatase activity in vivo, increasing or reducing estrogen production in males and thereby affecting skeletal health.

### Committee opinion no. 698: hormone therapy in primary ovarian insufficiency [^115XWfFt]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Primary ovarian insufficiency describes a spectrum of declining ovarian function and reduced fecundity due to a premature decrease in initial follicle number, an increase in follicle destruction, or poor follicular response to gonadotropins. The sequelae of primary ovarian insufficiency include vasomotor symptoms, urogenital atrophy, osteoporosis and fracture, cardiovascular disease, and increased all-cause mortality. In women with primary ovarian insufficiency, systemic hormone therapy (HT) is an effective approach to treat the symptoms of hypoestrogenism and mitigate long-term health risks if there are no contraindications to treatment. Hormone therapy is indicated to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and urogenital atrophy and to improve the quality of life of women with primary ovarian insufficiency. Although exogenous estrogen replacement is recommended for women with primary ovarian insufficiency, data comparing various hormonal regimens for disease prevention, symptom amelioration, and safety are lacking in this population. As a first-line approach, HT (either orally or transdermally) that achieves replacement levels of estrogen is recommended. Combined hormonal contraceptives prevent ovulation and pregnancy more reliably than HT; despite only modest odds of spontaneous pregnancy in women with primary ovarian insufficiency, this is a critical consideration for those who deem pregnancy prevention a priority. Treatment for all women with primary ovarian insufficiency should continue until the average age of natural menopause is reached (age 50–51 years). Finally, considering the challenges that adolescents and young women may face in coping with the physical, reproductive, and social effects of primary ovarian insufficiency, comprehensive longitudinal management of this condition is essential.

### Endogenous and exogenous sex steroid hormones in asthma and allergy in females: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117S8YEg]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Fig 2
Meta-analyses of studies that investigated associations between the use of HRT and asthma and allergy in females. N. Europe, Northern Europe. All effect estimates are adjusted. Weights are from random-effects analysis. The comparator group in each analysis is never use.

Forty-one of the 51 observational studies had moderate risk of bias, whereas the rest had high risk; all 6 experimental studies had high risk of bias (data available on request).

This is the most comprehensive synthesis to date linking sex steroids to the development and expression of asthma and allergy in females. We followed recommended steps for undertaking a high-quality synthesis. However, the lack of high-quality experimental studies limited assessment of causality and relevance to patient care and policy. Although most epidemiological studies adjusted for key confounders, this was often not comprehensive. Many outcomes (eg, medication use, exacerbations, and hospitalizations) were not assessed, and so there is little evidence in relation to these.

Questions that remain to be addressed center on the influence of different types of sex steroids, dose and route of administration of exogenous sex steroids, and the underlying biologic mechanisms through which hormones may influence asthma and allergy. Early menarche and irregular menstruation are often signs of anovulation, indicating episodes of unopposed estrogen exposure to target organs and absences of progesterone exposure. Estrogen-only HRT was associated with asthma, whereas smoking, which may influence estrogen metabolism, had a protective effect. Although higher body mass index is generally associated with a more estrogenic stateand also an increased risk of asthma, we found increased risk in both overweight/obese and nonoverweight/nonobese HRT users. At the cellular level, estrogen can have proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects, depending on cell type and location. Explanations for the various associations found are undoubtedly complex, and it is unlikely that all can be explained by one biological mechanism. Our results also suggest that atopy may be a contributing factor in some instances (irregular menstruation) but not others (menopause). The differences in findings for early and late menarche may be due to the different asthma outcomes investigated: alternatively, the effect observed in cross-sectional studies may reflect reverse causation. Further mechanistic work is required to elucidate any relationships, as are further longitudinal observational studies with detailed phenotyping of participants.

### Pituitary gonadotropin-releasing hormone II as a possible mediator of positive estrogen feedback [^112nGzvE]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

While highly plausible, this generally accepted mechanism is based on two assumptions. First, the same population of GNRH‐producing cells ultimately respond to both negative and positive estrogen feedback, either directly or indirectly via kisspeptin neurons. Second, pituitary gonadotropes respond to only a single molecular form of GNRH. Moreover, this mechanism does not adequately explain how estrogens inhibit GNRH secretion for most of the follicular phase, and yet in the middle of the cycle they suddenly become highly stimulatory. A novel explanation was proposed more recently when it was discovered that humansand rhesus macaques, express two different hypothalamic forms of GNRH (i.e. GNRH1 and GNRH2), where the two populations of GNRH neurons are completely distinct, and that both molecular forms of GNRH can stimulate LH release in vivo by acting through the same GNRH receptor 1 (GNRHR1). More importantly, estradiol was shown to inhibit GNRH1 expression in the hypothalamus but stimulate GnRH2 expression, leading to the idea that hypothalamic regulation of the primate female reproductive axis may be orchestrated by two distinct GnRH cell populations. It was further posited, that the pulsatile release of GNRH1 plays a primary role in stimulating pulsatile LH release from the adenohypophysis, which in turn stimulates follicular development and ovarian sex‐steroid production and is responsible for mediating negative estrogen feedback.

### Surgical versus natural menopause: cognitive issues [^111XWb2R]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Women who undergo both natural and surgical menopause experience the loss of cyclic ovarian production of estrogen, but hormonal and demographic differences distinguish these two groups of women. Our objective was to review published evidence on whether the premature cessation of endogenous estrogen production in women who underwent a surgical menopause has deleterious consequences for cognitive aging and to determine whether consequences differ for women if they undergo natural menopause. Studies of estrogen-containing hormone therapy are relevant to this issue.

Design

We reviewed evidence-based research, including the systematic identification of randomized clinical trials of hormone therapy with cognitive outcomes that included an objective measure of episodic memory.

Results

As inferred from very small, short-term, randomized, controlled trials of high-dose estrogen treatment, surgical menopause may be accompanied by cognitive impairment that primarily affects verbal episodic memory. Observational evidence suggests that the natural menopausal transition is not accompanied by substantial changes in cognitive abilities. For initiation of hormone therapy during perimenopause or early postmenopause when the ovaries are intact, limited clinical trial data provide no consistent evidence of short-term benefit or harm. There is stronger clinical trial evidence that initiation of hormone therapy in late postmenopause does not benefit episodic memory or other cognitive skills.

Conclusions

Further research is needed on the long-term cognitive consequences of surgical menopause and long-term cognitive consequences of hormone therapy initiated near the time of surgical or natural menopause. A potential short-term cognitive benefit might be weighed when a premenopausal woman considers initiation of estrogen therapy at the time of, or soon after, hysterectomy and oophorectomy for benign conditions, although data are still quite limited and estrogen is not approved for this indication. Older postmenopausal women should not initiate hormone therapy to improve or maintain cognitive skills.

DRSP is a synthetic progestin and spironolactone analog with antimineralocorticoid activity. In animals and in vitro, drospirenone has antiandrogenic activity, but no glucocorticoid, antiglucocorticoid, estrogenic, or androgenic activity. Progestins counter estrogenic effects by decreasing the number of nuclear estradiol receptors and suppressing epithelial DNA synthesis in endometrial tissue.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to Angeliq nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen plus progestin products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Role of estrogen in the regulation of central and peripheral energy homeostasis: from a menopausal perspective [^116sykky]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Estrogen and ERs

Estrogens refer to C 18 steroids that are derived from cholesterol, catalyzed by the enzyme aromatase, and converted from the C19 precursor, androgen. The aromatase is detected in various human tissues, such as ovarian granulosa cells, adipose and skin fibroblasts, placental syncytiotrophoblast, brain, and bone. With the highest affinity to ERs, E2 is primarily secreted by ovarian granulosa cells in premenopausal women. E1 and E3 are the metabolites of E2, both of which are much less potent than E2.E1, as the main estrogen after menopause, is synthesized in peripheral adipose and skin tissue with precursor androstenedione produced by the adrenal cortex. E3 is mainly produced by the placenta in pregnant women (Figure 1). Orally ingested exogenous estrogen first passes from the intestine to the liver and is rapidly metabolized into less potent E1 before reaching the specific tissue. The first pass decreases the estrogen level in circulation and affects other liver metabolic functions (i.e. coagulation and lipid metabolism). Later, metabolized estrogen in the gut is reabsorbed into circulation through enterohepatic circulation with the help of enteral bacterial flora. Coadministration with drugs that disrupt the gut microbiota, such as antibiotics, may inhibit the effectiveness of estrogen replacement therapy. Therefore, it is essential to individually design the route of administration of estrogen replacement therapy and evaluate specific combined medication to avoid drug–drug interaction.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111ju7Ne]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

North American Menopause Society 2022 hormone therapy — primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) defines permanent menopause as menopause before age 40 years and early menopause as menopause between the ages of 40 and 45 years; POI describes loss of ovarian function before age 40 years with potential intermittent, transient return of hormone production and menstrual cycles. Women with early or premature loss of ovarian function are at increased risk for adverse events related to ovarian hormone deficiency, and evidence links early loss to decreased quality of life and increased risks of fracture, CVD, dementia, diabetes mellitus, and overall mortality, with additional issues including persistent VMS, loss of fertility, bone loss, genitourinary symptoms, sexual dysfunction, cognitive and mood changes, ophthalmic conditions, and depression; some risks may reflect premature aging, as evidenced by shortened telomere length in some studies.

### Exemestane [^117LmXxB]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Breast cancer cell growth may be estrogen-dependent. Aromatase is the principal enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens both in pre- and postmenopausal women. While the main source of estrogen (primarily estradiol) is the ovary in premenopausal women, the principal source of circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women is from conversion of adrenal and ovarian androgens (androstenedione and testosterone) to estrogens (estrone and estradiol) by the aromatase enzyme in peripheral tissues.

Exemestane is an irreversible, steroidal aromatase inactivator, structurally related to the natural substrate androstenedione. It acts as a false substrate for the aromatase enzyme, and is processed to an intermediate that binds irreversibly to the active site of the enzyme, causing its inactivation, an effect also known as "suicide inhibition". Exemestane significantly lowers circulating estrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women, but has no detectable effect on adrenal biosynthesis of corticosteroids or aldosterone. Exemestane has no effect on other enzymes involved in the steroidogenic pathway up to a concentration at least 600 times higher than that inhibiting the aromatase enzyme.

### Endogenous and exogenous sex steroid hormones in asthma and allergy in females: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116hhuht]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The current review will present the most comprehensive and unbiased synthesis of the evidence relating endogenous and exogenous sex steroid hormones to the development and clinical expression of asthma and allergy in females. The only previous review on the topic considered menopausal transition as the only hormone exposure and asthma as the only outcome and therefore does not give a clear picture of the overall evidence base. Key strengths of the current review include the following: (1) synthesis of the role of both endogenous and exogenous sex steroid hormones; (2) presentation of the evidence for each key hormonal transitional point and exposure (puberty, menarche, menstruation, use of hormonal contraceptives, menopause and use of HRT) during the female's life course and assessment of how each of these exposure definitions influences the risk of asthma in females; and (3) a comprehensive and highly sensitive search strategy and inclusion of known leading databases and a panel of expert contacts that will ensure that the main sources of retrieving literature for the underlying evidence are covered.

In ascertaining whether endogenous and exogenous sex steroid hormones have any role in the development and clinical expression of asthma and allergy in females, we aim to uncover the following: (1) putative role and critical time windows of the effect of each endogenous sex steroid hormone (puberty, menarche, menstruation and menopause); (2) effectiveness and safety of exogenous hormonal contraceptives and HRT and their subtypes as secondary prevention strategies; (3) subgroups of females who are more likely to benefit or could be at greater risk of asthma as a consequence of their sex steroid hormonal status or exposure; and (4) key research gaps in this evidence base, recommending steps to strengthen future work. Along these lines, the evidence from this study will in particular form the basis for initiating intervention trials to establish whether hormonal contraceptives and HRT can be effective in improving outcomes of asthma and allergic disorders in females.

Conclusion

Synthesising the evidence that has so far emerged on the role of sex steroid hormones in the development and clinical expression of asthma and allergy in females will help to clarify the reason for the observed sex differentials in the onset and overall burden of asthma after puberty. Furthermore, a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence base will provide the opportunity to identify the potentials of exogenous sex steroid hormones for the primary and secondary prevention of asthma in females.

### Gender differences in multiple sclerosis: induction of estrogen signaling in male and progesterone signaling in female lesions [^111EathB]. Journal of Neuropathology and Experimental Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

The basis of gender differences in the prevalence and clinical progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) is not understood. Here, we identify gender-specific responses in steroid synthesis and signaling in the brains of MS patients as possible contributors to these differences. We investigated gene expression changes in these pathways and of inflammatory cytokines in MS lesions and normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of male and female patients (n = 21) and control NAWM (n = 14) using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (25 MS lesions, 21 MS NAWM, and 14 control NAWM) and immunohistochemistry (3–4 sections per group). In MS lesions in males, there was local upregulation of aromatase (an enzyme involved in estrogen biosynthesis), estrogen receptor-β (ERβ), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNA; whereas in females, there was local upregulation of 3β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase, a progesterone synthetic enzyme, and of progesterone receptor. Astrocytes in the rim and center of MS lesions were found to be the primary source of steroidogenic enzyme and receptor expression. Aromatase and ERα mRNA levels were positively correlated with that of TNF in primary cultures of human microglia and astrocytes; TNF caused increased ERα, suggesting that inflammatory signals stimulate estrogen signaling in this cell type. Together, these findings suggest that there are gender differences in the CNS of MS patients that may affect lesion pathogenesis, that is, in males, estrogen synthesis and signaling are induced; whereas in females, progestogen synthesis and signaling are induced. These differences may represent contributing factors to gender differences in the prevalence and course of MS.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^116RYczs]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Even after menopause, women continue to produce low levels of estrogens and progesterone (< 0.5 ng/ml). Postmenopausal estrogens consist of E 1 (25–42 pg/ml), the dominant estrogen after menopause, and also E 2 (10–25 pg/ml). E 3 levels remain low at ~6 pg/ml. These estrogens are primarily synthesized by peripheral conversion of androstenedione (0.53 ng/ml) and testosterone (22.2 ng/dl), the androgens produced from postmenopausal ovaries and adrenal glands. Postmenopausal androgen biosynthesis, albeit slightly reduced after menopause, remains comparable to premenopausal levels of androstenedione (0.83 ng/ml) and testosterone (25.8 ng/dl). Obesity is also associated with elevated levels of estrogens and increased breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. In premenopausal women, however, obesity is linked to a reduced risk of breast cancer with lower levels of progesterone. It remains unclear whether progesterone levels are elevated in postmenopausal women with obesity as are estrogen levels. Owing to the limited sensitivity of progesterone assay, it has been challenging to measure accurate concentrations of progesterone in postmenopausal women. Studies indicate that the ovary and adrenal gland are likely to be primary sources of postmenopausal progesterone.

### Aromatase inhibition 2013: clinical state of the art and questions that remain to be solved [^115nFBSr]. Endocrine-Related Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Endocrine principles of aromatase inhibition

In postmenopausal women, estrogens are synthesized in most of the body compartments, including the liver, muscle, connective tissue, and skin. While one single aromatase gene exists, the gene contains at least ten different promoters, with different promoters and ligands regulating estrogen synthesis across different tissue types. Notably, these promoters play a different role in benign vs malignant breast tissue; although the 1.4 promoter is the main activator in normal breast tissue, promoters II, 1.3, and 1.7 have been shown to play a role in addition to 1.4 in breast cancer tissue. However, proteins coded for by the different promoters are similar. The aromatase is able to convert testosterone into estradiol (E 2) and androstenedione into estrone (E 1). While circulating androstenedione as well as testosterone in postmenopausal women is considered of adrenal origin, the ovary seems to provide a minor, albeit significant, contribution of circulating testosterone. These circulating androgens are taken up by the different tissue compartments for subsequent aromatization.

Circulating androstenedione levels (4–5 nM) exceed the circulating levels of testosterone (0.5–1 nM) by a factor of about 5–10; in addition, the aromatase enzyme has a four- to fivefold higher affinity for androstenedione compared with testosterone. Thus, aromatization of androstenedione into E 1 is the major pathway of estrogen synthesis in postmenopausal women. While E 1 is inactive by itself with respect to stimulating estrogen receptor activation, it is easily converted to E 2 by multiple dehydrogenases.

Considering plasma estrogen levels in postmenopausal women, plasma E 1 (50–70 pM) exceeds E 2 (12–20 pM) concentrations by a factor of 4–5. In addition, postmenopausal women reveal plasma concentrations of E 1 sulfate (E 1 S) of about 4–600 pM. To be biologically active, E 1 S has to be deconjugated prior to conversion into E 2.

### The mammalian ovary from genesis to revelation [^114NdYU5]. Endocrine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Two major functions of the mammalian ovary are the production of germ cells (oocytes), which allow continuation of the species, and the generation of bioactive molecules, primarily steroids (mainly estrogens and progestins) and peptide growth factors, which are critical for ovarian function, regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, and development of secondary sex characteristics. The female germline is created during embryogenesis when the precursors of primordial germ cells differentiate from somatic lineages of the embryo and take a unique route to reach the urogenital ridge. This undifferentiated gonad will differentiate along a female pathway, and the newly formed oocytes will proliferate and subsequently enter meiosis. At this point, the oocyte has two alternative fates: die, a common destiny of millions of oocytes, or be fertilized, a fate of at most approximately 100 oocytes, depending on the species. At every step from germline development and ovary formation to oogenesis and ovarian development and differentiation, there are coordinated interactions of hundreds of proteins and small RNAs. These studies have helped reproductive biologists to understand not only the normal functioning of the ovary but also the pathophysiology and genetics of diseases such as infertility and ovarian cancer. Over the last two decades, parallel progress has been made in the assisted reproductive technology clinic including better hormonal preparations, prenatal genetic testing, and optimal oocyte and embryo analysis and cryopreservation. Clearly, we have learned much about the mammalian ovary and manipulating its most important cargo, the oocyte, since the birth of Louise Brown over 30 yr ago.

### Endogenous and exogenous sex steroid hormones in asthma and allergy in females: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117Y4XwL]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Before puberty, asthma and allergy are more common in males than in females, but these conditions become more common in females than in males during adulthood until around the time of menopause. The disease severity, healthcare utilisation and impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are also considerably higher in post-pubertal females than in males. Although the specific mechanisms for these differences are unclear, it has been suggested that female sex steroid hormones may have a role. Higher disease risk in females appears to follow key hormonal transitional time points in a female's reproductive life cycle, such as puberty, menarche, menstruation and menopause. These hormonal transitional points may increase the risk of asthma and poor asthma outcomes in females. In contrast, external suppression of endogenous sex hormone production with hormonal contraceptives may improve asthma outcomes, but the evidence is inconsistent, with evidence suggesting that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) may increase the risk of poor outcomes.

A clearer understanding of the role of sex steroid hormones in the development of asthma and allergy in females and their impact on asthma exacerbation, use of healthcare, and HRQoL will help to provide new insights into disease mechanisms and essential preliminary data to inform the development of primary prevention interventions and hormonal-based management strategies. We plan to undertake a systematic synthesis of the evidence to provide a comprehensive, unbiased estimate of the actual effects of sex steroid hormones on the development and clinical expression of asthma and allergy in females.

The only relevant previous systematic review on this topic was confined to investigating the role of menopausal transition; this review focussed on asthma incidence as the sole outcome of interest. Consequently, that study does not allow a thorough appraisal of this evidence base, given that key endogenous and exogenous hormonal factors, as well as other essential asthma and allergy outcomes, were not considered. There is therefore the need to undertake a more comprehensive synthesis of the effect of the various endogenous and exogenous hormonal factors on the full spectrum of asthma outcomes in females.

### Metabolism of endogenous and exogenous reproductive hormones [^116A7y2a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Estradiol and progesterone are produced in abundance by the ovary of the reproductive-age female (and by the placenta in pregnancy). Serum levels of both hormones are very low in the postmenopause, and indistinguishable from women who have undergone castration. Postmenopausal women have higher levels of aromatase in skin and adipose and convert androstenedione to estrone more effectively than younger women. Estradiol is well absorbed orally, but undergoes extensive first-pass effect resulting in production of the less potent metabolites estrone and estrone sulfate. Ethinyl estradiol is well absorbed, potent, and has more pronounced effects in the production of important hepatic proteins. Progesterone is absorbed orally only if ingested in a micronized form, has a relatively short serum half-life, and is metabolized to products with little biologic activity. The synthetic progestogens are abundant in number; potent in effect; and well absorbed orally, vaginally, and transdermally. New formulations of estrogens and progestogens and new delivery systems promise to provide gynecologists and patients with a long list of potential solutions to contraceptive needs and alternatives for hormone replacement therapies.

### Endogenous and exogenous sex steroid hormones in asthma and allergy in females: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112RuEhf]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

To the Editor:

Asthma and allergy are more common in males than in females during early childhood, but the incidence, severity, and impact on quality of life are greater in postpubertal females than in males. Female sex steroid hormones may partly explain these differences. In 2 previous systematic reviews, early menarche (< 12 years) was associated with an increased asthma risk, whereas no significant association was found between menopause and asthma, although subgroup analyses indicated an increased risk in postmenopausal women using hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Consideration of other hormonal factors, along with the full spectrum of relevant outcomes, is necessary for a comprehensive appreciation of the underlying evidence base. We therefore undertook a systematic review investigating the role of endogenous and exogenous hormonal factors in the development and clinical expression of asthma and allergy in females.

Our methods were published a priori (PROSPERO: 2015:CRD42015026762). Further details are available in this article's Online Repository at. We included experimental and analytical epidemiological studies of females from puberty to adulthood (< 75 years). Exposures were puberty, menarche, menstruation, menopause, hormonal contraceptives, and HRT. Primary outcomes were self-reported or objectively defined incidence or prevalence of asthma, asthma exacerbations, asthma hospitalizations, and asthma medication use.

We searched 11 bibliographic databases, databases of ongoing studies, and conference abstracts, and contacted experts for articles published between January 1990 and November 2015 with no language restrictions. N.M. and B. I.N. independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles; extracted study data; and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (experimental studies) and the Effective Public Health Practice Project tool (observational studies). Discrepancies were resolved by discussion, or arbitration by A.S.

### Short-term fasting reveals amino acid metabolism as a major sex-discriminating factor in the liver [^111aXkWC]. Cell Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Sex impacts on liver physiology with severe consequences for energy metabolism and response to xenobiotic, hepatic, and extra-hepatic diseases. The comprehension of the biology subtending sex-related hepatic differences is therefore very relevant in the medical, pharmacological, and dietary perspective. The extensive application of metabolomics paired to transcriptomics here shows that, in the case of short-term fasting, the decision to maintain lipid synthesis using amino acids (aa) as a source of fuel is the key discriminant for the hepatic metabolism of male and female mice. Pharmacological and genetic interventions indicate that the hepatic estrogen receptor (ERα) has a key role in this sex-related strategy that is primed around birth by the aromatase-dependent conversion of testosterone into estradiol. This energy partition strategy, possibly the result of an evolutionary pressure enabling mammals to tailor their reproductive capacities to nutritional status, is most important to direct future sex-specific dietary and medical interventions.

### Understanding women's sex hormone physiology – A priority in diabetes care [^1156Tko9]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, women experience remarkable physiological variations in sex hormone exposure throughout their lifespan that exert profound, clinically significant effects on glucose regulation and metabolic homeostasis. The bidirectional relationship between reproductive endocrinology and glucose metabolism creates complex pathophysiological interactions, where dysfunction in either system propagates through both central neural circuits and peripheral target tissues. Despite these fundamental connections, current research paradigms remain disproportionately focused on pregnancy‐related physiology, while other critical hormonal states — including pubertal transitions, menstrual cycle dynamics, contraceptive use, assisted reproduction, menopausal changes and endocrine cancer therapies — have been systematically understudied. Given the substantial clinical consequences of these interactions, advancing our understanding of women's sex hormone physiology across all these contexts must become an urgent priority.

### Estradiol (estring) [^1126x4bT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

### Vitreous estrogen levels in patients with an idiopathic macular hole [^115PkpUM]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In postmenopausal women, the primary source of estrogen is the adrenal gland, which secretes dehydroepiandrosterone. Dehydroepiandrosterone is converted by steroidogenic enzymes to estrogens in peripheral tissues. Estrogen readily passes through the blood–retinal barrier, and vitreous estrogen is known to be transported from the adrenal gland via blood circulation. In contrast, abundant P450 aromatase is reportedly detectable in the retina of goldfish. Androstenedione is converted to estrogen by P450 aromatase. If P450 aromatase is expressed in the human eye, local production of estrogen may be the result of an alternating supply source. The findings of this present study show that in patients with an IMH, vitreous E2 levels were higher than E1 levels. E2 is believed to be converted from E1 by 17-β hydroxy-dehydrogenase in the eye. This is the first report that evaluated vitreous estrogen levels in patients with an IMH. However, to elucidate the local metabolism of estrogen, further experimental studies will be needed.

E2 exerts the strongest biological activity among the various natural estrogens (E1, E2, and Estriol). Estrogen receptors have a strong affinity for estrogen, which is known to be biologically active even at extremely low levels, and they have reportedly been detected in the retina. In the present study, the observed vitreous E2 levels in the IMH patients were considered more than adequate for biological activity. Vitreous E2 is suggested to have some effect on the eye. Contraction of the posterior vitreous membrane is considered to be one of the steps in the pathogenesis of IMHs. To the best of our knowledge, the effect of estrogen on the vitreous membrane has not yet been elucidated. Previous studies have shown that estrogen has an effect on collagen metabolism and hyaluronic acid production in the skin, and it is believed to have effects on the posterior vitreous membrane. However, those effects have yet to be identified.

### Regulation of body composition and bioenergetics by estrogens [^113UkGaT]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Evidence points to an important role of estradiol (E2) in the regulation of body composition and bioenergetics. Basic and preclinical research shows that the disruption of E2 signaling through either genetic manipulation or surgical intervention accelerates fat accumulation, with a disproportionate increase in abdominal fat. Clinical evidence for the regulation of body composition and bioenergetics by E2 is less consistent. Evidence exists both for and against menopause as the mediator of changes in body composition. Thus, a need remains to better understand the metabolic actions of estrogens in women and the potential impact on health after the menopause.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to estradiol gel 0.1% nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Genome-wide association study of estradiol levels and the causal effect of estradiol on bone mineral density [^115cFNQX]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Estrogen, the primary female sex hormone, is responsible for the development of the female reproductive system and secondary sex characteristics. Estrogen acts primarily as a growth hormone for the reproductive organs and regulates the menstrual cycle in women. Additionally, it plays a critical role in male sexual function. There are 3 major forms of estrogen: estrone, estradiol, and estriol. Estradiol is the major and most potent form. In females, high estrogen levels have been associated with deep vein thrombosis and increased risk for certain cancers, including breast cancer in women. In males, higher levels have been suggested to be associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Estrogen is also an important regulator of bone metabolism in both females and males. When estrogen levels drop after menopause, the cells that synthesize bone (osteoblasts) are unable to effectively produce bone mass. The loss of ovarian estrogens after menopause has therefore, not surprisingly, been associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and higher risk of osteoporosis.

Previously genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for estrogen have been performed in cohorts of up to 11 000 individuals, mostly of European descent, both male and female and stratified by sex. In addition, a GWAS was recently performed for sex hormone levels in UK Biobank (UKB), a study that mainly focused on testosterone. They identified strong sex-specific genetic effects on serum testosterone levels but did not consider the results from estradiol in women, due to the strong link between estradiol levels and menopausal status/age of menopause.

In addition to GWAS, previous studies have also addressed the causal effect of hormones in relation to disease risk using Mendelian Randomization (MR). MR is an approach inspired by randomized controlled studies that uses genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to estimate a causal relationship between an exposure, estradiol in our case, and an outcome (eg, BMD). The underlying reasoning is that if an exposure is directly causing an increased risk of a disease, then the genetic factors increasing the exposure should also indirectly affect disease risk through their effects on the exposure. However, this method requires that some key assumptions are met: (1) the selected IVs are associated with the exposure, (2) the IVs affect the outcome through the exposure, only, and (3) the IVs are not associated with any known or unknown confounders. Because genotypes are assigned at conception, MR can be used to overcome some of the limitations of observational studies, such as reverse causation, where the (alleged) outcome affects the exposure.

### Update in female reproduction: a life-cycle approach [^116nY56p]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Context

Female reproduction spans a developmental life arc from fetal life and childhood, through puberty to the reproductive years, and, finally, ovarian follicle depletion and the onset of menopause.

Objective

This invited review highlights a selection of reports from leading journals over the past 2 yr that have significantly advanced our understanding of female reproduction from conception to menopause.

Synthesis

During fetal life, in utero exposures may be important determinants of later pubertal and adult endocrine physiology. Epigenetic mechanisms are likely involved in the fetal programming of adult endocrine function. With regards to the polycystic ovary syndrome, recent clinical trials have confirmed the central role of clomiphene for ovulation induction in women with this disease. In addition, an expert panel has recommended that all women with polycystic ovary syndrome have a glucose tolerance test because of the high prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance in this population. In menopausal women the precise impact of estrogen therapy on cardiovascular biology remains to be delineated fully. Evolving data indicate that when initiated near the onset of menopause, estrogen therapy has fewer cardiovascular risks than when it is administered decades after the menopause.

Conclusions

The essence of reproduction is the successful transmission of germ-line DNA to a succeeding generation. Advances in genetics and endocrinology are converging to advance significantly our understanding of the biology of reproduction and our ability to influence reproductive processes. These advances will translate into new treatments for the prevalent medical problems of reproduction.

### Estradiol and norethindrone acetate [^111EQQtE]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. Progestins exert their effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes. Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, and central nervous system.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to estradiol and norethindrone acetate tablets nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### Estradiol action in the female hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis [^116Ze2cP]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2024). Medium credibility.

It has now been about a century since a flurry of discoveries identified first the pituitary, then more specifically the anterior pituitary and soon thereafter the central nervous system as components regulating gonadal and downstream reproductive functions. This was an era of ablation/replacement designs using at first rudimentary and then increasingly pure preparations of gonadal and pituitary "activities" or transplanting actual glands, whole or homogenized, among subjects. There was, of course, controversy as is typical of lively and productive scientific debates to this day. The goals of this commentary are to briefly review the history of this work and how the terms referring to interactions among the components of the hypothalamo (as the central neural component was soon associated with)-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis evolved, and then to question if the current terms used have kept up with our understanding of the system. The focus in this review will be the actions of estradiol primarily upon the hypothalamus. Important actions of progesterone on the hypothalamus as well as both steroids on the pituitary response to hypothalamic factors are both acknowledged and largely ignored in this document, as are any sex differences as we focus on females.

### Endogenous and exogenous sex steroid hormones in asthma and allergy in females: protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111CgEFp]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Quality assessment and risk of bias

The quality of eligible studies and the potential for risk of bias will be independently undertaken by two reviewers; any discrepancies will be resolved by discussion or arbitration by a third reviewer. We will assess the methodological quality of experimental studies based on the recommendations of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions as well as the Cochrane Effectiveness and Practice Organisation of Care (EPOC) guidelines. The recommendations highlight seven domains of focus in appraising intervention studies: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting and other sources of bias. We will derive domain-specific and overall quality grading for each study as follows: A — low risk of bias; B — moderate risk of bias; C — high risk of bias. We will use the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) to quality-appraise observational studies and will also derive component-specific (i.e. suitability of the study design for the research question; risk of selection bias; exposure measurement; outcome assessment; and generalisability of findings) and overall grading for each study.

Data syntheses

We will undertake a narrative synthesis of the data. In addition, for studies deemed to be reasonably clinically, methodologically and statistically homogeneous, we will perform meta-analyses using random-effects models. In comparison with fixed-effect meta-analysis, the random-effects model is a more conservative approach as its underlying assumption is closer to reality, particularly synthesising studies obtained only from the published literature, and it incorporates potential heterogeneity between studies when calculating the pooled estimates. We will quantify the heterogeneity between studies using the I² statistic. The meta-analyses will be performed separately for experimental and observational studies and within each study design will also be undertaken separately for groups of studies falling into each type of sex steroid hormonal exposure (puberty, menarche, menstruation, hormonal contraceptives, menopause and HRT). Where possible, we will perform subgroup analyses according to females' background characteristics, such as age, body mass index, smoking and other potential characteristics. We will perform sensitivity analyses on the basis of risk of bias in the studies in order to evaluate the robustness of our findings. We will assess evidence of publication bias using funnel plots and statistically using Begg and Egger tests. The meta-analyses will be performed using Stata Statistical Software (Release 13; StataCorp LP. College Station, TX, USA).

### Estrogenic regulation of hippocampal inhibitory system across lifespan [^117Tpff1]. Journal of Neuroendocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

The evidence so far suggests that peripheral and brain‐derived estrogenic effects reduce the function of inhibitory synapses originating in two different types of INs: CCK/CB1 and PV‐expressing basket INs. The picture regarding the impact of estrogens in IN physiology is likely to be incomplete since other types of INs express aromatase and ERs. How different sources of estrogens interact in the control of INs remains to be established. It is possible that different IN classes may differentially sense local or peripheral sources to adapt hippocampal activity and function to specific conditions. Autocrine actions of estrogens in INs are suggested by aromatase expression in INs and would require co‐expression of ERs in the same estrogen‐producing cells. In principle, the lipophilic nature of 17β‐estradiol molecule poses certain constraints, due to limited solubility, to the passive transport across the extracellular spacebut, together with free diffusion through the plasma membrane and putative active transport, could support paracrine actions of estrogens across different neuronal and glial cell types in the hippocampus. In females, the estrous cycle imposes fluctuating levels of systemic estrogens with important consequences on the physiology and structure of excitatory hippocampal synapses. Moreover, the estrous cycle is also associated with changes in hippocampal estrogens levelsand in the secretion of gonadotrophin‐releasing hormone, which in turn regulates the production of neuroestrogens in the hippocampus. Both phenomena may impact the function of specific IN subtypes. For example, recent studies have described increased density and intensity of PNNs surrounding CA1 PV INs in the proestrus stage of the estrous cycle, associated with high hormonal plasma levels. The regulation of PV IN function and PNNs by neuroestrogens is independent of the endocrine function of the gonads since it takes place in ovariectomized female mice, but the influence of estrous cycle stage in the activity of PV INs or other hippocampal INs subtypes has not been directly addressed. Future studies have the potential to unveil a role for other fluctuating hormones, for example, progesterone, in regulating the function of defined subclasses of hippocampal INs.

### Addressing sex as a biological variable in preclinical models of lung disease: an official American Thoracic Society research statement [^113R7jEF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Additional in vitro experimental design considerations

Given the influence of cellular sex and interactions with sex steroids, in vitro studies should confirm the cellular sex of the donor sources. Commercially sourced adult human cells often lack this information, necessitating laboratory verification and classification before conducting experiments. For cells derived from patient samples (e.g. bronchoscopy, surgical resections), detailed documentation of donor sex and age is essential. If institutional review board-compliant, cellular sex can be determined and verified from primary tissues and monitored for consistency across subcultures. Data on menopausal status, hormone therapy use, and pregnancy history in female donors further help put data derived from female donors into context. Such data should be collected in biorepositories.

In addition, cataloging sex hormone and receptor levels in cells may be important, as these cells contain pathways for local sex steroid production, which can create autocrine or paracrine effects in vitro. Culture media can inadvertently affect steroidal pathways (e.g. phenol red as a proestrogenic agent and growth factor interactions, as seen with neurotrophins and estrogens. Therefore, culture media should be formulated to control for hormonal and growth factors, as informed by current literature. Serum-free and charcoal-stripped media allow for studying cellular behavior in low- or no-hormone environments.

To balance SABV considerations with practical laboratory needs, one approach could involve the research community performing a targeted set of experiments using human lung cells across the age spectrum in carefully curated media. Such studies would establish a reference platform with genomic, proteomic, and functional data, enabling reliable exploration of SABV without dismissing prior foundational research. Key takeaways for consideration of SABV in in vitro models are summarized in Figure 3.

### Estrogen production and action [^115LV9N3]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

Estradiol production is most commonly thought of as an endocrine product of the ovary; however, there are many tissues that have the capacity to synthesize estrogens from androgen and to use estrogen in a paracrine or intracrine fashion. In addition, other organs such as the adipose tissue can contribute significantly to the circulating pool of estrogens. There is increasing evidence that in both men and women extraglandular production of C(18) steroids from C(19) precursors is important in normal physiology as well as in pathophysiologic states. The enzyme aromatase is found in a number of human tissues and cells, including ovarian granulosa cells, the placental syncytiotrophoblast, adipose and skin fibroblasts, bone, and the brain, and it locally catalyzes the conversion of C(19) steroids to estrogens. Aromatase expression in adipose tissue and possibly the skin primarily accounts for the extraglandular (peripheral) formation of estrogen and increases as a function of body weight and advancing age. Sufficient circulating levels of the biologically active estrogen estradiol can be produced as a result of extraglandular aromatization of androstenedione to estrone that is subsequently reduced to estradiol in peripheral tissues to cause uterine bleeding and endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in obese anovulatory or postmenopausal women. Extraglandular aromatase expression in adipose tissue and skin (via increasing circulating levels of estradiol) and bone (via increasing local estrogen concentrations) is of paramount importance in slowing the rate of postmenopausal bone loss. Moreover, excessive or inappropriate aromatase expression was demonstrated in adipose fibroblasts surrounding a breast carcinoma, endometriosis-derived stromal cells, and stromal cells in endometrial cancer, giving rise to increased local estrogen concentrations in these tissues. Whether systemically delivered or locally produced, elevated estrogen levels will promote the growth of these steroid-responsive tissues. Finally, local estrogen biosynthesis by aromatase activity in the brain may be important in the regulation of various cognitive and hypothalamic functions. The regulation of aromatase expression in human cells via alternatively used promoters, which can be activated or inhibited by various hormones, increases the complexity of estrogen biosynthesis in the human body. Aromatase expression is under the control of the classically located proximal promoter II in the ovary and a far distal promoter I.1 (40 kilobases upstream of the translation initiation site) in the placenta. In skin, the promoter is I.4. In adipose tissue, 2 other promoters (I.4 and I.3) located between I.1 and II are used in addition to the ovarian-type promoter II. In addition, promoter use in adipose fibroblasts switches between promoters II/I.3 and I.4 upon treatments of these cells with PGE(2) versus glucocorticoids plus cytokines. Moreover, the presence of a carcinoma in breast adipose tissue also causes a switch of promoter use from I.4 to II/I.3. Thus there can be complex mechanisms that regulate the extraglandular production of estrogen in a tissue-specific and state-specific fashion.

Introduction

Abnormal energy metabolism may lead to a series of physical disorders and predispose postmenopausal women to obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and cardiovascular disease. The incidence of metabolic diseases shows a gender-specific character, with females being particularly at risk of age-correlated metabolic pathology. Premenopausal women exhibit a healthier metabolic pattern compared to age-matched men. However, in the postmenopausal state, with the absence of estrogen, women experience general variations in glucose and lipid profiles, as well as the redistribution of body fat, triggering a significant increase in metabolic-related diseases and all-cause mortality. These findings verify that estrogen is a fundamental regulator in maintaining female energy homeostasis.

Estrogens, as a category of steroid hormones, include estradiol (E2), estriol (E3), and estrone (E1). In humans, estradiol is the primary circulating estrogen hormone that mediates signals through the intracellular nucleus, plasma, and membrane-associated estrogen receptors (ERs). Estrogen is among the most essential hormones in women and gets involved in the initiation, development, and maintenance of reproductive and physiological functions across the body tissues. With the improved life expectancy and the high prevalence of postmenopausal metabolic dysfunction, the beneficial effect of estrogen (mainly referred to estradiol) on central and peripheral energy balance has gained extensive attention. In this study, we review how estrogen contributes to bioenergetic systems in the brain and whole body through ERs signaling in women. Besides, the choice of a particular regimen, dosage, and timing of estrogen therapy have been discussed, with a special emphasis on its regulation of metabolism and clinical implications.

### Estradiol / norethindrone acetate (Lopreeza) [^115XNoxN]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate-conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and FSH through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

Progestin compounds enhance cellular differentiation and generally oppose the actions of estrogens by decreasing estrogen receptor levels, increasing local metabolism of estrogens to less active metabolites, or inducing gene products that blunt cellular responses to estrogen. Progestins exert their effects in target cells by binding to specific progesterone receptors that interact with progesterone response elements in target genes. Progesterone receptors have been identified in the female reproductive tract, breast, pituitary, hypothalamus, and central nervous system.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to Lopreeza nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisions across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

### An examination of dynamic gene expression changes in the mouse brain during pregnancy and the postpartum period [^1179wY7d]. G3 (2015). Low credibility.

The developmental transformation of the mammalian female brain during pregnancy, parturition, and the postpartum period prepare and drive maternal behaviors, and is both a response to, and presumably a cause of, the physiological changes accompanying these reproductive transitions (reviewed in;). While it is clear that fluctuating titers of hormones contribute to changes in gene expression that mediate this transformation, how the female brain is shaped as a result of reproductive and maternal experience is not understood at a molecular-genetic or neural circuit level.

Hormones are vital for both the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy, parturition, and the onset of postpartum maternal behavior, with peptide hormones prolactin (Prl) and oxytocin (Oxt), and steroid hormones estrogen (E) and progesterone (P4) having key roles (reviewed in). With respect to the brain, the epicenter of hormone regulation is the hypothalamus, which is the major central nervous system (CNS) component of the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis (reviewed in;). Hormones produced in the hypothalamus regulate the pituitary gland, which in turn regulates gonadal hormone production. The hormone feedback loops mean that the cells of the hypothalamus are both the source and the target of a variety of hormones.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^111zbUzT]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Estrogen and progesterone are principal hormones in a woman's life. Before menopause, women are exposed to regularly varying levels of endogenous estrogens and progesterone released during repeated menstrual cycles and potentially to more sustained levels of these hormones during pregnancy. Reproductive-age women may be further exposed to these hormones via oral contraceptives, composed of a progestin with or without an estrogen, and other forms of hormonal contraception. Near or after menopause, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) — estrogen alone or combined with a progestin — may be offered to mitigate menopausal symptoms arising from precipitous declines in endogenous estrogen production and to reduce the risk of bone fractures. – Women with prior use of oral contraceptive pills show a significantly reduced risk of ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. Despite the intended medical effects and additional health benefits, these hormonal agents, especially estrogens, remain a lingering concern for breast cancer risk. –

In this review, we have aimed to comprehensively evaluate the association between estrogens and breast cancer. Given the expansive scope of scientific investigations pertaining to this topic, we focus on findings from randomized clinical trials (RCTs), prospective cohort studies, and meta-analyses with rigor and a large sample size, as well as preclinical mechanistic studies. To be inclusive on the topic with depth, we examined vast evidence, via extensive search on PubMed, from clinical and basic experimental studies, which include hormonal contraceptives, HRT, estrogen-elevating fertility treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), reproductive factors, steroid hormone synthesis and metabolism, breast cancer therapies, basic experimental studies, and animal research. Ultimately, we have sought to connect the dots by critically assessing and cohesively integrating wide-ranging, oft-incongruent findings into the conclusions based on the totality of current evidence.

### Exploring the effects of estrogen deficiency and aging on organismal homeostasis during menopause [^117PchYC]. Nature Aging (2024). High credibility.

Sex hormone signaling declines during aging, from early midlife through menopause, as a consequence of reduced circulating estrogens and decreased receptiveness to these hormones in target tissues. Estrogens preserve energy homeostasis and promote metabolic health via coordinated and simultaneous effects throughout the brain and body. Age-associated loss of estrogen production during menopause has been implicated in a higher risk for metabolic diseases and increased mortality. However, it remains unclear whether age-associated changes in homeostasis are dependent on reduced estrogen signaling during menopause. Although menopausal hormone therapies containing estrogens can alleviate symptoms, concerns about the risks involved have contributed to a broad decline in the use of these approaches. Non-hormonal therapies have emerged that target tissues or pathways with varying levels of selectivity, reducing risk. We summarize here the broad effects of estrogen loss on homeostasis during menopause, current and emerging therapies and opportunities for understanding homeostatic disruptions associated with menopause.

### Estrogens and breast cancer [^117FRGfX]. Annals of Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

Estrogens have been associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. Yet emerging clinical and experimental evidence points to progestogens [endogenous progesterone or synthetic progesterone (progestin)] as the primary hormonal driver underlying seemingly estrogen-associated breast cancer risk. Estrogens may contribute to breast cancer risk indirectly by induction of the progesterone receptor and thus amplifying progesterone signaling. Large studies of hormonal contraceptives suggest that the small increase in breast cancer risk from hormonal contraceptives is mainly attributable to progestins, not estrogens. Estrogen-plus-progestin hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has consistently shown an increase in breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women, whereas estrogen-alone HRT has little impact on breast cancer risk in naturally or surgically menopausal women. In particular, the long-term follow-up of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trials suggests a benefit of estrogen alone. Recent data further indicate that endogenously elevated estrogen during assisted reproductive technology (ART) exhibits little adverse effect on or potentially a reduction in breast cancer risk and recurrence. Also, accumulating evidence suggests that inhibition of progesterone signaling is a critical mechanism underlying the risk-reducing and therapeutic effects of antiestrogens. Estrogen HRT has shown an array of proven benefits, including ameliorating menopausal symptoms and improving bone health. Collective evidence thus suggests that estrogen HRT is likely to offer health benefits to perimenopausal or postmenopausal women, including breast cancer survivors, as well as young BRCA1/2 carriers with prophylactic oophorectomy for ovarian cancer prevention.

### Aromatization of androgens in women: current concepts and findings [^112S1Vzy]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the role of circulating C(19) steroids as precursors of estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Design

Review of current published literature.

Result(S)

In postmenopausal women as in men, estradiol no longer functions as a circulating hormone, because it ceases to be formed by the ovaries at the time of menopause. Estradiol continues to be formed in a number of extragonadal sites, however, including breast, bone, vascular smooth muscle, and various sites in the brain. At these sites of formation, local estradiol levels can be quite high, but the production rate is insufficient to affect the body in a global fashion; thus, estrogen action at these extragonadal sites of synthesis is primarily at a local level and serves a paracrine or even intracrine role. Because of this, in postmenopausal women as in men, circulating estrogen levels do not drive growth and development of target tissues. Instead, they reflect the metabolism of estradiol at these extragonadal sites. Estrogen that is not metabolized at these sites reenters the circulation, and, consequently, circulating levels of estradiol reflect its synthesis and action in extragonadal sites. Thus, they are reactive instead of proactive. An important difference between estrogen production at these extragonadal sites and estrogen that is synthesized in the ovary is that the former is absolutely dependent on a supply of circulating C(19) androgenic substrate.

Conclusion(S)

Circulating levels of testosterone begin to decline in the mid-reproductive years, and the levels of adrenal androgenic steroids, namely adrostenedione and DHEA, decrease throughout postmenopausal life. Therefore, the circulating levels of these adrogenic steroids may serve an important role in the maintenance of local estrogen synthesis, for example, in the bone and brain where estrogen has a profound influence on the maintenance of mineralization on the one hand, and possible cognitive function on the other.
