## Question

What are the causes of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of progressive supranuclear palsy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pathobiology and whether PSP is a primary tauopathy. Then, I should verify the genetic risk architecture, including common MAPT variation and rare mutations. Next, I will examine cellular and network mechanisms such as gain-of-function toxicity, seeding/propagation, and synaptic loss. After that, I need to map the selective neuroanatomy that underpins the clinical phenotype. I should then consider non-genetic risk factors and potential environmental triggers, and distinguish true PSP from phenocopies. Finally, I will synthesize these elements into a concise causal cascade and note diagnostic implications and biomarker constraints, ensuring each point aligns with the cited literature.

> Let me first confirm the foundational biology so I don't jump to conclusions. Progressive supranuclear palsy is consistently characterized as a primary tauopathy with neuronal and glial accumulation of hyperphosphorylated 4-repeat tau isoforms, including 0N4R and 1N4R, forming neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, and the pathognomonic tufted astrocytes, which places tau — encoded by MAPT — at the center of pathogenesis [^114DoB6L] [^113We7x4]. Wait, let me verify whether this is just a generic tau signal in fluids; actually, CSF total and phospho-tau assays generally do not discriminate PSP from controls, underscoring that the disease mechanism is tissue- and circuit-specific rather than reflected by a simple CSF tau elevation in PSP [^111a7AV9].

> I need to check the genetic underpinnings next. The major risk for sporadic PSP comes from common variation at MAPT, with evidence that such variation influences isoform expression and associates most strongly with clinically typical PSP phenotypes, while rare pathogenic mutations like R5L have been described and appear to act via gain-of-function effects on tau's microtubule assembly role [^113We7x4] [^117CkaGd] [^115cjeWH]. Hold on, I should verify whether other loci contribute to phenotypic variability; there are signals such as variation at TRIM11 that modify clinical features, and importantly, early-onset and late-onset PSP share a similar genetic risk profile, arguing against a distinct monogenic driver for early presentations in most cases [^114DoB6L] [^11389gmr]. Let me reconsider whether the R5L mutation alters isoform ratios; the report indicates it does not change isoform synthesis but still produces 4R-predominant insoluble tau aggregates, consistent with a toxic gain-of-function rather than a splice-shift mechanism [^115cjeWH].

> Next, I should review the cellular and systems-level mechanisms that translate genetic susceptibility into degeneration. I will now examine evidence for toxic gain-of-function, prion-like propagation, synapse loss, and glial contributions. The R5L mutation impairs tau-mediated microtubule polymerization and confers toxicity, a canonical gain-of-function observation consistent with 4R-tau misfolding and aggregation being injurious to neuronal integrity [^115cjeWH]. But wait, what about propagation across circuits? Sarkosyl-insoluble tau from PSP brains seeds aggregation in vitro and, when injected into primate supranigral regions, induces parkinsonism and dysexecutive features with PSP-like tau pathology, providing direct in vivo evidence of prion-like spread in a gyrencephalic brain [^1124c6HF]. I should confirm whether early synaptic dysfunction contributes to cortical symptoms; modeling constrained by synaptic PET in PSP-Richardson's syndrome links regional synapse loss to altered cortical neurophysiology and frontal cognitive decline even with mild atrophy, supporting synaptopathy as an early mediator of network failure [^111btuTW]. Hmm, wait a minute, the role of oligodendroglia needs scrutiny: long-duration PSP shows a lower burden of oligodendroglial tau (coiled bodies), and the study interprets the tempo of disease as determined by oligodendroglial pathology; that sounds counterintuitive at first, but on reflection it implies that higher early oligodendroglial tau burden correlates with more rapid progression, whereas lower burdens are seen in the benign, long-duration subgroup, reconciling the observation with a driver role for oligodendroglial pathology in disease acceleration [^117PGbfJ].

> Let me think about the neuroanatomical signature because cause should align with where degeneration occurs. Pathology and imaging consistently implicate the subthalamic nucleus, midbrain (including the tectum), superior cerebellar peduncles, and basal ganglia, with dense microscopic tau lesions in the basal ganglia, diencephalon, and brainstem, matching the clinical triad of postural instability, vertical gaze palsy, and akinetic-rigid syndrome [^113We7x4] [^114DoB6L]. I should double-check in vivo tau imaging; florzolotau PET in PSP shows predominant binding across the pallido–nigro–luysian axis, with higher intensity in Richardson's syndrome versus non-RS phenotypes and patterns that echo postmortem distributions, reinforcing regionally selective vulnerability of 4R-tau networks in PSP [^111yrumK] [^113vzFnZ]. Next, I should review structural metrics that track disease; midbrain area reduction and superior cerebellar peduncle degeneration correlate with severity and progression, providing convergent anatomical biomarkers of the involved circuitry, especially in PSP-Richardson's syndrome [^114zRDKP] [^112ivMyC].

> Now, I need to ensure we are not over-ascribing non-genetic causes. Age is the strongest demographic risk, with onset typically in the mid-60s, and early-onset PSP does not show higher rates of encephalitis or head injury than late-onset PSP, arguing against these as primary causal factors across the spectrum [^114DoB6L] [^11389gmr]. Hold on, I should verify whether purported environmental toxins explain PSP; Guadeloupean parkinsonism produces a PSP-like syndrome with distinct imaging and clinical features, suggesting a toxin-associated mimic rather than true PSP pathology, so we should be cautious not to conflate mimicking syndromes with the etiology of PSP itself [^115ZpHqi]. Taken together, beyond aging as a permissive factor, consistent exogenous causes are not identified in the provided sources [^114DoB6L] [^11389gmr].

> I will now examine phenocopies to avoid misattribution of cause. MM2-subtype sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease can present with early falls, vertical gaze palsy, and rapid dementia, sometimes labeled as PSP during life, but this is a prionopathy with distinct molecular pathology, not a cause of PSP's tauopathy [^112pC9dS]. Let me reconsider Lewy body disease; brainstem-predominant α-synuclein pathology may yield a PSP-like clinical picture in rare cases, again a mimic rather than an etiologic substrate for PSP [^112aCUZD]. I should confirm MSA overlap; autopsy-proven MSA can mimic PSP clinically, which reinforces the need for stringent criteria and supports the distinctness of PSP as a 4R tauopathy, not a synucleinopathy [^112xDMX9]. To anchor this, the "probable 4R-tauopathy" clinical category has high specificity for underlying 4R tau pathology in PSP and corticobasal degeneration, which helps separate true PSP from mimics in trials and research, albeit with limited sensitivity early on [^117NWLx9] [^116DptgR].

> Synthesis time — let me knit the causal model while checking each link. Genetic susceptibility primarily via common MAPT variation, occasionally augmented by rare mutations and phenotype modifiers, biases tau biology toward 4R-tau misprocessing; this favors misfolding and aggregation into hyperphosphorylated 4R-tau seeds that propagate in a prion-like manner across vulnerable brainstem–basal ganglia–diencephalic circuits; the process disrupts cytoskeletal integrity and reduces synaptic density, with oligodendroglial tau burden influencing the tempo of progression; selective involvement of the pallido–nigro–luysian axis, subthalamic nucleus, midbrain, and superior cerebellar peduncles explains the cardinal clinical phenotype; aging permissively reduces proteostatic resilience, but consistent exogenous causes have not been demonstrated in the supplied literature [^113We7x4] [^114DoB6L] [^1124c6HF] [^111btuTW] [^117PGbfJ]. I should confirm that this synthesis aligns with in vivo and postmortem mapping; convergent PET and MRI evidence supports the same regional vulnerabilities that are pathognomonic for PSP, strengthening the causal coherence of a genetically primed, age-dependent 4R-tau proteinopathy [^111yrumK] [^113vzFnZ] [^114zRDKP].

> Before concluding, let me double-check diagnostic and biomarker implications so I don't overstate causality beyond the data. Despite tau being the etiologic hub, conventional CSF t-tau and p-tau assays do not reliably distinguish PSP from controls, underscoring that current fluid biomarkers capture Alzheimer-type tau dynamics better than 4R-PSP biology; thus, clinicopathologic correlation and emerging imaging/physiological markers remain essential for accurate attribution of cause in vivo [^111a7AV9]. Hold on, I should verify whether earlier clinical categorization helps; the "suggestive of PSP" construct improves early identification and reduces time to diagnosis, but by itself does not define etiology, so it should be integrated with genetic risk, imaging patterns, and longitudinal evolution to avoid mislabeling mimics as PSP [^111D371Q] [^116DptgR].

> Final check: putting it plainly, PSP is best understood as a genetically primed, age-dependent 4-repeat tauopathy in which MAPT-driven vulnerability, toxic 4R-tau aggregation with prion-like spread, early synaptic dysfunction, and glial contributions converge to produce selective degeneration in brainstem and basal ganglia circuits; mimics like prion or synuclein diseases can look similar clinically but are not causal for PSP, and no consistent environmental toxin or infection is implicated by the provided sources [^114DoB6L] [^113We7x4] [^1124c6HF] [^117PGbfJ] [^112pC9dS] [^112aCUZD] [^112xDMX9].

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is caused by **abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein** in neurons and glia [^113We7x4], forming neurofibrillary tangles, tufted astrocytes, and coiled bodies [^117CkaGd], with a predominance of 4-repeat tau isoforms [^114DoB6L] [^117NWLx9]. This tauopathy leads to selective neurodegeneration in the midbrain, basal ganglia, and brainstem, producing the characteristic clinical syndrome [^113vzFnZ]. The primary risk factor is the **MAPT H1 haplotype**, and rare MAPT mutations can cause familial PSP; environmental or lifestyle factors are not established causes [^115cjeWH] [^1173pe3C] [^11389gmr]. PSP is a sporadic neurodegenerative disorder with no known infectious or autoimmune triggers.

---

## Tau protein abnormalities

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that stabilizes neuronal microtubules [^113We7x4]. In PSP, tau becomes **hyperphosphorylated**, misfolds, and aggregates into insoluble filaments that form **neurofibrillary tangles**, tufted astrocytes, and coiled bodies [^114DoB6L]. These aggregates disrupt neuronal function, impair axonal transport, and ultimately lead to neuronal death. Tau isoforms: PSP is characterized by a predominance of **four-repeat (4R) tau isoforms**, distinguishing it from other tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, which typically involves both three-repeat (3R) and 4R tau isoforms [^117NWLx9] [^114DoB6L]. Tau propagation: Recent studies suggest that **tau pathology may spread in a prion-like manner** from cell to cell, contributing to disease progression [^1124c6HF].

---

## Genetic factors

Although most cases of PSP are sporadic, **genetic factors** play a significant role in disease susceptibility:

- **MAPT gene**: The most significant genetic risk factor for PSP is the H1 haplotype of the MAPT gene, which encodes tau protein. This haplotype is present in approximately 95% of PSP cases, compared to about 60% in the general population.

- **MAPT mutations**: Rare mutations in the MAPT gene, such as the R5L mutation, have been identified in familial cases of PSP, suggesting a direct causal relationship between tau gene mutations and PSP pathology [^115cjeWH] [^117CkaGd].

- **Other genetic factors**: Variations in other genes, such as TRIM11, have been identified as modifiers of PSP phenotype, influencing disease severity and progression [^114DoB6L] [^11389gmr].

---

## Neuropathological changes

PSP is characterized by specific **neuropathological changes**, including:

- **Neuronal loss and gliosis**: Significant neuronal loss and gliosis occur in the basal ganglia, diencephalon, and brainstem, particularly in the subthalamic nucleus, midbrain tectum, and superior cerebellar peduncle [^113We7x4] [^113vzFnZ].

- **Dopaminergic degeneration**: The substantia nigra shows loss of pigment corresponding to nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration, contributing to parkinsonian symptoms [^113We7x4] [^114zRDKP].

- **Synaptic loss**: Early synaptic loss occurs in PSP, contributing to cognitive impairment even in the absence of significant cortical atrophy [^111btuTW].

---

## Environmental and lifestyle factors

There is **no strong evidence** linking specific environmental or lifestyle factors to the development of PSP [^1173pe3C]. Unlike other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, where environmental toxins and lifestyle factors have been implicated, PSP appears to be primarily driven by genetic and molecular factors.

---

## Infectious and autoimmune triggers

There is **no evidence** that infectious agents or autoimmune processes play a significant role in the development of PSP; the disease is primarily characterized by tau protein abnormalities and genetic susceptibility, with no known infectious or autoimmune triggers [^1173pe3C].

---

## Summary of PSP causative factors

| **Factor** | **Role in PSP** |
|-|-|
| Tau protein abnormalities | - Primary cause <br/> - Hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates disrupt neuronal function |
| Genetic factors | - Significant risk factor <br/> - MAPT H1 haplotype and rare MAPT mutations |
| Neuropathological changes | - Neuronal loss <br/> - Gliosis <br/> - Dopaminergic degeneration <br/> - Synaptic loss |
| Environmental factors | No strong evidence linking environmental factors to PSP |
| Infectious/autoimmune triggers | No evidence of involvement |

Progressive supranuclear palsy is primarily caused by **abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein**, leading to neuronal degeneration [^113We7x4]. Genetic factors, particularly the MAPT H1 haplotype, significantly increase susceptibility. There is no strong evidence linking environmental, infectious, or autoimmune factors to PSP [^1173pe3C].

### An R5L tau mutation in a subject with a progressive supranuclear palsy phenotype [^115cjeWH]. Annals of Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The MAPT gene, which encodes tau, was screened for mutations in 96 subjects with progressive supranuclear palsy. A point mutation, R5L, was identified in a single subject, and it was not present in the other subjects or in 96 controls. Functionally, this mutation alters the ability of tau to promote microtubule assembly.

Analysis of soluble tau from different brain regions indicates that the mutation does not affect the ratio of tau isoforms synthesized. Aggregated insoluble tau from subcortical regions was predominantly four-repeat tau with no or one amino-terminal insert (0N4R and 1N4R). Insoluble tau from cortical regions also contained 1N3R tau. Thus, the R5L mutation causes a progressive supranuclear palsy phenotype, presumably by a gain-of-function mechanism.

### Variation at the TRIM11 locus modifies progressive supranuclear palsy phenotype [^114DoB6L]. Annals of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition and the most common cause of atypical parkinsonism, with an estimated prevalence of 5 to 7 per 100,000. The pathology of PSP is centered on the structural microtubule-associated protein tau, encoded by the MAPT gene located on chromosome 17. In PSP, there is neuronal and glial accumulation of hyperphosphorylated fibrillary aggregates of 4-repeat predominant tau. The pathological hallmarks of PSP include a high density of neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads in the basal ganglia and brainstem along with tau-positive tufted astrocytes.

Richardson syndrome (RS) is the most common clinical phenotype related to PSP pathology. It was first described by Steele, Richardson, and Olszewski as an L-dopa–unresponsive akinetic–rigid syndrome with falls, a vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, and dementia. Previous studies looking at the natural history of RS have shown that the mean age of disease onset is 65 to 67 years, and the median disease duration is 6 to 7 years. In addition, a clinical diagnosis of RS has been shown to be highly predictive of underlying PSP pathology, and the diagnosis of this form of PSP was operationalized in the NINDS–Society for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy criteria.

We and others have identified alternative clinical phenotypes related to PSP pathology in relatively small case series. This led to the description of two distinct PSP non-RS clinical phenotypes by Williams and colleagues: PSP-parkinsonism (PSP-P) and pure akinesia with gait freezing (PAGF).

### Progressive supranuclear palsy: Pathology and genetics [^113We7x4]. Brain Pathology (2007). Low credibility.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is an atypical Parkinsonian disorder associated with progressive axial rigidity, vertical gaze palsy, dysarthria, and dysphagia. Neuropathologically, the subthalamic nucleus and brainstem, especially the midbrain tectum and the superior cerebellar peduncle, show atrophy. The substantia nigra shows a loss of pigment corresponding to nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration. Microscopic findings include neuronal loss, gliosis, and neurofibrillary tangles in the basal ganglia, diencephalon, and brainstem. Characteristic tau pathology is also found in glia.

The major genetic risk factor for sporadic PSP is a common variant in the gene encoding microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), and recent studies have suggested that this may result in the altered expression of specific tau protein isoforms. Imaging studies suggest that there may be sensitive and specific means to differentiate PSP from other Parkinsonian disorders, but the identification of a diagnostic biomarker is still elusive.

### Identification of multiple system atrophy mimicking Parkinson's disease or progressive supranuclear palsy [^112xDMX9]. Brain (2021). Low credibility.

We studied a subset of patients with autopsy-confirmed multiple system atrophy who presented a clinical picture that closely resembled either Parkinson's disease or progressive supranuclear palsy. These mimics are not captured by the diagnostic criteria for multiple system atrophy. Among 218 autopsy-proven multiple system atrophy cases reviewed, 177 (81.2%) were clinically diagnosed and pathologically confirmed as multiple system atrophy (i.e. typical cases), while the remaining 41 (18.8%) had received an alternative clinical diagnosis, including Parkinson's disease (i.e. Parkinson's disease mimics; n = 16) and progressive supranuclear palsy (i.e. progressive supranuclear palsy mimics; n = 17).

We also reviewed the clinical records of another 105 patients with pathologically confirmed Parkinson's disease or progressive supranuclear palsy, who had received a correct final clinical diagnosis (i.e. Parkinson's disease, n = 35; progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson syndrome, n = 35; and progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism, n = 35). We investigated 12 red flag features that would support a diagnosis of multiple system atrophy according to the diagnostic criteria. Compared with typical multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease mimics more frequently had a good levodopa response and visual hallucinations. Vertical gaze palsy and apraxia of eyelid opening were more commonly observed in progressive supranuclear palsy mimics. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an increased likelihood of having multiple system atrophy.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Clinical and radiological manifestations, pathophysiology, and outstanding questions [^116wEimm]. The Lancet Neurology (2015). High credibility.

The diagnostic criteria for Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the identification and diagnosis of PRES in patients presenting with specific neurological symptoms and risk factors. This tool is particularly useful in differentiating PRES from other neurological conditions with similar presentations.

The primary components of this diagnostic criteria include the presence of at least one acute neurological symptom, at least one risk factor, specific findings on brain imaging, and the absence of an alternative diagnosis. Acute neurological symptoms may include seizures, encephalopathy, confusion, headache, or visual disturbances. Risk factors encompass severe hypertension or blood pressure fluctuations, renal failure, immunosuppressant therapy, chemotherapy, eclampsia, or an autoimmune disorder. The brain imaging should either be normal, show bilateral vasogenic edema, or cytotoxic edema with a pattern indicative of PRES.

The diagnostic criteria for PRES are met if all four components are present. If any of these components are absent, the diagnostic criteria for PRES are not met, suggesting the need for further investigation into alternative diagnoses. This diagnostic tool thus provides a structured approach to the diagnosis of PRES, facilitating early recognition and appropriate management of this condition.

### Pathological, clinical and genetic heterogeneity in progressive supranuclear palsy [^117CkaGd]. Brain (2002). Low credibility.

We have identified two groups of patients with clinically typical and atypical, pathologically diagnosed progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and investigated their genetic and molecular pathological characteristics. Those with clinically typical PSP are more likely to have the PSP susceptibility genotype and to have the deposition of PSP-type hyperphosphorylated tau protein.

- **Clinically atypical PSP group**: This group contains a number of different clinical syndromes, including an L-dopa unresponsive bradykinetic syndrome and a clinical syndrome closely resembling idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The clinically atypical PSP group are less likely to have the PSP susceptibility genotype and often have the deposition of Alzheimer's disease paired helical filament type hyperphosphorylated tau.

This study suggests that the tau PSP susceptibility genotype is most strongly associated with clinically typical PSP. Neurofibrillary tangle parkinsonian disorders, which pathologically resemble PSP but involve the deposition of Alzheimer's disease-type tau often without involvement of the tau susceptibility genotype, need to be distinguished for diagnostic and research purposes.

### Impulsive-compulsive spectrum behaviors in pathologically confirmed progressive supranuclear palsy [^111ppUR9]. Movement Disorders (2010). Low credibility.

There is growing awareness of impulsive-compulsive spectrum behaviors (ICBs) in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated with dopamine replacement therapy (DRT). These include pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive shopping, binge eating, punding, and compulsive use of DRT, or dopamine dysregulation syndrome. In PD, difficulties exist in separating the effects of DRT from the underlying disease process and aberrant dopaminergic systems in determining the etiology of ICBs. Recent reports of ICBs associated with dopamine agonist use for conditions other than PD may suggest a significant etiological role for these medications, but currently published cases thus far lack pathological confirmation of diagnoses. We present three cases of pathologically confirmed progressive supranuclear palsy who developed ICBs in association with dopamine agonist use. Pathological comparisons between these three cases and other case series of progressive supranuclear palsy are made.

### Progressive supranuclear palsy: Where are we now [^1173pe3C]. The Lancet Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

This review provides an update on progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP, or Steele-Richardson-Olszewski disease), an adult-onset neurodegenerative disorder characterized by early postural instability, which leads to falls, and a vertical supranuclear-gaze palsy. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that the disorder is more common than previously recognized, that it is commonly misdiagnosed, and that it may present to a wide range of hospital specialists. The diagnosis of PSP hinges on clinical acumen. Attempts to identify a suitable biomarker in the CSF or a specific and sensitive imaging or neurophysiological technique have so far failed to have a significant effect on the diagnostic process. A better understanding of the molecular pathology of PSP has highlighted the importance of tau-protein accumulation and tau-genotype susceptibility in its pathogenesis. No drug treatment significantly and consistently benefits patients, and novel therapies are urgently required.

### F-florzolotau PET imaging captures the distribution patterns and regional vulnerability of tau pathology in progressive supranuclear palsy [^111yrumK]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Use of 18F-Florzolotau PET imaging in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy effectively illustrates the uptake patterns of the tracer. In the study, images depict uptake in the healthy control (HC) group (panel A), the entire patient cohort (panel B), as well as in the PSP-RS (panel C) and PSP-non-RS (panel D) groups. Notably, patients with PSP exhibit significantly increased binding mainly in the pallido-nigro-luysian axis when compared to the HC group (panel E). Although similar patterns of tracer accumulation are observed in both patient groups, the binding intensity is markedly lower in patients with PSP-non-RS (panel F).

The images use color bars to represent SUVR values in panels A–D, and threshold values from voxel-wise comparisons in panels E–F. Abbreviations used include: HC for healthy control, PSP for progressive supranuclear palsy, PSP-RS for progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson's syndrome, PSP-non-RS for other PSP subtypes except progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson's syndrome, and SUVR for standardized uptake value ratio.

A generalized linear model adjusted for age, sex, and disease duration was employed to estimate intergroup differences regarding semiquantitative PET parameters across different target regions. To correct for multiple comparisons, the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure was applied in all analyses.

### The evolution of diagnosis from symptom onset to death in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) compared to Parkinson's disease (PD) [^112183S9]. Journal of Neurology (2023). Low credibility.

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics at the time of the first assessment and entry into the PINE study were extracted. The full primary care, secondary care, and research records for each case were systematically hand-searched retrospectively to identify relevant data. The onset of the diagnostic process was defined as the date of the index symptom onset. An index symptom was identified as the first documented symptom, noted in the primary or secondary care record, which persisted throughout the course of the illness to maximize the specificity of symptoms relating to their parkinsonian diagnosis. A list of motor, non-motor, and neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs systematically sought from the records are detailed in Appendix 1. At their baseline visit, patients also recalled the onset of their first parkinsonian symptom, defined as the patient-recalled index symptom.

A documented primary diagnosis was a clinician's single best explanation for the patient's clinical presentation, while differential diagnoses were documented as alternative explanations for the patient's presentation. Prior to PINE study referral, clinicians were general practitioners (GPs) or hospital specialists. After study entry, patients had at least an annual review by a movement disorder specialist in addition to other hospital specialists. Both syndromic and disease-specific diagnoses, mixed diagnoses, and exogenous factors such as alcohol or an infection — if considered a clinician's single best explanation for symptoms — were regarded as discrete diagnoses. The date each primary diagnosis was first proposed or re-diagnosed was also recorded.

### Characterizing a neurodegenerative syndrome: primary progressive apraxia of speech [^111pmT3w]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

We previously reported an association of AOS with underlying tau pathologies, particularly with 4 repeat (4 R) tau. In that study, it appeared that subjects with what we now call PPAOS were more likely to have the underlying pathology of progressive supranuclear palsy. This association with tau has subsequently been identified by other groups. It is interesting, however, that neurological examination did not identify more features commonly associated with progressive supranuclear palsy in our subjects with PPAOS, with the exception of Subject 3. This subject had a pure motor speech disorder for 5.5 years before developing eye movement abnormalities suggestive of underlying progressive supranuclear palsy.

The fact that this was the only subject with a disease duration greater than 5 years, and the fact that four subjects with a disease duration of between 4 and 5 years did not show typical clinical features of progressive supranuclear palsy, suggests that progressive supranuclear palsy features may be more likely to emerge at least 5 years into the illness. It remains unclear, however, whether subjects with PPAOS will develop the full-blown characteristics of progressive supranuclear palsy, since falls in the first year, a symptom typical of progressive supranuclear palsy, were not reported in any of our 12 subjects with PPAOS and none met criteria for probable progressive supranuclear palsy. Interestingly, though, Subject 3 had executive dysfunction on neurological testing, with a score of 14 on the Frontal Assessment Battery. Four other subjects had mild executive dysfunction as measured by…

### Cognition in corticobasal syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy: A review [^11794EAe]. Movement Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) represent challenging neurodegenerative disorders for both clinicians and nonclinical scientists. Although initially grouped together as "Parkinson's-Plus" syndromes, CBS and PSP are clinically and pathologically distinct from Parkinson's disease. It is now evident that behavioral and cognitive changes are common in both syndromes and significantly impact quality of life and carer burden.

We briefly review the clinical, pathological, and neuroradiological features of each syndrome, followed by detailed descriptions of the behavioral and cognitive deficits encountered in CBS and PSP. Clinically and pathologically heterogeneous, CBS is characterized by a wide range of cognitive and behavioral disturbances. Impairments in executive function and memory are common but nonspecific. In contrast, deficits in language and visuospatial abilities appear to be more distinctive features of CBS; the relevance of specific patterns of impairment to the underlying histopathology or prognosis remains to be fully elucidated.

As in CBS, behavioral and cognitive changes are almost universal in PSP, with a wide range of reported deficits. Apathy is very common, often paradoxically accompanied by impulsivity. Executive dysfunction is prominent, but memory and visuospatial deficits also occur. An emerging field is the study of social cognition, which appears impaired in both syndromes. As therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative pathologies develop, more specific diagnostic tools for CBS and PSP will be required.

### Clinical milestones as triggers for palliative care intervention in progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy [^116Adu5Y]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2023). High credibility.

In patients diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), it is crucial to identify specific clinical milestones that can trigger timely palliative care interventions. By doing so, healthcare providers can improve the quality of life for those affected by these progressive neurological disorders.

- **Identifying clinical milestones**: Key clinical milestones for PSP and MSA typically include a noticeable decline in motor function, the onset of severe dysphagia, or recurrent respiratory infections. Recognizing these signs early can help initiate necessary palliative care measures.

- **Palliative care interventions**: Upon reaching significant clinical milestones, it becomes critical to engage a multidisciplinary team to address symptoms, provide support, and assist with end-of-life planning. This team can consist of neurologists, palliative care specialists, and support services, all working together to ensure comprehensive care.

By focusing on these clinical milestones, the aim is to enhance patient outcomes and provide compassionate care tailored to the individual needs of those living with PSP and MSA.

### A fully automated, atlas-based approach for superior cerebellar peduncle evaluation in progressive supranuclear palsy phenotypes [^112ivMyC]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

The superior cerebellar peduncle is damaged in progressive supranuclear palsy. However, alterations differ between progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism. In this study, we propose an automated tool for superior cerebellar peduncle integrity assessment and test its performance in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism, Parkinson disease, and healthy controls.

Structural and diffusion MRI was performed in 21 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome, 9 with progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism, 20 with Parkinson disease, and 30 healthy subjects. In a fully automated pipeline, the left and right superior cerebellar peduncles were first identified on MR imaging by using a tractography-based atlas of white matter tracts; subsequently, volume, mean diffusivity, and fractional anisotropy were extracted from superior cerebellar peduncles. These measures were compared across groups, and their discriminative power in differentiating patients was evaluated in a linear discriminant analysis.

Compared with those with Parkinson disease and controls, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy with Richardson syndrome showed alterations of all superior cerebellar peduncle metrics (decreased volume and fractional anisotropy, increased mean diffusivity). Patients with progressive supranuclear palsy-parkinsonism had smaller volumes than those with Parkinson disease.

### Autopsy validation of progressive supranuclear palsy-predominant speech/language disorder criteria [^116K6peT]. Movement Disorders (2022). Low credibility.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) may present as a speech/language disorder (PSP-SL).

- **Objective**: We assessed pathological correlates of patients with PSP-SL who retained the suggestive of PSP-SL (s.o. PSP-SL) diagnosis versus those who progressed to possible/probable (poss./prob.) PSP.

- **Methods**: Thirty-four prospectively recruited patients with s.o. PSP-SL completed comprehensive speech/language and neurological assessments longitudinally, died, and underwent autopsy.

- **Results**: Twelve patients (35%) evolved to poss./prob. PSP, while 22 (65%) remained as s.o. PSP-SL. Pathological diagnoses differed across the groups (P = 0.025). Patients with s.o. PSP-SL had four different neuropathologies: corticobasal degeneration (59%), PSP (13%), Pick's disease (14%), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 (14%). All patients with poss./prob. PSP had a 4R-tauopathy, consisting of PSP (67%) and corticobasal degeneration (33%). The development of poss./prob. PSP increased the chance of having PSP pathology by 2.38 times.

- **Conclusions**: PSP-SL is associated with heterogeneous pathologies. Evolution of PSP-SL into poss./prob. PSP is more predictive of underlying PSP pathology than s.o. PSP-SL.

### Combined assessment of function and survival to demonstrate the effect of treatment on progressive supranuclear palsy [^113RpB9r]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder for which there are currently no disease-modifying treatments. Recent trials of potential therapies had durations of 12 months, which may be insufficient because of nonrandom missingness due to death. Longer durations, incorporating the PSP Rating Scale and survival, can reduce the potential for type II error. Selecting efficacy measures more sensitive to disease modification may facilitate identification of treatment effect.

- **Objective**: The objective of this study was to evaluate the simulated phase 3 PSP trial assessing the effect of a disease-modifying intervention on a novel combined primary endpoint comprising function (PSP Rating Scale) and survival, the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS), and to determine operating characteristics of the CAFS.

- **Methods**: To simulate PSP progression in the trial population, we developed models of the PSP Rating Scale and survival using data from published clinical studies. These models were used to define operating characteristics of the CAFS for use in a phase 3 trial.

- **Results**: The sample size determined (N = 384; 1:1 randomization) would provide > 80% power to detect significant treatment effects on the CAFS compared with placebo. The CAFS provides good operating characteristics and increased power to detect moderate treatment effects on the PSP Rating Scale. We propose a trial design allowing potential detection of treatment effects at a preplanned interim analysis after participants complete 12 months of treatment.

### F-florzolotau PET imaging captures the distribution patterns and regional vulnerability of tau pathology in progressive supranuclear palsy [^113vzFnZ]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2023). High credibility.

Consistent results were found when dividing the PSP-non-RS group into subgroups according to disease phenotypes, such as PSP with predominant gait freezing (PSP-PGF) and PSP with predominant parkinsonism (PSP-P), and comparing each phenotype individually with PSP-RS. No significant differences were seen between patients with PSP-PGF and PSP-P. Details are shown in Supplementary Table 2–3 and Supplementary Figure 1.

- **Figure 3: Heat maps** for the individual distribution of 18 F-florzolotau SUVR Z scores in different PSP phenotypes, with the highest values being observed for the PSP-RS group. The distribution of 18 F-florzolotau retention was found to follow the patterns of tau pathology described in previous post-mortem studies (Supplementary Figure 2). The abbreviations used include PSP for progressive supranuclear palsy, PSP-RS for progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson's syndrome, PSP-non-RS for other PSP subtypes except for progressive supranuclear palsy-Richardson's syndrome, PSP-PGF for progressive supranuclear palsy with predominant gait freezing, S.o. PSP for suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy, and WM for white matter. The color bar indicates SUVR Z scores.

### MM2 subtype of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease may underlie the clinical presentation of progressive supranuclear palsy [^112pC9dS]. Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

The classical presentation of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) is rapid progressive dementia, often associated with myoclonus and ataxia, followed by death in less than a year from diagnosis. The few patients in the literature who presented with parkinsonism and were suspected to have progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) all experienced a malignant course, with most dying within three years of diagnosis.

We screened the Queen Square Brain Bank database and, among 213 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PSP, found ten patients with disease duration of three years or less, including one patient with CJD pathology. We report this patient and review other similar cases from the literature. Ten additional cases with similar presentation were identified in the literature. The mean disease duration was 24.2 months.

- **Clinical presentation**: These patients typically exhibited early falls, prominent dementia, early vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, and symmetric akinetic syndrome.

In the patients who were subtyped at post-mortem, all four represented the MM2 subtype of sCJD. A rapidly progressive course of PSP with early falls, cognitive impairments, and vertical supranuclear gaze palsy should raise suspicion of underlying sCJD pathology, regardless of the absence of supportive findings on ancillary tests. This case and the literature support the notion that biochemical properties of the prion protein can influence the clinical presentation of sCJD.

### Clinical conditions "suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy"-diagnostic performance [^116uaSx4]. Movement Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Positive predictive value of MDS-PSP and NINDS-SPSP criteria: PPVs for the MDS-PSP and the NINDS-SPSP criteria as a function of disease duration are displayed in Figure 1C. The PPV for s.o. PSP starts at 73% in the first year and continuously declines to 63.6% in the third year, 48.5% in the ninth year, and 32.7% at the end of the record. Possible and probable PSP combined according to the MDS-PSP criteria had a PPV of 87.5% in the first year, increasing to 91% in the third year before decreasing again to 81% in the ninth year and ending at 81.8% at the end of the record. The NINDS-SPSP criteria, which are defined by a possible and probable PSP category, rise in PPV from 78.3% in the first year to 86.4% in the third year. They then fluctuate from 85.4% in the sixth year to 86.5% in the ninth year, returning to 86.4% at the end of the record. The overall PPV of the MDS-PSP criteria was 76.2% in the first year, 71.6% in the third, 64.7% in the ninth year, and 60.8% at the end of the record.

- **Effect of the exclusion criteria on the positive predictive value**: We also analyzed the effect of the exclusion criteria on the PPV (Figure 1C vs. Supplementary Figure S1C). With the omission of the exclusion criteria, PPV was reduced for all patient groups of our cohort in every year and for both the MDS-PSP and the NINDS-SPSP criteria.

### Management of Bell's palsy [^113HC6M5]. Australian Prescriber (2017). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Bell's palsy:

- **Definition**: Bell's palsy, also known as idiopathic facial paralysis, is an acute-onset, isolated, unilateral lower motor neuron facial weakness or paralysis.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact cause of Bell's palsy is unknown; however, reactivation of the herpes virus at the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve has been postulated.

- **Disease course**: The likely vascular distension, inflammation, and edema with ischemia of the facial nerve results in Bell's palsy. It presents with clinical manifestations of unilateral weakness or paralysis of the upper and lower facial muscles, drooping of ipsilateral eyelids, dry eye due to an inability to close eyes completely, epiphora, drooping of the corner of the mouth, ipsilateral impaired or loss of taste sensation, difficulty in eating, dribbling of saliva, altered sensation on the affected side of the face, pain in or behind the ear, and hyperacusis on the affected side if the stapedius muscle is involved. Spontaneous complete recovery occurs in 70–75% of untreated patients.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Bell's palsy is not associated with an increased risk of mortality.

### Imaging measures predict progression in progressive supranuclear palsy [^114zRDKP]. Movement Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

The objective of this work was to determine whether the progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale, a measure of disease severity, is associated with neuroanatomical changes in progressive supranuclear palsy.

- **Methods**: We recruited 22 subjects with probable progressive supranuclear palsy who completed the progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale at two time points. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Associations were assessed between whole brain volume, ventricular volume, midbrain area, and superior cerebellar peduncle fractional anisotropy, as well as the baseline/change of the progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale.

- **Results**: Superior cerebellar peduncle fractional anisotropy correlated with the total score and gait/midline subscore of the progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale. Whole brain volume, midbrain area, and disease duration predicted subsequent changes over time in the gait/midline subscore of the progressive supranuclear palsy rating scale.

- **Conclusions**: Imaging measures could be useful to help predict clinical progression in subjects with progressive supranuclear palsy.

### Exercise and physical activity for people with progressive supranuclear palsy: A systematic review [^114tRo7Q]. Clinical Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Whether progressive resistance strength training is beneficial for people with progressive supranuclear palsy has not been reported, even though it has strong evidence of benefit in other chronic neurological conditions such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson's disease. The effectiveness of falls education for people with progressive supranuclear palsy and their caregivers has not been documented despite established benefit for people living with Parkinson's disease.

There is a need for randomized controlled trials that systematically evaluate the effects of auditory and visual cues on movement and the performance of structured physical activities for people with progressive supranuclear palsy. Similarly, whether walking programs, aquatic therapy, and cycling are beneficial in progressive supranuclear palsy is not known. There is also a need to understand if complementary therapies such as music therapy, dancing, boxing, tai chi, Pilates, and yoga are helpful. Future trials need to control for progressive supranuclear palsy medications and the stage of disease progression when evaluating the relative benefits of exercise therapies, as well as explore the facilitators and barriers to activity engagement.

For individuals in the early stages of progressive supranuclear palsy, conclusive evidence was not found to demonstrate strong or sustained effects of therapeutic exercises. Some gains in walking speed and quality were associated with music-cued movement rehabilitation, weight-supported treadmill training, and robotic rehabilitation.

### Progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome and semantic dementia in neuropathologically proven Lewy body disease: A report of two cases [^112aCUZD]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

The impact of neuropathological lesions on the clinical symptoms and progression of Lewy body disease (LBD) remains unclear. To address this issue, we describe two illustrative cases of autopsy-proven LBD that presented atypical phenotypes of progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome and semantic dementia. Postmortem examination revealed diffuse LBD with massive brainstem involvement in case 1, whereas Lewy bodies predominated in the amygdala and neocortex in case 2. Alzheimer's disease pathology was present in both cases, and TDP-43 inclusions were noted in case 2. These cases illustrate two contrasted clinical presentations and highlight the heterogeneity within the underlying proteinopathies of neurodegenerative diseases.

### Clinical and neuroanatomical signatures of tissue pathology in frontotemporal lobar degeneration [^11197fw5]. Brain (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical syndromes associated with histopathological features in this series are summarized below.

Presentations with the behavioral variant of frontotemporal degeneration (FTD) were observed in association with all pathologies except TDP-C, TDP-B, which is associated with FTD-MND, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Semantic dementia was associated with TDP-C pathology in 19 of 23 cases (83%); the remaining four patients had Pick's disease. The presence of acalculia, not referenced in consensus criteria for semantic dementia, appeared to be associated with underlying Pick's pathology, as observed in three of four patients who exhibited acalculia.

Progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) was a presentation of tau pathologies in 7 of 10 cases (70%): three patients had Pick's disease, four had corticobasal degeneration, and orofacial apraxia developed only in patients with tau pathologies. Presentation with corticobasal syndrome was associated with tau pathologies, such as corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, or MAPT mutation, in four of five cases; the remaining patient had TDP-A pathology associated with a GRN mutation. Progressive supranuclear palsy syndrome was associated with tau pathology in all six cases; five patients had progressive supranuclear palsy pathology, while the remaining patient had corticobasal degeneration pathology. FTD-MND was associated with TDP-43 pathology in all four cases; three patients had TDP-B pathology, and the remaining patient had TDP-A pathology. Certain clinical features were observed.

### Neurophysiological consequences of synapse loss in progressive supranuclear palsy [^111btuTW]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Synaptic loss occurs early in many neurodegenerative diseases and contributes to cognitive impairment even in the absence of gross atrophy. Currently, there are few formal models for human disease to explain how cortical networks underlying cognition are affected by synaptic loss. We advocate that biophysical models of neurophysiology offer both a bridge from preclinical to clinical models of pathology and quantitative assays for experimental medicine. Such biophysical models can also disclose hidden neuronal dynamics generating neurophysiological observations such as EEG and magnetoencephalography.

Here, we augment a biophysically informed mesoscale model of human cortical function by including synaptic density estimates as captured by 11 C-UCB-J PET, providing insights into how regional synapse loss affects neurophysiology. We use the primary tauopathy of progressive supranuclear palsy (Richardson's syndrome) as an exemplar condition, with high clinicopathological correlations. Progressive supranuclear palsy causes a marked change in cortical neurophysiology in the presence of mild cortical atrophy and is associated with a decline in cognitive functions linked to the frontal lobe.

Using parametric empirical Bayesian inversion of a conductance-based canonical microcircuit model of magnetoencephalography data, we show that including regional synaptic density — as a subject-specific prior on laminar-specific neuronal populations — markedly increases model evidence. Specifically, model comparison suggests that a reduction in synaptic density in inferio

### Key emerging issues in progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration [^111FLRV9]. Journal of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

It has been approximately 50 years since neurologists were introduced to the entities "progressive supranuclear palsy" and "corticobasal degeneration". Since the two seminal publications, there have been significant advancements in our understanding of these two neurodegenerative diseases, particularly the fact that both are associated with tau proteins.

Recent advances over the past 3 years that are notable to the field are discussed in this review, covering clinical diagnosis, pathological features, neuroimaging and CSF biomarkers, genetic associations, and clinical trials related to progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration.

### Magnetic resonance imaging lesion pattern in Guadeloupean parkinsonism is distinct from progressive supranuclear palsy [^115ZpHqi]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

In the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe, patients with atypical parkinsonism develop a progressive supranuclear palsy-like syndrome, named Guadeloupean parkinsonism. Unlike the classical forms of progressive supranuclear palsy, these patients experience hallucinations and myoclonus. The lesions associated with Guadeloupean parkinsonism are poorly characterized, and it is not known to what extent they differ from progressive supranuclear palsy. The aim of the present study was to determine the structural and metabolic profiles of Guadeloupean parkinsonism compared with progressive supranuclear palsy and controls using combined structural and diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

We included nine patients with Guadeloupean parkinsonism, ten with progressive supranuclear palsy, and nine age-matched controls. Magnetic resonance imaging examination was performed at 1.5 T and included 3D T(1)-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, diffusion tensor imaging, and single voxel magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the lenticular nucleus. Images were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry, voxel-based diffusion tensor imaging, and brainstem region of interest measurements.

In patients with Guadeloupean parkinsonism, structural and diffusion changes predominated in the temporal and occipital lobes, the limbic areas (medial temporal, orbitofrontal, and cingulate cortices), and the cerebellum. In contrast, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy showed structural changes primarily in the midbrain and basal ganglia, with diffusion abnormalities predominating in those areas.

### Combined assessment of function and survival to demonstrate the effect of treatment on progressive supranuclear palsy [^115trAEY]. Movement Disorders (2025). Low credibility.

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disorder for which there are currently no disease-modifying treatments. Recent trials of potential therapies have had durations of 12 months, which may be insufficient due to nonrandom missingness caused by death. Longer durations, incorporating the PSP Rating Scale and survival, can reduce the potential for type II error. Choosing efficacy measures more sensitive to disease modification may facilitate the identification of treatment effects.

The objective of this study was to evaluate a simulated phase 3 PSP trial assessing the effect of a disease-modifying intervention on a novel combined primary endpoint that includes function (PSP Rating Scale) and survival, known as the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS). Additionally, the study aimed to determine the operating characteristics of the CAFS.

To simulate PSP progression in the trial population, models of the PSP Rating Scale and survival were developed using data from published clinical studies. These models were employed to define the operating characteristics of the CAFS for use in a phase 3 trial.

The determined sample size (N = 384; 1:1 randomization) would provide more than 80% power to detect significant treatment effects on the CAFS compared with placebo. The CAFS demonstrates good operating characteristics and increased power to detect moderate treatment effects on the PSP Rating Scale. We propose a trial design allowing potential detection of treatment effects at a preplanned interim analysis after participants complete 12 months of treatment.

### N-terminal and mid-region tau fragments as fluid biomarkers in neurological diseases [^111a7AV9]. Brain (2022). Low credibility.

All CSF t-tau biomarkers were low in progressive supranuclear palsy, with concentrations being similar to the controls (P > 0.12 for all assays; Figure 5A). The median fold changes versus controls were similar and less than 1 for all t-tau assays (P = 0.076; Supplementary Table 6), and none of the t-tau and p-tau assays discriminated progressive supranuclear palsy from controls (AUCs 51–64% for all; Figure 5B). NTA and NTB t-tau also displayed very strong positive correlations with each other in progressive supranuclear palsy (rₛ = 0.83, P < 0.0001), and moderate to strong positive correlations with Innotest and MR t-tau (rₛ = 0.47−0.62, P ≤ 0.059; Figure 5C). There was no association between the N-t-tau and N-p-tau concentrations in progressive supranuclear palsy (rₛ = −0.21 to 0.41, P ≥ 0.10).

### Tau seeds from patients induce progressive supranuclear palsy pathology and symptoms in primates [^1124c6HF]. Brain (2023). High credibility.

Progressive supranuclear palsy is a primary tauopathy affecting both neurons and glia and is responsible for both motor and cognitive symptoms. Recently, it has been suggested that progressive supranuclear palsy tauopathy may spread in the brain from cell to cell in a 'prion-like' manner. However, direct experimental evidence of this phenomenon and its consequences on brain functions is still lacking in primates. In this study, we first derived sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions from post-mortem brains of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. We also isolated the same fraction from age-matched control brains. Compared to control extracts, the in vitro characterization of progressive supranuclear palsy-tau fractions demonstrated a high seeding activity in P301S-tau expressing cells, displaying after incubation abnormally phosphorylated (AT8- and AT100-positivity), misfolded, filamentous (pentameric formyl thiophene acetic acid positive), and sarkosyl-insoluble tau.

We bilaterally injected two male rhesus macaques in the supranigral area with this fraction of progressive supranuclear palsy-tau proteopathic seeds and two other macaques with the control fraction. The quantitative analysis of kinematic features revealed that progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques exhibited symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism as early as 6 months after injection, remaining present until euthanasia at 18 months. An object retrieval task showed the progressive appearance of a significant dysexecutive syndrome in progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques compared to controls.

### Diagnosis across the spectrum of progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome [^114BU6PX]. JAMA Neurology (2020). Low credibility.

The PROSPECT study's multimodal assessment of clinical, cognitive, fluid, genetic, and imaging data has identified markers that enable the differentiation of PD from PSP and CBS. In addition, we present confirmatory data on the changes across modalities in classical phenotypes of PSP and CBS and evaluate biomarkers of variant PSP syndromes included in the most recent diagnostic criteria and in a distinct biomarker-defined CBS-AD syndrome. These findings may enhance the early diagnosis of PSP and CBS for accurate prognostication and stratification of patients for clinical trials.

### Clinical conditions "suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy"-diagnostic performance [^111D371Q]. Movement Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

Our study shows that the novel concept of s.o. PSP contributes to the increased sensitivity of the MDS-PSP criteria for antemortem PSP diagnosis compared to the NINDS-SPSP criteria in our cohort. The majority of PSP patients in our cohort passed through the state of s.o. PSP diagnosis (57%) and evolved to a higher level of diagnostic certainty antemortem (66%). Among those that evolved to probable or possible PSP in our cohort, the average time PSP patients spent with a diagnosis of s.o. PSP before evolving was 3.6 years. However, as the prevalence of PSP in our cohort is much higher than in the average neurological clinic population, further investigation with a more representative population should be assessed in future projects. S.o. PSP showed high specificity in the first 3 years of disease, declining with increasing disease duration. Application of the MDS-PSP criteria for s.o. PSP reduced the time to diagnosis by 1.6 years from 3.8 to 2.2 years on average. When compared to the NINDS-SPSP criteria, the overall time to diagnosis was reduced from 4.0 years (NINDS-SPSP) to 2.2 years (MDS-PSP).

In total, 57% (N = 116) of all PSP patients in our cohort received a diagnosis of s.o. PSP at any time until the end of record, 69.8% (N = 81) of these cases within the first year after symptom onset and 86.2% (N = 100) within the first 3 years after symptom onset. Hence, s.o. PSP is essential to identify prospective PSP patients at an early disease stage and should play an important role in future research projects, such as clinical trials with disease-modifying therapy.

### The genetic and clinico-pathological profile of early-onset progressive supranuclear palsy [^11389gmr]. Movement Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The final clinical profile of early-onset progressive supranuclear palsy (EOPSP) closely resembled that of late-onset progressive supranuclear palsy (LOPSP) and mirrored previous studies, which have shown that initial non–Richardson's syndrome (RS) phenotypes come to resemble RS in the latter stages of the disease. As we move into a new era of potential anti-tau therapies, early and accurate distinction between progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Parkinson's disease (PD) will become increasingly important. Therefore, we explored the value of a PSP genetic risk score (GRS) and found that, at the group level, EOPSP and LOPSP z-scores were significantly higher in comparison with PD.

In the absence of an identified genetic mutation, the biological drivers of early-onset presentations of neurodegenerative diseases such as PSP are likely to be multifactorial. We explored the potential etiological roles of encephalitis and head injury and found no significant differences in rates between EOPSP and LOPSP.

### Social cognitive deficits and their neural correlates in progressive supranuclear palsy [^111zu8x9]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Progressive supranuclear palsy impaired the recognition of multiple emotions in the auditory (vocal) domain. In contrast to the deficits in the recognition of most emotions, happiness recognition was preserved. This might be because happiness is a positive emotion, the others being either negative (anger, disgust, sadness, fear) or intermediate (surprise). It may also have been a ceiling effect, as happiness is least often confused with the other emotions when using visual stimuli and is more readily recognized than the other basic emotions in health. Nonetheless, the preservation of happiness recognition provides additional evidence that the patients understood the tasks and were able to respond appropriately.

Progressive supranuclear palsy also impaired the TASIT theory of mind task.

- **Sincere statements**: Patients did not have difficulties interpreting sincere statements, suggesting that they understood the task, were able to engage with it, and could manage its demands on working memory.

- **Sarcastic statements**: However, they found the sarcastic statements difficult, particularly the paradoxical sarcasm. This suggests that they were unable to interpret the mental state of the protagonists in the video and have a theory of mind deficit.

Is there a role for executive dysfunction in the social cognition deficits? Some have argued that they are independent, while others have proposed that executive function is necessary to understand theory of mind tests. To investigate this in our group, we used the Brixton test of executive function as it is a non-motor and untimed test.

- **Traumatic and structural causes**: ocular trauma, pituitary apoplexy, exophthalmos

- **Specific conditions**: progressive external ophthalmoplegia, Parinaud ophthalmoplegia

In addition, external ophthalmoplegia can be caused by medications such as propofol.

### Neuroimaging correlates of blinking abnormalities in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy [^112RxpZM]. Movement Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

We aimed to identify the possible relationship between blinking abnormalities and neuroimaging changes in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. We studied 18 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and 13 healthy subjects. Voluntary and spontaneous blinking were recorded using kinematic techniques. Changes in brain structures were detected by T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry. We then sought possible correlations between blinking and neuroimaging abnormalities in patients.

Kinematic analysis indicated several abnormalities during voluntary blinking and a markedly reduced spontaneous blink rate in patients compared with healthy subjects. Neuroimaging showed gray matter loss in cortical and subcortical structures and lower white matter volume in the brainstem. Gray matter loss in subcortical structures correlated with the prolonged pause duration between the closing and opening phases during voluntary blinking.

This study provides a more specific insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying blinking abnormalities in progressive supranuclear palsy.

### Validation of the movement disorder society criteria for the diagnosis of 4-repeat tauopathies [^117NWLx9]. Movement Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The Movement Disorder Society criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy introduced the category "probable 4-repeat (4R)-tauopathy" for the joint clinical diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration.

- **Objectives**: To validate the accuracy of these clinical criteria for "probable 4R-tauopathy" to predict underlying 4R-tauopathy pathology.

- **Methods**: Diagnostic accuracy for 4R-tauopathies according to the established criteria was estimated retrospectively in autopsy-confirmed patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration (grouped as 4R-tauopathies), and Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (grouped as non-4R-tauopathies).

- **Results**: We identified 250 cases with progressive supranuclear palsy (N = 195) and corticobasal degeneration (N = 55) and non-4R-tauopathies (N = 161). Sensitivity and specificity of "probable 4R-tauopathy" were 10% and 99% in the first year and 59% and 88% at the final record.

- **Conclusions**: The new diagnostic category "probable 4R-tauopathy" showed high specificity and may be suitable for the recruitment of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration into therapeutic trials targeting 4R-tauopathy. The low sensitivity underpins the need for diagnostic biomarkers.

### The impact of neuropsychiatric symptoms in perceived quality of life in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy [^111auUQR]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: We included 40 patients meeting criteria for probable PSP, who were assessed at the Rossy Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Centre in Toronto Western Hospital, Canada, between 2020 and 2023. The Rossy Progressive Supranuclear Palsy Centre was established in 2020, and patients are enrolled in a clinical research program as previously described. Demographic and clinical data were collected at baseline and during 6‐month follow‐ups.

- **Subjects**: Inclusion criteria for this study were a clinical diagnosis of probable PSP based on the MDS criteria and having completed a QoL questionnaire. Thirty‐seven of the patients met the criteria for PSP‐Richardson Syndrome. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board of the University Health Network, and written consent was obtained from all participants.

### Social cognitive deficits and their neural correlates in progressive supranuclear palsy [^113BG7W5]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

For higher-order aspects of social cognition, including empathy and theory of mind, a frontotemporal cortical network has been implicated that includes regions affected by progressive supranuclear palsy pathology. For example, the inferior frontal gyrus, together with components of the emotional network, has been linked to emotional empathy — the ability to 'feel' the emotion of others. This may be mediated by its putative role in the mirror neuron system. Such 'emotional empathy' can be contrasted with 'cognitive empathy', the determination of what others think, feel, or intend without necessarily sharing the 'feeling'.
On the basis of this prior knowledge of the functional anatomy of social cognition, one can use a region of interest approach to increase the sensitivity and localization of pathological changes correlated with empathy. It can be difficult to isolate empathic aspects of the task and control for the mode of testing (e.g. videos versus cartoons). However, there is a consensus that cognitive empathy is associated with the medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, posterior superior temporal sulcus, the temporoparietal junction, and striatum. Of these, the correlation with the medial prefrontal cortex is most consistent. Therefore, it is relevant that with progressive supranuclear palsy, the foci of cerebral atrophy and highest pathological burden overlap with these regions associated with social cognition, especially in the frontal areas.

Based on these associations between structure, function, and pathology, we formed three…

### Hypokinesia without decrement distinguishes progressive supranuclear palsy from Parkinson's disease [^1127kmRz]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

Repetitive finger tapping is commonly used to assess bradykinesia in Parkinson's disease. The Queen Square Brain Bank diagnostic criterion of Parkinson's disease defines bradykinesia as "slowness of initiation with progressive reduction in speed and amplitude of repetitive action". Although progressive supranuclear palsy is considered an atypical parkinsonian syndrome, it is not known whether patients with progressive supranuclear palsy have criteria-defined bradykinesia.

This study objectively assessed repetitive finger tap performance and handwriting in patients with Parkinson's disease (n = 15), progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 9), and healthy age- and gender-matched controls (n = 16). The motion of the hand and digits was recorded in 3D during 15-second repetitive index finger-to-thumb tapping trials. The main finding was hypokinesia without decrement in patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, which differed from the finger tap pattern in Parkinson's disease.

Average finger separation amplitude in progressive supranuclear palsy was less than half of that in controls and Parkinson's disease (P < 0.001 in both cases). Change in tap amplitude over consecutive taps was computed by linear regression. The average amplitude slope in progressive supranuclear palsy was nearly zero (0.01°/cycle), indicating a lack of decrement, which differed from the negative slope in patients with Parkinson's disease off levodopa (-0.20°/cycle, P = 0.002). "Hypokinesia", defined as less than 50% of the control group's mean amplitude, combined with "absence of decrement", defined as mean positive amplitude slope.

### Long-duration progressive supranuclear palsy: Clinical course and pathological underpinnings [^117PGbfJ]. Annals of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

The study aimed to identify the clinical characteristics of the subgroup of benign progressive supranuclear palsy with particularly long disease duration and to define neuropathological determinants underlying variability in disease duration in progressive supranuclear palsy. Clinical and pathological features were compared among 186 autopsy-confirmed cases with progressive supranuclear palsy, distinguished by survival times of ten or more years and shorter durations.

The results indicated that 45 cases, representing 24.2%, had a disease duration of ten or more years. The only significant independent clinical predictor of longer survival was the absence of ocular motor abnormalities within the first three years from disease onset. Histopathologically, the neurodegeneration parameters in each survival group were paralleled anatomically by the distribution of neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions. In contrast, tufted astrocytes displayed an anatomically opposite severity pattern. Notably, a significantly lower presence of coiled bodies was found in those who survived longer, as opposed to patients with a less favorable course.

The interpretation indicates that a considerable proportion of patients had a more "benign" disease course with a survival of ten or more years, exhibiting a distinct pattern and evolution of core symptoms compared to patients with shorter survival. The inverted anatomical patterns of astrocytic tau distribution suggest distinct implications for these cell types in the trans-cellular propagation of the disease. The tempo of disease progression seemed mostly determined by oligodendroglial tau, with a high degree of oligodendroglial tau pathology potentially affecting neuronal integrity and…

### Energy expenditure, body composition and dietary habits in progressive supranuclear palsy [^115sqRsf]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Low credibility.

Little is known about metabolic changes in progressive supranuclear palsy. The goals of the present study are to: (1) investigate whether early progressive supranuclear palsy is associated with changes in energy expenditure, body composition, and dietary intake compared with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls; (2) assess the accuracy of the Harris-Benedict equation in predicting measured rest energy expenditure in progressive supranuclear palsy; (3) verify differences according to sex, phenotypes, disease severity, and presence of dysphagia in progressive supranuclear palsy.

- **Methods**: Twenty-one participants with progressive supranuclear palsy, 41 with Parkinson's disease, and nine healthy controls were included. Rest energy expenditure was assessed with an indirect calorimeter, body composition with bio-impedance analysis, and physical activity and dietary intake were estimated with a validated frequency questionnaire. Parametric testing was used to analyze differences between groups.

- **Results**: Progressive supranuclear palsy showed reduced total daily energy expenditure and physical activity compared to both other cohorts (p < 0.05). Limited accuracy was shown for the Harris-Benedict equation (accurate prediction frequency < 60%). Greater disease severity was associated with lower rest energy expenditure (p = 0.030), fat-free mass (p = 0.026), and muscle mass (p = 0.029).

- **Conclusion**: Greater disease severity is associated with a reduction in rest energy expenditure, likely due to the reduction in lean mass and muscle mass.

### Clinical conditions "suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy" - diagnostic performance [^116P11Hu]. Movement Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

In summary, this study describes the characteristics and clinical evolution of patients diagnosed with s.o. PSP. It highlights the considerable value of s.o. PSP in identifying patients in their early clinical course who evolve to develop possible or probable PSP and are likely to have underlying PSP pathology. Recognition of clinical conditions s.o. PSP reduces the time to first PSP diagnosis by 1.6 years on average. PSP patients remained with a diagnosis of s.o. PSP for 3.6 years on average before evolving to a higher level of diagnostic certainty. With the ultimate goal to deliver disease-modifying therapies within the earliest clinical course, it will be of high importance to further characterize patients with s.o. PSP in a prospective, real-life clinical setting and to identify biomarkers to increase the specificity of PSP or 4R-tauopathy diagnosis early on. The limitations of this study arise mainly from its retrospective nature, use of the development cohort for validation, and focus on those with known neuropathology rather than prospective cases in community or healthcare settings. Thus, prospective validation of the diagnosis of s.o. PSP will be mandatory to verify our results.

### Clinical conditions "suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy"-diagnostic performance [^111YBTuR]. Movement Disorders (2020). Low credibility.

The Movement Disorder Society diagnostic criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy introduced the diagnostic certainty level "suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy" for clinical conditions with subtle signs suggestive of the disease. This category aims at the early identification of patients in whom the diagnosis may be confirmed as the disease evolves.

- **Objective**: To assess the diagnostic performance of the defined clinical conditions suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy in an autopsy-confirmed cohort.

- **Methods**: Diagnostic performance of the criteria was analyzed based on retrospective clinical data of 204 autopsy-confirmed patients with progressive supranuclear palsy and 216 patients with other neurological diseases.

- **Results**: The conditions suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy strongly increased the sensitivity compared to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the Society for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy criteria. Within the first year after symptom onset, 40% of patients with definite progressive supranuclear palsy fulfilled criteria for suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy. Two-thirds of patients suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy evolved into probable progressive supranuclear palsy after an average of 3.6 years. Application of the criteria for suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy reduced the average time to diagnosis from 3.8 to 2.2 years.

- **Conclusions**: Clinical conditions suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy allow earlier identification of patients likely to evolve into clinical conditions associated with progressive supranuclear palsy.

### Diagnosis across the spectrum of progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal syndrome [^116DptgR]. JAMA Neurology (2020). High credibility.

We analyzed 222 cases with atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS) consisting of 93 female [41.9%] and 129 male [58.1%] participants, with a mean [SD] age at recruitment of 68.3 [8.7] years. Additionally, we included 76 controls and 1967 cases with Parkinson's disease (PD). At study entry, the application of clinical diagnostic criteria, including the NINDS-SPSP PSP criteria, identified 58 cases with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 55 cases with multiple system atrophy (MSA), 55 cases with corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and 54 indeterminate (IDT) cases.

Reclassification was possible after the publication of the 2017 Movement Disorder Society (MDS) PSP criteria, resulting in 101 cases with PSP, 55 cases with MSA, 40 cases with CBS, and 26 IDT cases. Notably, 15 of the CBS cases were reclassified as PSP-CBS overlap under the MDS PSP diagnostic criteria due to slowed vertical saccades and/or vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, both associated with underlying PSP pathological findings. In total, 17 of the 40 reclassified CBS cases (42.5%) had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection, of which 8 (47.1%) exhibited an Alzheimer disease (AD)-like CSF profile.

The following disease groups were defined: PSP-Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS), PSP-subcortical (including PSP-parkinsonism, PSP-purely genetic form [PSP-PGF], and PSP–oculomotor predominant subtypes), PSP-cortical (consisting of PSP-CBS overlap and PSP-frontal subtypes), MSA-parkinsonism, MSA-cerebellar, CBS-unknown, CBS-4-repeat tau (CBS-4RT), CBS-AD, and IDT.

### Association between semantic dementia and progressive supranuclear palsy [^111d3dFN]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2019). Low credibility.

Cognitive change is an integral part of PSPs and may precede physical symptoms. The present case is, however, unusual. SD is typically associated with TDP-43 and PSPs with tau pathology, so their co-occurrence would not a priori be predicted. To our knowledge, a mixed SD/PSPs phenotype has been previously reported only once, without supportive neuropsychological or pathological data, although impaired semantic test performance has been described.

In the present case, two underlying pathologies were identified, with differing distributions within the brain that mapped, respectively, onto the physical and cognitive disorder: tau pathology conforming to PSP in midbrain structures and TDP-43 in the temporal cortex. Interestingly, the TDP-43 pathology, characterized by neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions (NCI), short neuritic profiles, and small, granular NCI in dentate gyrus granule cells, conformed to TDP-43 subtype A, which is typically associated with nfPPA and some cases of bvFTD. SD is usually associated with type C pathology, consisting of sparse NCI but frequent long, neuritic profiles within the temporal cortex and more rounded, solid NCI, reminiscent of Pick bodies, in dentate gyrus granule cells. Thus, the TDP-43 pathological characteristics differ from those of prototypical SD.

Limited TDP-43 pathology, closely resembling FTLD-type subtype A, is present in many neurodegenerative disorders and has generally been considered a 'secondary' change. The present case challenges that assumption. Clinically, the patient's cognitive and physical disorders showed different trajectories.

### Social cognitive deficits and their neural correlates in progressive supranuclear palsy [^1123ggAQ]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

When progressive supranuclear palsy was first described, a set of characteristic features were identified that remain the principal diagnostic criteria: vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and postural instability with falls. Generally, patients also exhibit akinetic rigidity and progressive dysarthria and dysphagia. However, significant cognitive problems are common, including apathy and a dysexecutive syndrome, as well as psychiatric comorbidities such as depression or anxiety. Half of the patients also report social impairments as a negative influence on their quality of life.

We recently reported deficits in basic emotion recognition in progressive supranuclear palsy, proposing that these are part of a wider deficit in social cognition that may contribute to common difficulties in social interactions. Social cognition is not a unitary phenomenon; on one level, it requires the ability to recognize basic emotions (e.g. happy, sad, angry, disgust, and surprise), known as 'emotion knowledge'. It also encompasses an appreciation of more complicated emotions (e.g. sarcasm and humor) and higher-order social inferences, which require a greater understanding and representation of other people's mental states in a given context, known as 'Theory of Mind'.
Several neurological disorders affect social cognition, including emotion recognition and theory of mind. These include not only progressive supranuclear palsy but also behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease.

### Toward future therapies in progressive supranuclear palsy [^113Cyrnv]. Movement Disorders (2005). Low credibility.

There is a stern therapeutic challenge for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) that has not yet been met. The lack of randomized, controlled trials and negative outcomes from the vast majority of studies make it impossible to set therapeutic standards, or to give clear recommendations. We review progress at the time of writing in this area and briefly consider future potential therapeutic strategies.

### Neuroimaging comparison of primary progressive apraxia of speech and progressive supranuclear palsy [^116nyQSc]. European Journal of Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Primary progressive apraxia of speech, a motor speech disorder of planning and programming, is a tauopathy that has overlapping histological features with progressive supranuclear palsy. We aimed to compare, for the first time, atrophy patterns, as well as white matter tract degeneration, between these two syndromes.

- **Methods**: Sixteen primary progressive apraxia of speech subjects were age- and gender-matched to 16 progressive supranuclear palsy subjects and 20 controls. All subjects were prospectively recruited, underwent neurological and speech evaluations, and 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Grey and white matter atrophy was assessed using voxel-based morphometry and atlas-based parcellation, and white matter tract degeneration was assessed using diffusion tensor imaging.

- **Results**: All progressive supranuclear palsy subjects had typical oculomotor/gait impairments, but none had speech apraxia. Both syndromes showed grey matter loss in the supplementary motor area, white matter loss in the posterior frontal lobes, and degeneration of the body of the corpus callosum. Whilst lateral grey matter loss was focal, involving the superior premotor cortex in primary progressive apraxia of speech, loss was less focal, extending into the prefrontal cortex in progressive supranuclear palsy. Caudate volume loss and tract degeneration of superior cerebellar peduncles were also observed in progressive supranuclear palsy. Interestingly, the area of the midbrain was reduced in both syndromes compared to controls, although this reduction was greater in progressive supranuclear palsy.

### How to apply the Movement Disorder Society criteria for diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy [^117XmaHn]. Movement Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The Movement Disorder Society criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy define diagnostic allocations, stratified by certainty levels and clinical predominance types. We aimed to study the frequency of ambiguous multiple allocations and to develop rules to eliminate them.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively collected standardized clinical data by chart review in a multicenter cohort of autopsy-confirmed patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, to classify them by diagnostic certainty level and predominance type and to identify multiple allocations.

- **Results**: Comprehensive data were available from 195 patients. More than one diagnostic allocation occurred in 157 patients (80.5%). On average, 5.4 allocations were possible per patient. We developed four rules for Multiple Allocations eXtinction (MAX). They reduced the number of patients with multiple allocations to 22 (11.3%), and the allocations per patient to 1.1.

- **Conclusions**: The proposed MAX rules help to standardize the application of the Movement Disorder Society criteria for progressive supranuclear palsy .© 2019 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

### One decade ago, one decade ahead in progressive supranuclear palsy [^113QdxJn]. Movement Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Fifty-five years have passed since the first description of PSP, but it is in the last decade that there has been a revolutionary change in understanding both the clinical and pathophysiological aspects of this disease. Ten years ago, our knowledge about the clinical spectrum and pathophysiology of the disease was quite limited, and there was no credible clinical study on any drug treatment for this devastating disease. Today, we have discovered the wide clinical spectrum of PSP, leading to the development of new diagnostic criteria in 2017, aiming to diagnose the disease earlier and include more phenotypes in clinical studies.

Moreover, just over the past decade, numerous large, double-blind clinical trials with disease-modifying agents have been conducted, providing important novel insights into disease biomarkers and progression. These studies were possible because of gained novel insights into the pathophysiological processes of the disease and pave the way for the near future. In the next decade, we dare to predict the discovery of biomarkers for PSP, improvements in diagnosis using the new criteria in combination with these biomarkers, and ultimately the development of a neuroprotective therapy that could be applied to patients in a prodromal stage, sparing them from this devastating disorder.

### Social cognitive deficits and their neural correlates in progressive supranuclear palsy [^114kdnAg]. Brain (2012). Low credibility.

We have shown that progressive supranuclear palsy impairs the recognition of emotion and theory of mind. In addition to replicating grey and white matter atrophy patterns in progressive supranuclear palsy, we have found structural correlations with social cognition performance. Specifically, atrophy in the right inferior frontal gyrus correlated negatively with scores on both the voice emotion test and TASIT, and atrophy of the anterior rostral medial frontal cortex correlated with theory of mind impairments. These results, together with the preserved performance on control tasks, indicate a generic social cognition deficit due to progressive supranuclear palsy pathology in critical brain networks for social cognition.

Set in the context of previous research showing that 50% of patients complain of a negative impact on their quality of life due to social impairment, and research indicating that patients present with behavioural change including disinhibition and aggressiveness, a social cognition deficit should be considered by those managing and caring for patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. Greater acknowledgment of the patients' impaired ability to empathize with those around them may help to alleviate patient–carer relationship difficulties at a time when the patient needs them most.
