## Question

Should I adjust synthroid if the tsh is hight but the t4 is normal?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether to adjust Synthroid (levothyroxine) when TSH is high but free T4 is normal, and how to approach this. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether this is primary hypothyroidism versus central hypothyroidism. Then, I should verify the reliability of the labs and rule out assay interference or timing issues. Next, I will assess adherence and absorption, followed by evaluating the significance of an isolated high TSH with normal free T4. After that, I need to consider special populations like pregnancy, pediatrics, and the elderly. Finally, I will outline a decision framework and concrete actions, including when to adjust the dose and when to monitor instead, with appropriate follow-up intervals and safety checks [^116T6jdr] [^113SVBJx].

> Let me first confirm the clinical context, because the interpretation of a high TSH with normal free T4 hinges on whether this is primary hypothyroidism or central hypothyroidism; in primary disease, TSH is the primary biochemical target, whereas in central disease TSH is unreliable and free T4 should guide therapy, so I need to ensure we are not dealing with pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction before deciding to increase levothyroxine based on TSH alone [^116T6jdr] [^112GQShE] [^113m2fbv].

> Wait, let me verify the laboratory reliability before making any dose change; I should confirm whether the patient is taking biotin, which can artifactually alter TSH and T4 immunoassays, and I should ask the patient to stop biotin for at least 2 days before retesting, and I should also check whether the blood was drawn before the morning levothyroxine dose or at least 4 hours after, because post-dose sampling can transiently elevate free T4 and confound interpretation [^1156yKHH] [^116NZHCj].

> I need to check adherence and absorption next, since nonadherence and impaired bioavailability are the most common reasons for an elevated TSH despite seemingly adequate dosing; I should ask about missed doses, whether levothyroxine is taken fasting with water and separated from calcium, iron, PPIs, sucralfate, soy, or high-fiber foods, and whether there has been a recent switch in brand or formulation, because even small differences in bioequivalence can shift TSH by clinically meaningful amounts and warrant rechecking at steady state after any product change [^113XGvyo] [^116aZJ4Z] [^117LFNGB] [^113YhKa3].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; an isolated mildly elevated TSH with normal free T4 is often subclinical hypothyroidism, and I should confirm persistence on repeat testing in 3–6 months because many mild TSH elevations normalize spontaneously, and treatment decisions should integrate symptoms, cardiovascular risk, and pregnancy plans rather than TSH alone, with treatment generally considered when TSH is above 10 mIU/L or when there are symptoms, goiter, or pregnancy intentions [^116E5fuv] [^111CspHm] [^116fQeE3].

> Let me consider special populations carefully; in pregnancy, I should not wait to treat an elevated TSH, and I should increase the total weekly levothyroxine dose by about 30% as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, monitor TSH every 4 weeks, and aim for trimester-specific TSH targets because maternal-fetal outcomes depend on timely correction, whereas in older adults I should titrate more slowly and accept higher TSH targets to avoid overtreatment and atrial arrhythmias, and in pediatrics I should monitor both TSH and free T4 frequently given growth and neurodevelopmental stakes [^1179PXFb] [^115v7TfK] [^114q7F9o] [^117BXrkD].

> I should double-check for less common but important etiologies if the pattern remains discordant; a high TSH with normal or high T4 can reflect thyroid hormone resistance, a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, macro-TSH, or recent resumption of levothyroxine, so if these are suspected I need targeted evaluation before escalating therapy, and in central hypothyroidism I must not use TSH to titrate and instead target free T4 in the upper half of normal [^113XGvyo] [^112GQShE] [^113m2fbv].

> Now, I will outline the decision framework; if this is primary hypothyroidism with confirmed adherence and absorption, persistent TSH elevation above the reference range warrants a modest levothyroxine dose increase of about 12.5–25 mcg, whereas if TSH is only mildly elevated and the patient is asymptomatic, observation with repeat testing in 3–6 months is reasonable, and if central hypothyroidism is present, I should ignore TSH and adjust to keep free T4 in the upper half of normal, always reassessing 6–8 weeks after any change to allow steady state [^114BCykN] [^116T6jdr] [^112GQShE].

> But wait, what if the patient is already on a high dose and TSH remains high; I should verify again for adherence and absorption issues, consider switching to a liquid or soft-gel formulation to mitigate food and drug interactions, and in select cases consider supervised absorption testing or observed dosing strategies before further increasing the dose, because doses above 200 mcg/day are rarely required and very high requirements usually reflect nonadherence or malabsorption rather than true pharmacologic need [^116aZJ4Z] [^113XGvyo] [^112JE3rd].

> Next, I should review concrete actions; if I decide to adjust, I will increase by 12.5–25 mcg, reinforce administration technique, and recheck TSH and free T4 in 6–8 weeks, and if I choose to monitor, I will repeat TSH and free T4 in 3–6 months while addressing adherence and absorption, documenting symptoms and cardiovascular risk factors, and I will ensure any product switch is followed by repeat testing at steady state to avoid unrecognized under- or over-replacement [^114BCykN] [^117LFNGB] [^113YhKa3].

> In summary, yes, in primary hypothyroidism with confirmed adherence and absorption, a high TSH with normal free T4 generally indicates under-replacement and warrants a modest levothyroxine dose increase, but I need to ensure the diagnosis is correct, the labs are reliable, adherence and absorption are optimized, and special contexts like pregnancy, age, and central hypothyroidism are accounted for before changing therapy, with reassessment 6–8 weeks after any dose change to confirm the biochemical response [^116T6jdr] [^113SVBJx] [^114BCykN].

---

In general, **yes, you should increase Synthroid (levothyroxine) when TSH is high but T4 is normal**, because this indicates under-replacement in primary hypothyroidism [^112rVgm7]. The goal is to normalize TSH [^116T6jdr]; a high TSH with normal T4 reflects subclinical hypothyroidism or inadequate dosing. Increase the dose by **12.5–25 mcg** [^114BCykN], recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks [^1156yKHH], and adjust until TSH is normal. If TSH remains high, assess adherence, absorption, and drug interactions [^113XGvyo] [^116aZJ4Z]. In central hypothyroidism, do not use TSH to guide dosing; instead, titrate to keep free T4 in the upper normal range [^112GQShE] [^113m2fbv].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated TSH with normal T4

An elevated TSH with normal free T4 is termed **subclinical hypothyroidism** — a mild form of hypothyroidism in which the thyroid gland is underactive but still produces enough T4 to keep levels within the normal range. The elevated TSH reflects the pituitary gland's effort to stimulate the thyroid to produce more hormone [^115ZzzzT].

---

## Clinical guidelines for managing elevated TSH with normal T4

According to the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), **the primary goal of levothyroxine therapy is to normalize TSH levels** in patients with primary hypothyroidism [^113SVBJx]. Even when free T4 is normal, an elevated TSH indicates inadequate thyroid hormone replacement and warrants adjustment of the levothyroxine dose [^113KS3Ly].

---

## Recommended approach to adjusting Synthroid dosage

When TSH is elevated but free T4 is normal, the following steps are recommended:

- **Confirm adherence**: Ensure the patient is taking Synthroid consistently and correctly, preferably on an empty stomach, 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or at bedtime at least 3 hours after the last meal [^1124T36m].

- **Check for interfering factors**: Assess for potential drug interactions or dietary habits that may impair levothyroxine absorption, such as calcium or iron supplements, proton pump inhibitors, or high-fiber diets [^notfound].

- **Increase dosage**: If adherence and absorption are confirmed, increase the Synthroid dosage by 12.5–25 mcg increments [^114BCykN].

- **Monitor response**: Recheck TSH levels after 6–8 weeks [^1156yKHH] to assess the adequacy of the dose adjustment [^114BCykN].

- **Titrate to normalize TSH**: Continue adjusting the dose until TSH levels return to the normal reference range (typically 0.5–2.5 mIU/L) [^1156yKHH].

---

## Potential risks of not adjusting Synthroid dosage

Failure to adjust Synthroid dosage in patients with elevated TSH and normal T4 may lead to:

- **Progression to overt hypothyroidism**: Elevated TSH may eventually lead to decreased free T4 levels, resulting in overt hypothyroidism [^115ykRjT].

- **Cardiovascular risks**: Untreated subclinical hypothyroidism is associated with increased cardiovascular risk, including dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis [^111CspHm].

- **Neuropsychiatric symptoms**: Patients may experience fatigue, depression, cognitive impairment, and reduced quality of life [^115ZzzzT].

---

## Special considerations

- **Central hypothyroidism**: In secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable indicator of adequate replacement therapy. In these cases, free T4 levels should be used to guide dosage adjustments, aiming to maintain free T4 in the upper half of the normal range [^112GQShE] [^113m2fbv].

- **Elderly patients**: In elderly patients or those with cardiovascular disease, dosage adjustments should be made cautiously, starting with lower doses and titrating slowly to avoid adverse cardiovascular effects [^114q7F9o].

## Recommended actions for elevated TSH with normal T4

| **Step** | **Action** |
|-|-|
| 1 | Confirm adherence and absorption |
| 2 | Increase Synthroid dosage by 12.5–25 mcg |
| 3 | Recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks |
| 4 | Titrate dosage until TSH normalizes |

---

In summary, **yes, you should increase Synthroid when TSH is high but T4 is normal**, as this indicates subclinical hypothyroidism or inadequate replacement. The goal is to normalize TSH [^113KS3Ly]; adjust the dose and monitor the response to ensure biochemical and clinical euthyroidism.

2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation.

Biotin supplementation may interfere with immunoassays for TSH, T4, and T3, resulting in erroneous thyroid hormone test results. Stop biotin and biotin-containing supplements for at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Drug Interactions (7.10)].

Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of SYNTHROID may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dosage. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dosage, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatric Patients

In patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in pediatric patients as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dosage stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

The general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level. TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of SYNTHROID therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the patient is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of SYNTHROID [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

2.2 Important Considerations for Dosing

The dosage of SYNTHROID for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)]. Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dosage adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

For adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, titrate until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

For secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, serum TSH is not a reliable measure of SYNTHROID dosage adequacy and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to titrate SYNTHROID dosing until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

Inquire whether patients are taking biotin or biotin-containing supplements. If so, advise them to stop biotin supplementation at least 2 days before assessing TSH and/or T4 levels [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Drug Interactions (7.10)].

The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of SYNTHROID may not be attained for 4 to 6 weeks.

Regarding the use of levothyroxine sodium IV (also known as Synthroid) in pregnant patients for all trimesters: generally acceptable for use. The clinical experience to date does not indicate any adverse fetal effect when thyroid hormones such as levothyroxine are administered during pregnancy. Thyroid replacement therapy to hypothyroid women should not be discontinued during pregnancy. Thyroid hormones undergo minimal placental transfer. Measure TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester to gauge the adequacy of thyroid replacement dosage since during pregnancy as thyroid requirements may increase. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of thyroid hormone and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Immediately after obstetric delivery, the dosage should return to the pre-pregnancy dose, monitor thyroid function tests TSH at 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to assess for needed adjustments.

2.3 Recommended Dosage and Titration

Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Adults

The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in adults with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on age and comorbid cardiac conditions, as described in Table 1. For patients at risk of atrial fibrillation or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a lower dosage and titrate the dosage more slowly to avoid exacerbation of cardiac symptoms. Dosage titration is based on serum TSH or free-T4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

* Dosages greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily dosages greater than 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Drug Interactions (7)].

Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients

The recommended starting daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pediatric patients with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 2. Titrate the dosage (every 2 weeks) as needed based on serum TSH or free-T4 until the patient is euthyroid [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Pediatric Patients from Birth to 3 Months of Age at Risk for Cardiac Failure

Start at a lower starting dosage and increase the dosage every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.

Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity

To minimize the risk of hyperactivity, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dosage, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dosage until the full recommended replacement dosage is reached.

Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients

For pregnant patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism, measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In pregnant patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range.

The recommended daily dosage of SYNTHROID in pregnant patients is described in Table 3.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer in Adult and Pediatric Patients

The SYNTHROID dosage is based on the target level of TSH suppression for the stage and clinical status of thyroid cancer.

General

The goal of treatment in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is to achieve and maintain normal intellectual and physical growth and development.

The initial dose of levothyroxine varies with age and body weight (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION, Table 3). Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters (see PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, it is recommended that levothyroxine administration be discontinued for a 30-day trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Serum T4and TSH levels should then be obtained. If the T4is low and the TSH high, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is established, and levothyroxine therapy should be reinstituted. If the T4and TSH levels are normal, euthyroidism may be assumed and, therefore, the hypothyroidism can be considered to have been transient. In this instance, however, the physician should carefully monitor the child and repeat the thyroid function tests if any signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism develop. In this setting, the clinician should have a high index of suspicion of relapse. If the results of the levothyroxine withdrawal test are inconclusive, careful follow-up and subsequent testing will be necessary.

Since some more severely affected children may become clinically hypothyroid when treatment is discontinued for 30 days, an alternate approach is to reduce the replacement dose of levothyroxine by half during the 30-day trial period. If, after 30 days, the serum TSH is elevated above 20mU/L, the diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism is confirmed, and full replacement therapy should be resumed. However, if the serum TSH has not risen to greater than 20mU/L, levothyroxine treatment should be discontinued for another 30-day trial period followed by repeat serum T4and TSH testing.

The presence of concomitant medical conditions should be considered in certain clinical circumstances and, if present, appropriately treated (see PRECAUTIONS).

8.4 Pediatric Use

SYNTHROID is indicated in patients from birth to less than 17 years of age:

As a replacement therapy in primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) congenital or acquired hypothyroidism.
As an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer.

Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on cognitive development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate SYNTHROID therapy immediately upon diagnosis. Levothyroxine is generally continued for life in these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of SYNTHROID therapy for cardiac overload and arrhythmias.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate SYNTHROID at less than the full replacement dose [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with levothyroxine overtreatment in the elderly.

### Levothyroxine sodium (Levo-T) [^114C5Dxo]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of LEVO-T is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of LEVO-T may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start LEVO-T at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of LEVO-T dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate LEVO-T dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^111esriY]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Children in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests)

Therapy may begin at full replacement doses in otherwise healthy individuals less than 50 years old and in those older than 50 years who have been recently treated for hyperthyroidism or who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of levothyroxine sodium is approximately 1.7 mcg/kg/day (e.g., 100–125 mcg/day for a 70 kg adult). Older patients may require less than 1 mcg/kg/day. Levothyroxine sodium doses greater than 200 mcg/day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses ≥ 300 mcg/day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, and/or drug interactions.

For most patients older than 50 years or for patients under 50 years of age with underlying cardiac disease, an initial starting dose of 25–50 mcg/day of levothyroxine sodium is recommended, with gradual increments in dose at 6–8 week intervals, as needed. The recommended starting dose of levothyroxine sodium in elderly patients with cardiac disease is 12.5–25 mcg/day, with gradual dose increments at 4–6 week intervals. The levothyroxine sodium dose is generally adjusted in 12.5–25 mcg increments until the patient with primary hypothyroidism is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH has normalized.

In patients with severe hypothyroidism, the recommended initial levothyroxine sodium dose is 12.5–25 mcg/day with increases of 25 mcg/day every 2–4 weeks, accompanied by clinical and laboratory assessment, until the TSH level is normalized.

In patients with secondary (pituitary) or tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism, the levothyroxine sodium dose should be titrated until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer

Generally, TSH is suppressed to below 0.1 IU per liter, and this usually requires a LEVO-T dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be lower.

2.4 Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of LEVO-T may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of LEVO-T therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 IU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of LEVO-T [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty Are Complete

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of EUTHYROX is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 mcg per day to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of EUTHYROX may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg per day to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of EUTHYROX dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 (L-thyroxine) level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate EUTHYROX dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Thyroid hormones exert their physiologic actions through control of DNA transcription and protein synthesis. Triiodothyronine(T3) and L-thyroxine (T4) diffuse into the cell nucleus and bind to thyroid receptor proteins attached to DNA. This hormone nuclear receptor complex activates gene transcription and synthesis of messenger RNA and cytoplasmic proteins.

The physiological actions of thyroid hormones are produced predominantly by T3, the majority of which (approximately 80%) is derived from T4 by deiodination in peripheral tissues.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Oral levothyroxine sodium is a synthetic T4 hormone that exerts the same physiologic effect as endogenous T4, thereby maintaining normal T4 levels when a deficiency is present.

2.4	Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of EUTHYROX may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dose. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatrics

In patients with congenital hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in children as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dose stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

While the general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level, TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of EUTHYROX therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the child is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of EUTHYROX [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)])].

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty Are Complete

Start LEVOXYL at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of LEVOXYL is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100 mcg per day to 125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses of greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of LEVOXYL may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 mcg to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start LEVOXYL at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of LEVOXYL dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate LEVOXYL dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

Levothyroxine (LT4) bioequivalence — FDA criteria and clinical assessment: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) defines an LT4 formulation as equivalent if the 90% confidence interval of the difference of the pharmacokinetically derived areas under the curve (AUC) and difference of maximal concentrations (Cmax) of serum T4 fall within 80%–125% of a reference product when a comparable dose is administered to healthy volunteers, and in this analysis the LT4 dose is only tested at a single oral dose of 600 μg. The guideline states this definition is problematic because it does not require assessment of serum TSH and because 600 μg is pharmacologic, and proposes assessing comparable serum T4, T3, and TSH after daily dosing for at least 4–6 weeks in athyroid individuals; simulation studies also support TSH-based protocols for judging bioequivalence rather than pharmacokinetic indices.

Levothyroxine (LT4) potency, substitution, and monitoring — recommendations and cautions: Since 2007 the FDA has required that LT4 preparations maintain 95%–105% of their stated potency, revised from a prior requirement of 90%–110%, throughout their shelf life, and has required that all LT4 products be reassessed as though they were new drugs. When a generic or branded LT4 meets these criteria, the FDA has determined that preparations can be substituted by the pharmacy unless dispensed as written. The three endocrine societies recommend repeat thyroid function testing when a patient is switched from one LT4 preparation to another to ensure that the goal TSH and FT4 and T3 concentrations are achieved, and it is recommended that, once the therapeutic target is reached, the patient should remain on the same medication and, if possible, on the same dose and preparation of medication to the extent possible. It seems reasonable to keep a patient on a given product and, if a change is necessary, TSH levels should be rechecked; in patients with thyroid cancer, it is important to maintain LT4 product stability when a desired goal TSH is relevant for possible disease recurrence or progression.

American Thyroid Association — congenital hypothyroidism dosing and monitoring use weight-based levothyroxine (LT4) with age-specific needs, definitions of starting doses, treatment targets, and follow-up. Newborn requirements are higher, with "newborns typically requiring 10 μg/kg/d, 1-year-old children 4–6 μg/kg/d, adolescents 2–4 μg/kg/d, with transition to the average adult dose of 1.6 μg/kg/d once endocrine maturation is complete". In CH, "standard or low-dose therapy is defined by a range of 5–10 μg/kg/d, while high-dose regimens are defined as a range of 10–15 μg/kg/d", and "Starting doses of 10–15 μg/kg/d have been reported to normalize T4 levels within 2–3 weeks, while doses < 8 μg/kg/d result in normalization within 6–8 weeks". Targets are to "keep the T4 level in the mid to upper half of the reference range and the TSH in the mid to lower half of the reference range, optimally between 0.5 and 2.0 mIU/L". For follow-up, "surveillance testing with a TSH and T4 should be performed every 1–2 months during the first year of life", and "For patients with severe CH, monthly surveillance during the first 6–12 months may be indicated". For possible transient CH, "For patients with mild CH and no change in the LT4 dose over the first 3 years of life, a trial off LT4 therapy is reasonable", and permanence is confirmed if on "repeat testing 4–6 weeks after stopping LT4 therapy" the "TSH rises and the T4 decreases". Formulation and interactions are important: "Within the United States, there are no liquid formulations and there are no compounding processes that produce a stable concentration of LT4 in suspension. Efforts to create suspensions should be avoided", and "Soy, iron, calcium, and infant colic drops (simethicone) can decrease the absorption of LT4, and concurrent ingestion should be avoided". In selected cases with persistent TSH elevation despite adequate LT4 levels, "the addition of LT3 may result in normalization of TSH".

Levothyroxine dosing frequency and adherence — once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens: A randomized cross-over trial of once weekly oral administration of 7 times the usual daily levothyroxine (LT4) dose versus daily dosing found weekly therapy produced supratherapeutic T4 for about 24 hours while T3 remained within the reference range, and over 6 weeks other biochemical and clinical markers, including patient symptoms, did not differ from daily therapy. A second similar 6-week cross-over trial showed greater increases in T4 after weekly dosing than daily dosing without symptoms or echocardiographic evidence of hyperthyroidism. For patients in whom daily LT4 intake is unsuccessful, options include observed therapy or reducing the frequency of LT4 ingestion to twice weekly or weekly with a starting dose equal to the weight‑adjusted daily regimen (i.e., 7 times the daily dose); parenteral LT4 is also possible, although no trials were identified.

### Evaluation of the therapeutic efficacy of different levothyroxine preparations in the treatment of human thyroid disease [^114cuoXF]. Thyroid (2003). Low credibility.

At the present time, optimal therapy for hypothyroidism requires replacement of the deficiency in thyroid hormone with synthetic levothyroxine. Precise titration of this narrow therapeutic index drug is necessary to return the patient to a chemically and clinically euthyroid state. Seven levothyroxine formulations are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and four are available to the physician. Proper dosage is established based on thyrotropin (TSH) testing and clinical evaluation. Each levothyroxine preparation must comply with FDA standards for bioavailability but may vary with respect to its dissolution and absorption properties and are not interchangeable. This equivalence testing is done on normal volunteers and requires a suprapharmacologic dose of levothyroxine in order to make the determination of bioavailability. In this review we discuss the various methods to evaluate therapeutic efficacy and bioequivalence of levothyroxine preparations in the treatment of thyroid disease. These are relevant to the physician and patient because small differences in the efficacy can produce unwanted effects of either underreplacement or overreplacement.

Primary Hypothyroidism in Adults and in Adolescents in Whom Growth and Puberty are Complete

Start TIROSINT at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals who have been hypothyroid for only a short time (such as a few months). The average full replacement dose of TIROSINT is approximately 1.6 mcg per kg per day (for example: 100–125 mcg per day for a 70 kg adult).

Adjust the dose by 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 4 to 6 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. Doses greater than 200 mcg per day are seldom required. An inadequate response to daily doses greater than 300 mcg per day is rare and may indicate poor compliance, malabsorption, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

For elderly patients or patients with underlying cardiovascular disease, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Increase the dose every 6 to 8 weeks, as needed, until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal. The full replacement dose of TIROSINT may be less than 1 mcg per kg per day in elderly patients.

In patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism, start with a dose of 12.5 to 25 mcg per day. Adjust the dose in 12.5 to 25 mcg increments every 2 to 4 weeks until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH level is normalized.

Secondary or Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Start TIROSINT at the full replacement dose in otherwise healthy, non-elderly individuals. Start with a lower dose in elderly patients with underlying cardiovascular disease or patients with severe longstanding hypothyroidism as described above. Serum TSH is not a reliable measure of TIROSINT dose adequacy in patients with secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to monitor adequacy of therapy in this patient population. Titrate TIROSINT dosing per above instructions until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range.

2.2	Important Considerations for Dosing

ERMEZA oral solution may have a different concentration from other levothyroxine oral solution products. Use caution and consider the total dosage in terms of mcg and not volume (mL) when converting between ERMEZA and other levothyroxine oral solution products.

The dosage of ERMEZA for hypothyroidism or pituitary TSH suppression depends on a variety of factors including: the patient's age, body weight, cardiovascular status, concomitant medical conditions (including pregnancy), concomitant medications, co-administered food and the specific nature of the condition being treated [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5), and Drug Interactions (7)]. Dosing must be individualized to account for these factors and dose adjustments made based on periodic assessment of the patient's clinical response and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)].

For adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, titrate until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum TSH returns to normal [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

For secondary or tertiary hypothyroidism, serum TSH is not a reliable measure of ERMEZA dosage adequacy and should not be used to monitor therapy. Use the serum free-T4 level to titrate ERMEZA dosing until the patient is clinically euthyroid and the serum free-T4 level is restored to the upper half of the normal range [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)].

The peak therapeutic effect of a given dose of ERMEZA may not be attained for 4 to 6 weeks.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The initial dose of LEVO-T varies with age and body weight. Dosing adjustments are based on an assessment of the individual patient's clinical and laboratory parameters [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)].

In children in whom a diagnosis of permanent hypothyroidism has not been established, discontinue LEVO-T administration for a trial period, but only after the child is at least 3 years of age. Obtain serum T4 and TSH levels at the end of the trial period, and use laboratory test results and clinical assessment to guide diagnosis and treatment, if warranted.

Congenital Hypothyroidism [See Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.4)]

Rapid restoration of normal serum T4 concentrations is essential for preventing the adverse effects of congenital hypothyroidism on intellectual development as well as on overall physical growth and maturation. Therefore, initiate LEVO-T therapy immediately upon diagnosis. Levothyroxine is generally continued for life in these patients.

Closely monitor infants during the first 2 weeks of LEVO-T therapy for cardiac overload, arrhythmias, and aspiration from avid suckling.

Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment or overtreatment. Undertreatment may have deleterious effects on intellectual development and linear growth. Overtreatment is associated with craniosynostosis in infants, may adversely affect the tempo of brain maturation, and may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.

Acquired Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients

Closely monitor patients to avoid undertreatment and overtreatment. Undertreatment may result in poor school performance due to impaired concentration and slowed mentation and in reduced adult height. Overtreatment may accelerate the bone age and result in premature epiphyseal closure and compromised adult stature.

Treated children may manifest a period of catch-up growth, which may be adequate in some cases to normalize adult height. In children with severe or prolonged hypothyroidism, catch-up growth may not be adequate to normalize adult height.

8.5 Geriatric Use

Because of the increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease among the elderly, initiate LEVO-T at less than the full replacement dose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Atrial arrhythmias can occur in elderly patients. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of the arrhythmias observed with levothyroxine overtreatment in the elderly.

Levothyroxine therapy in secondary hypothyroidism — biochemical goals: In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, the primary biochemical treatment goal should be to maintain the serum free thyroxine (FT4) values in the upper half of the reference range; however, the serum free thyroxine target level may be reduced in older patients or patients with comorbidities who may be at higher risk of complications of thyroid hormone excess. Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence. Secondary (central) hypothyroidism is characterized by insufficient pituitary production of TSH and affects 1:100,000 individuals; when the etiology is a pituitary deficit of TSH this indicator can no longer be employed, and serum TSH is an unreliable indicator that may become undetectable with small increments in LT4 that still leave the serum FT4 in the hypothyroid range, thus an alternative measure of thyroid status may be required.

2.5	Monitoring TSH and/or Thyroxine (T4) Levels

Assess the adequacy of therapy by periodic assessment of laboratory tests and clinical evaluation. Persistent clinical and laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism, despite an apparent adequate replacement dose of ERMEZA, may be evidence of inadequate absorption, poor compliance, drug interactions, or a combination of these factors.

The risk of thyroid imbalance can be linked to the switch between levothyroxine-containing products. Assess the adequacy of therapy by assessment of laboratory tests, and clinical evaluation is recommended.

Adults

In adult patients with primary hypothyroidism, monitor serum TSH levels after an interval of 6 to 8 weeks after any change in dosage. In patients on a stable and appropriate replacement dose, evaluate clinical and biochemical response every 6 to 12 months and whenever there is a change in the patient's clinical status.

Pediatric Patients

In patients with hypothyroidism, assess the adequacy of replacement therapy by measuring both serum TSH and total or free-T4. Monitor TSH and total or free-T4 in pediatric patients as follows: 2 and 4 weeks after the initiation of treatment, 2 weeks after any change in dosage, and then every 3 to 12 months thereafter following dosage stabilization until growth is completed. Poor compliance or abnormal values may necessitate more frequent monitoring. Perform routine clinical examination, including assessment of development, mental and physical growth, and bone maturation, at regular intervals.

The general aim of therapy is to normalize the serum TSH level. TSH may not normalize in some patients due to in utero hypothyroidism causing a resetting of pituitary-thyroid feedback. Failure of the serum T4 to increase into the upper half of the normal range within 2 weeks of initiation of ERMEZA therapy and/or of the serum TSH to decrease below 20 mIU per liter within 4 weeks may indicate the patient is not receiving adequate therapy. Assess compliance, dose of medication administered, and method of administration prior to increasing the dose of ERMEZA [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

Secondary and Tertiary Hypothyroidism

Monitor serum free-T4 levels and maintain in the upper half of the normal range in these patients.

Evaluation of elevated TSH on levothyroxine — Variable adherence or nonadherence to LT4 therapy should be considered, and some patients with high TSH values while being prescribed LT4 were shown to be able to absorb LT4 normally and were thought to have poor adherence. Absorption testing can be conducted by administering a specific oral dose of LT4 under supervised conditions, measuring T4 concentrations at specific time points thereafter, and comparing the observed and predicted Cmax and AUC; doses of LT4, of 600 μg to 2 mg have been employed in absorption testing. One survey of patients prescribed LT4 found a self-reported nonadherence rate of 22%. Since LT4 is generally a lifelong medication, it is important for patients to identify a medication schedule that facilitates adherence; given the long half-life of LT4, patients can safely be advised to make up any omitted doses, and a weekly pill box may be helpful for identifying omitted doses. If a combination of a high TSH and a normal or high T4 concentration is documented by laboratory testing, this pattern could be consistent with the syndrome of thyroid hormone resistance, a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma, a macro-TSH phenomenon, or recent resumption of LT4 therapy.

Pediatric Dosage - Congenital or Acquired Hypothyroidism

The recommended daily dose of EUTHYROX in pediatric patients with hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 1. Start EUTHYROX at the full daily dose in most pediatric patients. Start at a lower starting dose in newborns (0 to 3 months) at risk for cardiac failure and in children at risk for hyperactivity (see below). Monitor for clinical and laboratory response [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

Newborns (0 to 3 months) at Risk for Cardiac Failure:

Consider a lower starting dose in newborns at risk for cardiac failure. Increase the dose every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.

Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity:

To minimize the risk of hyperactivity in pediatric patients, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dose, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dose until the full recommended replacement dose is reached.

Pregnancy

Pre-existing Hypothyroidism: EUTHYROX dose requirements may increase during pregnancy. Measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at a minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. For patients with serum TSH above the normal trimester-specific range, increase the dose of EUTHYROX by 12.5 mcg daily to 25 mcg daily and measure TSH every 4 weeks until a stable EUTHYROX dose is reached and serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range. Reduce EUTHYROX dosage to pre-pregnancy levels immediately after delivery and measure serum TSH levels 4 to 8 weeks postpartum to ensure EUTHYROX dose is appropriate.

New Onset Hypothyroidism: Normalize thyroid function as rapidly as possible. In patients with moderate to severe signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, start EUTHYROX at the full replacement dose (1.6 mcg per kg body weight per day). In patients with mild hypothyroidism (TSH less than 10 mIU per liter) start EUTHYROX at 1 mcg per kg body weight per day. Evaluate serum TSH every 4 weeks and adjust EUTHYROX dosage until a serum TSH is within the normal trimester-specific range [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

TSH Suppression in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer

The dose of EUTHYROX should target TSH levels within the desired therapeutic range. This may require a EUTHYROX dose of greater than 2 mcg per kg per day, depending on the target level for TSH suppression.

Recommendation 11 — patient follow-up after RAI therapy for GD: Follow-up within the first 1–2 months after RAI therapy for GD should include an assessment of free T4, total T3, and TSH, and biochemical monitoring should be continued at 4- to 6-week intervals for 6 months, or until the patient becomes hypothyroid and is stable on thyroid hormone replacement; strong recommendation, low-quality evidence. Most patients respond with normalization of thyroid function and symptom improvement within 4–8 weeks, and hypothyroidism may occur from 4 weeks, with 40% hypothyroid by 8 weeks and > 80% by 16 weeks. Beta-blockers started prior to RAI should be tapered when free T4 and total T3 return to the reference range; as free T4 and total T3 improve, methimazole (MMI) can usually be tapered. Most patients eventually develop hypothyroidism indicated by free T4 below normal; levothyroxine should then be instituted, TSH should not be used initially to determine the need, and replacement dose should be adjusted based on free T4 with careful titration. Once euthyroidism is achieved, lifelong annual thyroid function testing is recommended at least annually, and since TSH may remain suppressed for a month or longer after hyperthyroidism resolves, interpret TSH cautiously and only with free T4 and total T3.

Persistent elevation of TSH levels in patients under treatment for hypothyroidism is a relatively common clinical problem in endocrinology practice. The most common cause for this phenomenon is poor patient compliance with their thyroid hormone tablets. In the compliant patient, however, multiple aetiologies are possible and a methodological and stepwise approach to the patient's problem will uniformly identify a cause, or at least a resolution.

### Optimal thyroid hormone replacement [^115a2k8B]. Endocrine Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Hypothyroidism is a common endocrinopathy, and levothyroxine is frequently prescribed. Despite the basic tenets of initiating and adjusting levothyroxine being agreed on, there are many nuances and complexities to consistently maintaining euthyroidism. Understanding the impact of patient weight and residual thyroid function on initial levothyroxine dosage and consideration of age, comorbidities, thyrotropin goal, life stage, and quality of life as levothyroxine is adjusted can be challenging and continually evolving. Because levothyroxine is a lifelong medication, it is important to avoid risks from periods of overtreatment or undertreatment. For the subset of patients not restored to baseline health with levothyroxine, causes arising from all aspects of the patient's life (coexistent medical conditions, stressors, lifestyle, psychosocial factors) should be broadly considered. If such factors do not appear to be contributing, and biochemical euthyroidism has been successfully maintained, there may be benefit to a trial of combination therapy with levothyroxine and liothyronine. This is not supported by the majority of randomized clinical trials, but may be supported by other studies providing lower-quality evidence and by animal studies. Given this discrepancy, it is important that any trial of combination therapy be continued only as long as a patient benefit is being enjoyed. Monitoring for adverse effects, particularly in older or frail individuals, is necessary and combination therapy should not be used during pregnancy. A sustained-release liothyronine preparation has completed phase 1 testing and may soon be available for better designed and powered studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism.

### The ages and TSH values of patients being prescribed levothyroxine [^115ykRjT]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypothyroidism affects approximately 5% of the United States population, and synthetic thyroxine in the form of levothyroxine (LT4) is the most prescribed therapy for this common condition. Autoimmune hypothyroidism is generally progressive, with a decrement in endogenous thyroid function occurring over time, such that overt hypothyroidism would occur if the thyroid hormone deficiency is untreated. However, at the current time hypothyroidism may initially be diagnosed when it is mild or subclinical, at a time that the serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) is minimally elevated below 10 mIU/L and the serum thyroid hormone levels are normal. Symptoms of hypothyroidism are not always specific for this condition, and each of the symptoms generally associated with hypothyroidism may also have non-thyroid causes. As attribution of the cause of symptoms is not a simple matter, many physicians may err on the side of treating mild TSH elevations with the expectation that symptoms may improve. Thus, treatment with LT4 may be initiated for borderline TSH elevations. The authors also hypothesize that LT4 may even be prescribed for unconfirmed serum TSH elevations, or even without TSH elevation, based on the symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

LT4 is being prescribed with increasing frequency, both in the United States, and in other countries. Several studies have shown that the TSH threshold at which LT4 therapy is initiated has fallen over time, such that an increasing number of cases of subclinical hypothyroidism are being treated and the mean or median TSH value at which therapy is initiated has decreased over time.– This trend for increasing treatment and decreasing thresholds has been documented both in the United States, and in Europe. Moreover, a recent study showed that if LT4 therapy was discontinued in patients undergoing treatment, while 39% of patients did in fact become hypothyroid as manifest by an elevated TSH, 61% maintained a normal TSH, perhaps suggesting that their treatment was unnecessary. However, the follow-up period in this study was relatively brief at 6–8 weeks, thus hypothyroidism being manifest later during follow-up cannot be excluded. Although national databases show a trend for an increasing number of LT4 prescriptions being provided over time, part of this apparent increase may be accounted for by a reduction in the length of prescriptions by prescribers, such that more prescriptions are being generated for the same number of patients each year.

Antithyroid drug (ATD) therapy in pregnancy — monitoring and regimen selection emphasizes monthly assessment with dose adjustment, using the lowest effective ATD dose, avoiding block-replacement with levothyroxine, titrating primarily to free T4 rather than TSH, and monitoring both mother and fetus. Thyroid function should be assessed at least monthly with ATD dose adjustment; the dose of ATD should be kept as low as possible; block-replacement therapy consisting of ATD plus levothyroxine should not be used in pregnancy and, if still needed, therapy should be changed to an ATD alone; free T4 is most closely correlated with good fetal outcome and serum TSH should not be used as sole guide; maternal thyroid function should be monitored frequently with noninvasive fetal assessment to balance therapy for acceptable thyroid function in mother and fetus.

Technical remarks note that Free T4 is the parameter that has been most closely correlated with good fetal outcome and that serum TSH may still be suppressed and should not be used as the guide in treatment, although normalization of maternal TSH during ATD therapy may indicate a need to reduce the dose of ATD. ATD plus levothyroxine should not be used in pregnancy; if a woman receiving such therapy becomes pregnant, therapy should be changed to an ATD alone.

### Study protocol; thyroid hormone replacement for untreated older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism-a randomised placebo controlled trial (TRUST) [^116GLqG2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

The dose is changed according to the serum TSH level as follows; 6–8 weeks after randomisation a blood sample is taken for serum TSH, with three possible actions:
TSH < 0.4 mU/L: treatment dose reduced to 25 micrograms levothyroxine in those starting on 50 micrograms; reduced to 0 in those starting on 25 micrograms – blinding maintained by giving placebo matching the 25 micrograms dose; these patients will have a further check TSH after 6–8 weeks; if TSH remains < 0.4 mU/L patient will be withdrawn from randomised treatment.
TSH ≥ 0.4 and < 4.6 mU/L: no change to the treatment dose; patient to be reviewed at 12 months.
TSH remains elevated (≥ 4.6 mU/L): additional 25 micrograms levothyroxine, giving a total daily dose of 75 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 50 micrograms, or a total daily dose of 50 micrograms levothyroxine for those starting on 25 micrograms.

Titration of dose of levothyroxine (25 micrograms increments) against serum TSH is repeated up to a maximum of two occasions, at 6–8 week intervals, with a check of serum TSH performed at 6–8 weeks after all dose titrations. The investigators remained masked to the results of TSH measurements throughout the course of the study.

The above process (but with only a single up-titration) is repeated at 12 months (plus or minus 1 month) then annually (at 24 and 36 months plus or minus 1 month). The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine that is prescribed is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration (by computer algorithm) is performed in the placebo group aiming for approximately the same frequency as that likely to be required in the levothyroxine-treated group. We have adopted an adaptive schedule, in which the data centre allocates the same proportion of placebo patients to have dose adjustment (up and down) as are required in the levothyroxine group. This ensures that the burden of assessment, and number of tablets to be taken, is the same in both the levothyroxine and placebo groups. The computer generated allocation also ensures that the clinical investigators remain blind to treatment allocation.

Indications and Usage

Levothyroxine sodium is used for the following indications:

Hypothyroidism - As replacement or supplemental therapy in congenital or acquired hypothyroidism of any etiology, except transient hypothyroidism during the recovery phase of subacute thyroiditis. Specific indications include: primary (thyroidal), secondary (pituitary), and tertiary (hypothalamic) hypothyroidism and subclinical hypothyroidism. Primary hypothyroidism may result from functional deficiency, primary atrophy, partial or total congenital absence of the thyroid gland, or from the effects of surgery, radiation, or drugs, with or without the presence of goiter.

Pituitary TSH Suppression - In the treatment or prevention of various types of euthyroid goiters (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS), including thyroid nodules (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS), subacute or chronic Iymphocytic thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), multinodular goiter (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS), and, as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy in the management of thyrotropin-dependent well-differentiated thyroid cancer.

### Treatment of hypothyroidism [^115ZzzzT]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Thyroid disease affects up to 0.5 percent of the population of the United States. Its prevalence is higher in women and the elderly. The management of hypothyroidism focuses on ensuring that patients receive appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy and monitoring their response. Hormone replacement should be initiated in a low dosage, especially in the elderly and in patients prone to cardiac problems. The dosage should be increased gradually, and laboratory values should be monitored six to eight weeks after any dosage change. Once a stable dosage is achieved, annual monitoring of the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level is probably unnecessary, except in older patients. After full replacement of thyroxine (T4) using levothyroxine, the addition of triiodothyronine (T3) in a low dosage may be beneficial in some patients who continue to have mood or memory problems. The management of patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (a high TSH in the presence of normal free T4 and T3 levels) remains controversial. In these patients, physicians should weigh the benefits of replacement (e.g., improved cardiac function) against problems that can accompany the excessive use of levothyroxine (e.g., osteoporosis).

### Treating hypothyroidism is not always easy: when to treat subclinical hypothyroidism, TSH goals in the elderly, and alternatives to levothyroxine monotherapy [^116E5fuv]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The majority of patients with hypothyroidism feel better when levothyroxine treatment restores thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations to normal. Increasingly, a significant minority of patients remain symptomatic and are dissatisfied with their treatment. Overzealous treatment of symptomatic patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may contribute to dissatisfaction among hypothyroidism patients, as potential hypothyroid symptoms in patients with minimal hypothyroidism rarely respond to treatment. Thyroid hormone prescriptions have increased by 30% in the United States in the last decade. The diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism should be confirmed by repeat thyroid function tests ideally obtained at least 2 months later, as 62% of elevated TSH levels may revert to normal spontaneously. Generally, treatment is not necessary unless the TSH exceeds 7.0–10 mIU/L. In double-blinded randomized controlled trials, treatment does not improve symptoms or cognitive function if the TSH is less than 10 mIU/L. While cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients under age 65 with subclinical hypothyroidism who are treated with levothyroxine, treatment may be harmful in elderly patients with subclinical hypothyroidism. TSH goals are age dependent, with a 97.5 percentile (upper limit of normal) of 3.6 mIU/L for patients under age 40, and 7.5 mIU/L for patients over age 80. In some hypothyroid patients who are dissatisfied with treatment, especially those with a polymorphism in type 2 deiodinase, combined treatment with levothyroxine and liothyronine may be preferred.

Pregnancy- Pregnancy may increase levothyroxine requirements (see PREGNANCY).

Subclinical Hypothyroidism- If this condition is treated, a lower levothyroxine sodium dose (e.g., 1 mcg/kg/day) than that used for full replacement may be adequate to normalize the serum TSH level. Patients who are not treated should be monitored yearly for changes in clinical status and thyroid laboratory parameters.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer and Thyroid Nodules- The target level for TSH suppression in these conditions has not been established with controlled studies. In addition, the efficacy of TSH suppression for benign nodular disease is controversial. Therefore, the dose of Levothyroxine Sodium Tablets, USP used for TSH suppression should be individualized based on the specific disease and the patient being treated.

In the treatment of well differentiated (papillary and follicular) thyroid cancer, levothyroxine is used as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy. Generally, TSH is suppressed to < 0.1 mU/L, and this usually requires a levothyroxine sodium dose of greater than 2 mcg/kg/day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be < 0.01 mU/L.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over… [^115MxVGg]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

A maximum of two levothyroxine up-titrations at the start of the trial and one up-titration at 12 and 24 month (± 1 month) intervals with repeated TSH measurements after 6–8 weeks ensure adequate levothyroxine treatment while avoiding potential over-replacement. The maximum possible dose of levothyroxine is 150 micrograms.

A mock titration adopting an adaptive schedule is performed in the placebo group by the data centre. A similar proportion of placebo patients will have up and down titrations of study medication as the intervention group to ensure the number of tablets and assessments is similar in both groups.

Because all thyroid function measurements are available only to the data centre, the clinical investigators remain fully blinded to the treatment allocation process during the trial.

Accountability logs recording the quantities of study medication dispensed to and returned from study participants, batch numbers and expiry dates are available for all study drug movements.

Criteria for discontinuing or modifying allocated study medication:
If overt biochemical hypothyroidism is identified (TSH > 20 mU/L and/or fT4 below the reference range) a second TSH with fT4 within 2 weeks is requested. Upon confirmation of biochemical hypothyroidism the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the General Practitioner (GP) for usual care.
If overt biochemical hyperthyroidism is identified (TSH < 0.4 mU/L) in the placebo group, or consecutively in the treatment group despite downtitrations, the participant will be withdrawn from the study treatment and referred to the GP for usual care.
If for clinical reasons (e.g. major illness) a proposed change in study medication or placebo is deemed inappropriate the algorithm is overridden by the local principal coordinator and no change in study medication takes place.

Randomisation

Participants are randomised to either the levothyroxine or placebo treatment arm (ratio 1:1) using the randomly permuted block method, stratified by site, sex and starting dose. The data centre (Robertson Centre for Biostatistics, University of Glasgow, Scotland) independently provides the randomisation schedule. Mawdsley Brooks & Co. implements the schedule through identical packaging of levothyroxine and matching placebo tablets.

Patient allocation is conducted via the dedicated trial web portal by the study nurses. When a participant is eligible based on entering the eligibility criteria in an electronic case report form (eCRF) supervised by a medically certified Principle Investigator, a central computer will trigger the decision.

### Hormonal replacement in hypopituitarism in adults: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112RSz9u]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2016). Medium credibility.

Central hypothyroidism in pregnancy — monitoring and levothyroxine dosing: We recommend that clinicians monitor fT4 or total T4 levels every 4–6 weeks for women with CH who become pregnant and that these women may require increased L-T4 doses to maintain pregnancy targets. Many women with primary hypothyroidism require significant (20–50%) increases in L-T4 doses early in pregnancy, with current recommendations to increase L-T4 by two extra pills per week upon confirming pregnancy; however, women with CH may not require the same degree of dose escalation. If pregnancy-specific fT4 reference ranges are not available, clinicians can use total T4 reference ranges adjusted upward by 50%; in CH, serum TSH is not useful for monitoring, so clinicians should use either fT4 or total T4, and an alternative approach is to monitor total T4 adjusting the nonpregnant reference range upward by 50%.

Impaired Bioavailability and Malabsorption of Oral LT4 Tablets

The tablet form is the predominant preparation of LT4, accounting for more than 95% of LT4 prescriptions. Generally, a dose of LT4 of 1.6 to 1.8 µg/kg body weight is sufficient for the normalization of thyroid function. Unfortunately, more than 30% to 50% of LT4-treated patients are estimated to be either undertreated or overtreated. Impaired bioavailability of LT4 is a common cause of off-target serum TH levels and has been reported in patients with many medical conditions, including concurrent diseases, coingestion with drugs or food, a switch in the LT4 preparation, improper storage, or poor compliance. Patients will present with elevated TSH levels, and reduced T3 and T4 levels and thus require a dose adjustment (> 1.9 µg/kg). Identification of the underlying cause is required to eliminate hypothyroid symptoms (Fig. 2).

Hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine (LT4) — serum triiodothyronine (T3) levels relative to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) normalization are described as follows: Patients with hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine to achieve normal serum TSH values may have serum triiodothyronine concentrations that are at the lower end of the reference range, or even below the reference range, and the clinical significance of this is unknown. LT4 is an effective, convenient, and cost-effective treatment for hypothyroidism. The evidence base includes at least eight studies examining serum T3 levels in humans being treated with LT4, although only two were prospective. In cross-sectional comparisons, despite similar TSH values, LT4-treated patients had significantly lower T3 concentrations than controls.

Monitoring of patients taking antithyroid drugs: An assessment of serum free T4 should be obtained about 4 weeks after initiation of therapy, and the dose of medication adjusted accordingly, and serum T3 also may be monitored since serum free T4 may normalize with persistent elevation of serum T3. Appropriate monitoring intervals are every 4–8 weeks until euthyroid values are achieved with the minimal dose of medication, after which biochemical testing and clinical evaluation can be undertaken at intervals of 2–3 months, and an assessment of serum free T4 and TSH are required before treatment and at intervals after starting treatment.

2.3	Recommended Dosage and Titration

Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Adults

The recommended starting daily dosage of ERMEZA in adults with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on age and comorbid cardiac conditions, as described in Table 1. For patients at risk of atrial fibrillation or patients with underlying cardiac disease, start with a lower dosage and titrate the dosage more slowly to avoid exacerbation of cardiac symptoms. Dosage titration is based on serum TSH or free-T4 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Hypothyroidism in Pediatric Patients

The recommended starting daily dosage of ERMEZA in pediatric patients with primary, secondary, or tertiary hypothyroidism is based on body weight and changes with age as described in Table 2. Titrate the dosage (every 2 weeks) as needed based on serum TSH or free-T4 until the patient is euthyroid [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

Pediatric Patients from Birth to 3 Months of Age at Risk for Cardiac Failure

Start at a lower starting dosage and increase the dosage every 4 to 6 weeks as needed based on clinical and laboratory response.

Pediatric Patients at Risk for Hyperactivity

To minimize the risk of hyperactivity, start at one-fourth the recommended full replacement dosage, and increase on a weekly basis by one-fourth the full recommended replacement dosage until the full recommended replacement dosage is reached.

Hypothyroidism in Pregnant Patients

For pregnant patients with pre-existing hypothyroidism, measure serum TSH and free-T4 as soon as pregnancy is confirmed and, at minimum, during each trimester of pregnancy. In pregnant patients with primary hypothyroidism, maintain serum TSH in the trimester-specific reference range. The recommended daily dosage of ERMEZA in pregnant patients is described in Table 3.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer in Adult and Pediatric Patients

The ERMEZA dosage is based on the target level for TSH suppression for the stage and clinical status of thyroid cancer.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — free T4 assessment, L-thyroxine timing, and pregnancy testing: A subnormal assessment of serum free T4 serves to establish hypothyroidism (primary with elevated TSH or central with normal/low TSH), and in previously hyperthyroid patients treated with antithyroid drugs, surgery, or radioiodine it is the primary test when TSH may remain low. For patients on L-thyroxine, blood for free T4 should be collected before dosing because levels increase by up to 20% after administration; in athyreotic patients, total T4 rose by 1 hour, peaked at 2.5 hours, while free T4 peaked at 3.5 hours and stayed above baseline for 9 hours. In pregnancy, measurement of serum total T4 is recommended over direct immunoassay of free T4; many patients have third-trimester free T4 values below nonpregnant ranges, and total T4 increases in the first trimester with the reference range ~1.5-fold the nonpregnant range throughout pregnancy. Serum T3 measurement, whether total or free, has limited utility in hypothyroidism.

### Study protocol: a randomised controlled trial on the clinical effects of levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism in people aged 80 years and over… [^111gP4aT]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Blinding

Participants are blinded to treatment allocation by using matching tablets and packaging for levothyroxine and placebo. All study personnel remain blinded for the duration of the trial through remote analysis of laboratory results of TSH in the data centre, ensuring the trial stays double blinded. GPs will remain blinded to treatment allocation and TSH tests unless otherwise required in the event of an emergency medical situation. An Interactive Voice Response System at the data centre allows for individual emergency allocation information to be released to an unblinded study physician through 24-h telephone access. All participants will learn the treatment allocation within 15 working days of receiving the final visit and completing all the data to aid in any further treatment decisions with the GP.

All laboratory tests for TSH and fT4 are performed at the local GP and clinical laboratories. The results in the treatment phase are uploaded to the independent data centre which in turn advises the study site on dose titration through the dedicated trial web portal. The study team remains unaware of the results of the thyroid function testing. Additionally, all cooperating GPs were asked to refrain from additional thyroid function measurements to ensure adequate blinding.

### Child with suspected acquired hypothyroidism [^112pTNtj]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected acquired hypothyroidism — treatment includes thyroid hormone replacement with levothyroxine (LT4), and brand-name thyroid hormone is an equivalent option for therapy as generic LT4. Switching of levothyroxine from brand name to generic preparations, or between generic preparations can lead to perturbations in serum TSH, and is not recommended unless under supervision of endocrinologist. Other forms of thyroid hormone replacement, such as desiccated porcine thyroid hormone, are not well studied for long-term use in hypothyroidism in children, and are not currently recommended. Dosing of LT4 is in micrograms, and pill strengths are commonly color-coded for ease of use and safety. Administration with some foods and supplements, such as soy and high fiber, should be avoided as it can impair LT4 absorption. Titration of doses is by serial thyroid function testing (TSH ± Free T4, often TSH only is required for ongoing monitoring), generally done about 4–8 weeks after a dose change. Follow up visits are recommended at regular intervals to monitor adherence, blood levels, and growth and development.

### Role of levothyroxine / liothyronine combinations in treating hypothyroidism [^112Chvgh]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Diverse causes potentially underlie decreased quality of life in biochemically euthyroid patients treated for hypothyroidism with levothyroxine. Once these contributing factors are addressed, if symptoms persist, there may be benefit to personalized use of combination therapy adding liothyronine. This approach should be carefully monitored: avoiding overtreatment and ensuring that therapy is only continued if it improves patient-reported quality of life. Most randomized clinical trials have not shown benefits, perhaps because of not targeting the most symptomatic patients. Sustained-release liothyronine preparations may soon be available for optimally designed studies assessing whether combination therapy provides superior therapy for hypothyroidism in select patients.

### Levothyroxine sodium (levothroid) [^111t1Wyk]. FDA (2012). Low credibility.

TSH Suppression in Well-differentiated Thyroid Cancer and Thyroid Nodules

The target level for TSH suppression in these conditions has not been established with controlled studies. In addition, the efficacy of TSH suppression for benign nodular disease is controversial. Therefore, the dose of LEVOTHROID®used for TSH suppression should be individualized based on the specific disease and the patient being treated.

In the treatment of well-differentiated (papillary and follicular) thyroid cancer, levothyroxine is used as an adjunct to surgery and radioiodine therapy. Generally, TSH is suppressed to < 0.1 mU/L, and this usually requires a levothyroxine sodium dose of greater than 2 mcg/kg/day. However, in patients with high-risk tumors, the target level for TSH suppression may be < 0.01 mU/L.

In the treatment of benign nodules and nontoxic multinodular goiter, TSH is generally suppressed to a higher target (e.g., 0.1 to either 0.5 or 1.0 mU/L) than that used for the treatment of thyroid cancer. Levothyroxine sodium is contraindicated if the serum TSH is already suppressed due to the risk of precipitating overt thyrotoxicosis (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Myxedema Coma

Myxedema coma is a life-threatening emergency characterized by poor circulation and hypometabolism, and may result in unpredictable absorption of levothyroxine sodium from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, oral thyroid hormone drug products are not recommended to treat this condition. Thyroid hormone drug products formulated for intravenous administration should be administered.

### Thyroid replacement therapy, thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, and long term health outcomes in patients with hypothyroidism: longitudinal study [^112Qsm8A]. BMJ (2019). Excellent credibility.

Implications of findings

Our findings may have important implications for research and clinical practice. The finding that long term outcomes remain similar across a wide range of "normal" TSH concentrations supports flexibility in the levothyroxine dosing schemes to preserve TSH within the normal range. Extrapolating, this is also supportive of the not uncommonly overlooked importance of an individual's set point in thyroid homoeostasis, as opposed to the laboratory reference. Related to the above, the local, tissue level activation or inactivation of thyroid hormones by deiodination (D2 and D3 deiodinases, which are critical determinants of the cytoplasmic triiodothyronine pool) may provide the individual with the necessary buffering capacity to control the activation of thyroid receptors at the tissue level according to the individual's needs, provided that this buffering capacity is not overwhelmed by high or low hormone concentrations. From a clinical perspective, this study provides strong support for the current recommendations on the clinical management of hypothyroid patients and validates with hard evidence the latest American Thyroid Association and British Thyroid Association guidelines.

Conclusions

Using repeated measures of TSH concentration over time in a well balanced and highly powered study population, we observed no clinically meaningful difference in the pattern of long term health outcomes, including all cause mortality, heart failure, ischaemic heart disease, stroke/transient ischaemic attack, atrial fibrillation, all fractures, and fragility fractures, in patients with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism when TSH concentrations lie within normal limits. However, targets for individual patients should be considered in line with their clinical needs.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^116jiqMd]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

T3 measurement and therapy in biochemically euthyroid but symptomatic patients — A survey found that 22% of clinicians would measure serum T3 levels when faced with a biochemically euthyroid patient with persistent symptoms, yet no published studies have demonstrated that relatively low T3 levels have negative consequences for patients with normal serum TSH values, so this remains an untested hypothesis. Although there has been an increase in the use of LT3 therapy in the United States over the last 10 years, a 2011 survey reported that 3.6% of physicians would consider prescribing LT3 in such circumstances. An individual trial of T3 therapy to normalize serum T3 without lowering TSH below normal is unsupported by data and is an unproven approach; some task force members thought it could be considered on individual basis as innovative therapy, but when such treatments are used repeatedly they should become the object of formal research to determine safety and effectiveness, and outside a trial it is difficult to assess desired response and uncontrolled experience does not establish effectiveness.

Triiodothyronine monotherapy for hypothyroidism — The guideline states that "longer-term controlled clinical trials using a longer-acting form of triiodothyronine are needed before considering the endorsement of synthetic liothyronine therapy for routine clinical use" and rates this as "Strong recommendation. Moderate quality evidence". While "thrice-daily synthetic liothyronine may be associated with beneficial effects on parameters such as weight and lipids", pharmacologic considerations include that "multiple daily dosing is required to sustain serum T3 levels given the much shorter half-life of LT3, compared with LT4" and reported "half-life values ranging from 6 to 22 hours". Experimental data further indicate that "normalization of serum TSH and hypothalamic TRH expression with T3 monotherapy requires serum T3 levels in the supranormal range".

### The relevance of tin the management of hypothyroidism [^115rBNRf]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Levothyroxine monotherapy has been the standard of care for treatment of hypothyroidism for more than 40 years. However, patients treated with levothyroxine have relatively lower serum tri-iodothyronine (T 3) concentrations than the general population, and symptoms of hypothyroidism persist for some patients despite normalisation of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. The understanding that maintenance of normal T 3 concentrations is the priority for the thyroid axis has redirected the clinical focus to serum T 3 concentrations in patients with hypothyroidism. This Personal View explores whether it is currently feasible to identify patients who could be considered for liothyronine supplementation in combination with levothyroxine. Genetic profiling stands out as a potential future tool to identify patients who do not respond well to levothyroxine due to suboptimal peripheral thyroxine (T 4) activation. Moreover, new slow-release liothyronine preparations are being developed to be trialled in these symptomatic patients, in an attempt to restore T 3 concentrations and provide conclusive results for the use of T 4 plus T 3 combination therapy.

### Guidelines for the treatment of hypothyroidism: prepared by the American Thyroid Association task force on thyroid hormone replacement [^111TwKrq]. Thyroid (2014). Medium credibility.

American Thyroid Association guideline — levothyroxine (LT4) dose requirements and modifiers are summarized as follows: Based on body weight, hypothyroid patients with minimal endogenous thyroid function require LT4 doses of 1.6–1.8 µg/kg of actual body weight, with some studies estimating 2.0–2.1 µg/kg for some patient groups, and LT4 doses in thyroid cancer patients requiring thyrotropin (TSH) suppression are on the order of 2.1–2.7 µg/kg. Ideal body weight is reported as a better predictor of LT4 dose than actual body weight, women treated for hypothyroidism typically require an increase in LT4 dose early in the first trimester of pregnancy, and LT4 replacement doses tend to decrease with age when titrated based on serum TSH; the presence of the type 2 deiodinase gene (DIO2) Thr92Ala polymorphism has produced inconsistent findings.

ATA/AACE hypothyroidism — dose adjustment and monitoring: Dose adjustments are guided by serum TSH determinations 4–8 weeks following initiation of therapy, dosage adjustments, or change in the L‑thyroxine preparation. While TSH levels may decline within a month of initiating therapy with doses of L‑thyroxine such as 50 or 75 μg, making adjustments with smaller doses may require 8 weeks or longer before TSH levels begin to plateau, and increment changes of 12.5–25 μg are initially made. Once an adequate replacement dosage has been determined, periodic follow‑up evaluations with repeat TSH testing at 6‑month and then 12‑month intervals are appropriate, and some clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism may take up to 3–6 months to resolve after serum TSH has returned to normal.

### A novel levothyroxine solution results in similar bioavailability whether taken 30 or just 15 minutes before a high-fat high-calorie meal [^1124T36m]. Thyroid (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), are pivotal to activation of metabolic processes and overall well-being. T3, representing ∼20% of the hormones secreted by the thyroid gland, is mainly derived from metabolism of T4 by deiodination. Treatment of hypothyroidism can therefore rely on the sole administration of levothyroxine (LT4).

While untreated hypothyroidism can be fatal, recent studies have demonstrated that even mild hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism in undertreated or overtreated patients may be associated with adverse health outcomes and excess mortality.

LT4 sodium is the standard of care for treatment of hypothyroidism and is available in various forms, including tablets, soft-gel capsules, and solutions. LT4 formulations are made of synthetic LT4 and, being chemically equivalent, exert the same physiological effect as endogenous T4, thus maintaining crucial hormone balance.

LT4 bioavailability is significantly decreased with food. Coadministration of LT4 tablets with a high-fat high-calorie meal significantly reduced T4 C max by 40–49% and AUC 0–48 by 38–40% with respect to fasting conditions. For this reason, LT4, in any dosage form, is recommended to be administered in the fasting state at least 30, ideally 60, minutes before breakfast.

Indeed, the American Thyroid Association guidelines for treatment of hypothyroidism recommend that LT4 be consistently taken either 60 minutes before breakfast or at bedtime (≥ 3 hours postdinner) for optimal consistent absorption. These strict recommendations are inconvenient for patients, who may find them challenging to work around their daily schedule, to the point where 20% or more do not comply with the dosing recommendations. Nonadherence to LT4 therapy is quite common, potentially contributing to difficulties in achieving and maintaining therapeutic targets.
