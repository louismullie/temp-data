## Question

workup for thombocytopenia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the step-by-step workup for thrombocytopenia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true thrombocytopenia and excluding pseudothrombocytopenia. Then, I should assess severity and clinical context to triage urgency. Next, I will structure the initial laboratory evaluation, followed by targeted testing for specific etiologies such as ITP, TTP/HUS/DIC, HIT, and inherited platelet disorders. After that, I should consider special populations like pregnancy, pediatrics, and older adults. Finally, I will integrate results into a management plan and highlight when to escalate care or involve hematology, ensuring each step aligns with guideline-backed evidence.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and exclude pseudothrombocytopenia, because platelet clumping in EDTA can artifactually lower the automated count. I should repeat the platelet count in citrate or heparin tubes and review a peripheral smear for platelet agglutination, giant platelets, or schistocytes before proceeding further, as this avoids misclassification and unnecessary workup [^1169QU2y].

> Next, I should review severity and clinical context to guide urgency. Platelets above 50 × 10⁹/L are usually asymptomatic, 20–50 × 10⁹/L may show petechiae or easy bruising, and below 10 × 10⁹/L carries a high risk of spontaneous bleeding and warrants emergent evaluation, with outpatient management reasonable for counts ≥ 20 × 10⁹/L in stable, asymptomatic adults and hospitalization considered for lower counts or active bleeding, especially with comorbidities or diagnostic uncertainty [^1169QU2y] [^114AGyEi] [^112sUSip].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I need to check the history and medications carefully, including onset, bleeding symptoms, infections, alcohol, pregnancy, liver disease, and especially heparin exposure, because drug-induced thrombocytopenia and HIT are common and actionable, and I should also ask about family history and syndromic features that might suggest inherited platelet disorders [^1169QU2y] [^114smUyv] [^114WNZwX].

> I will now examine the CBC with differential and a peripheral smear to distinguish isolated thrombocytopenia from cytopenias or dysplasia. I should look for schistocytes suggesting TMA, blasts indicating marrow infiltration, macrocytosis suggesting MDS, and large platelets suggesting inherited thrombocytopenia, and I should confirm that any abnormalities beyond isolated thrombocytopenia prompt further hematologic evaluation rather than assuming ITP [^117SXTKk].

> Let me consider the core initial labs next. I should obtain HIV and hepatitis C serologies in all adults with suspected ITP, and add hepatitis B testing when indicated, because these infections are treatable causes of secondary ITP and alter management, and I should also check liver function tests, TSH, and a direct antiglobulin test when hemolysis or Evans syndrome is suspected, while avoiding routine thrombopoietin levels which are not helpful in ITP workups [^112zaWuA] [^115L6Hce].

> But wait, what if I suspect a thrombotic microangiopathy? I should immediately order LDH, haptoglobin, indirect bilirubin, creatinine, and coagulation studies, and send ADAMTS13 activity urgently when TTP is suspected, using a 4Ts or PLASMIC score to stratify pretest probability while recognizing that severe ADAMTS13 deficiency supports TTP and mandates urgent plasma exchange and corticosteroids, with hematology involvement and admission for monitoring [^115zsjG4] [^113KCWZS] [^116Y3yBg].

> I need to ensure I do not miss HIT. If there is heparin exposure and a platelet fall of 50% or more or a nadir of 20–100 × 10⁹/L, I should calculate a 4Ts score, stop all heparin immediately, and start a non-heparin anticoagulant while sending PF4/heparin immunoassay and, if available, a washed platelet functional assay, because HIT is prothrombotic and delays in switching anticoagulants increase morbidity [^114WNZwX] [^116YwKck].

> Let me verify the approach to inherited platelet disorders. If there is a family history, syndromic features, persistent macrothrombocytopenia, or failure of standard ITP therapy, I should consider a curated genetic panel or exome sequencing after expert phenotyping, recognizing that up to roughly 10% of patients labeled as chronic ITP harbor pathogenic variants in thrombocytopenia genes and that misdiagnosis can change management and counseling [^114LPBfg] [^113GjH9d] [^111fhkxR].

> For pregnancy, I should double-check hypertensive and microangiopathic etiologies. I will assess for preeclampsia with severe features or HELLP using blood pressure, urinalysis, liver enzymes, and LDH, and distinguish these from TTP/HUS and gestational thrombocytopenia, because management diverges and delivery is curative for HELLP but not for TTP, which requires plasma exchange [^116AKhV4] [^114SdND5] [^117TPuSM].

> In older adults, I should confirm whether isolated thrombocytopenia might herald MDS. Recent data suggest a strong association between isolated thrombocytopenia and incident hematologic malignancy in patients aged 60 and older, so I should have a lower threshold for bone marrow evaluation when cytopenias evolve or atypical features appear, balancing this with guideline nuances on when marrow is not routinely required in typical ITP presentations [^115n6jMs] [^1165NUP8] [^111YBgi4].

> For pediatrics, let me reconsider the likelihood of inherited disorders. I should prioritize differentiating primary ITP from inherited platelet disorders and secondary ITP due to immune dysregulation, using family history, smear morphology, and, when indicated, targeted genetic testing, while remembering that many children with ITP recover spontaneously and observation can be appropriate in the absence of significant bleeding [^112hWTaV] [^116PPrYK].

> I should confirm that I am not overlooking immune checkpoint inhibitor–related ITP. If thrombocytopenia occurs on ICIs, I will obtain CBC with smear, DIC labs, LDH, and viral studies as indicated, and treat per hematology standards with corticosteroids and IVIG for severe disease, holding the ICI until resolution, because this entity behaves like secondary ITP but can be severe and requires prompt recognition [^111WQEFw] [^115PNFBS].

> Next, I should review when to escalate diagnostics. If isolated thrombocytopenia persists without a clear etiology after initial testing, or if there are atypical features, I should consider bone marrow aspirate and biopsy to evaluate for MDS, marrow infiltration, or atypical ITP, recognizing that ASH advises against routine marrow in typical ITP but supports it when smear or CBC shows abnormalities beyond thrombocytopenia [^1165NUP8] [^111YBgi4].

> Finally, I need to ensure management aligns with etiology and bleeding risk. For typical ITP with platelets below 30 × 10⁹/L or symptomatic bleeding, I should start a short course of corticosteroids or dexamethasone and consider IVIG for rapid count rise or when steroids are contraindicated, arrange expedited hematology follow-up within 24–72 hours, and avoid platelet transfusion unless there is life-threatening bleeding or counts are below 10 × 10⁹/L, while for TTP I must not delay plasma exchange and for HIT I must switch anticoagulants immediately and never start warfarin without overlap [^115tWvzE] [^117KMU1E] [^1164k7e4] [^1169QU2y].

The workup for thrombocytopenia begins with **confirming true thrombocytopenia** [^1169QU2y] and **excluding pseudothrombocytopenia** [^113h8nQU] by repeating the platelet count in citrate or heparinized tubes and reviewing a peripheral smear [^1169QU2y]. Next, assess severity and bleeding risk [^1166aZVa], then order a **targeted laboratory evaluation** — CBC with differential, peripheral smear, liver and renal function tests, HIV/HCV serologies [^112zaWuA], and coagulation profile — to categorize the cause as decreased production, increased destruction, or sequestration [^1169QU2y]. Based on results, pursue etiology-specific tests: ADAMTS13 for TTP [^113KCWZS], antiplatelet antibodies for ITP [^113Y9q7r], heparin-PF4 antibodies for HIT [^111asqbe], and bone marrow biopsy for unexplained cytopenias or suspected marrow disorders [^111YBgi4]. Management is guided by the underlying cause, platelet count, and bleeding risk, with urgent hematology referral for severe thrombocytopenia or life-threatening bleeding [^1152oXzi].

## Initial evaluation

### Confirm true thrombocytopenia

Confirm true thrombocytopenia by **repeating the platelet count** in citrate or heparinized tubes to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia from platelet clumping [^1169QU2y]. Also review the peripheral smear to verify thrombocytopenia and assess platelet morphology [^115ZB1XX].

---

### Assess severity and bleeding risk

Assess severity and bleeding risk by correlating the **platelet count with bleeding symptoms** [^1169QU2y]; counts > 50 × 10⁹/L are usually asymptomatic, 20–50 × 10⁹/L may cause petechiae or easy bruising, and < 10 × 10⁹/L carry a high risk of spontaneous bleeding [^1169QU2y]. Also determine whether thrombocytopenia is acute or chronic by reviewing prior counts and the clinical context [^1169QU2y].

---

## Laboratory evaluation

### Basic laboratory tests

- **Complete blood count (CBC) with differential**: Evaluate other hematologic abnormalities (anemia, leukopenia, leukocytosis) [^112zaWuA].
- **Peripheral blood smear**: Assess platelet morphology, schistocytes (TTP/HUS/DIC), blasts (marrow infiltration), dysplasia (MDS) [^notfound].
- **Liver function tests (LFTs)**: Evaluate hepatic disease, portal hypertension, or alcohol-related thrombocytopenia [^114SdND5].
- **Renal function tests**: Assess renal disease or thrombotic microangiopathy [^113KCWZS].
- **Coagulation profile (PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer)**: Screen for DIC or other coagulopathies [^111WQEFw].
- **HIV and hepatitis C serologies**: Identify infectious etiologies of thrombocytopenia [^112zaWuA].

---

### Additional tests based on clinical suspicion

| **Clinical suspicion** | **Recommended tests** |
|-|-|
| Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) | - Antiplatelet antibodies (IgG/IgM) [^113Y9q7r] <br/> - Bone marrow biopsy if atypical presentation or age > 60 years [^111YBgi4] [^115n6jMs] |
| Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) | - ADAMTS13 activity and inhibitor [^113KCWZS] <br/> - LDH <br/> - Haptoglobin <br/> - Indirect bilirubin [^notfound] |
| Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) | - Heparin-PF4 antibody assay (ELISA) [^notfound] <br/> - Functional assay (serotonin release assay) if ELISA positive [^116YwKck] |
| Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) | - PT <br/> - aPTT <br/> - Fibrinogen <br/> - D-dimer <br/> - Peripheral smear for schistocytes [^notfound] |
| Bone marrow disorders (MDS, leukemia) | - Bone marrow aspirate/biopsy with cytogenetics [^1122rrCE] |
| Inherited thrombocytopenia | - Genetic testing (e.g. ThromboGenomics panel) [^114LPBfg] [^115tP4sP] |

---

## Clinical assessment and history

A thorough clinical assessment and history are essential to guide the **diagnostic workup**:

- **Bleeding history**: Petechiae, purpura, mucosal bleeding, menorrhagia, gastrointestinal bleeding [^1169QU2y].
- **Medication history**: Heparin, quinine, antibiotics, chemotherapeutic agents, immune checkpoint inhibitors [^114FY6jz] [^111WQEFw].
- **Family history**: Inherited platelet disorders, autoimmune diseases [^111fhkxR].
- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, weight loss, night sweats (malignancy, infection) [^notfound].
- **Alcohol use**: Chronic alcohol consumption can cause thrombocytopenia [^notfound].

---

## Indications for bone marrow biopsy

Bone marrow biopsy is indicated in the following scenarios:

- **Unexplained thrombocytopenia**: Persistent thrombocytopenia without identifiable cause [^notfound].
- **Abnormal CBC**: Additional cytopenias or abnormal smear findings [^111YBgi4].
- **Suspected marrow disorders**: MDS, leukemia, or marrow infiltration [^113HTngx].
- **Atypical ITP**: Age > 60 years or atypical presentation [^115n6jMs].

---

## Management considerations

Management depends on the **underlying cause, platelet count, and bleeding risk**:

- **Observation**: Asymptomatic patients with platelets > 50 × 10⁹/L [^notfound].
- **Medical therapy**: Corticosteroids, IVIG, TPO receptor agonists for ITP [^117KMU1E] [^112zaWuA] [^114LPBfg].
- **Platelet transfusion**: Active bleeding or platelets < 10 × 10⁹/L [^1169QU2y].
- **Emergency management**: Plasma exchange for TTP, immediate heparin cessation for HIT [^114FY6jz].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to monitor platelet counts, assess treatment response, and detect complications. Patient education should cover **bleeding precautions, medication adherence, and when to seek medical attention** [^notfound].

---

The workup for thrombocytopenia requires a **structured approach**: confirm true thrombocytopenia, assess severity and bleeding risk, perform targeted laboratory tests, and tailor management to the underlying cause. This ensures accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Thrombocytopenia in the ICU: disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathies-what intensivists need to know [^116Y3yBg]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Like any pragmatic guidelines, we chose to focus on the most common presentation as we considered this of most benefit. For comprehensive guidance on TMA diagnosis and management, we refer to other works, such as those of Scully et al. Campistol et al. Laurence et al. and Azoulay et al. While the proposed algorithm applies to the majority of cases of thrombocytopenia, it must be noted that clinical judgment and collaboration with experts is essential, as exceptional clinical presentations do occur.

It should also be noted that some of the tests required in the differential diagnosis (e.g. ADAMTS13 activity assay) are not available at all institutions. If rapid ADAMTS13 testing is not possible, the PLASMIC score, a seven-component prediction tool that can accurately and reliably predict the probability of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency, can be used. Additionally, we have not included genetic testing for the complement abnormalities of aHUS in our algorithm; while these can confirm an already suspected diagnosis of aHUS, the turnaround time is currently considerable and should not be relied upon in the ICU.

Critically ill patients have a range of clinical problems, including multi-organ failure, sepsis, and shock, and early diagnosis and management are crucial to optimize outcomes. We present a concise diagnostic algorithm that enables intensivists to make a rapid diagnosis so that they can initiate early appropriate management for ICU patients with thrombocytopenia. This algorithm adds to the current literature available to the intensivist, with a focus on differentiating TTP and HUS from DIC.

### Accuracy of diagnosing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^113zD1AW]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

This study found that in clinical practice only about half of all cases clinically suspected of HIT require antibody testing using the currently recommended diagnostic algorithm. However, a relevant number of patients were not correctly classified, potentially leading to delayed diagnosis as well as a delay in change of the anticoagulant. This exposes these often-vulnerable patients to the risk of serious thromboembolic complications or bleeding complications due to overtreatment with risky anticoagulants. The utilization of a CDS can potentially improve the diagnostic algorithms for HIT.

### How I diagnose and treat thrombocytopenia in geriatric patients [^116gaxyX]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Thrombocytopenia in older individuals is a common but diagnostically challenging condition that has variable clinical impact to those who are affected. Diagnostic approach requires evaluation of the preexisting clinical conditions, detailed review of medications, and assessment for disorders that warrant urgent treatment. In this article, we describe a systematic approach to diagnosis of thrombocytopenia and present a schematic review for management strategies. Three clinical scenarios are presented that are relevant for their prevalence and management challenges in an older adult population. The first scenario addresses primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and reviews different treatment options. The second one addresses complications of thrombocytopenia in management of the myelodysplastic syndrome. The last one reviews diagnostic challenges of drug-induced ITP.

ASH 2019 ITP — Recommendation 1a on initial management: In adults with newly diagnosed ITP and a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the panel "suggests corticosteroids rather than management with observation (conditional recommendation based on very low certainty in the evidence of effects ⊕◯◯◯)". The evidence review "included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies that had internal comparators", and due to scarcity also "included all single-arm prospective studies of ≥ 50 adults with newly diagnosed ITP" and, for observation, "retrospective studies of ≥ 50 adults". No direct comparative studies were found: "We found no studies that directly compared corticosteroids vs management with observation in adult patients with ITP with a platelet count of < 30 × 10⁹/L", though "We found 5 RCTs… and 2 prospective studies" of corticosteroids. Reported outcomes included "Four studies reported data on response within 7 days; 6 studies reported on remission; 3 studies reported on major bleeding; 4 studies reported on mortality; 0 studies reported on overall HRQoL", and "There were no studies in ITP patients with platelet counts of < 30 × 10⁹/L who were managed with observation alone". Consequently, "The relative effects were not estimable from the data because of a lack of direct comparisons".

### Platelet disorders in children: a diagnostic approach [^115ZB1XX]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

The investigation of children with suspected inherited platelet disorders is challenging. The causes of mucocutaneous bleeding are many, and specialized testing for platelet disorders can be difficult to access or interpret. An algorithm developed for the investigation of suspected platelet disorders provides a sequential approach to evaluating both platelet function abnormalities and thrombocytopenia. Investigation begins with a clinical evaluation and laboratory testing that is generally available, including platelet counting, peripheral blood cell morphology, and aggregometry. Based on results of initial investigations, the algorithm recommends specialized testing for specific diagnoses, including flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, electron microscopy, and mutational analysis.

### Diagnostic approach to the patient with a suspected inherited platelet disorder: who and how to test [^111fhkxR]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

Bleeding and thrombocytopenia are common referrals to the pediatric and adult hematology practice. The differential diagnosis encompasses a wide spectrum of entities that vary in acuity, severity, and etiology. Most will be acquired (especially in adult patients), but many can be inherited, and some may have manifestations affecting other organ systems. The first step: defining whether the symptoms and/or laboratory findings are clinically significant and warrant additional work-up, can be equally as challenging as reaching the diagnosis itself. How much bleeding is too much to be considered normal? How low of a platelet count is too low? Once the decision has been made to pursue additional studies, considering the increasing number of laboratory tests available, the diagnostic process can be complex. In this article, we outline a general approach for the evaluation of patients in whom an inherited platelet disorder is being considered. We present two clinical vignettes as introduction to the diagnostic approach to inherited platelet disorders. We describe the rationale for the different types of tests that are clinically available, their limitations, and finally the challenges that are frequently encountered in the interpretation of results. We also intend to provide some guidance on the expected phenotype in terms of severity of bleeding and/or thrombocytopenia according to the etiology of the inherited disorder. Our goal is to provide the practicing hematologist with a practical framework that is clinically applicable in their daily practice.

### How I treat thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^116AKhV4]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic abnormality in pregnancy, encountered in ∼10% of pregnancies. There are many possible causes, ranging from benign conditions that do not require intervention to life-threatening disorders necessitating urgent recognition and treatment. Although thrombocytopenia may be an inherited condition or predate pregnancy, most commonly it is a new diagnosis. Identifying the responsible mechanism and predicting its course is made challenging by the tremendous overlap of clinical features and laboratory data between normal pregnancy and the many potential causes of thrombocytopenia. Multidisciplinary collaboration between hematology, obstetrics, and anesthesia and shared decision-making with the involved patient is encouraged to enhance diagnostic clarity and develop an optimized treatment regimen, with careful consideration of management of labor and delivery and the potential fetal impact of maternal thrombocytopenia and any proposed therapeutic intervention. In this review, we outline a diagnostic approach to pregnant patients with thrombocytopenia, highlighting the subtle differences in presentation, physical examination, clinical course, and laboratory abnormalities that can be applied to focus the differential. Four clinical scenarios are presented to highlight the pathophysiology and treatment of the most common causes of thrombocytopenia in pregnancy: gestational thrombocytopenia, preeclampsia, and immune thrombocytopenia.

### Clinical management, ethics and informed consent related to multi-gene panel-based high throughput sequencing testing for platelet disorders: communication from the SSC of the ISTH [^112bkVwp]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Medium credibility.

To date, current practices regarding the inclusion, or exclusion, of VUS in a diagnostic genetic report vary. 11 A clinician receiving a report containing VUS could use this information to order further functional tests and family studies that could inform on the pathogenicity of the variant. Because VUS will have to be discussed with the patient, it is essential to provide a clear explanation of VUS, and the possibility for a change of the initial genetic report in the future. Therefore, to avoid misinterpretation of VUS findings and provide appropriate counseling, it is strongly advised that an HTS test for clinical diagnostics and inclusion of VUS reporting should only be requested by clinicians experienced in genetic interpretation. Laboratory reports should clearly distinguish between VUS and (likely) pathogenic variants to reduce potential confusion. Reporting VUS and initiating further studies is an extension of standard patient care. It is of crucial importance when considering VUS that data sharing is promoted to allow for improved interpretation of variants. We endorse that reported variants should be routinely shared in variant databases provided the patient is deidentified, appropriate data protection mechanisms are in place, and patients are notified their data will be shared.

What diagnostic rate can we expect when performing a multigene panel HTS test for IPD? A recent review compared the diagnostic rate obtained in different HTS studies for IPD and the main conclusion is that this strongly depends on the patient inclusion criteria. 6 Thrombogenomics, the largest HTS study performed to date, shows that when performing an HTS test on DNA from 335 patients with suspected inherited (macro)thrombocytopenia and 430 patients with a known platelet function disorder confirmed by laboratory tests, a diagnostic rate of 47.8% and 26.1% was obtained, respectively. 12 The low diagnostic rate for the platelet function disorders in this study was due to the inclusion of patients with isolated delta storage pool disease for which the gene(s) are still unknown. If a patient's exome or genome sequence has been used for diagnostics, and no pathogenic variants identified, the data can be used for gene discovery in a research setting.

Thrombocytopenia (immune thrombocytopenia, ITP) during ICI therapy — workup and management — diagnostic workup for patients with possible ICI-related ITP should include CBC with differential, blood smear evaluation, DIC labs (PT/partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/fibrinogen)/d-dimer), and LDH; for patients with ICI-related ITP, treatment should follow hematological standard of care and typically includes steroids (prednisone dose of 1 mg/kg oral or equivalent); for patients with severe ITP, IVIG (0.5 g/kg/day for 5 days) should be administered in addition to steroids, and rituximab may also be considered.

### Inherited thrombocytopenias: history, advances and perspectives [^114vSVDV]. Haematologica (2020). Medium credibility.

In taking account of these advances, the fundamentals for a systematic approach to the diagnosis and management of inherited thrombocytopenia remain largely those expertly outlined in a recent European Hematology Association consensus report on mild and moderate bleeding disorders, to which the reader is directed. In the context of immune thrombocytopenia, a systematic approach includes careful primary tier assessment of the basic clinic-pathological information for each new patient prior to next stage investigations and, if needed, referral to a specialist center. The recommendations in this European Hematology Association report are very useful in emergency situations and for prevention or control of spontaneous bleeding, such as epistaxis or gum bleeding and at-risk situations, including dental and surgical procedures or traumatic events when immediate practical decisions must be made.

### Bleeding and bruising: a diagnostic work-up… [^111rUeTD]. AAFP (2008). Low credibility.

The PFA-100 simulates the formation of the platelet plug in vivo by passing the patient's blood through an aperture coated with collagen/epinephrine and collagen/adenosine diphosphate. In patients with von Willebrand's disease and other platelet function disorders, the amount of time required for the platelets to aggregate from both collagen/epinephrine and collagen/adenosine diphosphate is prolonged. A prolonged time to clot to just collagen/epinephrine usually indicates a drug effect, such as from aspirin. The reported sensitivity of the PFA-100 for diagnosing von Willebrand's disease and other platelet function disorders is 88 to 90 percent with a specificity of 86 to 94 percent. Referral If the laboratory work-up does not diagnose a bleeding disorder, but there is still high suspicion based on personal and family history, the patient should be referred to a hematologist.

If von Willebrand's disease, a factor VIII inhibitor, or factor deficiencies are discovered, referral is based on the diagnosis and severity, as well as the comfort level of the physician. If the history, physical examination, or the routine laboratory studies are abnormal in the preoperative assessment, surgery should be delayed until a cause can be determined with a work-up or by referral. RESOLUTION OF CASE STUDIES Case One. Laboratory testing included a normal blood count and platelet count. A PFA-100 test was abnormal to collagen/epinephrine and collagen/adenosine diphosphate. Further testing was diagnostic for von Willebrand's disease. Case Two. A complete blood count, PT, PTT, and PFA-100 were normal. The patient was reassured that with a low bleeding score, a negative family history, and an unremarkable physical examination, she most likely has purpura simplex. She was told to follow up if her symptoms got worse or if she had any new symptoms.

Case Three. Laboratory evaluation included a hemoglobin count of 7 g per dL, a platelet count of 400 × 10³ per μL, a PT of 12 seconds, and a PTT of 100 seconds. A mixing study did not return the PTT to normal. Measurement of factor VIII showed a level of 1 percent, and an assay for the presence of a factor VIII inhibitor showed a high-titer inhibitor.

### An update on pediatric ITP: differentiating primary ITP, IPD, and PID [^112hWTaV]. Blood (2022). Medium credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is the most common acquired thrombocytopenia in children and is caused by immune-mediated decreased platelet production and increased platelet destruction. In the absence of a diagnostic test, ITP must be differentiated from other thrombocytopenic disorders, including inherited platelet disorders. In addition, a diagnosis of secondary ITP due to a primary immune deficiency with immune dysregulation may not be apparent at diagnosis but can alter management and should be considered in an expanding number of clinical scenarios. The diagnostic evaluation of children with thrombocytopenia will vary based on the clinical history and laboratory features. Access to genotyping has broadened the ability to specify the etiology of thrombocytopenia, whereas increasing access to immunophenotyping, functional immunologic and platelet assays, and biochemical markers has allowed for more in-depth evaluation of patients. With this greater availability of testing, diagnostic algorithms in patients with thrombocytopenia have become complex. In this article, we highlight the diagnostic evaluation of thrombocytopenia in children with a focus on ITP, including consideration of underlying genetic and immune disorders, and use hypothetical patient cases to describe disease manifestations and strategies for treatment of pediatric ITP.

### Clinical updates in adult immune thrombocytopenia [^1172mBD5]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) occurs in 2 to 4/100000 adults and results in variable bleeding symptoms and thrombocytopenia. In the last decade, changes in our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disorder have led to the publication of new guidelines for the diagnosis and management of ITP and standards for terminology. Current evidence supports alternatives to splenectomy for second-line management of patients with persistently low platelet counts and bleeding. Long-term follow-up data suggest both efficacy and safety, in particular, for the thrombopoietin receptor agonists and the occurrence of late remissions. Follow-up of patients who have undergone splenectomy for ITP reveals significant potential risks that should be discussed with patients and may influence clinician and patient choice of second-line therapy. Novel therapeutics are in development to address ongoing treatment gaps.

### Increased risk of haematological malignancy in adults over age 60 with thrombocytopenia compared with matched controls: time for an upfront bone marrow evaluation? [^115n6jMs]. British Journal of Haematology (2024). Medium credibility.

International societies have conflicting recommendations on whether bone marrow aspirate/biopsy (BMB) is needed during workup for isolated thrombocytopenia. Our objective was to determine if thrombocytopenia in patients aged ≥ 60years is associated with an increased incidence of haematological malignancy. We performed a retrospective population-based cohort study in patients aged ≥ 60years between January 1, 2009 to December 31, 2019. Exposed patients had specialist consultation for thrombocytopenia, with platelet count < 100×10⁹/L, but normal haemoglobin and white blood cell count. Unexposed patients were those who never had specialist consultation for thrombocytopenia and whose platelets were ≥ 100×10⁹/L. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of haematological malignancy using a competing risk of death model. During 4.0years (IQR 2.2–6.7) of follow-up, 378/4930 exposed (19.1/1000PY, 95% CI 17.1–21.0), and 204/17556 unexposed patients (2.5/1000PY, 95% CI 2.2–2.8) were diagnosed with haematological malignancy (HR 15.5 (95% CI 11.3–21.4, p < 0.0001) in year 1, and 5.3 (95% CI 4.4–6.6, p < 0.0001) in years 2+). This finding persisted in analyses stratified by sex, age, severity, or duration of thrombocytopenia, and treatment with corticosteroids within 2weeks of consultation. This study found a strong association between isolated thrombocytopenia and haematological malignancy in patients ≥ 60years, supporting consideration of diagnostic testing including BMB during outpatient specialist consultation.

Introduction

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disease of adults and children where reduction in platelet counts results in an increased risk of bleeding. There are no diagnostic tests for ITP, and it is diagnosed through exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia. Primary ITP is recognized as platelet count below 100 × 10 9 /L in the absence of any other medical conditions, whereas secondary ITP is associated with autoimmune diseases, infections, malignancy, or primary immunodeficiency syndromes such as common variable immunodeficiency.

First-line treatment options are steroids and intravenous immunoglobulin and response to these therapies provides further evidence for a diagnosis of ITP. There are many second line treatment options available including thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RAs), B-cell–depleting therapy, or immune modulators such as SYK inhibitors. There is considerable heterogeneity of responses to treatments in patients with ITP and there is an unmet need for a diagnostic test and for prognostic markers.

Some of the heterogeneity of responses could be explained by misdiagnosis and some due to different underlying pathologies. We propose that genetic testing for alternative diagnoses could aid diagnostic accuracy and lead to better treatment stratification.

Inherited thrombocytopenia (IT) is an example of common misdiagnosis; as many as 40% patients with IT are initially misdiagnosed with chronic ITP. IT results from pathogenic variants in genes implicated in megakaryocyte differentiation and/or platelet formation and clearance. The differentiation of platelets from hematopoietic stem cells involves genes encoding a number of transcription factors and proteins; genetic variants in these genes have been shown to cause IT. Diagnosis can be made with high throughput sequencing such as the ThromboGenomics (TG) panel test. This panel includes 96 diagnostic grade genes curated and approved by the Scientific and Standardisation Committee on Genomics in Thrombosis and Haemostasis of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis. The bleeding and platelet disorder genes (BPDG) on this panel are now available on the R90 panel in the UK National Genomic Test Directory commissioned by the National Health Service (NHS) in England.

Thrombocytosis is a common clinical problem frequently encountered during routine evaluation. The diagnostic workup entails a step-by-step approach, which allows for an accurate assessment of the underlying cause. A thorough clinical history and physical examination may help differentiate thrombocytosis secondary to a reactive process versus an underlying clonal proliferation process. Once essential thrombocytosis is evident, relevant laboratory evaluation for an ongoing myeloproliferative disorder is paramount. Various treatment modalities have been proven to be beneficial. With further scientific investigation underway, molecular therapies may soon be cornerstones of therapy in essential thrombocytosis.

### Assessing thrombocytopenia in the intensive care unit: the past, present, and future [^1151n1u4]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is common among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Multiple pathophysiological mechanisms may contribute, including thrombin-mediated platelet activation, dilution, hemophagocytosis, extracellular histones, ADAMTS13 deficiency, and complement activation. From the clinical perspective, the development of thrombocytopenia in the ICU usually indicates serious organ system derangement and physiologic decompensation rather than a primary hematologic disorder. Thrombocytopenia is associated with bleeding, transfusion, and adverse clinical outcomes including death, though few deaths are directly attributable to bleeding. The assessment of thrombocytopenia begins by looking back to the patient's medical history and presenting illness. This past information, combined with careful observation of the platelet trajectory in the context of the patient's clinical course, offers clues to the diagnosis and prognosis. Management is primarily directed at the underlying disorder and transfusion of platelets to prevent or treat clinical bleeding. Optimal platelet transfusion strategies are not defined, and a conservative approach is recommended.

### Practical guide to the diagnosis and management of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114WNZwX]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is an immune reaction to heparin associated with thrombocytopenia, thrombotic risk, and a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Given the frequent use of heparin and the common occurrence of thrombocytopenia in hospitalized patients, the diagnosis and management of HIT is a recurrent challenge in everyday inpatient care. This article presents practical guidance and tools to support the individual clinician providing evidence-based care to patients with suspected or confirmed HIT. The optimal diagnostic evaluation requires the stepwise use of risk-stratification tools and laboratory assays. Management requires the selection and use of nonheparin anticoagulation in these complex patients with both increased thrombotic risk and possible concurrent increased bleeding risk due to thrombocytopenia. Each step in the diagnostic and management process has important nuances and complexities, many of which vary based on patient characteristics and institutional resources. Given the many challenges of HIT care, truly practical management is best achieved when tools are implemented to support the delivery of consistent, high quality, and cost-effective care across health systems.

Workup includes history and physical examination focused on viral illness and lymphocyte‑depleting therapies, family or personal history of autoimmunity, CBC with peripheral smear and reticulocyte count, bone marrow evaluation only if abnormalities are present or further workup is necessary, testing for HIV, HCV, HBV, and H. pylori in newly diagnosed ITP, and checking a direct antiglobin test to rule out concurrent Evans' syndrome; nutritional evaluation and bone marrow evaluation are advised if other cell lines are affected with concern for aplastic anemia. For G1 with platelet count 75 to < 100/ μL, continue ICPI with close clinical follow-up and laboratory evaluation. For G2 with platelet count 50 to < 75/ μL, hold ICPI but monitor for improvement and, if not resolved, interrupt treatment until AE has reverted to G1; administer prednisone 1 mg/kg per day (dosage range, 0.5–2 mg/kg per day) daily for 4 weeks followed by taper over 4–6 weeks to the lowest effective dose; intravenous immunoglobulin may be used with corticosteroids if a more rapid platelet rise is required.

Inherited platelet disorders (IPDs) comprise a heterogenous group of diseases that include defects in platelet function and disordered megakaryopoiesis. Some IPDs overlap as both defects in function and thrombopoiesis, resulting in both altered aggregation and/or secretion and thrombocytopenia. This review examines the key features of the presentation of IPDs in children and adults and presents a diagnostic algorithm for the evaluation of these patients. In addition, recent advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of platelet disorders are addressed, with attention given to some of the novel genetic associations. Finally, treatment options and future therapies are briefly discussed.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^111TT4vg]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a complicated disease because of its heterogeneity and lack of diagnostic markers making selection of treatment difficult. Perhaps the most straightforward part of management is at presentation of ITP. If the platelet count is very low and no other findings are present, the worldwide consensus treatment is steroids. Whether dexamethasone, prednisone/prednisolone (prednis[ol]one), or intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone is used, the response rate and side effects are relatively predictable. IV methylprednisolone or dexamethasone increases the platelet counts faster and may have fewer side effects than have weeks of prednis(ol)one treatment. Questions revolve around whether to add IV immunoglobulin (IVIG), and/or platelet transfusion. While the latter is rarely appropriate if there is serious bleeding and/or the diagnosis is unclear, an analysis based on medical records in the USA identified that as many as 25% of ITP patients receive platelet transfusion, which is far too many.

The management of ITP becomes more complicated if other findings arise, if patients do not respond to steroids, or if patients continue to require treatment. Both the American Society of Hematology guidelines and an international consensus report emphasize that continued steroid use beyond 6 weeks is to be avoided. Compliance with this strong recommendation entails earlier use of "second-line" therapy in patients with ITP, a practice already gaining traction. However, the definition of "early" remains fluid; "early" can be at 1 month of steroid treatment to allow discontinuation of steroids. "Early" can also be in the first 3 months when ITP is "newly diagnosed. These ill-defined distinctions are one reason for substantial variation in the management of ITP. Another is the uncertainty of diagnosis. A third, the focus of this discussion, is how to select second-line treatment.

This review focuses on the initiation of second-line treatment reviewing the pros and cons of different agents utilizing a case-based approach by first exploring ITP in a young female and continuing throughout her pregnancy. The review then outlines diagnostic considerations and management in an older male with particular attention to secondary ITP in both patients.

### Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy [^117TPuSM]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2022). Medium credibility.

Hematologists are often consulted for thrombocytopenia in pregnancy, especially when there is a concern for a non-pregnancy-specific etiology or an insufficient platelet count for the hemostatic challenges of delivery. The severity of thrombocytopenia and trimester of onset can help guide the differential diagnosis. Hematologists need to be aware of the typical signs of preeclampsia with severe features and other hypertensive disorders of pregnancy to help distinguish these conditions, which typically resolve with delivery, from other thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or complement-mediated TMA). Patients with chronic thrombocytopenic conditions, such as immune thrombocytopenia, should receive counseling on the safety and efficacy of various medications during pregnancy. The management of pregnant patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenia who are refractory to first-line treatments is an area that warrants further research. This review uses a case-based approach to discuss recent updates in diagnosing and managing thrombocytopenia in pregnancy.

### Thrombocytopenia: evaluation and management [^1169QU2y]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a platelet count of less than 150 × 10³ per μL and can occur from decreased platelet production, increased destruction, splenic sequestration, or dilution or clumping. Patients with a platelet count greater than 50 × 10³ per μL are generally asymptomatic. Patients with platelet counts between 20 and 50 × 10³ per μL may have mild skin manifestations such as petechiae, purpura, or ecchymosis. Patients with platelet counts of less than 10 × 10³ per μL have a high risk of serious bleeding. Although thrombocytopenia is classically associated with bleeding, there are conditions in which bleeding and thrombosis can occur, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, and thrombotic microangiopathies. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia in the absence of systemic illness most likely have immune thrombocytopenia or drug-induced thrombocytopenia. In stable patients being evaluated as outpatients, the first step is to exclude pseudothrombocytopenia by collecting blood in a tube containing heparin or sodium citrate and repeating the platelet count. If thrombocytopenia is confirmed, the next step is to distinguish acute from chronic thrombocytopenia by obtaining or reviewing previous platelet counts. Patients with acute thrombocytopenia may require hospitalization. Common causes that require emergency hospitalization are heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, thrombotic microangiopathies, and the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome. Common nonemergency causes of thrombocytopenia include drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenia, and hepatic disease. Transfusion of platelets is recommended when patients have active hemorrhage or when platelet counts are less than 10 × 103 per μL, in addition to treatment (when possible) of underlying causative conditions. It is important to ensure adequate platelet counts to decrease bleeding risk before invasive procedures; this may also require a platelet transfusion. Patients with platelet counts of less than 50 × 10³ per μL should adhere to activity restrictions to avoid trauma-associated bleeding.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^113HTngx]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

An important cause of thrombocytopenia in elderly patients is myelodysplastic syndrome. A bone marrow examination is necessary to diagnose this condition. Typically, marrow will be hyperplastic, but marrow cells will be undergoing apoptosis and not producing mature blood cells and reveal dyspoiesis. Diagnostics have improved remarkably as has clinical discrimination of different subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome. Nonetheless. cases of myelodysplastic syndrome early in their evolution may be difficult to distinguish from "difficult" ITP.

Drug-induced thrombocytopenia is a possibility since older patients may be taking more medications. Limited laboratory testing is available to demonstrate that thrombocytopenia is drug-induced. Diagnosis generally relies on recognizing medications likely to cause thrombocytopenia; one approach is to change medications if any are newly initiated. Viral infections could also occur in this population e.g. hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus.

Patients over the age of 60 are thought to have a higher likelihood of fatal and non-fatal serious bleeding compared to younger patients ;77–79 recent studies of intracranial hemorrhage have supported earlier findings demonstrating a higher risk in those above 60 years of age. Thus, it may be appropriate to pursue an aggressive approach in this patient, such as the addition of IVIG to steroids.

Which second-line treatment is optimal for a 63-year-old male?

Rituximab in an older male

In this case of ITP, the older man has a reasonable likelihood of a response but, even if he responds well, his response will very likely last only 6–12 months. The chance of a long-term (> 1 year) response is low. Furthermore, as discussed previously, after rituximab it would not be possible to vaccinate the patient against SARS-CoV-2, which is important since this 63-year-old is in a high-risk group and would benefit from boosters. As indicated, there is a 10–20% possibility of developing significant hypogammaglobulinemia when the combination of dexamethasone with rituximab is used. A good initial response followed by the expected relapse would allow rituximab to be reused, but it remains unlikely to lead to a cureand the probability of hypogammaglobulinemia occurring is thought to increase with repeated use.

Thrombocytopenia

Diagnostic workup for patients with possible ICI-related ITP should include CBC with differential, blood smear evaluation, DIC labs (PT/partial thromboplastin time (PTT)/fibrinogen/d-dimer), and LDH.
For patients with ICI-related ITP, treatment should follow hematological standard of care. Typically, this includes steroids (prednisone dose of 1 mg/kg oral or equivalent (LE: 1)).
For patients with severe ITP, IVIG (0.5 g/kg/day for 5 days (LE: 1) should be administered in addition to steroids. Rituximab may also be considered (LE: 2).

Neutropenia

Diagnostic workup for patients with possible ICI-related neutropenia should include CBC with differential and blood smear evaluation.
For patients being treated with chemo-immunotherapy who develop neutropenia, it is important to differentiate between immune-related neutropenia and chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression.
For patients with immune-related neutropenia, treatment should follow hematological standard of care. Typically, this includes steroids (prednisone 1 mg/kg oral or equivalent) with G-CSF (LE: 3).

Aplastic anemia and pure red cell aplasia

Diagnostic workup for patients with possible ICI-related AA, PRCA, or related pancytopenia/bone marrow failure should include CBC with differential, reticulocyte count, and blood smear evaluation.
For patients with ICI-related AA, additional immunosuppressive therapies beyond steroids should be used, such as cyclosporine. ATG may also be considered (LE: 4).
For patients with PRCA, hematological standard of care includes steroids (LE: 3).
For patients with steroid-refractory PRCA, additional immunosuppressive therapies such as cyclosporine may be required (LE: 3). ATG may be also be considered (LE: 4).

Hemaphagocytic lymphohistiocytosis

Diagnostic workup for patients with possible ICI-related HLH should include CBC with differential, blood smear evaluation, ferritin, and soluble IL-2 receptor. Because this condition is life-threatening, it should be suspected when symptoms arise and warrants early consultation with a specialist.
For patients with ICI-related secondary HLH, hematological consultation is required as this is a challenging condition to manage. Standard of care treatment typically involves steroids and immunosuppressives, such as etoposide or tocilizumab (LE: 3).

### The role of genetic sequencing in the diagnostic workup for chronic immune thrombocytopenia [^116uGGzu]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

The discovery of pathogenic variants in genes like RUNX1, ETV6, and ANKRD26 indicates a specific syndrome of thrombocytopenia with a predisposition to hematological malignancies. For these patients, their disease was misdiagnosed as ITP and therefore, future management was modified to include monitoring of blood counts, along with prompt investigation of results outside normal parameters. Many of these patients had been treated with TPO-RAs, despite limited evidence supporting their use in IT. A recent literature review identified sparse clinical trials or case reports that demonstrated the use of TPO-RAs in ITs. While TPO-RAs appear effective for bridging compared to surgery or stem cell transplantation in some cases, their use in conditions predisposing to myelodysplastic syndromes or malignancy requires caution due to potential risks of accelerated disease progression and thrombosis. Given these findings, association between response to TPO-RAs and IT should be investigated in future studies.

All patients receive counseling regarding cascade testing of family members. This highlights the importance of informed consent before carrying out these tests. Patients must understand the implications of finding pathogenic variants both for themselves and their families, and this has led to guidance for clinicians on informed consent from the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. As genetic testing becomes more common in the diagnostic workup of ITP, clinicians must be appropriately trained to obtain consent, informing patients of these risks. Another ethical consideration is the appropriate age for testing children, given that the results may have lifelong implications.

The TG panel demonstrated a diagnostic yield of 47.8% in patients with thrombocytopenia, higher than our diagnostic yield of 25% (total number of patients with a pathogenic or LP variant or detected VUS). This discrepancy likely reflects differences in patient phenotypes, with the TG study focusing on patients with macrothrombocytopenia or IT features, whereas our cohort consisted of chronic ITP patients. Nonetheless, our finding that 10% of patients had an underlying IT indicates the utility for this test in the ITP diagnostic pathway. Variants in the BPDG such as TUBB1 have previously been shown to affect response to ITP treatment, and given the number of VUS identified in these genes, the association with treatment response should be prioritized for future research.

### Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura: a hematological emergency [^116T1RzJ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is a hematological emergency and diagnostic challenge. The critical determinant of outcome is timely diagnosis and treatment.

Objectives

Describe the pathophysiology, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Discussion

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has a varied presentation and a tendency to mimic several disorders. However, it may be at least provisionally diagnosed in the patient with thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia without alternate cause. The mainstay of treatment is immediate plasma exchange to be repeated until platelet count is stabilized. Adjuvant therapies include corticosteroids, rituximab, and cyclosporine.

Conclusion

It is essential for the emergency physician to be aware of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura's range of presentations, diagnostic criteria, and treatment.

### Drug-induced thrombocytopenia [^114smUyv]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Drug-induced thrombocytopenia was first described in the 19th century, yet our understanding of its pathogenesis continues to evolve. The list of drugs implicated in drug-induced thrombocytopenia is extensive and growing. Many, if not most, of these medications induce thrombocytopenia by immune mechanisms. Because the degree of thrombocytopenia can put patients at risk for serious bleeding, a prompt diagnosis is key to clinical management. The laboratory approach to diagnosing drug-induced thrombocytopenia is 2-pronged. First, nondrug causes of thrombocytopenia must be ruled out. Second, testing for drug-dependent platelet antibodies, available at specialized reference laboratories, often can identify the offending medication, although usually not in time for initial clinical management. Once a medication is suspected of causing thrombocytopenia, it must be discontinued promptly, and the patient should be monitored closely. Thrombocytopenia generally resolves quickly after offending medication withdrawal, and the prognosis of drug-induced thrombocytopenia is then excellent.

### Exome sequencing in 116 patients with inherited thrombocytopenia that remained of unknown origin after systematic phenotype-driven diagnostic workup [^1151FNMH]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Inherited thrombocytopenias (IT) are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by low platelet count that can result in a bleeding tendency of variable degree. In these disorders, thrombocytopenia can be isolated or associated with additional congenital defects; moreover, some cases of IT have a predisposition to develop additional diseases over time, such as hematologic malignancies, bone marrow aplasia and renal failure.

Until recently, the diagnosis of IT was based on a complex process requiring a multi-step clinical and laboratory characterization of patients and subsequent resequencing of candidate genes. The introduction of next-generation sequencing revolutionized the diagnostic approach to these disorders, allowing the analysis of virtually all known genes at one time by exome sequencing (ES). Moreover, application of next-generation sequencing led to the identification of many novel genes underlying IT. These advances revealed a picture of wide genetic heterogeneity, with at least 40 genes implicated; it should, however, be noted that only a few genes account for most of the cases, while most genes explain less than 2% cases each. In spite of the recent progress, almost half of patients with familial IT still remain without a definite molecular diagnosis, which would be of key importance for clinical management and counseling.

ES of large numbers of patients, in association with clustering of results according to standardized clinical or functional phenotypes, has proven effective in the description of novel forms of IT and the identification of causative variants in known IT genes, thus achieving a molecular diagnosis for a substantial proportion of patients.6–9 However, phenotype-based approaches may be ineffective when thrombocytopenia is non-syndromic, with no additional phenotypes contributing to the patient's clinical picture, or is not associated with detectable alterations in platelet function.

Here we report the analysis of 116 patients with non-syndromic IT who had remained without a definite molecular diagnosis after an extensive diagnostic workup. We show the power of the ES approach to improve the diagnostic yield over a phenotype-driven diagnostic algorithm and illustrate the reasons that make ES a strategy of choice in the molecular elucidation of these genetically heterogeneous disorders.

### Why does my patient have thrombocytopenia? [^113971re]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia, usually defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000/μL, is a common reason for a hematology consult in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. In most patients, the cause of the thrombocytopenia can be identified and treated. This article reviews the clinical approach to the patient with thrombocytopenia, the mechanisms that underlie it, and the laboratory tests available to investigate it. A practical approach to the investigation and management of thrombocytopenia in the clinical settings commonly encountered by the hematology consultant is then described.

### Thrombocytopenia in the ICU: disseminated intravascular coagulation and thrombotic microangiopathies-what intensivists need to know [^111d5dDw]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

DIC is relatively common, developing in 9–19% of ICU patients, usually as a result of sepsis, with an incidence of 18/100,000 in the overall population. By contrast, TTP and Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC)-associated HUS have estimated incidences of 6 and up to 29 cases per million, respectively, and atypical HUS (aHUS) a prevalence of 0.2–0.4 cases per million, making these conditions far rarer than DIC. Although TTP is described as a pentad of fever, thrombocytopenia, MAHA, renal dysfunction, and neurological impairment, often some of these features are not present. Accordingly, TTP may be confused with HUS, which is most commonly characterized by the triad of thrombocytopenia, MAHA, and renal dysfunction. These clinical similarities of DIC, TTP, and HUS are a major concern because they pose a risk of misdiagnosis as intensivists are more likely to consider a diagnosis of DIC than of the rarer TTP or HUS, thus delaying potentially lifesaving treatment.

Several diagnostic algorithms for TMA have been published. However, currently the only available guidance specific to the ICU are the recently published expert statements of Azoulay and colleagues. This publication provides an excellent guide for the differential diagnosis of TMAs but only briefly mentions DIC. A concise diagnostic algorithm tailored to intensivists would aid rapid differential diagnosis of TTP and HUS from DIC, and enable early appropriate treatment.

### How I treat heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^114FY6jz]. Blood (2012). Low credibility.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a prothrombotic adverse drug effect induced by platelet-activating antibodies against multimolecular complexes of platelet factor 4 and heparin. Diagnosis rests on a clinical assessment of disease probability and laboratory testing. Management involves immediate discontinuation of heparin and initiation of an alternative anticoagulant. Because of the frequency of thrombocytopenia among heparinized patients, the limited specificity of widely available immunoassays, the limited availability of more specific functional assays, and clinicians' fears of missing a case of true disease, overtesting, overdiagnosis, and overtreatment have become common. As a result, a substantial number of thrombocytopenic patients are unnecessarily exposed to costly alternative anticoagulants and their attendant risk of bleeding. In this review, we describe not only our approach to the evaluation and management of patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, but also the measures we use to minimize misdiagnosis and unnecessary treatment of patients without the disease. In addition, we propose areas of investigation for improvement of the diagnosis and management of this potentially fatal disorder.

### The 2022 review of the 2019 American Society of Hematology guidelines on immune thrombocytopenia [^1119essR]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The 2019 American Society of Hematology (ASH) guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) included recommendations on the management of adults (recommendations 1–9) and children (recommendations 10–21) with primary ITP. We describe here the results of a review of the 2019 guidelines by a working group of experts requested by ASH to inform decision-making about the need for and timing of a guideline revision. An updated Medline and Embase search applied the same search terms as in the 2019 ASH guidelines, limited to systematic reviews and clinical trials, from May 2017 to July 2022. There were 193 studies identified, 102 underwent abstract reviews, and 54 full reviews. Each study was assessed based on relevance to the previous recommendation with regard to the population, prioritized outcomes, new outcomes, and study design. Reviewers assessed if the data would change the strength or the directionality of the existing recommendation or merit development of a new recommendation. Based on this review, the ASH Committee on Quality endorsed a focused update on second-line management for adults with ITP. In addition, there will be continued annual monitoring and reviewing of the 2019 ASH guidelines on ITP in full to evaluate when there is sufficient new evidence to warrant additional revisions.

### Bleeding severity as an important outcome in childhood immune thrombocytopenia [^113RprxM]. Pediatric Blood & Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Over the years pediatric hematologists have continued to debate whether pharmacotherapy or clinical observation should be employed as initial management in childhood immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Delineating the fundamental elements of heterogeneity in bleeding manifestations in childhood ITP has proven to be a complicated task. Efforts to classify the impact of hemorrhage in ITP based on platelet count have been problematic. Factors beyond relying on a laboratory measurement as a surrogate marker of disease severity need to be considered. What is needed to better guide therapeutic decision-making is a clinically relevant and evidence-based measure of bleeding severity. In this special supplement, the history of therapeutic management in ITP and prior attempts to grade or quantify hemorrhage will be reviewed.

### How to manage ITP with life-threatening bleeding [^116qorcN]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2023). Medium credibility.

While immune thrombocytopenia often presents with mild bleeding manifestations or surprising findings of thrombocytopenia on routine complete blood counts in patients without symptoms, some patients can present with new thrombocytopenia and life-threatening bleeding. Emergent assessment and treatment are needed to prevent substantial morbidity and even mortality. These patients present to the emergency room with bleeding, and hematologists are subsequently consulted. Understanding the approach to making the diagnosis and excluding other life-threatening illnesses is essential, as is rapid initiation of treatment in the bleeding patient even when the diagnosis of immune- mediated thrombocytopenia is tentative. Using a case-based format, we review how to approach and treat patients presenting with new thrombocytopenia and bleeding.

### The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) clinical practice guideline on immunotherapy for the treatment of acute leukemia [^1122rrCE]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Diagnostics prior to immunotherapy for newly diagnosed patients with acute leukemia

A number of clinical guidelines have been developed for the workup and diagnosis of acute leukemia. Initial workup provides disease classification, risk stratification, and a better understanding of both disease biology and potential treatment options. Selection of appropriate diagnostics to initiate immunotherapies is under investigation. Only in a select few situations has consensus been achieved on how to determine whether a patient is a strong candidate for immunotherapy. Further, if a patient is eligible for two different immunotherapies, it is challenging to identify the treatment option that will provide maximal benefit. Potential diagnostic evaluations for patients with acute leukemia being considered for immunotherapy are discussed below.

A number of diagnostics are available for the initial workup of a patient suspected to have acute leukemia. Workup typically includes history and physical examination, complete blood counts (CBC) and leucocyte differential counts, platelets, electrolytes, liver function tests, prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), international normalized ratio (INR), fibrinogen, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), uric acid, human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing for patients who are candidates for allo-HCT, chest X-ray and CT/MRI scans if clinically indicated, echocardiogram, and a lumbar puncture if neurological symptoms are present. Bone marrow biopsy/aspirate with cytogenetics (karyotype and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)), immunophenotyping, and molecular studies including next generation sequencing, are performed to diagnose and classify disease characteristics. Cytochemical studies can also help to differentiate between ALL and AML, but do not traditionally replace immunophenotyping. Appropriate sensitivity of all assessment techniques must be verified to ensure that measurable/minimal residual disease (MRD) status can also be assessed in future management stages.

Restrict their use to experienced laboratories.

### Management of newly diagnosed immune thrombocytopenia: can we change outcomes? [^115cE4iR]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2017). Low credibility.

Immune thrombocytopenia resulting from antibody-mediated platelet destruction combined with impaired platelet production is a common cause of thrombocytopenia. The decision to treat newly diagnosed patients is based on several factors including ceasing hemorrhagic manifestations, increasing the platelet count, prevention of bleeding, and inducing remission. Current standard first-line therapy is a course of corticosteroids. Although this treatment paradigm increases the platelet count in the majority of patients, a high percentage relapse after discontinuation of corticosteroid therapy. For this reason, intensification of first-line therapy that results in superior long-term remission rates would be desirable. This manuscript focuses primarily on adults with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), highlighting pediatric data and practice when applicable. The primary aim is to outline upfront strategies for treatment-naive patients with ITP to enhance remission rates, taking into account assessment of the risks and benefits of these approaches.

### Evaluation and management of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura in the emergency department [^113KCWZS]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a dangerous condition that can be misdiagnosed in the emergency department.

Objective

The purpose of this narrative review article is to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of TTP, with a focus on emergency clinicians.

Discussion

TTP is a disorder with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, severe thrombocytopenia, and multiorgan ischemic injury. It may be acquired or hereditary, and is caused by a reduced amount or function of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS13), which is an enzyme involved in cleaving von Willebrand factor. The classic presentation of TTP includes fever, neurologic abnormalities, thrombocytopenia with purpura, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and acute renal injury. However, < 7% of cases have all of these findings present. Testing should include a complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, blood smear, coagulation panel, fibrinogen, D-dimer, lactate dehydrogenase, ADAMTS13 level, troponin, human immunodeficiency virus assessment, urinalysis, pregnancy test as appropriate, and electrocardiogram. Management includes hematology consultation if available, plasma exchange and corticosteroids, and treatment of end-organ complications. All patients require admission for treatment and close monitoring.

Conclusion

TTP is a potentially dangerous medical condition requiring rapid diagnosis and management. It is essential for emergency clinicians to know how to diagnose and treat this disorder.

### Exome sequencing in 116 patients with inherited thrombocytopenia that remained of unknown origin after systematic phenotype-driven diagnostic workup [^115tP4sP]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

It should be mentioned that our study was focused on Mendelian forms of IT. We explored the possibility of multigenic or incomplete penetrance, but our data are not sufficient to demonstrate a significant role for these mechanisms.

In conclusion, our results show how the application of an unbiased genomic approach to IT, inclusive of CNV evaluation, substantially increased the diagnostic rate in patients who remained undiagnosed after a thorough phenotype-driven investigation. The combined execution of both ES and accurate clinical-laboratory characterization in all patients with IT is expected to be the initial diagnostic approach with the highest probability of success. However, systematic application of this combined approach in all patients would be expensive and time-consuming, also in view of the increasing number of disorders being discovered as associated with IT, therefore necessitating an increasingly complex diagnostic workup for phenotypic characterization. Moreover, the study of IT patients needs specialized skills that often are not available locally: given that phenotypic characterization requires fresh blood samples, this usually means that patients have to travel long distances to reach the nearest reference center for the study of these rare diseases. Therefore, we consider it reasonable to propose that ES, which is becoming more and more economically convenient and can be performed on shipped samples, represents the initial investigation. The diagnosis indicated by ES should be confirmed though the study of the patient's clinical and laboratory phenotype and family history, in order to provide a correct interpretation of genetic variants. If this approach does not culminate in a diagnosis, then a complete phenotypic characterization needs to be performed at a center with specific expertise in the diagnosis of IT, especially considering the disorders associated with genes not completely covered by ES. We also suggest that segregation of candidate variants is evaluated on all available family members to allow correct classification of variants.

Finally, our study disclosed that no novel genes make major contributions to IT, in terms of prevalence, thereby suggesting the need for larger, collaborative studies to identify the genes associated with the almost 50% cases with unknown molecular causes.

### Clinical decision support to reduce unnecessary diagnostic testing for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia [^116zL3sy]. British Journal of Haematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Appropriate evaluation of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is imperative because of the potentially life-threatening complications. However, overtesting and overdiagnosis of HIT are common. Our goal was to evaluate the impact of clinical decision support (CDS) based on the HIT computerized-risk (HIT-CR) score, designed to reduce unnecessary diagnostic testing. This retrospective observational study evaluated CDS that presented a platelet count versus time graph and 4Ts score calculator to clinicians who initiated a HIT immunoassay order in patients with predicted low risk (HIT-CR score 0–2). The primary outcome was the proportion of immunoassay orders initiated but cancelled after firing of the CDS advisory. Chart reviews were conducted to assess anticoagulation usage, 4Ts scores and the proportion of patients who had HIT. In a 20-week period, 319 CDS advisories were presented to users who initiated potentially unnecessary HIT diagnostic testing. The diagnostic test order was discontinued in 80 (25%) patients. Heparin products were continued in 139 (44%) patients, and alternative anticoagulation was not given to 264 (83%). The negative predictive value of the advisory was 98.8% (95% CI: 97.2–99.5). HIT-CR score-based CDS can reduce unnecessary diagnostic testing for HIT in patients with a low pretest probability of HIT.

### Thrombocytopenia [^114heLDf]. American Family Physician (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is defined as a platelet count of less than 150 × 10³ per µL. It is often discovered incidentally when obtaining a complete blood count during an office visit. The etiology usually is not obvious, and additional investigation is required. Patients with platelet counts greater than 50 × 10³ per µL rarely have symptoms. A platelet count from 30 to 50 × 10³ per µL rarely manifests as purpura. A count from 10 to 30 × 10³ per µL may cause bleeding with minimal trauma. A platelet count less than 5 × 10³ per µL may cause spontaneous bleeding and constitutes a hematologic emergency. Patients who present with thrombocytopenia as part of a multisystem disorder usually are ill and require urgent evaluation and treatment. These patients most likely have an acute infection, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, liver disease, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or a hematologic disorder. During pregnancy, preeclampsia and the HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome are associated with thrombocytopenia. Patients with isolated thrombocytopenia commonly have drug-induced thrombocytopenia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura, pseudothrombocytopenia, or if pregnant, gestational thrombocytopenia. A history, physical examination, and laboratory studies can differentiate patients who require immediate intervention from those who can be treated in the outpatient setting. Treatment is based on the etiology and, in some cases, treating the secondary cause results in normalization of platelet counts. Consultation with a hematologist should be considered if patients require hospitalization, if there is evidence of systemic disease, or if thrombocytopenia worsens despite initial treatment.

Choosing Wisely® is a medical stewardship initiative led by the American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation in collaboration with professional medical societies in the United States. The American Society of Hematology (ASH) released its first Choosing Wisely® list in 2013.

### How do we diagnose immune thrombocytopenia in 2018? [^113Y9q7r]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

In this report, we will review the various clinical and laboratory approaches to diagnosing immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), with a focus on its laboratory diagnosis. We will also summarize the results from a number of laboratories that have applied techniques to detect anti-platelet autoantibodies as diagnostic tests for ITP. Although there is considerable variability in methods among laboratories, there is general agreement that platelet autoantibody testing has a high specificity but low sensitivity. This suggests several possibilities: (1) the ideal test for ITP has yet to be developed, (2) current test methods need to be improved, or (3) ITP is the clinical expression of a variety of thrombocytopenic disorders with different underlying mechanisms. Even the clinical diagnosis of ITP is complex, and experienced clinicians do not always agree on whether a particular patient has ITP. Improvements in the diagnostic approach to ITP are necessary to improve the management of this disorder.

### Evidence-based management of immune thrombocytopenia: ASH guideline update [^114oNRqY]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2018). Low credibility.

In 1996 and 2011, the American Society of Hematology (ASH) supported efforts to create guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). These guidelines used different approaches to arrive at recommendations for testing and treatment. Despite differences in methodology, in both cases there was a paucity of randomized trials to inform recommendations. As data on the diagnosis and management of ITP expands, the ASH Committee on Quality is dedicated to maintaining updated guidelines representing recent evidence and guideline methodology. Here, we will review the updated ASH guidelines on ITP with a focus on recommendations with new understanding and future research to close knowledge gaps.

### Perioperative thrombocytopenia: evidence, evaluation, and emerging therapies [^115xKJwz]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common perioperative clinical problem. While global haemostasis is influenced by many patient- and procedure-related factors, the contribution of thrombocytopenia to bleeding risk is difficult to predict, as platelet count does not linearly correlate with likelihood of bleeding. Thus, the widely used definition of thrombocytopenia and grading of its severity have limited clinical utility. We present a summary and analysis of the current recommendations for invasive procedures in thrombocytopenic patients, although the platelet count at which any given procedure may safely proceed is unknown. The benefits and risks of preoperative platelet transfusions should be assessed on a patient-by-patient basis, and alternatives to platelet transfusion should be considered. In non-emergent surgeries or in postoperative thrombocytopenic patients, haematology consultation should be considered to guide diagnostics and management. We present a pragmatic approach to the evaluation of perioperative thrombocytopenia.

### Diagnosis of immune thrombocytopenia, including secondary forms, and selection of second-line treatment [^115MWf1f]. Haematologica (2022). Medium credibility.

What if the immune thrombocytopenia is secondary to a subclinical viral infection?

Multiple viruses have been associated with ITP. In children, ITP is often thought to be a post-infectious sequela. There may also be an underlying viral disease which is asymptomatic and thus eludes detection. It remains unclear whether all patients with ITP should be screened for hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus; with the coronavirus pandemic, it might be appropriate to screen for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Treatment of these three viral infections would alter ITP management. The primary treatment for both hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency virus would likely increase the platelet count. However, if hepatitis C has progressed to cirrhosis, the platelet effects of antiviral treatment may be limited. Another viral infection that could be subclinical is cytomegalovirus which might be revealed only by atypical lymphocytes and/or mildly elevated liver tests. Cytomegalovirus can worsen ITP in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatments because these agents will activate the cytomegalovirus and thus worsen the ITP making it more resistant to treatment. Helicobacter pylori may "cause" ITP, but only in certain places, e.g. Japan and Italy, is searching for it at diagnosis of ITP routine and is its eradication a uniformly effective approach to ITP.

### Hematologic emergencies: recognition and initial management [^1152oXzi]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Hematologic emergencies are bleeding or clotting disorders that are hereditary or acquired and must be treated emergently to avoid significant morbidity or mortality. Patients experiencing a hematologic emergency may present with spontaneous bleeding, jaundice, petechiae, or purpura. Initial diagnostic testing should include a complete blood count. Patients who have bleeding associated with a hereditary disorder should receive clotting factor replacement before diagnostic testing. Acute chest syndrome is an uncommon but serious complication of sickle cell disease. Hemolysis caused by autoimmune disorders or iatrogenic errors from blood product transfusions has a distinct clinical presentation and requires immediate action. Severe thrombocytopenia presenting as immune or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura should be differentiated and treated appropriately. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and trauma coagulopathy are sometimes confused with each other, but both can cause serious injury and require unique treatments. Primary care physicians should promptly recognize patients who require emergent referral to a hematologic specialist.

### American Society of Hematology 2019 guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia [^112KEDJ3]. Blood Advances (2019). High credibility.

American Society of Hematology guidelines for immune thrombocytopenia — research priorities emphasize that the panel was able to make a strong recommendation for approximately one-fifth (5/21) of the prioritized questions and recommend methodological directions for future evidence generation. The panel recommends that collaborative cohort studies (retrospective and prospective), registries, and other observational studies addressing these issues could contribute much to improve the current levels of evidence and are likely more feasible than RCTs. These studies should apply standard dosing regimens and definitions, consistently report on patient-reported outcomes including HRQoL and side effects, and report long-term follow-up data. The panel also recommends ongoing collaborative engagement of patients to best understand how to apply these guidelines within the context of shared decision-making. Lastly, the panel recognizes that many of the management options covered in these recommendations are unavailable in certain countries; therefore global cost-effective strategies should also be assessed.

Adult immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) — outpatient versus admission: In adults with a platelet count of ≥ 20 × 10⁹/L who are asymptomatic or have minor mucocutaneous bleeding, the panel suggests management as an outpatient rather than hospital admission, with patients not admitted to the hospital advised to receive education and expedited follow-up with a hematologist; admission decisions are noted to vary across 0 to 20 × 10⁹/L, and a good practice statement specifies hematology follow-up within 24 to 72 hours, while remarks list factors that may still favor admission (refractory to treatment, social concerns, uncertainty about diagnosis, significant comorbidities with risk of bleeding, more significant mucosal bleeding).

### Cases of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia elucidate the syndrome [^1145P51z]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) can have a dramatic presentation and often an unfortunate outcome. Each episode has the real potential to result in clinical catastrophe. From the > 100 such patients that we see yearly, patients have been selected to illustrate aspects of HIT such as history, epidemiology, clinical features, and improving treatment strategies. Delayed recognition continues to contribute to the morbidity and mortality of these patients. It is not adequate to just stop heparin therapy even with isolated HIT, therapy with low-molecular-weight heparins is contraindicated, and care must be used not to initiate warfarin therapy early or unopposed. A moderate suspicion for HIT should trigger the institution of therapy with an alternative anticoagulant even before laboratory confirmation. The potential beneficial impact of therapy with direct thrombin inhibitors makes it more important to maintain awareness of and vigilance for this syndrome.

Introduction

The diagnostic utility of recommended diagnostic tests in daily practice often does not match published study results, and little is known about tests used to diagnose heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Immune-mediated HIT is a life-threatening complication seen after heparin administration. Immunogenic complexes are generated from IgG antibodies targeting platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin-complexes. In turn, these complexes activate platelets through FcγRIIA receptors and cause platelet aggregation. As phenotype, a triad of signs and symptoms are common: (1) thrombocytopenia, (2) severe thrombosis, and (3) a typical timing of platelet count reduction following heparin administration. HIT is uncommon and occurs in diverse settings, making it unfamiliar to the clinician involved. It is, however, imperative to know when to suspect HIT and how to handle it correctly to prevent severe thromboembolic complications.

### How to approach thrombocytopenia [^113h8nQU]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2012). Low credibility.

Thrombocytopenia is a common hematologic finding with variable clinical expression. A low platelet count may be the initial manifestation of infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus or it may reflect the activity of life-threatening disorders such as the thrombotic microangiopathies. A correct identification of the causes of thrombocytopenia is crucial for the appropriate management of these patients. In this review, we present a systematic evaluation of adults with thrombocytopenia. The approach is clearly different between outpatients, who are frequently asymptomatic and in whom we can sometimes indulge in sophisticated and relatively lengthy investigations, and the dramatic presentation of acute thrombocytopenia in the emergency department or in the intensive care unit, which requires immediate intervention and for which only a few diagnostic tests are available. A brief discussion of the most common etiologies seen in both settings is provided.
