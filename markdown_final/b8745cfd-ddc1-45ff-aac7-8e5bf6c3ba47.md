## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the current recommendations for statin therapy in patients with diabetes, and how these recommendations compare to those for patients without diabetes, with explicit reasoning and self-verification throughout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most authoritative, up-to-date guidelines and their hierarchy. Then, I should verify the risk stratification framework in diabetes and how age modifies intensity. Next, I will examine primary versus secondary prevention thresholds and LDL-C goals. After that, I need to check special populations such as older adults, type 1 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. I will then compare these recommendations with those for patients without diabetes. Finally, I should review safety, monitoring, and nonstatin add-on therapy, and close with implementation considerations and a concise synthesis.

> Let me first confirm the guideline hierarchy and the most current sources so I don't anchor on outdated targets. The ADA Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes — 2025 is the primary, most current source for diabetes-specific lipid management, while the 2018/2019 ACC/AHA multisociety cholesterol guidelines provide the overarching risk-based framework and diabetes-specific recommendations, and the 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines inform European practice and very-high-risk LDL-C targets, which are often adopted in U.S. practice for secondary prevention and extreme risk settings [^116DoW87] [^115w4QSz] [^111bTipb].

> I need to ensure the risk stratification logic is correct before assigning intensity. Diabetes confers at least intermediate ASCVD risk by age 40, and risk is further modified by age, the presence of established ASCVD, and additional ASCVD risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, albuminuria/eGFR < 60, LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL, or family history of premature ASCVD; this risk-factor–based approach drives the choice of statin intensity and LDL-C goals in current ADA guidance [^116DoW87] [^113ibFsf].

> Now, for primary prevention in adults 40–75 years with diabetes and no ASCVD, let me verify the default intensity and when to escalate. ADA 2025 recommends moderate-intensity statins for all in this group, with high-intensity statins for those with one or more additional ASCVD risk factors, aiming for LDL-C < 70 mg/dL and generally a ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction from baseline; if the percent reduction is hard to operationalize, focusing on the absolute LDL-C goal is acceptable in practice [^115o4amj] [^111KzxVa] [^116DoW87]. Wait, I should double-check the ACC/AHA alignment: yes, ACC/AHA recommends moderate-intensity statins for adults 40–75 with diabetes regardless of calculated 10-year risk, and it is reasonable to use high-intensity therapy when multiple risk factors are present, which is concordant with ADA's approach [^115w4QSz] [^111CzrrQ].

> For secondary prevention or established ASCVD in diabetes, I should confirm the intensity and LDL-C targets. ADA 2025 recommends high-intensity statins for all ages with diabetes and ASCVD, targeting LDL-C < 70 mg/dL and preferably < 55 mg/dL when feasible, with a ≥ 50% reduction from baseline. This aligns with the very-high-risk paradigm endorsed by ESC/EAS and reflects the robust outcome benefits of more intensive LDL-C lowering in this population [^113k8ZtQ] [^114y5gvg] [^114G5Qr6] [^111bTipb].

> Let me consider younger adults with diabetes, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing. In adults 20–39 years with diabetes, statins are not routine for all; ADA advises considering statins when additional ASCVD risk factors are present, and this individualized approach is echoed by endocrine guidance for type 1 diabetes with long duration or microvascular disease, where statins should be considered even in the absence of classic ASCVD risk calculators [^112oTwGE] [^117C4aVr] [^114Htzpm].

> Next, I should review older adults, since age modifies risk–benefit and tolerance. For adults older than 75 years with diabetes, ADA recommends continuing existing statin therapy if already on it and considering initiation of at least moderate-intensity statins after discussing benefits and risks. Evidence is limited in this age group, so shared decision-making is essential, and strict LDL-C targets may be relaxed when life expectancy is limited or adverse effects emerge [^1128jhea] [^112ZfsCB] [^115277qK].

> I will now examine type 1 diabetes, because I should confirm whether the same intensity rules apply. ADA applies the same age- and risk-based framework to type 1 diabetes, with high-intensity statins indicated for ASCVD and moderate- to high-intensity statins considered for primary prevention in those over 40, with long disease duration, or with microvascular complications; endocrine guidance similarly supports statins in high-risk type 1 diabetes phenotypes irrespective of calculated risk scores [^113UtNf8] [^117C4aVr] [^114Htzpm].

> But wait, what about chronic kidney disease and dialysis, since that often changes the calculus. For CKD stages 1–4 with diabetes, standard risk-based statin therapy is recommended, but statins should not be initiated in patients with diabetes on maintenance dialysis given lack of outcome benefit in randomized trials; if already on a statin at dialysis initiation, some experts allow continuation with individualized reassessment [^112WCx6b] [^115f49sp].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about nonstatin therapy sequencing. I initially thought to add ezetimibe only after dual high-intensity statin trials, but I should verify the current pathway. ADA 2025 and ACC 2022 consensus support adding ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor if LDL-C goals are not achieved on maximally tolerated statin therapy, with bempedoic acid as an alternative in statin-intolerant patients; fibrates are not recommended to be added to statins for ASCVD risk reduction in diabetes, and ezetimibe is generally considered first-line add-on given efficacy, safety, and cost [^113eCvmi] [^11157p91] [^114c1Fmz] [^113C7Lh9].

> I should confirm safety monitoring and the diabetes progression signal. Statin therapy is associated with a modest increase in new-onset or progression of diabetes, particularly with higher-intensity regimens; nonetheless, cardiovascular benefits outweigh glycemic risks, so guidelines recommend checking fasting glucose or HbA1c before and within about 1 year of statin initiation in patients with diabetes risk factors, alongside ongoing lifestyle counseling and standard diabetes screening [^117W8o15] [^1118KZQW] [^113Bggbf].

> Now, comparing to patients without diabetes, I need to ensure the distinctions are precise. In non-diabetic adults 40–75, statin decisions are driven by calculated 10-year ASCVD risk and risk enhancers, with high-intensity therapy typically reserved for risk ≥ 20% or LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, whereas moderate-intensity therapy considered for 7.5–20% risk after shared decision-making. In contrast, diabetes confers at least intermediate risk by definition, so most adults 40–75 with diabetes qualify for at least moderate-intensity statins regardless of calculated risk, and high-intensity is reasonable with additional risk factors or LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL on therapy [^111CzrrQ] [^115w4QSz]. Hmm, wait a minute, I almost implied diabetes alone mandates high-intensity for all 40–75; that would overstate the guidance — ADA and ACC/AHA endorse moderate-intensity for all 40–75 with diabetes, with escalation to high-intensity when additional risk factors are present or ASCVD risk is very high, which is the correct nuance [^115o4amj] [^115w4QSz].

> Next, I should review implementation and adherence, because underuse undermines risk reduction. Real-world data show substantial underutilization of guideline-directed statins and especially high-intensity therapy in diabetes with ASCVD, and patient nonacceptance of statin recommendations is common and associated with worse LDL-C control. Addressing side effects, using shared decision-making, and employing strategies for statin intolerance — such as switching agents, dose adjustment, intermittent dosing, or adding nonstatins — can improve persistence and outcomes [^115f2Ssz] [^1176fxLs] [^111vKS73].

> Let me synthesize the practical approach to ensure internal consistency. For adults 40–75 with diabetes and no ASCVD, start a moderate-intensity statin and escalate to high-intensity if one or more ASCVD risk factors are present, targeting LDL-C < 70 mg/dL. For any age with diabetes and ASCVD, use high-intensity statins and target LDL-C < 70 mg/dL, and consider < 55 mg/dL when feasible. For adults 20–39 with diabetes, individualize based on additional risk factors. For adults older than 75, continue existing statins and consider moderate-intensity initiation after shared decision-making. Across all groups, add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor if LDL-C goals are not met on maximally tolerated statins, and use bempedoic acid in statin-intolerant patients [^116DoW87] [^113k8ZtQ] [^114y5gvg] [^113eCvmi] [^113C7Lh9].

> In conclusion, I should confirm that the current recommendations reflect a risk-enhanced, intensity-based strategy rather than a one-size-fits-all rule. Diabetes status shifts the risk baseline, but within diabetes, intensity is tailored to age, ASCVD status, and additional risk factors, with explicit LDL-C goals and a clear escalation pathway to nonstatins when needed; this approach balances robust cardiovascular risk reduction with individualized safety and tolerance considerations [^116DoW87] [^115w4QSz] [^116uninn].

Statin therapy is recommended for **all adults with diabetes aged 40–75 years** [^116DoW87], with **high-intensity statins for those with ASCVD or multiple risk factors** [^117BD4a7] and **moderate-intensity for others** [^115o4amj]. For adults > 75 years, use **shared decision-making** [^112e9uLj]; for adults 20–39 years, consider statins if additional risk factors are present [^112oTwGE]. The **LDL-C goal is < 70 mg/dL** for most [^111KzxVa] and **< 55 mg/dL** for those with ASCVD or very high risk [^114y5gvg]; add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor if goals are not met [^113eCvmi]. Statin benefits outweigh the small risk of new-onset diabetes [^112uhztJ], and monitoring of glycemia is advised in high-risk patients [^1118KZQW].

## Current recommendations for statin therapy in diabetes

### General recommendations

- **Age 40–75 years**: Initiate statin therapy for all adults with diabetes [^116DoW87], regardless of baseline LDL-C [^113TNrpJ].
- **Age > 75 years**: Use shared decision-making [^112e9uLj] to continue or initiate statins based on comorbidities, life expectancy, and patient preferences [^notfound].
- **Age 20–39 years**: Consider statins if additional ASCVD risk factors are present (e.g. LDL-C ≥ 160 mg/dL, hypertension, smoking) [^112oTwGE].

---

### Statin intensity recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended statin intensity** |
|-|-|
| ASCVD or multiple ASCVD risk factors | High-intensity (LDL-C reduction ≥ 50%) [^111KzxVa] [^113k8ZtQ] |
| No ASCVD, age 40–75 years | Moderate-intensity (LDL-C reduction 30–49%) [^115o4amj] [^115w4QSz] |
| Statin intolerance | Use maximum tolerated dose; consider nonstatin options if needed [^112LdBwf] [^113C7Lh9] |

---

### LDL-C targets

The **LDL-C goal is < 70 mg/dL** for most adults with diabetes [^notfound], and **< 55 mg/dL** for those with ASCVD or at very high risk [^114y5gvg]. If targets are not achieved with maximally tolerated statins, add ezetimibe or a PCSK9 inhibitor [^111KzxVa].

---

## Comparison with non-diabetic patients

### Primary prevention

In primary prevention, **adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes** should receive statins regardless of calculated ASCVD risk [^115w4QSz], whereas **non-diabetic adults** are treated based on a calculated 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 7.5% [^111CzrrQ] [^113Sbcgp].

---

### Secondary prevention

In secondary prevention, **patients with diabetes and ASCVD** should receive high-intensity statins with lower LDL-C targets than non-diabetic patients [^114y5gvg].

---

### Special considerations

- **Statin intolerance**: Use maximum tolerated dose; consider ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, or bempedoic acid if needed [^112LdBwf] [^113C7Lh9].
- **Pregnancy**: Statins are contraindicated [^115fjgHS].
- **Monitoring**: Regular lipid panels and liver enzymes as indicated [^111SVUMa] [^111LmhyU].

## Risks and benefits of statin therapy in diabetes

### Benefits

Benefits include significant reductions in **cardiovascular events and mortality** [^115PBRJ8] in patients with diabetes [^116ADHW1]. Statin therapy is also **cost-effective** for primary and secondary prevention in diabetes [^111SHaKt].

---

### Risks

- **New-onset diabetes**: Modest increase in risk, especially with high-intensity statins [^112uhztJ] [^1134m6Jj].
- **Diabetes progression**: Possible worsening glycemic control, but cardiovascular benefits outweigh risks [^113Bggbf] [^112TqeWU].
- **Muscle symptoms**: Rare but monitor for myopathy [^112Sbrqw].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

- **Lipid panels**: Every 3–12 months until stable, then annually [^notfound].
- **Liver enzymes**: Check at initiation and if clinically indicated [^111LmhyU].
- **Glycemic control**: Monitor HbA1c or fasting glucose, especially in high-risk patients [^1118KZQW] [^1134m6Jj].

---

Statin therapy is recommended for **all adults with diabetes aged 40–75 years** [^116DoW87], with intensity tailored to ASCVD risk and LDL-C targets. The benefits outweigh the small risks, and therapy should be individualized with shared decision-making, especially in older adults or those with additional risk factors [^112e9uLj].

Type 2 diabetes dyslipidemia — statins are first-line and intensity is matched to ASCVD risk with monitoring. Unless contraindicated, a statin should be used as the first-line therapy for dyslipidemia in persons with T2D. High-risk patients (T2D with < 10% 10-year risk) should be started on moderate-intensity statin therapy, which results in an LDL-C reduction in the range of 30% to 40%. For persons at very high risk (10%–20% 10-year risk) and extreme risk (> 20% 10-year risk), high-intensity statin therapy, which lowers LDL-C by > 50% to 60%, should be started regardless of baseline LDL-C level. Lipids should initially be monitored at 6- to 12-week intervals and then at less frequent intervals (eg, 6 months) once at goal.

This large retrospective cohort study included 83 022 propensity-scored matched pairs of statin users and nonusers and found that the diabetes-progression composite outcome was significantly higher among patients with diabetes who used statins than among patients with diabetes who did not use statins. The study examined 12 years of data on patients covered by the Veterans Affairs health system and new-user and active-comparator designs to assess associations between statin initiation and diabetes progression from 2003 to 2015. Meaning Statin use was associated with diabetes progression in patients with diabetes — statin users had a higher likelihood of insulin treatment initiation, developing significant hyperglycemia, experiencing acute glycemic complications, and being prescribed an increased number of glucose-lowering medication classes.

Importance Statin therapy has been associated with increased insulin resistance; however, its clinical implications for diabetes control among patients with diabetes is unknown. Objective To assess diabetes progression after initiation of statin use in patients with diabetes. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a retrospective matched-cohort study using new-user and active-comparator designs to assess associations between statin initiation and diabetes progression in a national cohort of patients covered by the US Department of Veterans Affairs from fiscal years 2003–2015. Patients included were 30 years or older; had been diagnosed with diabetes during the study period; and were regular users of the Veterans Affairs health system, with records of demographic information, clinical encounters, vital signs, laboratory data, and medication usage. Interventions Treatment initiation with statins or with H2-blockers or proton pump inhibitors.

Main Outcomes and Measures Diabetes progression composite outcome comprised the following: new insulin initiation, increase in the number of glucose-lowering medication classes, incidence of 5 or more measurements of blood glucose of 200 mg/dL or greater, or a new diagnosis of ketoacidosis or uncontrolled diabetes. Diabetes progression outcome occurred in 55. 9% of statin users vs
48. 0% of active comparators. Each individual component of the composite outcome was significantly higher among statin users. Secondary analysis demonstrated a dose-response relationship with a higher intensity of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol lowering associated with greater diabetes progression.

Conclusions and Relevance This retrospective matched-cohort study found that statin use was associated with diabetes progression, including greater likelihood of insulin treatment initiation, significant hyperglycemia, acute glycemic complications, and an increased number of prescriptions for glucose-lowering medication classes. The risk-benefit ratio of statin use in patients with diabetes should take into consideration its metabolic effects. Guidelines recommend statin therapy for all patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 who are 40 to 75 years old and have a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 70 mg/dL or greater for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. 1, 2 However, statin use has been associated with increased insulin resistance and higher blood glucose levels.

### Statin… [^116UpsbD]. Wikipedia (2003). Low credibility.

Patient compliance with statin usage is problematic despite robust evidence of the benefits. Medical uses Statins are usually used to lower blood cholesterol levels and reduce risk for illnesses related to atherosclerosis, with a varying degree of effect depending on underlying risk factors and history of cardiovascular disease. A 2022 systematic review found the absolute risk reductions for three hard outcomes – all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke – to be 0. 8%,

1. 3%, and 0. 4%, respectively. Risk factors for coronary heart disease included abnormal lipid levels in the blood, diabetes mellitus, high blood pressure, and smoking. They recommended selective use of low-to-moderate doses statins in the same adults who have a calculated 10-year cardiovascular disease event risk of 7. 5–10% or greater.

In people over the age of 70, statins decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease but only in those with a history of heavy cholesterol blockage in their arteries. Most evidence suggests that statins are also effective in preventing heart disease in those with high cholesterol but no history of heart disease. A 2013 Cochrane review found a decrease in risk of death and other poor outcomes without any evidence of harm. For every 138 people treated for 5 years, one fewer dies; for every 49 treated, one fewer has an episode of heart disease. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends statin treatment for adults with an estimated 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease that is greater than 10%. Guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend statin treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with LDL cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL or those with diabetes, age 40–75 with LDL-C 70–190 mg/dL; or in those with a 10-year risk of developing heart attack or stroke of 7. 5% or more. However, critics such as Steven E. Nissen say that the AHA/ACC guidelines were not properly validated, overestimate the risk by at least 50%, and recommend statins for people who will not benefit, based on populations whose observed risk is lower than predicted by the guidelines. The European Society of Cardiology and the European Atherosclerosis Society recommend the use of statins for primary prevention, depending on baseline estimated cardiovascular score and LDL thresholds. On average, statins can lower LDL cholesterol by 1. 8 mmol/L, which translates into an estimated 60% decrease in the number of cardiac events and a 17% reduced risk of stroke after long-term treatment. A greater benefit is observed with high-intensity statin therapy.

They have less effect than the fibrates or niacin in reducing triglycerides and raising HDL-cholesterol. Older adults who receive statin therapy at time of discharge from the hospital after an inpatient stay have been studied. People with cardiac ischemia not previously on statins at the time of admission have a lower risk of major cardiac adverse events and hospital readmission two years post-hospitalization. Comparative effectiveness All statins appear effective regardless of potency or degree of cholesterol reduction. Simvastatin and pravastatin appear to have a reduced incidence of side-effects. Women and children According to the 2015 Cochrane systematic review, atorvastatin showed greater cholesterol-lowering effect in women than in men compared to rosuvastatin. In children, statins are effective at reducing cholesterol levels in those with familial hypercholesterolemia. Their long term safety is, however, unclear.

### Diabetes and cardiovascular disease: when it comes to lipids, statins are all you need [^114xCQes]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

LDL cholesterol is the major risk factor for cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients. Statins significantly reduce cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients. Starting statin therapy before diabetes develops and treating to lower LDL cholesterol targets than is currently recommended may reduce risk even further. There is no evidence that other antilipidemic agents improve clinical outcomes.

Statin therapy monitoring in patients with diabetes risk factors — The panel recommends that fasting glucose or glycated hemoglobin be checked before initiation of statin therapy and within 1 year afterward in those with diabetes risk factors. In addition, lifestyle therapies should be emphasized to aid in lowering atherogenic cholesterol levels and for reducing diabetes risk.

Intolerance to statin therapy — management steps include switching to a different high-intensity statin if indicated, switching to moderate- or low-intensity therapy, lowering the statin dose, or using nondaily dosing; in addition, the addition of nonstatin treatment plans to maximum tolerated statin therapy should be considered, as these are frequently associated with improved medication-taking behavior and achievement of LDL cholesterol goals.

Recommendations for adults with high blood cholesterol — risk-based statin therapy are as follows: "In adults at intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), statin therapy reduces risk of ASCVD, and in the context of a risk discussion, if a decision is made for statin therapy, a moderate-intensity statin should be recommended". Targets are specified: "In intermediate risk (≥ 7.5% to < 20% 10-year ASCVD risk) patients, LDL-C levels should be reduced by 30% or more", and "in patients at high risk (≥ 20% 10-year ASCVD risk), levels should be reduced by 50% or more". Diabetes-specific guidance states: "In adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes, regardless of estimated 10-year ASCVD risk, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated", and "In adults with diabetes mellitus who have multiple ASCVD risk factors, it is reasonable to prescribe high-intensity statin therapy with the aim to reduce LDL-C levels by 50% or more". For very high LDL-C, "In patients 20 to 75 years of age with an LDL-C level of 190 mg/dL (≥ 4.9 mmol/L) or higher, maximally tolerated statin therapy is recommended".

Cholesterol reduction — statin initiation and targets (ages 40–75): In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 190 mg/dL, we recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction of ≥ 50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol 70 to 189 mg/dL, we recommend a 10-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease should be calculated; without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, we recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve either a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal < 100 mg/dL or a reduction of ≥ 50%, and with a 10-year risk of 5% to 7.5%, we recommend moderate statin therapy as an option to achieve either a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goal < 130 mg/dL or a reduction of 30% to 50% after consideration of risk reduction, adverse events, drug interactions, and individual preferences.

### 2022 ACC expert consensus decision pathway on the role of nonstatin therapies for LDL-cholesterol lowering in the management of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk: a report of the American college of cardiology solution set oversight committee [^113ibFsf]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

ACC 2022 ECDP — Adults with diabetes without ASCVD and baseline LDL-C < 190 mg/dL on statin therapy for primary prevention: The guideline recommends that all adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes receive at least a moderate-intensity statin, and higher-risk subgroups (including reduced eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and ankle brachial index < 0.9) are potential candidates for high-intensity statin therapy. For the small proportion with 10-year predicted ASCVD risk < 7.5% and no additional high-risk features, moderate-intensity statin therapy with anticipated LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) reduction 30%-49% is supported; soluble dietary fiber and phytosterols may also be considered. Because elevated non-HDL-C (non–high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is common in diabetes, non-HDL-C thresholds are important to consider. If, despite adherence to lifestyle recommendations and moderate-intensity statin therapy, patients have < 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), consideration of intensification of therapy is indicated and routine clinical assessment and interventions are warranted. If the response reaches a 30% to 49% reduction in LDL-C and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL), it is reasonable to continue current therapy. If still inadequate after these steps, the patient and clinician may consider increasing the statin dose to a high-intensity statin. If high-intensity statin therapy still results in inadequate percent LDL-C reduction or LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (or non-HDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dL), the clinician and patient should enter a discussion focused on adding a nonstatin; ezetimibe 10 mg daily may be considered as the initial nonstatin agent for most patients when additional LDL-C lowering is desired.

### Recommendations… [^1113n6ox]. AAFP (2016). Low credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- For most persons with diabetes, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease.
- An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be used to treat hypertension.
- Patients should receive a high-intensity statin if they have at least a 7. 5% risk of atherosclerotic CVD.
- A dosage of 75 to 162 mg per day of aspirin is an option in persons with a 10-year risk of CVD of 10%. From the AFP Editors. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in persons with diabetes mellitus. In 1999 and again in 2007, the American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association joined together to release statements on preventing CVD in persons with diabetes. New data have emerged since the publication of these statements; therefore, an updated guideline has been released. The ADA now states that an A1C of ≥ 6. 5% or previous criteria for fasting glucose or two-hour glucose may be used for diagnosing diabetes. Multiple medications approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration for managing obesity in the long term and short term. BLOOD GLUCOSE Some studies indicate that the possible risks of intensive glycemic control may outweigh the benefits in certain populations, including those with a history of severe hypoglycemia, and a shorter life expectancy because of older age, frailty, or comorbidities. Less strict A1C goals can be used in these persons.

Additionally, less strict goals can be used for patients if the goal is hard to meet even with intensive self-management education, counseling, and treatment with medications aimed at lowering glucose levels. For most persons, A1C should be at 7% or lower to decrease the occurrence of microvascular disease. To lower A1C to this level, mean plasma glucose should be 150 to 160 mg per dL, fasting and premeal glucose should be less than 130 mg per dL, and postprandial glucose should be less than 180 mg per dL. Stricter goals might be beneficial in certain patient populations such as those without significant heart disease, shorter disease duration, or longer life expectancy; however, these should be implemented only if they do not cause significant hypoglycemia or adverse effects.

BLOOD PRESSURE Recent randomized controlled trials evaluating intensive blood pressure lowering to less than 130 mm Hg have determined that there is no benefit in reducing the risk of coronary events. There is no evidence to indicate that intensive blood pressure lowering in persons with diabetes should be a universal recommendation, and more studies are needed to determine the proper goals in persons with risk factors. Most persons with diabetes should have a blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg; however, in some persons, lower goals may be suitable if they are possible to reach without problems. If a person's hypertension is treated with medications, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker should be used, including in persons with chronic kidney disease.

### An assessment by the statin diabetes safety task force: 2014 update [^117W8o15]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2014). Low credibility.

Statin therapy reduces the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death by 25% to 30% in primary as well as secondary prevention patients. Thus, statins are the pharmacologic therapy of choice for the management of high blood cholesterol levels. Prompted by examination of clinical trial data suggesting a modest, but statistically significant, increase in the incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus with statin use, the US Food and Drug Administration in 2012 added a statement to the labels of statin medications indicating that increases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) and fasting glucose levels have been reported with statin use. This labeling change has raised questions among clinicians regarding the relative benefits and risks of statin use, both among patients with diabetes mellitus and among those with diabetes risk factors. This 2014 report from the Diabetes Subpanel of the National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Statin Safety reviews the published evidence relating statin use to the hazard for diabetes mellitus or worsening glycemia, examines potential mechanisms that may mediate the relationship between statin use and diabetes mellitus risk, and suggests future research efforts. Given the well-established benefits of statin therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular events among those with indications for treatment, no changes to clinical practice are recommended other than the measurement of HbA1C or fasting glucose in those deemed to also be at elevated diabetes risk after initiating statin therapy, and potentially before initiation in selected patients considered to be at elevated risk of developing diabetes. The panel advocates following recommendations from the American Diabetes Association, or other relevant guidelines if outside the United States, for screening and diagnosis as well as lifestyle modification for prevention or delay of diabetes mellitus in those with prediabetes or other risk factors.

### PCSK9 inhibitors in lipid management of patients with diabetes mellitus and high cardiovascular risk: a review [^113j7QnC]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Elevated levels of low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) are well established to be associated with the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), defined as acute coronary syndrome, a history of myocardial infarction, stable or unstable angina, coronary or other arterial revascularization, ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral artery disease (all presumed to be of atherosclerotic origin). 1 ASCVD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals with diabetes mellitus. 2 Individuals with diabetes mellitus and elevated levels of LDL‐C are at higher absolute risk of cardiovascular disease compared with those with high LDL‐C without diabetes mellitus. 3 Statin therapy is recommended as the first‐line lipid‐lowering drug therapy for the management of dyslipidemia in individuals with diabetes mellitus (unless contraindicated) in current major US guidelines and recommendations (summarized in Table S1). 1, 2, 4, 5 However, some patients with high cardiovascular risk either do not achieve adequate LDL‐C reductions on statins, or are intolerant to statins and therefore receive suboptimal statin doses or discontinue statin therapy, and thus remain at increased risk of cardiovascular events. For such patients, additional and/or alternative nonstatin lipid‐lowering treatment options should be considered. 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12

PRIMARY PREVENTION: IS THERE A DIABETIC INDIVIDUAL WHO SHOULD NOT GET A STATIN?

Diabetes is a significant cardiovascular risk factor (conferring a three time absolute adjusted risk of CVD death). Furthermore, in individuals with diabetes, a log linear relationship exists between cholesterol levels and CVD regardless of the baseline LDL. Thus, it was assumed, that regardless of the baseline cholesterol level, reducing the LDL will reduce the occurrence of CVD. This led to a number of primary cardiovascular prevention trials using statin therapy as the principal intervention. It has been clearly shown (and thus clearly incorporated into the ADA guidelines) that diabetic individuals with other risk factors should indeed be treated with a statin.

Yet only a few studies have included diabetic individuals without other CVD risk factors (Table 2). In the Heart Protection Study (HPS), 5,963 individuals with diabetes were randomized to 40 mg simvastatin or placebo regardless of their baseline LDL or prior vascular disease status. A significant 22% reduction in the first event rate of major vascular outcomes (first major coronary event, stroke, or revascularization) was noted. Based on the HPS data, an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of lifetime simvastatin treatment found it to be cost saving even in patients as young as 35 years or with a 5-year risk of major vascular events as low as 5% (considered moderate CVD risk). These criteria include almost all of the diabetic individuals, including individuals with type 1 diabetes over the age of 30 years and individuals with type 2 diabetes over the age of 32 years for men and 38 years for women.

### Rationale for new American diabetes association guidelines: are national cholesterol education program goals adequate for the patient with diabetes mellitus? [^112XoDiW]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

Both the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) consider type 2 diabetes mellitus to be a coronary artery disease (CAD) risk equivalent and thus suggest that patients with either diabetes or CAD should have their plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowered to < 2.59 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL). Recently the NCEP issued a white paper suggesting an even lower plasma LDL cholesterol goal of < 1.81 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) for patients at high cardiovascular risk, including patients with diabetes. This rationale was based partly on the higher risk of future cardiovascular disease seen in patients who have diabetes with or without preexisting cardiovascular disease than in nondiabetic subjects with preexisting cardiovascular disease. Additionally, as reported in the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE-IT) study, high-dose lipid-lowering therapy has been shown to further reduce CAD event rates compared with conventional therapy.

### Cardiovascular risk assessment in patients with diabetes [^115qadXq]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

The American Diabetes Association approach

The 2016 American Diabetes Association Standards of Diabetes Care endorses th e use of a risk factor-based approach to decide on initiation of statin therapy. Basically, it recommends risk stratification including 3 variables: age, the existence of previous cardiovascular events and the presence or not of risk factors. ADA risk factors include: LDL-c above 100 mg/dL, high blood pressure, smoking, overweight/obesity and family history of premature ASCVD. All patients with definite ASCVD events should receive high-intensity statin therapy, independently of age. In patients between 40 and 75 years without ASCVD events, but in the presence of cardiovascular risk factors, it is recommended high-intensity statin therapy. In older or younger patients, if in the presence of risk factors, either moderate or high-intensity statin therapy can be indicated, depending on the individual patient preference and tolerance. In older patients without ASCVD events and without risk factors, moderate statin therapy is advocated. In younger patients without ASCVD or risk factors, ADA considers that lifestyle therapy alone may be more appropriate. Recently, ADA has included a recommendation for patients with recent acute coronary syndrome. In these patients, generally high-intensity statins is appropriate, however, considering the results of the IMPROVE-IT study, ezetimibe plus moderate-statin therapy is now also advocated for those with LDL-c above 50 mg/dL, who cannot tolerate high-doses of statin.

Adults with diabetes mellitus older than 75 years — risk and continuation of statins — have increasing ASCVD risk, with a type 2 diabetes mellitus cohort without ASCVD showing MI incidence averaging 25.6 per 1000 person-years in those > 75 years of age and a type 1 diabetes mellitus cohort showing a 10-year fatal CVD risk in those > 75 years of age of 70% in men and 40% in women. Although no controlled statin trials in people > 75 years of age are available, evidence supports the continuation of moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy for primary prevention in those > 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus, who comprise 21% of the population in this age category, and the clinician should note that the benefit may be offset by limited life span or increased susceptibility to adverse events in this age group.

### Lipid-lowering treatment patterns among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with high cardiovascular disease risk [^116DGC6m]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a primary cause of mortality and morbidity among patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with type 2 diabetes have a twofold to fourfold higher risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs) than patients without diabetes. In addition, type 2 diabetes patients with a history of CVD have an increased risk of recurrent events. Hence, high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes should be treated effectively to better manage cardiovascular risks.

Several studies have shown that lipid-lowering treatments (LLTs) such as statins are effective in reducing the risk of CVEs and total mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a recent meta-analysis conducted by de Vries et al, patients with diabetes with CVD experienced reductions in relative risk with standard-dose and intensive-dose statins by an estimated 15% and 24%, respectively, for major CVEs or cerebrovascular events. According to the 2013 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines, patients with type 2 diabetes are one of four statin benefit groups. Along with lifestyle recommendations, the 2015 American Diabetes Association (ADA) Standards of Care position statement for CVD and risk management recommended different statin intensity treatment for patients of different age groups and CVD risk factors.

### Is there a role for coronary calcium in patients with diabetes? [^111UP6yr]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), a significant portion of high-risk patients have diabetes. Two decades ago, patients with or without cardiovascular disease were identified as having coronary heart disease (CHD) risk equivalents because prospective studies showed that they were at risk for future CHD events equivalent to that of patients with established CHD. Thus, for patients with CHD, cholesterol guidelines recommended that patients with diabetes should be treated routinely with statins. However, recently, the treatment of diabetes has been greatly improved, and the risk for ASCVD has decreased. For this reason, it may be appropriate to re-evaluate the recommendations for routine use of statins in patients with diabetes. One of the major advances in the risk assessment for ASCVD is the introduction of coronary artery calcium measurement. This report will examine the role of coronary artery calcium scanning for the decision to initiate statin therapy in the primary prevention for patients with diabetes.

### Comparison of recommended eligibility for primary prevention statin therapy based on the US preventive services task force recommendations vs the ACC / AHA guidelines [^115pJVLU]. JAMA (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance

There are important differences among guideline recommendations for using statin therapy in primary prevention. New recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) emphasize therapy based on the presence of 1 or more cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and a 10-year global CVD risk of 10% or greater.

Objective

To determine the difference in eligibility for primary prevention statin treatment among US adults, assuming full application of USPSTF recommendations compared with the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines.

Design, Setting, and Participants

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data (2009–2014) were used to assess statin eligibility under the 2016 USPSTF recommendations vs the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines among a nationally representative sample of 3416 US adults aged 40 to 75 years with fasting lipid data and triglyceride levels of 400 mg/dL or less, without prior CVD.

Exposures

The 2016 USPSTF recommendations vs 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Eligibility for primary prevention statin therapy.

Results

Among the US primary prevention population represented by 3416 individuals in NHANES, the median weighted age was 53 years (interquartile range, 46–61), and 53% (95% CI, 52%-55%) were women. Along with the 21.5% (95% CI, 19.3%-23.7%) of patients who reported currently taking lipid-lowering medication, full implementation of the USPSTF recommendations would be associated with initiation of statin therapy in an additional 15.8% (95% CI, 14.0%-17.5%) of patients, compared with an additional 24.3% (95% CI, 22.3%-26.3%) of patients who would be recommended for statin initiation under full implementation of the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines. Among the 8.9% of individuals in the primary prevention population who would be recommended for statins by ACC/AHA guidelines but not by USPSTF recommendations, 55% would be adults aged 40 to 59 years with a mean 30-year cardiovascular risk greater than 30%, and 28% would have diabetes.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this sample of US adults from 2009–2014, adherence to the 2016 USPSTF recommendations for statin therapy, compared with the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines, could lead to a lower number of individuals recommended for primary prevention statin therapy, including many younger adults with high mean long-term CVD risk.

ACC/AHA 2019 primary prevention — statins in diabetes states that most patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes are at intermediate or high risk (PCE ≥ 7.5% 10-year risk) of ASCVD events, and three of 4 double-blinded primary-prevention RCTs of moderate statin therapy in this age range showed significant reductions in ASCVD events. A meta-analysis found moderate-intensity statin therapy was associated with a risk reduction of 25%, similar to people without diabetes and with no apparent difference between type 1 diabetes mellitus and T2DM; therefore, moderate-intensity statin therapy is indicated for primary prevention in patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes. Residual risk remained high in trials (e.g., 8.5% had major cardiovascular events in 3.8 years), no RCTs of high-intensity statin therapy have been carried out exclusively in diabetes, and high-intensity statin therapy is preferred in patients with diabetes as they develop risk modifiers.

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^115frQxr]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Both in primary prevention and in the very-high-risk patients, it seems that statins reduce major cardiovascular events irrespective (at least in part) of the baseline and post-therapy LDL levels achieved. Should statins be generally prescribed in a fixed-dose manner? We would not go so far as to suggest that, but indeed, in the diabetic individual whose LDL cholesterol is seemingly within normal limits, this should be considered. The indication for statin therapy in diabetic individuals should not rely solely on LDL levels but on the inherent cardiovascular risk that accompanies this disease (even if goal LDL levels are met).

We believe that the standards of care for individuals with diabetes should mirror the evidence. Replacing a fixed-dose statin trial scheme with a treat-to-target LDL guideline is controversial. This inherent problem of the current guidelines should be amended. Evidence based on "hard" outcome trials of statin use should guide our treatment goals and considerations, not epidemiologic or extrapolated LDL-based data.

Table 1
ADA evidence grading system for clinical practice recommendations

These guidelines are based on numerous trials showing a benefit for statin therapy both as primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and mortality. Trials like the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), proved beyond doubt that patients with type 2 diabetes and other risk factors for CVD should be treated with a statin, apparently disregarding their initial LDL cholesterol level. However, most of these trials did not set a goal LDL cholesterol level for treatment but examined the effect of a predetermined statin dose on the outcome. Extrapolated from these trials and from epidemiologic data, a goal LDL of 100 mg% seems adequate for the majority of patients. Yet because of the problematic interpretation of clinical trial data that was not inherent in its basic structure, alternative treatment goals have arisen, including a reduction of LDL by 40% (in patients where LDL reduction could not reach the 100 mg% goal) or a reduction below 70 mg% (in very-high-risk patients — those with prior cardiovascular disease or acute coronary syndromes).

Some questions are raised from these guidelines. First, the overall efficacy of statin use for primary prevention raises the question who should not get a statin, i.e. what is the evidence for their use as primary prevention in diabetic individuals. Should a statin be given on an LDL-based treat-to-target goal (as stated in the guidelines, reduce the LDL below 100 mg%), existence of other vascular risk factors, age, or regardless of the measured cholesterol at predetermined doses (similar to current use of aspirin).

The second question is what is the evidence for the target LDL in secondary prevention in high-risk diabetic individuals — how aggressive should we be, and should we limit ourselves to an LDL-targeted therapy versus a comprehensive high-dose statin strategy. Again there is the question of the target LDL versus the "evidence-based" fixed dose?

How can we stratify cardiovascular risk in diabetes?

The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology approach

The 2013 AHA/ACC guidelines propose an approach based on the global risk estimation. The panel considers that patients with diabetes, either type 1 or 2, aged between 40 and 75 years, who have a baseline non-treated LDL-c between 70 and 189 mg/dL, should be stratified into a higher or a lower risk category to receive either high or moderate intensity treatment with statins. This categorization is based on the calculation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes.

The ACC/AHA calculator was developed to estimate the 10-year risk for the first ASCVD event (non-fatal myocardial infarction or CHD death, or fatal/non-fatal stroke) by entering definite risk factors. It uses a risk equation derived from a pool of 4 cohorts obtained from the American population. The 10-year risk is based on the first ASCVD event over a 10-year period among people previously free from ASCVD. The calculator should be used in non-Hispanic African Americans and in non-Hispanic whites in the range of 40–79 years of age. For patients with diabetes, the guidelines indicate intensive statin treatment for patients with an ASCVD risk above 7.5% in 10 years. If the risk is below this cut-off, moderate-intensity statin treatment is indicated.

The panel defines high-intensity treatment as the statin therapy able to reduce LDL-c in more than 50% from baseline. Moderate-intensity treatment is defined as the reduction of LDL-c in about 30 to < 50%. In patients aged less than 40 years, or above 75 years, the evidence of benefit is less clear. In these cases, when deciding to initiate or intensify statin therapy, the AHA/ACC panel consider reasonable to evaluate the potential for ASCVD benefits, considering the preferences of the patient and the potential for adverse effects.

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^113SA2Nq]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

The American Diabetes Association (ADA) standards of care for diabetes state that statin therapy should be initiated in individuals with diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors with a target LDL cholesterol of < 100 mg/dl. Furthermore, a possible target LDL of < 70 mg/dl is stated in patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In this mini-review, we examine the evidence that exists regarding LDL cholesterol–based treatment goals in individuals with diabetes. From our review of the current literature, it is evident that the majority of clinical trials were designed using a fixed dose of statins and not in an LDL cholesterol–based "treat-to-target" approach (thus differing from the common design of blood glucose control trials). This leads us to reassess the current guidelines with special emphasis on the very-low-risk and very-high-risk individuals with diabetes, where the evidence is less robust. We conclude that in this subset of individuals with diabetes, statin therapy should be based on the existing evidence and prescribed in a fixed-dose manner.

Recommendations

Screening

In most adult patients, measure fasting lipid profile at least annually. In adults with low-risk lipid values (LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol > 50 mg/dl, and triglycerides < 150 mg/dl), lipid assessments may be repeated every 2 years. (E)

Treatment recommendations and goals

Lifestyle modification focusing on the reduction of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol intake; weight loss (if indicated); and increased physical activity should be recommended to improve the lipid profile in patients with diabetes. (A)
Statin therapy should be added to lifestyle therapy, regardless of baseline lipid levels, for diabetic patients: with overt CVD (A) without CVD who are over the age of 40 and have one or more other CVD risk factors. (A)
For lower-risk patients than the above (e.g. without overt CVD and under the age of 40), statin therapy should be considered in addition to lifestyle therapy if LDL cholesterol remains above 100 mg/dl or in those with multiple CVD risk factors. (E)
In individuals without overt CVD, the primary goal is an LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l). (A)
In individuals with overt CVD, a lower LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l), using a high dose of a statin, is an option. (B)
If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets on maximal tolerated statin therapy, a reduction in LDL cholesterol of ∼30–40% from baseline is an alternative therapeutic goal. (A)
Triglycerides levels < 150 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/l) and HDL cholesterol > 40 mg/dl (1.0 mmol/l) in men and > 50 mg/dl (1.3 mmol/l) in women are desirable. However, LDL cholesterol–targeted statin therapy remains the preferred strategy. (C)
If targets are not reached on maximally tolerated doses of statins, combination therapy using statins and other lipid-lowering agents may be considered to achieve lipid targets but has not been evaluated in outcome studies for either CVD outcomes or safety. (E)
Statin therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy. (E)

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111KzxVa]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Cardiovascular disease risk management in diabetes — risk‑based statin therapy and LDL targets state that the evidence is strong for people with diabetes aged 40–75 years, and current guidelines recommend that in people with diabetes who are at higher cardiovascular risk, especially those with one or more ASCVD risk factors, high-intensity statin therapy should be prescribed to reduce LDL cholesterol by ≥ 50% from baseline and to achieve the recommended LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L). Since baseline LDL cholesterol may be difficult to ascertain in practice, a focus on an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L) rather than percent reduction in LDL cholesterol is recommended, and it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy if LDL goal is not achieved; while there are no randomized controlled trials specifically assessing cardiovascular outcomes of adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statin therapy in primary prevention, a meta-analysis suggests that there is a cardiovascular benefit of adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to treatment for people at high risk.

Dyslipidemia/Lipid Management

Screening

In most adult patients, measure fasting lipid profile at least annually. In adults with low-risk lipid values (LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl, HDL cholesterol > 50 mg/dl, and triglycerides < 150 mg/dl), lipid assessments may be repeated every 2 years. (E)

Treatment recommendations and goals

Lifestyle modification focusing on the reduction of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol intake; weight loss (if indicated); and increased physical activity should be recommended to improve the lipid profile in patients with diabetes. (A)
Statin therapy should be added to lifestyle therapy, regardless of baseline lipid levels, for diabetic patients: with overt CVD (A) without CVD who are over the age of 40 years and have one or more other CVD risk factors. (A)
For patients at lower risk than those mentioned above (e.g. without overt CVD and under the age of 40 years), statin therapy should be considered in addition to lifestyle therapy if LDL cholesterol remains above 100 mg/dl or in those with multiple CVD risk factors (E)
In individuals without overt CVD, the primary goal is an LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l). (A)
In individuals with overt CVD, a lower LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l), using a high dose of a statin, is an option. (B)
If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets on maximal tolerated statin therapy, a reduction in LDL cholesterol of ∼30–40% from baseline is an alternative therapeutic goal. (A)
Triglyceride levels < 150 mg/dl (1.7 mmol/l) and HDL cholesterol > 40 mg/dl (1.0 mmol/l) in men and > 50 mg/dl (1.3 mmol/l) in women are desirable. However, LDL cholesterol–targeted statin therapy remains the preferred strategy. (C)
If targets are not reached on maximally tolerated doses of statins, combination therapy using statins and other lipid-lowering agents may be considered to achieve lipid targets but has not been evaluated in outcome studies for either CVD outcomes or safety. (E)
Statin therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy. (E)

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Adults with diabetes and without ASCVD — baseline LDL-C < 190 mg/dL on statin therapy for primary prevention — are managed as follows: Adults aged 40–75 years with diabetes and without clinical ASCVD and baseline LDL-C < 190 mg/dL are the primary population; adults aged 20–39 years with cardiovascular (CV) risk factors and/or diabetes-specific risk enhancers or aged > 75 years — See Section 5.3.2. All individuals should be considered for at least moderate-intensity statin therapy, with steps to 1. Calculate 10-year risk and consider diabetes risk enhancers, 2. Evaluate and optimize lifestyle modifications, adherence to guideline-recommended statin therapy, risk factor control, and SASEs, and 3. Referral to RD/RDN. If 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, diabetes-specific risk enhancers, or subclinical atherosclerosis, increase to high-intensity statin therapy; among those with 10-year risk ≥ 20%, assess for ≥ 50% LDL-C reduction (and LDL-C < 70 mg/dL or non-HDL-C < 100 mg/dL) on maximally-tolerated statin therapy and, if not met, may consider ezetimibe‡. If the initial risk criteria are not present, determine whether there is ≥ 30–49% LDL-C reduction (and LDL-C < 100 mg/dL or non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dL) on at least moderate-intensity statin therapy; if not, increase to high-intensity statin therapy. Monitor adherence to lifestyle modifications, medications, and LDL-C response to therapy.

### Lipid management with statins in type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111pvDBp]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update on lipid management and recent modifications in cholesterol guidelines for use of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), specifically in patients with diabetes.

Data Sources

Studies and guidelines were identified through a MEDLINE search (1996-April 2005).

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies were selected for review if the primary treatment intervention was a statin, at least 4% of the study population held a diagnosis of diabetes, and diabetes subgroup analysis was available.

Data Synthesis

The Heart Protection Study demonstrated an approximately 25% relative risk reduction of a first coronary event in patients with diabetes, a reduction similar to those without diabetes. In subjects with diabetes, a significant reduction in coronary events was noted regardless of the baseline cholesterol level. The Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study demonstrated a 37% relative risk reduction in the primary prevention of cardiovascular morbidity in patients with diabetes.

Conclusions

Based on the current literature, a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level < 100 mg/dL remains an appropriate goal for patients with diabetes in the absence of established cardiovascular disease. For higher-risk patients, such as those with diabetes and a history of cardiovascular disease, a more stringent LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is an option according to current clinical trial evidence. At least a 30–40% reduction in the LDL-C level is advisable when initiating statin therapy.

### Pharmacotherapy in patients with diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease… [^115f2Ssz]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

In this cohort study of 324 706 patients from health systems across the US, 58. 6% of patients were receiving a statin,
45. 5% of patients were receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker, 3. 9% of patients were prescribed a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, and
2. 8% of patients were receiving a sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Exposures One or more health care encounters in 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures Patient characteristics by prescription of any of the following key evidence-based therapies: high-intensity statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-receptor blocker and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. Overall, 190 277 patients were prescribed a statin, but only 88 426 patients were prescribed a high-intensity statin; 147 762 patients were prescribed an ACEI or ARB, 12 724 patients were prescribed a GLP-1RA, and 8989 patients were prescribed an SGLT2I. Overall, 14 918 patients were prescribed all 3 classes of therapies, and 138 173 patients were prescribed none. Conclusions and Relevance In this large cohort of US patients with diabetes and ASCVD, fewer than 1 in 20 patients were prescribed all 3 evidence-based therapies, defined as a high-intensity statin, either an ACEI or ARB, and either an SGLT2I and/or a GLP-1RA. These findings suggest that multifaceted interventions are needed to overcome barriers to the implementation of evidence-based therapies and facilitate their optimal use. Estimates from studies evaluating individuals with diabetes and ASCVD demonstrate a wide variation in the use of key preventive pharmacotherapies, namely high-intensity statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blockers. Evidence-based therapy was defined as the use of a high-intensity statin, an ACEI or ARB, and either an SGLT2I and/or GLP-1RA. Statistical comparison between treatment groups prescribed each medication of interest was not possible, given the lack of mutual exclusivity; however, descriptive comparisons were made on the basis of clinically relevant differences and narrow 95% CIs, generated using pooled SDs for continuous variables and assumed binomial proportions for categorical variables. Use of lipid-, blood pressure–, and glucose-lowering therapies are presented in Figure 2. Overall, 190 346 patients were prescribed a statin, but only 87 160 patients were prescribed a high-intensity statin.

Use of nonstatin low-density cholesterol–lowering therapies was low, with 8161 patients prescribed ezetimibe and 1055 patients prescribed a PCSK9 inhibitor. ACEIs or ARBs were prescribed in 147 762 patients. Of the antihyperglycemic medications, metformin was prescribed in 120 821 patients, sulfonylureas in 42 027 patients, and insulin in 118 508 patients. Use of glucose-lowering drugs with proven CV benefit was low, with 12 724 patients of patients prescribed a GLP-1RA and 8989 patients prescribed an SGLT2I. Compared with the overall cohort, patients prescribed a high-intensity statin were more likely to be men (59. 9% of patients vs

Dyslipidemia therapeutic recommendations — statin initiation, monitoring, targets, and escalation: A high-intensity statin should be started along with therapeutic lifestyle changes to attain ≥ 50% reduction of baseline LDL-C. Lipids should be rechecked within 12 weeks of initiating therapy, and if the LDL-C, or non-HDL-C concentration remains > 70 mg/dL or > 100 mg/dL, respectively, the statin dose should be increased with the goal of lowering LDL-C to < 70 mg/dL and non-HDL-C to < 100 mg/dL. If these targets cannot be achieved with maximally tolerated statin therapy, then these considerations should include a more potent statin or the addition of ezetimibe, and when treatment goals are not met despite these strategies, bempedoic acid, or pharmacotherapy targeting PCSK9 should be considered.

### Statins for primary prevention in type 2 diabetes [^112qGVwJ]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2006). Low credibility.

At least 1 in 40 people in the UK have type 2 diabetes mellitus, and the prevalence is increasing. Such people are more likely than others to develop, and to die from, cardiovascular disease. Statin therapy helps to prevent cardiovascular disease events among patients at increased risk, with or without diabetes, and is standard treatment for patients needing secondary prevention. Here we discuss whether statins should be used routinely for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes irrespective of other risk factors.

SECONDARY PREVENTION: HOW LOW SHOULD WE GO?

In patients with overt CVD, the guidelines state an optional goal LDL of 70 mg%. This recommendation is based on several recently published trials that examined the effect of aggressive LDL lowering therapy (i.e. high dose statin therapy) in high risk populations of patients (Table 3). In the PROVE-IT TIMI 22 trial, 4,162 patients 10 days after an acute coronary syndrome (acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI], or high-risk unstable angina) were randomized to standard 40 mg pravastatin treatment or high dose/aggressive 80 mg atorvastatin treatment. Patients were followed for 18 to 36 months and achieved an average LDL cholesterol level of 62 mg% in the atorvastatin group and 95 mg% in the pravastatin group. In the aggressive therapy group versus the control group, a significant 16% reduction in the primary end point (a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring re-hospitalization, revascularization and stroke) was noted. 18% of the ∼1,600 patients in each treatment arm suffered from diabetes and showed similar risk reduction to that of the general cohort. A post hoc analysis of the PROVE-IT TIMI 22 trial data revealed a reduction not only in LDL cholesterol but also in CRP levels. This reduction in CRP was significantly associated with a reduction in cardiovascular events irrespective of the associated LDL reduction.

Another important trial was the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study. In one arm of this study, a total of 1,501 patients with diabetes, stable coronary heart disease, and LDL levels < 130 mg% were randomized to receive low-dose (10 mg) or high-dose (80 mg) atorvastatin and followed for 4.9 years. At the end of the study, LDL levels in the low-dose group were 98 versus 77 mg% in the high-dose group. This was associated with a significant 25% reduction in the rate of major cardiovascular events (defined as death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal non–procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke) in the high-dose versus the low-dose group.

The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines recently published its 2018 recommendations on management of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in people with diabetes. For primary prevention, moderate-intensity statin therapy is recommended for those aged 40–75 years, with a preference for high-intensity statin treatment for older subjects and for those with higher estimated risk or risk-enhancing factors following a patient-clinician discussion. Statin therapy may be reasonable in adults < 40 years or > 75 years of age where there is less evidence for benefit. For people with diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, high-intensity statin therapy is recommended. The majority of these subjects have very high risk, and an LDL-C goal of < 70 mg/dL is recommended. If this target is not achieved, ezetimibe and/or a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor may be added.

### The role of lipid-lowering therapy in preventing coronary heart disease in patients with type 2 diabetes [^113RAPTw]. Clinical Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Coronary heart disease is the most common cause of death among diabetic patients. The increased risk of coronary heart disease in type 2 diabetes is due, in part, to lipid abnormalities often present in the diabetic patient. Diabetic dyslipidemia is characterized by elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and an increased preponderance of small, dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) particles. Current guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease in diabetic patients identify elevated LDL-C as the primary target of lipid-lowering therapy, and recommend statins as the first-line treatment for diabetic dyslipidemia. This review evaluates the large statin trials that have included diabetic patients, and discusses the role of combination therapy in managing dyslipidemia in diabetic patients.

### Should all diabetic patients be treated with a statin? [^116ADHW1]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

LDL cholesterol lowering with statins has been previously shown to be beneficial with a substantial risk reduction of major vascular events in a wide spectrum of high-risk participants, irrespective of baseline lipid profile or other characteristics, including diabetes. However, a small number of trials recruited diabetic patients exclusively, and other trials did not enroll a sufficient number of diabetic patients to facilitate prespecified or post hoc analyses of the effect of statins in these patients. In addition, there was scant information about the separate effects of statins on cardiovascular complications and whether the benefits of statin therapy are worthwhile in people with diabetes without a history of clinically manifested vascular disease. A recent meta-analysis addressed these issues and examined the efficacy of statin therapy in 18,686 people with diabetes in 14 randomized trials. During a mean follow-up of 4.3 years, statin therapy significantly reduced the risk of all-cause and vascular mortality, major vascular events, MI, coronary revascularization, and stroke. A salient point is that the proportional effect of statin therapy in diabetic patients was similar, irrespective of whether there was a prior history of vascular disease and other baseline characteristics, namely sex, age, hypertension, pretreatment LDL cholesterol levels, other lipid levels, BMI, smoking, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. The authors suggested that the use of standard doses of statins that reduced LDL cholesterol by almost 40% would prevent approximately one-third of patients from experiencing a major vascular event. Moreover, a greater decline in LDL cholesterol levels is expected to further decrease cardiovascular risk, since the benefits were almost linearly related to the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol, with no threshold below which there was no further benefit. Not surprisingly, evaluation of the outcome of diabetic patients in the placebo arm of this meta-analysis revealed that those with a history of vascular disease had the worst outcome (31.6% risk for major vascular events during 4.3 years of follow-up). The risk for developing a major vascular event was higher in patients with vascular disease without diabetes, compared with diabetic patients without vascular disease (23.5 and 11.8%, respectively), the lowest risk being in patients without diabetes and no vascular disease (8.3%). This indicates that the notion that diabetes is a CHD-risk equivalent cannot be applied to all diabetic patients. The relative risk reduction of major vascular events per millimole per liter reduction in LDL cholesterol in participants with and without diabetes, and with or without a history of vascular disease, was analogous. Despite the fact that the absolute risk of patients with diabetes without vascular disease was lower than nondiabetic patients with vascular disease, the average risk over a 10-year period in those with diabetes, but without vascular disease, would exceed the U.K. National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) threshold of 20% risk at which level these guidelines recommend statin therapy.

### Treat-to-target versus high-intensity statin treatment in patients with or without diabetes mellitus: a pre-specified analysis from the LODESTAR trial [^111bTipb]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Current lipid management guidelines strongly recommend a stringent reduction in LDL-C level among patients with CAD to prevent recurrent cardiovascular events, and the importance of optimal LDL-C reduction is further emphasized in patients with concurrent cardiovascular risk factors such as DM. The 2018 AHA/ACC guidelines for lipid management recommend the use of high-intensity statin therapy to lower LDL-C ≥ 50% from baseline in diabetic patients who have multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Similarly, the American Diabetes Association's 2023 update strongly recommends the use of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention in diabetic patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, despite the well-recognized clinical benefits of high-intensity statin therapy in secondary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with CAD, concerns regarded statin-related side-effects have posed a considerable hurdle for prescription of high-intensity statins and are associated with low drug adherence in these patients. In the 2019 ESC/EAS lipid guidelines, all patients with documented CAD, regardless of diabetes status, are classified as a very high-risk population and it is strongly recommended that these patients achieve at least a 50% reduction in their baseline LDL-C level and maintain their LDL-C level below 55 mg/dL. However, the guidelines also emphasize assessing safety issues and adjusting statin treatment dose accordingly (class of recommendation, IIa). Taken together, two rational therapeutic approaches have been proposed to achieve sufficient LDL-C reduction in high-risk populations: (1) adjusting the statin dose to achieve a target LDL-C level, or (2) initiating treatment with a high-intensity statin until intolerance occurs. However, there is insufficient evidence concerning which approach is most advantageous in terms of efficacy and safety profile in CAD patients, particularly those with DM, the most common cardiovascular risk factor.

### Lipid control in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^111LmhyU]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

In an effort to provide internists and other primary care physicians with effective management strategies for diabetes care, the Clinical Efficacy Assessment Subcommittee (CEAS) of the American College of Physicians (ACP) decided to develop guidelines on the management of dyslipidemia, particularly hypercholesterolemia, in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The CEAS commissioned a systematic review of the currently available evidence on the management of lipids in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The evidence review is presented in a background paper in this issue. On the basis of this systematic review, the CEAS developed recommendations that the ACP Board of Regents then approved as policy. The target audience for this guideline is all clinicians who care for patients with type 2 diabetes. The target patient population is all persons with type 2 diabetes, including those who already have some form of microvascular complication and, of particular importance, premenopausal women. The recommendations are as follows. RECOMMENDATION 1: Lipid-lowering therapy should be used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity for all patients (both men and women) with known coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes. RECOMMENDATION 2: Statins should be used for primary prevention against macrovascular complications in patients (both men and women) with type 2 diabetes and other cardiovascular risk factors. RECOMMENDATION 3: Once lipid-lowering therapy is initiated, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus should be taking at least moderate doses of a statin. RECOMMENDATION 4: For those patients with type 2 diabetes who are taking statins, routine monitoring of liver function tests or muscle enzymes is not recommended except in specific circumstances.

In people 40–75 years of age, use moderate-intensity statin therapy in those without ASCVD risk factors, and use a high-intensity statin in those with ≥ 1 ASCVD risk factor, with an LDL cholesterol goal of < 70 mg/dL (< 1.8 mmol/L); it may be reasonable to add ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor to maximum tolerated statin therapy if LDL goal is not achieved, and use bempedoic acid for those who are statin intolerant. In people > 75 years of age, continue current statin therapy or consider initiating a moderate-intensity statin after weighing benefits and risks.

### Cardiovascular risk heterogeneity in adults with diabetes: selective use of coronary artery calcium in statin use decision-making [^112JcpDb]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association guidelines recommend statin therapy for all patients with diabetes between the ages of 40 and 75, including those without cardiovascular disease (CVD). While diabetes is a major CVD risk factor, not all patients with diabetes have an equal risk of CVD. Thus, a more risk-based approach warrants consideration when recommending statin therapy for the primary prevention of CVD. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) is a noninvasive imaging modality that can help risk stratify patients with diabetes for future CVD events. CAC has been extensively studied in large cohorts such as the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and found to outperform other novel risk stratification tools including carotid intima-media thickness. Moreover, a CAC score of 0 has been shown to be useful in downgrading the estimated risk of a CVD event in patients with diabetes and an intermediate Pooled Cohort Equation score. As clinicians weigh the recommendation for a lifelong therapy and the problem of statin nonadherence and patients weigh concerns about adverse effects of statins, the decision to initiate statin therapy in patients with diabetes is ideally a shared one between patients and providers, and CAC could facilitate this discussion.

Primary prevention with statins in diabetes

Based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, current guidelines recommend primary prevention with statins to nearly all adults with diabetes. The strong indication for statin therapy to patients with diabetes, especially in the presence of ≥ 1 cardiovascular risk factor and/or end-organ damage, is not new and was effective during the present study period. The European (and Danish) guidelines recommend therapeutic goals, but we focused primarily on initiation of statin therapy rather than on treatment goal because it is more important to initiate therapy than to intensify it to fulfil a treat-to-target strategy. Therefore, it came as a surprise that statin therapy had been initiated in less than half of patients with known diabetes before first MI, in particular because nearly all had at least one easily identifiable marker of very high risk, such as hypertension, smoking, family history of CHD, and/or nephropathy. Thus, the current practice of selective use of statins for the primary prevention of ASCVD in some but not other patients with diabetes does not seem to target treatment to those at highest risk. The same appears to be the case in non-diabetic patients destined for a first MI.

### Treatment of diabetes in older adults: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^115277qK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

Management of hyperlipidemia in older adults with diabetes — In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes, we recommend an annual lipid profile. In patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes, we recommend statin therapy and the use of an annual lipid profile to achieve the recommended levels for reducing absolute cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and all-cause mortality. Technical remark: The Writing Committee did not rigorously evaluate the evidence for specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets in this population, so we refrained from endorsing specific LDL-C targets; for patients aged 80 years old and older or with short life expectancy, we advocate that LDL-C goal levels should not be so strict. Epidemiological evidence documents that diabetes is an independent risk factor for CVD, and individuals with diabetes have more than twice the risk for CVD than those who do not have diabetes; most patients aged 65 years and older with diabetes do not have marked elevations of LDL-C, yet these LDL-C levels are high enough to support the development of atherosclerosis.

### Key recommendations on managing dyslipidemia for… [^116nDcCL]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Secondary Prevention For secondary prevention, we recommend moderate-dose statins as the mainstay of treatment. This is consistent with trial evidence, and evidence is insufficient to show improved cardiovascular and all-cause mortality with higher-intensity treatment over moderate-dose statins. 11 Moderate-dose statins have fewer adverse effects than high-dose statins; therefore, we strongly recommend them as the first step in therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk. 1, 6 The ACC/AHA recommends intensive therapy in secondary prevention unless medications cannot be tolerated.
2. We recommend offering more intensive therapy to patients who wish to further reduce their risk. 1 Switching to high-dose statins and adding ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors to statins reduces nonfatal cardiovascular events more than moderate-dose statins alone, each to a similar extent.

11 All were studied primarily in higher-risk populations, such as those with acute coronary syndrome, recurrent cardiac events, or tobacco use. Because of the uncertain long-term effects and high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors, we recommend increasing the statin dose and adding ezetimibe before considering the use of PCSK9 inhibitors.

1. Icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a single randomized trial among secondary prevention patients with elevated triglyceride levels. 2 The high rates of events in the control group and lack of corroborating studies limit our confidence in recommending this medication. Lipid Testing Although the ACC/AHA recommends treating to LDL-C targets, this paradigm has not been prospectively studied. 1, 2 All primary and secondary prevention trials compared medication doses, most often a medication compared with placebo.

Although post-hoc meta-analyses show that higher-intensity medications correlate with lower LDL-C levels and lower event rates, these secondary analyses do not add any specificity to existing trial results. 12 We recommend treatment based on medication intensity to match the evidence, which also simplifies monitoring. After starting medication based on treatment intensity, further measurement of cholesterol is unnecessary. Even while making primary prevention decisions, we find the evidence supports infrequent lipid monitoring. Risk calculators demonstrate that patient factors such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and tobacco use influence risk scores significantly more than cholesterol values. Cholesterol levels are stable for up to 10 years, with most change between measurements due to testing variability. 13 There is no need to repeatedly measure cholesterol more than once a decade for risk calculations.

Using previous cholesterol values to calculate risk every two to five years offers the opportunity to decrease unnecessary testing. When cholesterol levels are measured, nonfasting samples have equivalent accuracy and should be used routinely. Indications for fasting samples are limited, such as verifying hypertriglyceridemia if considering icosapent ethyl. Editor's Note: Dr. Arnold is a contributing editor for American Family Physician.

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^114udzJp]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Table 2
Primary prevention trials and meta-analysis of statin use in diabetic individuals with no other CVD risk factors

On the contrary, the recent Atorvastatin Study for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease End Points in non-insulin-dependent diabetes (ASPEN) failed to show a significant reduction in primary prevention of major vascular outcomes (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, re-canalization, coronary artery bypass surgery, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and worsening or unstable angina requiring hospitalization) with 10 mg atorvastatin in patients with type 2 diabetes. This was partially explained by a short duration of diabetes in the study population, changing guidelines necessitating the addition of lipid-lowering therapy to 26.9% of the placebo group and a low overall event rate.

In the ADA standards of care, a scale of evidence grade is used (A–E) (Table 1), where grade "A" evidence refers to evidence from a meta-analysis that incorporated quality ratings in the analysis. Such a meta-analysis was recently published by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists (CTT) Collaborators. In this work, the effect of statin treatment in 18,686 individuals with diabetes was evaluated from 14 randomized trials (inclusion criteria were unconfounded trials with lipid-lowering primary interventions that aimed to recruit at least 1,000 participants with treatment duration lasting at least 2 years). The mean duration of follow-up was 4.3 years. Participants with diabetes had a 9% reduction in all-cause mortality per millimole per liter LDL cholesterol reduction (relative risk 0.91, 99% CI 0.82–1.01; P = 0.02). The overall effect was a consistent reduction of 21% in major vascular events per millimole per liter LDL cholesterol reduction (defined as the composite outcome of myocardial infarction or coronary death, stroke, or coronary revascularization) (0.79, 99% CI 0.72–0.86; P < 0.0001) (these results did not change dramatically after incorporation of the ASPEN results; a 20% risk reduction was calculated). Subgroup analysis revealed this reduction was consistent irrespective of whether patients had prior cardiovascular disease, other CVD risk factors (hypertension, smoking, BMI, renal function, HDL levels), or baseline LDL (up to an LDL level of 2.6 mmol/l). Thus, even in diabetic individuals without other cardiovascular risk factors, a beneficial effect of statins was noted. This outcome may be a result of the pleotropic effect of statins, as a different mechanism of CVD disease reduction, isolated from their LDL-lowering properties.

Cholesterol reduction — Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline recommendations specify statin treatment thresholds, targets, and monitoring for adults at metabolic risk. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL (≥ 5.9 mmol/L), we recommend high-intensity statin therapy to achieve an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age with LDL-C 70 to 189 mg/dL (1.8 to 4.9 mmol/L), we recommend a 10-year risk for ASCVD should be calculated. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, we recommend high-intensity statin therapy either to achieve an LDL-C goal < 100 mg/dL (< 2.6 mmol/L) or an LDL-C reduction of ≥ 50%. In individuals 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes and a 10-year risk of 5% to 7.5%, we recommend moderate statin therapy as an option after consideration of risk reduction, adverse events, drug interactions, and individual preferences, to achieve either an LDL-C goal < 130 mg/dL (< 3.4 mmol/L) or an LDL-C reduction of 30% to 50%. In individuals with metabolic risk, without diabetes, on statin therapy, we suggest monitoring glycemia at least annually to detect new-onset diabetes mellitus. In individuals aged > 75 years without diabetes and a 10-year risk ≥ 7.5%, we recommend discussing the benefits of statin therapy with the patient based on expected benefits vs possible risks/side effects; decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis and statin therapy should be calibrated to reach the recommended LDL targets.

### The extent to which statins have improved cardiovascular outcomes: lessons from randomized trials and observational studies of "real world" practice in people with diabetes [^115PBRJ8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Statins are the mainstay of therapy for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with diabetes mellitus. It is estimated that there are more than half a billion patients with diabetes mellitus worldwide and the numbers of prevalent cases of diabetes are expected to increase in both developed and developing countries in the next decade. Statins reduce risk of mortality and morbidity mainly by reducing blood low density cholesterol. Statins, along with other medical treatments, are responsible for about half of the decrease in cardiovascular mortality over the past several decades. Multiple clinical trials have found evidence for statin use in patients with diabetes, for both primary prevention and secondary prevention. The benefit of statins in patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes in terms of absolute risk reduction is twice as much as compared to the risk in patients with coronary heart disease but no diabetes. The proportion of patients with diabetes treated with statins has increased steadily over the past few decades with concurrent decrease in cardiovascular deaths in this high-risk population. However, there are significant unmet needs in cardiovascular risk reduction, due to underutilization of statins and due to residual cardiovascular risk despite maximal statin therapy. Future strategies in population risk reduction in diabetics should include maximal statin therapy, additional treatment with nonstatin therapy and new paradigms of prevention with early intervention with shorter, more intensive therapy to potentially "reverse" atherosclerosis with goals of reducing clinical cardiovascular disease later in life.

### Impact of statin nonacceptance on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with diabetes [^1176fxLs]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Among patients with diabetes, cardiovascular events remain the leading causes of complications and mortality. Lowering low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels significantly attenuates the cardiovascular risk for these patients.

Based on this evidence, clinical guidelines universally recommend statin therapy for all patients with diabetes aged 40 to 75 years. Nevertheless, studies have shown that up to 50% of patients with diabetes are not being treated with statins. The reasons behind statin nonuse are multifactorial, including statin‐associated side effects, patient hesitancy, and guideline‐discordant practice from clinicians.

In particular, recent literature has brought to the fore the importance of nonacceptance of statin therapy recommendations by patients. Studies have shown that as many as 1 in 5 patients with guideline‐based indications for statin therapy do not accept their clinician's initial recommendation for treatment with a statin; these patients subsequently have significantly higher LDL‐C levels than patients who start statins right away. Patients with diabetes have a particularly high rate of nonacceptance of statin therapy recommendations. However, the effect of nonacceptance of statin therapy on long‐term clinical outcomes remains unknown. It is possible that in most cases of statin nonacceptance, patients ultimately begin statin therapy after only a brief delay that does not lead to a major impact on their cardiovascular health, or that they use other strategies to lower their cholesterol, including nonstatin therapies or lifestyle changes. We therefore performed a study to analyze the impact of statin therapy delays due to initial nonacceptance among patients with diabetes on long‐term cardiovascular outcomes.

### Statin use and cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients developing a first myocardial infarction [^113TNrpJ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

It has been known for decades that diabetes is a powerful risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Nevertheless, it came as a surprise when a study published in 1998 indicated that the risk for a first myocardial infarction (MI) in people with type 2 diabetes was as high as the risk for a new MI in non-diabetic patients with prior MI. Consequently, the American NCEP (National Cholesterol Education Program) clinical guidelines defined diabetes as a coronary heart disease (CHD) risk equivalent with similar intensity and goal of cholesterol-lowering therapy as in patients with known CHD. Similarly, in 2003, the European guidelines on ASCVD prevention defined diabetes type 2 and diabetes type 1 with microalbuminuria as high-risk conditions and recommended similar treatment goals for diabetic patients without ASCVD and nondiabetic patients with established ASCVD. Today, risk-reducing statin therapy is recommended for nearly all patients with diabetes 40 years of age or older, regardless of cholesterol level.

To what extent this recommendation is followed in routine clinical practice is not known. Therefore, to address this question, we assessed the uptake of primary prevention with statins in contemporary and consecutive diabetic patients hospitalized with MI as first manifestation of ASCVD.

### Comparing eligibility for statin therapy for primary prevention under 2022 USPSTF recommendations and the 2018 AHA / ACC / multi-society guideline recommendations: from national health and nutrition examination survey [^115mjdgd]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The United States Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF) recently released recommendations for statin therapy eligibility for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We report the proportion and the absolute number of US adults who would be eligible for statin therapy under these recommendations and compare them with the previously published 2018 American Heart Association (AHA)/ American College of Cardiology (ACC)/ Multisociety (MS) Cholesterol guidelines.

Methods

We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017–2020 of adults aged 40–75 years without prevalent self-reported atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol < 190 mg/dL. The 2022 USPSTF recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥ 10% and ≥ 1 CVD risk factor (diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, or smoking). The 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guideline recommends considering statin therapy for primary prevention for those with diabetes mellitus, or 10-year ASCVD risk ≥ 20% or 10-year ASCVD risk 7.5 to < 20% after accounting for risk-enhancers and shared decision making. Survey recommended weights were used to project these proportions to national estimates.

Results

Among 1799 participants eligible for this study, the weighted mean age was 56.0 ± 0.5 years, with 53.0% women (95% confidence interval [CI] 49.7, 56.3), and 10.6% self-reported NH Black individuals (95% CI 7.7, 14.3). The weighted mean 10-year ASCVD risk was 9.6 ± 0.3%. The 2022 USPSTF recommendations and the 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guidelines indicated eligibility for statin therapy in 31.8% (95% CI 28.6, 35.1) and 46.8% (95% CI 43.0, 50.5) adults, respectively. These represent 33.7 million (95% CI 30.4, 37.2) and 49.7 million (95% CI 45.7, 53.7) adults, respectively. For those with diabetes mellitus, 2022 USPSTF recommended statin therapy in 63.0% (95% CI 52.1, 72.7) adults as compared with all adults with diabetes aged 40–75 years under the 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guidelines.

Conclusion

In this analysis of the nationally representative US population from 2017 to 2020, approximately 15% (~16.0 million) fewer adults were eligible for statin therapy for primary prevention under the 2022 USPSTF recommendations as compared to the 2018 AHA/ ACC/ MS Cholesterol guideline.

### American diabetes association indications for statins in diabetes: is there evidence? [^111UPJ3U]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Published yearly, the ADA standards of clinical care portray the principle guidelines of diabetes care based on the constantly evolving body of evidence for the treatment of patients with diabetes. The 2008 standards of care state the following for statin use in diabetic individuals:
Statin therapy should be added to lifestyle therapy, regardless of baseline lipid levels, for diabetic patients a) with overt cardiovascular disease (CVD) (A: level of evidence as described in the ADA evidence-grading system [Table 1]); the primary goal is an LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl (< 2.6 mmol/l) (A); a lower LDL cholesterol goal of 70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l), using a high dose of a statin, is an option (E); and b) without CVD who are over the age of 40 years and have one or more other CVD risk factor. The primary goal is an LDL cholesterol < 100 mg/dl (< 2.6 mmol/l) (A).
For lower-risk patients than those specified above (e.g. without overt CVD and under the age of 40 years), statin therapy should be considered in addition to lifestyle therapy if LDL cholesterol remains > 100 mg/dl or in individuals with multiple CVD risk factors (E).
If drug-treated patients do not reach the above targets on maximal tolerated statin therapy, a reduction in LDL cholesterol of > 40% from baseline is an alternative therapeutic goal (A).
Combination therapy using statins and other lipid-lowering agents may be considered to achieve lipid targets but has not been evaluated in outcome studies for either CVD outcomes or safety (E).
Statin therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy (E).

### Dyslipidemia: management using optimal lipid-lowering therapy [^112Sbrqw]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate current approaches and explore emerging research related to dyslipidemia management.

Data Sources

MEDLINE (2004-April 2012) was searched for randomized controlled trials using the terms dyslipidemia and lipid-lowering therapy or statin (> 1000 hits). Separate searches (MEDLINE, Google) identified meta-analyses (2010–2011), disease prevalence statistics, and current consensus guidelines (2004-July 2011). Additional references were identified from the publications reviewed.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

English-language articles on large multicenter trials were evaluated.

Data Synthesis

National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines for the reduction of cardiovascular risk recommend the attainment of specific low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) target values, based on an individual's 10-year risk of coronary heart disease or global risk. For most patients unable to achieve recommended lipid level goals with therapeutic lifestyle changes, statins are the first option for treatment. Results of large, well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that statins are effective in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in diverse populations, including patients with diabetes and the elderly, and that intensive statin therapy provides more effective lipid goal attainment and significantly greater risk reduction in patients with coronary artery disease. Statin therapy is generally well tolerated but may increase the risk of myopathy. Statin use has been associated with increases in hepatic transaminases and an increased risk of diabetes, although the absolute risk of diabetes is low compared with the risk reduction benefit. Combination therapy including a statin may be appropriate for certain populations, but the risk reduction benefits of combination therapy remain unclear. Ezetimibe is an important treatment option for patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not tolerate intensive statin therapy. Although fibrates or niacin improves overall lipid profiles in patients with hypertriglyceridemia or dyslipidemia who are receiving statin therapy, their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular risk remains questionable and their use raises safety and tolerability concerns.

Conclusions

Intensifying lifestyle changes and statin dose should be utilized first in patients not achieving their LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals.
