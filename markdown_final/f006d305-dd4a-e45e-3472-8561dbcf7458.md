## Question

Mild hallus valgus treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options for mild hallux valgus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to define "mild" hallux valgus and the clinical implications of that definition. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence for conservative versus surgical management. Next, I will examine specific conservative options and their likelihood of benefit. After that, I need to review surgical indications, technique selection, and outcomes, including minimally invasive approaches. Finally, I should integrate patient-specific factors, monitoring, and a practical decision framework with clear thresholds and timelines.

> Let me first confirm the definition and clinical relevance of "mild" hallux valgus. Mild disease typically corresponds to a hallux valgus angle around 15–20 degrees and an intermetatarsal angle less than about 13–14 degrees, with minimal subluxation and preserved joint motion, which guides both prognosis and treatment selection [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that these angular thresholds align with contemporary algorithms; yes, many series and reviews anchor distal chevron indications to IMA less than roughly 14 degrees and HVA less than about 30–35 degrees, which fits the mild category here [^155e4658].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence for conservative versus surgical care in mild disease. Wait, let me verify the hierarchy: the best evidence shows surgery reduces pain and improves function versus no treatment or orthosis, but in mild deformity the absolute benefit of surgery may be smaller and conservative measures can suffice for many patients [^f99a8fd7] [^e858db45]. I need to ensure I don't overstate conservative efficacy; systematic reviews indicate low-certainty evidence that orthoses and splints can reduce pain but generally do not correct deformity, which tempers expectations for nonoperative care [^269c858d].

> I will now examine conservative options and their likelihood of benefit. Footwear modification to a wider toe box and low heel reduces medial eminence irritation and can delay progression, though it does not correct alignment; this is reasonable first-line advice in mild disease [^notfound]. Custom or prefabricated foot orthoses can reduce pain in some patients, with low-to-moderate certainty evidence, and may be particularly helpful when there is concurrent arch collapse or metatarsalgia; I should confirm that benefits are symptom-related rather than structural, which they are [^269c858d] [^c1c2ca16]. Night splints and toe spacers may offer short-term pain relief and modest angular improvement in select studies, but evidence is limited and heterogeneous; I need to emphasize that any deformity correction is typically small and not durable without ongoing use [^269c858d]. Targeted foot strengthening, especially for abductor hallucis and tibialis posterior, can improve dynamic stability and reduce pain, though it will not normalize the HVA; this is a low-risk adjunct worth trying for 6–12 weeks [^bf64bf4e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about surgery in mild disease. I should confirm indications: persistent pain despite 3–6 months of optimized conservative care, progressive deformity, or functional limitation that impacts work or recreation are reasonable thresholds to discuss operative correction, even in mild angular disease [^notfound]. Let me consider procedure selection: for mild deformity with IMA less than about 14 degrees, a distal chevron osteotomy with medial eminence excision and, when needed, a lateral soft tissue release is the workhorse with robust evidence for pain relief and functional improvement; recurrence is generally low when technique and patient selection are sound [^f99a8fd7] [^e858db45]. I should double-check that minimally invasive chevron/Akin (MICA) achieves comparable outcomes; large prospective series show significant improvements in validated foot scores and low recurrence at 2 years, supporting MICA as a viable alternative in experienced hands, though learning curve and fixation choices matter [^0fdabbb5] [^2ca28787]. But wait, what if someone proposes a percutaneous transverse osteotomy? Emerging series suggest good outcomes, yet comparative data versus open chevron are still limited; I should caution that technique-specific complications and long-term recurrence need more high-quality trials before recommending it broadly over chevron [^ac54c440] [^31534f05].

> I need to ensure I address patient-specific modifiers that shift the balance toward or away from surgery. Age, activity, comorbidities, and expectations all matter; younger, active patients with progressive deformity and shoe-fit problems are more likely to benefit from definitive correction, whereas older, sedentary patients with minimal pain may do well with conservative care alone [^notfound]. Let me reconsider the role of first ray hypermobility; randomized data do not show that hypermobility mandates a Lapidus procedure over a distal osteotomy in mild-to-moderate deformity, so I should avoid overcalling Lapidus in this scenario unless there is severe instability or arthrosis [^3cf6c63c]. I should confirm that patients understand surgery addresses pain and function, not cosmesis per se, and that recovery takes 6–12 weeks before full shoewear and activity normalization, which helps align expectations [^notfound].

> Next, I should review monitoring and follow-up. For conservative care, reassess at 6–12 weeks for pain, function, and progression; if pain persists or deformity advances, escalate to surgical consultation. For postoperative care, weight-bearing protocols vary by fixation and technique, but many contemporary chevron and MICA series allow immediate weight-bearing in a rigid shoe with staged return to regular footwear by about 2–6 weeks; I should tailor this to bone quality and fixation strategy [^0fdabbb5] [^efdf4f6b]. Recurrence risk is influenced by undercorrection of sesamoid position and metatarsal pronation; I need to check radiographic alignment at 6–12 weeks and counsel on shoe choices to mitigate recurrence, especially in patients with flexible deformity patterns [^c97a56c9].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision framework. Start with education on footwear, activity modification, and a 6–12 week trial of orthoses and strengthening; if pain resolves and function is acceptable, continue conservatively with periodic reassessment for progression. If pain persists or deformity progresses, discuss chevron or MICA osteotomy with transparent risks, benefits, and recovery expectations; reserve Lapidus for instability or arthrosis rather than mild deformity alone. Throughout, align treatment with patient goals, occupational demands, and tolerance for recovery, documenting shared decision-making [^f99a8fd7] [^e858db45] [^0fdabbb5].

> Finally, I should double-check key takeaways to ensure internal consistency. Mild hallux valgus is defined by modest angular deformity with preserved motion and minimal subluxation; conservative care can reduce pain but rarely corrects alignment; surgery is indicated for refractory symptoms or progression, with distal chevron or MICA providing reliable pain and function gains; and patient selection, technique mastery, and expectation management are the pillars of success in this population [^f99a8fd7] [^0fdabbb5].

For mild hallux valgus, **conservative care is first-line** [^e858db45] and includes footwear changes (wide toe box, low heels), custom or over-the-counter orthoses, and targeted exercises to strengthen intrinsic muscles and improve alignment [^269c858d] [^bf64bf4e]. Night splints and toe spacers may reduce pain and slow progression, though evidence for structural correction is limited [^269c858d]. Surgery is reserved for persistent pain or functional limitation despite 3–6 months of conservative therapy, with distal chevron osteotomy or minimally invasive techniques (e.g. MICA) offering reliable correction and rapid recovery [^f99a8fd7] [^0fdabbb5]. Most patients improve with conservative care, and recurrence after surgery is low when indicated and performed correctly [^269c858d] [^0fdabbb5].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is the **cornerstone of treatment** for mild hallux valgus, aiming to relieve pain, prevent progression, and improve function [^e858db45].

---

### Footwear modification

- **Wide toe box shoes**: Reduce pressure on the medial eminence and allow toe alignment.
- **Low-heeled shoes**: Decrease forefoot load and improve biomechanics.
- **Soft materials**: Minimize friction and irritation over the bunion.

---

### Orthotic devices

- **Custom-made orthoses**: Improve foot mechanics, reduce pain, and may slow deformity progression [^c1c2ca16].
- **Night splints**: Maintain alignment and reduce pain, though evidence for structural correction is limited [^269c858d].
- **Toe spacers**: Separate the great toe from the second toe, reducing deformity stress and improving comfort [^448d2b7a].

---

### Physical therapy

Physical therapy focuses on **intrinsic muscle strengthening** — targeting the abductor hallucis, flexor hallucis brevis, and tibialis posterior to improve alignment and reduce pain [^bf64bf4e] — and on **stretching** of the Achilles tendon and plantar fascia to relieve tension and improve foot mechanics.

---

### Patient education

Patient education emphasizes **activity modification** to avoid prolonged standing and high-impact activities, and provides **weight management** counseling to reduce forefoot load and symptoms.

---

## Surgical management

Surgery is considered for mild hallux valgus only when **conservative measures fail** after 3–6 months or when pain and functional limitation persist [^notfound].

---

### Indications for surgery

Indications include **persistent pain** despite conservative therapy, **functional limitation** that interferes with daily activities, and **progressive deformity** with increasing deformity or secondary metatarsalgia.

---

### Surgical options

| **Procedure** | **Description** | **Indications** | **Outcomes** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Distal chevron osteotomy | V-shaped osteotomy of the distal first metatarsal head | Mild deformity (HVA < 30°, IMA < 13°) | - Reliable correction <br/> - Rapid recovery <br/> - Low recurrence [^f99a8fd7] |
| Minimally invasive chevron and Akin (MICA) | Percutaneous chevron osteotomy with Akin phalangeal osteotomy | Mild to moderate deformity | - Significant improvement in pain and function <br/> - Low recurrence <br/> - Early weight-bearing [^0fdabbb5] |
| Percutaneous distal metatarsal osteotomy | Minimally invasive distal osteotomy | Mild to moderate deformity | - Comparable outcomes to open techniques <br/> - Shorter recovery <br/> - Lower complication rates [^0eb858fe] |

---

### Postoperative care

Postoperative care includes **immediate weight-bearing** in a surgical shoe or boot with early mobilization, structured physical therapy to restore range of motion and strength, and regular follow-up to monitor alignment and detect recurrence.

---

## Long-term outcomes and recurrence

Conservative management effectively controls symptoms and slows progression in many patients, though deformity may persist [^269c858d]. Surgical outcomes are generally favorable, with **low recurrence rates** and high patient satisfaction when indicated and performed correctly [^0fdabbb5].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing treatment choice

- **Age**: Younger patients may prefer surgery for cosmetic and functional reasons; older patients may favor conservative care.
- **Activity level**: Active patients may benefit from surgery for faster recovery and return to activity.
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, osteoporosis, and vascular disease may limit surgical options.
- **Patient preferences**: Shared decision-making is essential to align treatment with patient goals.

---

## Conclusion

Conservative management is **first-line** for mild hallux valgus, with surgery reserved for refractory cases. Most patients improve with conservative care, and surgical outcomes are favorable when indicated.

### Does minimally invasive surgery provide better clinical or radiographic outcomes than open surgery in the treatment of hallux valgus deformity? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^31534f05]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hallux valgus is the most common foot deformity and affects 23% to 35% of the general population. More than 150 different techniques have been described for surgical correction. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the use of minimally invasive surgery to correct hallux valgus deformities. A variety of studies have been published with differing outcomes regarding minimally invasive surgery. However, most studies lack sufficient power and are small, making it difficult to draw adequate conclusions. A meta-analysis can therefore be helpful to evaluate and compare minimally invasive and open surgery.

Questions/Purposes

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and prospective controlled studies to answer the following question: Compared with open surgery, does minimally invasive surgery for hallux valgus result in (1) improved American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores and VAS scores for pain, (2) improved radiologic outcomes, (3) fewer complications, or (4) a shorter duration of surgery?

Methods

The systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted according to the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Intervention and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses. A search was performed in the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases on May 3, 2022. Studies were eligible if they were randomized controlled or prospective controlled studies that compared minimally invasive surgery and open surgery to treat patients with hallux valgus. We defined minimally invasive surgery as surgery performed through the smallest incision required to perform the procedure accurately, with an incision length of approximately 2 cm at maximum. Open surgery, on the other hand, involves a larger incision and direct visualization of deeper structures. Seven studies (395 feet), consisting of six randomized controlled studies and one prospective comparative study, were included in the qualitative and quantitative data synthesis. There were no differences between the minimally invasive and open surgery groups regarding age, gender, or severity of hallux valgus deformity. Each included study was assessed for the risk of bias using the second version of the Cochrane tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials or by using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for comparative studies. Most of the included studies had intermediate quality regarding the risk of bias. We excluded one study from our analysis because of its high risk of bias to avoid serious distortions in the meta-analysis. We performed a sensitivity analysis to confirm that our meta-analysis was robust by including only studies with a low risk of bias. The analyzed endpoints included the AOFAS score (range 0 to 100), where higher scores represent less pain and better function; the minimum clinically important difference on this scale was 29 points. In addition, the VAS score was analyzed, which is based on a pain rating scale (range 0 to 10), with higher scores representing greater pain. Radiologic outcomes included the hallux valgus angle, intermetatarsal angle, and distal metatarsal articular angle. Complications were qualitatively assessed and evaluated for differences. A random-effects model was used if substantial heterogeneity (I² > 50%) was found; otherwise, a fixed-effects model was used.

Results

We found no clinically important difference between minimally invasive and open surgery in terms of the AOFAS score (88 ± 7 versus 85 ± 8, respectively; mean difference 4 points [95% CI 1 to 6]; p < 0.01). There were no differences between the minimally invasive and open surgery groups in terms of VAS scores (0 ± 0 versus 0 ± 1, respectively; standardized mean difference 0 points [95% CI -1 to 0]; p = 0.08). There were no differences between the minimally invasive and open surgery groups in terms of the hallux valgus angle (12° ± 4° versus 12° ± 4°; mean difference 0 points [95% CI -2 to 2]; p = 0.76). Radiographic measurements of the intermetatarsal angle did not differ between the minimally invasive and open surgery groups (7° ± 2° versus 7° ± 2°; mean difference 0 points [95% CI -1 to 1]; p = 0.69). In addition, there were no differences between the minimally invasive and open surgery groups in terms of the distal metatarsal articular angle (7° ± 4° versus 8° ± 4°; mean difference -1 point [95% CI -4 to 2]; p = 0.28). The qualitative analysis revealed no difference in the frequency or severity of complications between the minimally invasive and the open surgery groups. The minimally invasive and open surgery groups did not differ in terms of the duration of surgery (28 ± 8 minutes versus 40 ± 10 minutes; mean difference -12 minutes [95% CI -25 to 1]; p = 0.06).

Conclusion

This meta-analysis found that hallux valgus treated with minimally invasive surgery did not result in improved clinical or radiologic outcomes compared with open surgery. Methodologic shortcomings of the source studies in this meta-analysis likely inflated the apparent benefits of minimally invasive surgery, such that in reality it may be inferior to the traditional approach. Given the associated learning curves-during which patients may be harmed by surgeons who are gaining familiarity with a new technique-we are unable to recommend the minimally invasive approach over traditional approaches, in light of the absence of any clinically important benefits identified in this meta-analysis. Future research should ensure studies are methodologically robust using validated clinical and radiologic parameters, as well as patient-reported outcome measures, to assess the long-term outcomes of minimally invasive surgery.

### Hallux valgus surgery in the athlete: current evidence [^e5d28a0b]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Hallux valgus is a common disorder characterized by a medial deviation of the 1st metatarsal, eventually leading to subluxation and pain of the 1st metatarsophalangeal joint. This can inhibit sports activity. Despite being a common forefoot pathology, debate exists regarding the appropriate surgical approach in the athletic population. Paucity in literature exists with reporting of outcomes of 1st metatarsal procedures leading to best outcomes. This review was able to identify 5 studies of surgical correction of hallux valgus in athletes published to date. The aim is to guide the physician in treating athletes with hallux valgus deformity. Currently, the literature supports distal 1st metatarsal osteotomy (Chevron) with a return to activity of approximately 3 months for mild to moderate deformity, and the Ludloff osteotomy for moderate to severe deformity at a slightly slower time frame of return to sports. At best, the Lapidus procedure allows approximately 80% of patients to return to activity. Studies need to document activity level and return to sport in order to help guide treatment.

### Surgical interventions for treating hallux valgus and bunions [^e858db45]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hallux valgus (lateral angulation of the great toe towards the lesser toes, commonly known as bunions) presents in 23% to 35% of the population. This condition leads to poor balance and increases the risk of falling, adding to the difficulty in fitting into shoes and pain. Conservative (non-surgical) interventions treating pain rather than curing deformity are usually first-line treatments. When surgery is indicated, the overall best surgical procedure is an ever-evolving topic of discussion.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of different types of surgery compared with placebo or sham surgery, no treatment, non-surgical treatments and other surgical interventions for adults with hallux valgus.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and trial registries to 20 April 2023. We did not apply any language or publication restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials evaluating surgical interventions for treating hallux valgus compared to placebo surgery or sham surgery, no treatment, non-surgical treatment or other surgical interventions. The major outcomes were pain, function, quality of life, participant global assessment of treatment success, reoperation (treatment failure), adverse events and serious adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias and the certainty of evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 25 studies involving 1597 participants with hallux valgus. All studies included adults and most were women. One study compared surgery (V-shaped osteotomy) with no treatment and with non-surgical treatment. Fifteen studies compared different surgical techniques, including a V-shaped osteotomy (Chevron osteotomy), to other types of osteotomy. Nine studies compared different simple osteotomy techniques to each other or to a mid-shaft Z-shaped osteotomy (Scarf osteotomy). Most trials were susceptible to bias: in particular, selection (80%), performance (88%), detection (96%) and selective reporting (64%) biases. Surgery versus no treatment Surgery may result in a clinically important reduction in pain. At 12 months, mean pain was 39 points (0 to 100 visual analogue scale, 100 = worst pain) in the no treatment group and 21 points in the surgery group (mean difference (MD) -18.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -26.14 to -9.86; 1 study, 140 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence was downgraded for bias due to lack of blinding and imprecision. Surgery may result in a slight increase in function. At 12 months, mean function was 66 points (0 to 100 American Orthopedics Foot and Ankle Scale (AOFAS), 100 = best function) in the no treatment group and 75 points in the surgery group (MD 9.00, 95% CI 5.16 to 12.84; 1 study, 140 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence was downgraded for bias due to lack of blinding and imprecision. Surgery may result in little to no difference in quality of life. At 12 months, mean quality of life (0 to 100 on 15-dimension scale, 100 = higher quality of life) was 93 points in both groups (MD 0, 95% CI -2.12 to 2.12; 1 study, 140 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence was downgraded for bias due to lack of blinding and imprecision. Surgery may result in a slight increase in participant global assessment of treatment success. At 12 months, mean participant global assessment of treatment success was 61 points (0 to 100 visual analogue scale, 100 = completely satisfied) in the no treatment group and 80 points in the surgery group (MD 19.00, 95% CI 8.11 to 29.89; 1 study, 140 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence was downgraded for bias due to lack of blinding and imprecision. Surgery may have little effect on reoperation (relative effect was not estimable), adverse events (risk ratio (RR) 8.75, 95% CI 0.48 to 159.53; 1 study, 140 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and serious adverse events (relative effect was not estimable), but we are uncertain. Surgery versus non-surgical treatment Surgery may result in a clinically important reduction in pain; a slight increase in function and participant global assessment of treatment success; and little to no difference in quality of life (1 study, 140 participants; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect on reoperation, adverse events and serious adverse events (1 study, 140 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Complex versus simple osteotomies Complex osteotomies probably result in little to no difference in pain compared with simple osteotomies (7 studies, 414 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Complex osteotomies may increase reoperation (7 studies, 461 participants; low-certainty evidence), and may result in little to no difference in participant global assessment of treatment success (8 studies, 462 participants; low-certainty evidence) and serious adverse events (12 studies; data not pooled; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of complex osteotomies on function and adverse events (very low-certainty evidence). No study reported quality of life.

Authors' Conclusions

There were no trials comparing surgery to placebo or sham. Surgery may result in a clinically important reduction in pain when compared to no treatment or non-surgical treatment. Surgery may also result in a slight increase in function and participant global assessment of treatment success compared to no treatment or non-surgical treatment. There may be little to no difference in quality of life between surgery and no treatment or non-surgical treatment. We are uncertain about the effect of surgery on reoperation (treatment failure), adverse events or serious adverse events, when compared to no treatment or non-surgical treatment. Complex and simple osteotomies demonstrated similar results for pain. Complex osteotomies may increase reoperation (treatment failure) and may result in little to no difference in participant global assessment of treatment success and serious adverse events compared to simple osteotomies. We are uncertain about the effect of complex osteotomies on function, quality of life and adverse events.

### First metatarsal hemiepiphysiodesis for the treatment of juvenile hallux valgus: a systematic review [^a5d2fbbe]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Juvenile hallux valgus (JHV) is a pediatric deformity characterized by the varus deviation of the first metatarsal and valgus deviation of the proximal phalanx. Among the several surgical techniques available, hemiepiphysiodesis consists of the unilateral growth arrest of the first metatarsal physis. Despite this technique has been proposed over 70 years ago, only a few studies including clinical and radiological outcomes have been published, making the procedure unclear in terms of results. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the outcomes of hemiepiphysiodesis of the first metatarsal in the treatment of JHV.

Methods

Google Scholar, Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane databases were searched for all the articles reporting on clinical and radiological results of hemiepiphysiodesis of the first metatarsal in the treatment of JHV. The selected articles were reviewed to extract demographic data, surgical techniques, complications, clinical outcomes, and radiological parameters.

Results

Six articles were included in the qualitative analysis. A total of 85 patients with 144 halluces valgus were treated through hemiepiphysiodesis of the first metatarsal. The mean age at surgery was 10.7 years (range 5 to 15). The mean follow-up was 2.7 years (range 1 to 7.5). Hemiepiphysiodesis was performed through 2 different techniques. Eighteen (12.5%) complications occurred. The mean American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score increased from 70.6 (range 49 to 93) preoperatively to 89.4 (range 72 to 100) postoperatively. The mean HVA improved from 28.3 (range 14 to 46) to 24.03 degrees (range 0 to 54), and the mean IMA improved from 13 (range 8 to 33) to 10.9 degrees (range 8 to 33).

Conclusions

This review showed that hemiepiphysiodesis of the first metatarsal is a safe treatment for JHV. Improvement in both clinical and radiological results has been observed in all the studies, sometimes being statistically significant. Despite the improvement, mean postoperative radiological angles remained altered and consistent with mild-moderate hallux valgus. This suggests that hemiepiphysiodesis plays a bigger role in preventing the worsening of the deformity rather than correcting it. Randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up and a larger number of patients are needed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of this treatment.

### Percutaneous distal metatarsal osteotomy for correction of hallux valgus. surgical technique [^57ed8632]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Distal osteotomy of the first metatarsal is indicated for the surgical treatment of mild-to-moderate hallux valgus deformity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of a subcapital distal osteotomy of the first metatarsal with use of a percutaneous technique.

Methods

From 1996 to 2001, 118 consecutive percutaneous distal osteotomies of the first metatarsal were performed for the treatment of painful mild-to-moderate hallux valgus in eighty-two patients. The patients were assessed with a clinical and radiographic protocol at a mean of 35.9 months postoperatively. The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hallux-metatarsophalangeal-interphalangeal scale was used for the clinical assessment.

Results

The patients were satisfied following 107 (91%) of the 118 procedures. The mean score on the AOFAS scale was 88.2 ± 12.9 points. The postoperative radiographic assessments showed a significant change (p < 0.05), compared with the preoperative values, in the mean hallux valgus angle, first intermetatarsal angle, distal metatarsal articular angle, and sesamoid position. The valgus deformity recurred after three procedures (2.5%), the first metatarsophalangeal joint was stiff but not painful after eight (6.8%), and a deep infection developed after one (0.8%). The infection resolved with antibiotic therapy.

Conclusions

The percutaneous technique proved to be reliable for the correct execution of a distal linear osteotomy of the first metatarsal for the correction of a painful mild-to-moderate hallux valgus deformity. The clinical results appear to be comparable with those obtainable with traditional open techniques, with the additional advantages of a minimally invasive procedure, a substantially shorter operating time, and a reduced risk of complications related to surgical exposure.

### Radiographic outcomes of a percutaneous, reproducible distal metatarsal osteotomy for mild and moderate bunions: a multicenter study [^0eb858fe]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Hallux valgus is a prevalent condition. Many open surgical methods of correction have been described. We performed a percutaneous, extra-articular distal metatarsal osteotomy for mild to moderate bunion deformity. The minimally invasive technique was used in 217 feet (180 patients; age 49 ± 4.7 years, mean ± standard deviation) at 4 centers in North America (Center 1: November 2012 to March 2017; Center 2: January 2010 to May 2016; Center 3: October 2013 to June 2016; Center 4: January 2015 to June 2017). The procedure was used in simultaneous bilateral cases in 28 patients (15.6%) and in nonsimultaneous bilateral cases in 9 patients (5.0%). Immediate postoperative weightbearing was used in all cases. The mean preoperative intermetatarsal angle, hallux abductus angle, and tibial sesamoid position were 14.6° ± 3.5°, 30.7° ± 7.8°, and 5.4 ± 1.4, respectively. At final follow-up of 9.3 ± 6.1 months, the mean intermetatarsal angle, hallux abductus angle, and tibial sesamoid position were 4.7° ± 2.8°, 8.4° ± 6.1°, and 2.0 ± 1.0, respectively (p < .0001 for all comparisons). No major complications were noted. All 217 osteotomies achieved union; 3 feet (1.4%) in 3 patients (1.7%) experienced asymptomatic malunion. Superficial pin-site infection was seen in 42 (19.4%) of the 217 feet (39 patients, 21.7%). The radiographic results of this percutaneous technique appear to be reproducible across multiple centers, and the technique is useful when correcting intermetatarsal and hallux abductus angles. This percutaneous osteotomy for realignment of the first ray allows immediate postoperative weightbearing and, in this initial review, appears to be safe and effective, even in simultaneous bilateral cases.

### Unfavorable outcomes following surgical treatment of hallux valgus deformity: a systematic literature review [^bd2adeba]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical correction of deformity plays a central role in the treatment of hallux valgus deformity. However, complications or unintended outcomes are frequently noted in clinical series. There has been no rigorous systematic review of studies reporting outcomes of surgical treatment for hallux valgus deformity, to the best of our knowledge.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of studies reporting the outcomes of surgical correction for hallux valgus deformity.

Results

A total of 229 studies met the inclusion criteria. The pooled rates of postoperative patient dissatisfaction and postoperative first metatarsophalangeal pain were 10.6% and 1.5%, respectively. The overall rate of recurrent deformity was 4.9%.

Conclusions

### Surgery vs orthosis vs watchful waiting for hallux valgus: a randomized controlled trial [^f99a8fd7]. JAMA (2001). Excellent credibility.

Context

Hallux valgus is a common foot deformation in adults, but evidence for effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatments for this condition is limited.

Objective

To compare the effectiveness of surgical and orthotic treatment with no treatment in patients with hallux valgus.

Design and Setting

Randomized controlled trial conducted in 4 general community hospitals in Finland in 1997–1998, with a follow-up period of 12 months.

Participants

Two hundred nine consecutive patients (mean age, 48 years; 93% women) with a painful bunion and a hallux valgus angle 35 degrees or less.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to surgery (distal chevron osteotomy; n = 71), orthosis (n = 69), or a 1-year waiting list (control group, n = 69).

Main Outcome Measures

Pain intensity during walking on a visual analog scale (0–100), patient assessment of global improvement, number of painful days, cosmetic disturbance, footwear problems, functional status, and treatment satisfaction, compared among treatment groups.

Results

Follow-up rates at 6 and 12 months were 99% and 98%, respectively. At 6 months, pain intensity decreased more in the surgical group than in the control group (adjusted mean differences, -20 [95% confidence interval (CI), -28 to -12]) and more in orthosis than in the control groups (adjusted mean difference, -14 [95% CI, -22 to -6. At 1 year, pain intensity decreased more in the surgical than in the control groups (adjusted mean difference, -19 [95% CI, -28 to -10]) and more than in the surgical and orthosis groups (adjusted mean difference, -14 [95% CI, -22 to -5]). At 1 year, 83%, 46%, and 24% in the surgery, orthosis, and control groups, respectively, thought they had improved compared with baseline (number needed to treat), 1.7 between surgical and control groups). Number of painful days, cosmetic disturbance, and footwear problems were least and functional status and satisfaction with treatment were best in the surgical group.

Conclusions

Surgical osteotomy is an effective treatment for painful hallux valgus. Orthoses provide short-term symptomatic relief.

### Interventions for treating hallux valgus (abductovalgus) and bunions [^69554845]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hallux valgus is classified as an abnormal deviation of the great toe (hallux) towards the midline of the foot.

Objectives

To identify and evaluate the evidence from randomised trials of interventions used to correct hallux valgus.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Injuries Group trials register (2003/1), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library issue 1, 2003), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2003) and EMBASE (1980 to January 2003). No language restrictions were applied. Hand searching of specific foot journals was also undertaken. Date of the most recent search: 31st March 2003.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials of both conservative and surgical treatments of hallux valgus. Excluded were studies comparing areas of surgery not specific to the control of the deformity such as use of anaesthetics or tourniquet placement.

Data Collection and Analysis

Methodological quality of trials which met the inclusion criteria was independently assessed by two reviewers. Data extraction was undertaken by two reviewers. The trials were grouped according to the interventions being compared, but the dissimilarity in the comparisons prevented pooling of results.

Main Results

The methodological quality of the 21 included trials was generally poor and trial sizes were small. Three trials involving 332 participants evaluated conservative treatments versus no treatment. There was no evidence of a difference in outcomes between treatment and no treatment. One good quality trial involving 140 participants compared surgery to conservative treatment. Evidence was shown of an improvement in all outcomes in patients receiving chevron osteotomy compared with those receiving orthoses. The same trial also compared surgery to no treatment in 140 participants. Evidence was shown of an improvement in all outcomes in patients receiving chevron osteotomy compared with those receiving no treatment. Two trials involving 133 people with hallux valgus compared Keller's arthroplasty with other surgical techniques. In general, there was no advantage or disadvantage using Keller's over the other techniques. When the distal osteotomy was compared to Keller's arthroplasty, the osteotomy showed evidence of improving the intermetatarsal angle and preserving joint range of motion. The arthroplasty was found to have less of an impact on walking ability compared to the arthrodesis. Six trials involving 309 participants compared chevron (and chevron-type) osteotomy with other techniques. The chevron osteotomy offered no advantages in these trials. For some outcomes, other techniques gave better results. Two of these trials (94 participants) compared a type of proximal osteotomy to a proximal chevron osteotomy and found no evidence of a difference in outcomes between techniques. Three trials involving 157 participants compared outcomes between original operations and surgeon's adaptations. There was no advantage found for any of the adaptations. Three trials involving 71 people with hallux valgus compared new methods of fixation to traditional methods. There was no evidence that the new methods of fixation were detrimental to the outcome of the patients. Four trials involving 162 participants evaluated methods of post-operative rehabilitation. The use of continuous passive motion appeared to give an improved range of motion and earlier recovery following surgery. Early weightbearing or the use of a crepe bandage were not found to be detrimental to final outcome.

Reviewer's Conclusions

Only a few studies had considered conservative treatments. The evidence from these suggested that orthoses and night splints did not appear to be any more beneficial in improving outcomes than no treatment. Surgery (chevron osteotomy) was shown to be beneficial compared to orthoses or no treatment, but when compared to other osteotomies, no technique was shown to be superior to any other. Only one trial had compared an osteotomy to an arthroplasty. There was limited evidence to suggest that the osteotomy gat the osteotomy gave the better outcomes. It was notable that the numbers of participants in some trials remaining dissatisfied at follow-up were consistently high (25 to 33%), even when the hallux valgus angle and pain had improved. A few of the more recent trials used assessment scores that combine several aspects of the patients outcomes. These scoring systems are useful to the clinician when comparing techniques but are of dubious relevance to the patient if they do not address their main concern and such scoring systems are frequently unvalidated. Only one study simply asked the patient if they were better than before the treatment. Final outcomes were most frequently measured at one year, with a few trials maintaining follow-up for 3 years. Such time-scales are minimal given that the patients will be on their feet for at least another 20–30 years after treatment. Future research should include patient-focused outcomes, standardised assessment criteria and longer surveillance periods, more usefully in the region of 5–10 years.

### Operative approach to adult hallux valgus deformity: principles and techniques [^4b2abc6c]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2020). Medium credibility.

Hallux valgus deformity is a progressive forefoot deformity consisting of a prominence derived from a medially deviated first metatarsal and laterally displaced great toe, with or without pronation. Although there is agreement that the deformity is likely caused by multifactorial intrinsic and extrinsic factors, the best method of operative management is debated despite the creation of basic algorithms. Our understanding of the deformity and the development of newer techniques is continuously evolving. Here, we review the general orthopaedic principles of operative decision-making and management of hallux valgus deformity.

### Fourth-generation percutaneous transverse osteotomies for hallux valgus [^4e48a338]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants

Consecutive patients who were ≥ 16 years old (with no upper age limit) and were undergoing primary correction of hallux valgus after the failure of nonoperative treatment were included in this study, regardless of deformity severity. Patients were not excluded if they were undergoing additional forefoot procedures, such as hammer toe correction or distal metaphyseal metatarsal osteotomy, or if they had metatarsus adductus, mild to moderate first MTPJ or tarsometatarsal joint arthritis (provided the arthritis was not the primary cause of symptoms), previous forefoot fracture, or naviculocuneiform joint arthritis. Eligibility was also not affected by smoking status or addiction issues. Exclusion criteria included previous hallux valgus surgery, advanced first-ray degenerative joint disease (characterized by either symptomatic arthritis with a positive grind test or a fixed, non-correctable HVA deformity), generalized ligamentous laxity (a Beighton score of > 8), neuromuscular conditions, and bone disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta. For patients with metatarsus adductus, treatment was modified according to its severity, with an additional distal or proximal lesser metatarsal osteotomy performed for moderate to severe cases. In patients with osteoporosis, postoperative protocols were modified to include use of stiff footwear, restricted first MTPJ plantar flexion stretches, and reduced early postoperative mobilization.

Data Collection

All data were collected prospectively and stored in an electronic registry (REDCap) by a dedicated research nurse (C.W.). Preoperative scores were not routinely collected until March 2019. Patients completed questionnaires in clinic or were contacted via email and telephone to complete scores through the REDCap platform.

### Effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions for hallux valgus: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^269c858d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis investigating the effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions for hallux valgus (HV).

Methods

Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched to April 2020, including parallel-group and crossover studies investigating nonsurgical interventions for HV. Two reviewers independently screened articles for inclusion, extracted data, determined risk of bias, and made assessments using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology. Risk of bias was assessed using version 2 of the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Effect sizes (mean differences or risk ratios, and 95% confidence intervals) were calculated and pooled where possible for the primary outcomes, foot pain, and HV angle.

Results

Eighteen included studies investigated a wide range of nonsurgical interventions for HV. Most studies had small sample sizes and concerns regarding risk of bias. Five separate meta-analyses for foot orthoses, splints, manual therapy, and taping added to foot exercises showed no significant effects on primary outcomes. However, results from 8 studies showed a significant pain reduction with the use of foot orthoses, night splints, dynamic splints, manual therapy, taping added to foot exercises, a multifaceted physical therapy program, and Botox injections. Four studies reported a clinically significant reduction in HV angle with night splints, foot exercises, multifaceted physical therapy, and Botox injections.

Conclusion

There is a low level of certainty surrounding the effectiveness of nonsurgical interventions for HV, but a reduction in pain appears more likely than improvement in HV angle.

### The pathogenesis of hallux valgus [^4cf71859]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2011). Low credibility.

The first ray is an inherently unstable axial array that relies on a fine balance between its static (capsule, ligaments, and plantar fascia) and dynamic stabilizers (peroneus longus and small muscles of the foot) to maintain its alignment. In some feet, there is a genetic predisposition for a nonlinear osseous alignment or a laxity of the static stabilizers that disrupts this muscle balance. Poor footwear plays an important role in accelerating the process, but occupation and excessive walking and weight-bearing are unlikely to be notable factors. Many inherent or acquired biomechanical abnormalities are identified in feet with hallux valgus. However, these associations are incomplete and nonlinear. In any patient, a number of factors have come together to cause the hallux valgus. Once this complex pathogenesis is unraveled, a more scientific approach to hallux valgus management will be possible, thereby enabling treatment (conservative or surgical) to be tailored to the individual.

### Osteodesis for hallux valgus correction: is it effective? [^c0bcb97a]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Although the etiology of hallux valgus is contested, in some patients it may be failure of the stabilizing soft tissue structures around the first ray of the foot. Because there is lack of effective soft tissue techniques, osteotomies have become the mainstream surgical approach to compensate for the underlying soft tissue deficiency; osteodesis, a soft tissue nonosteotomy technique, may be a third alternative, but its efficacy is unknown.

Questions/Purposes

We asked: (1) Can an osteodesis, a distal soft tissue technique, correct hallux valgus satisfactorily in terms of deformity correction and improvement in American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score? (2) Is the effectiveness of an osteodesis affected by the patient's age or deformity severity? (3) What complications are associated with this procedure?

Methods

Between February and October 2010, we performed 126 operations to correct hallux valgus, of which 126 (100%) were osteodeses. Sixty-one patients (110 procedures) (87% of the total number of hallux valgus procedures) were available for followup at a minimum of 12 months (mean, 23 months; range, 12–38 months). This group formed our study cohort. During the study period, the general indications for this approach included failed conservative measures for pain relief and metatarsophalangeal angle greater than 20° or intermetatarsal angle greater than 9°. Intermetatarsal cerclage sutures were used to realign the first metatarsal and postoperative fibrosis was induced surgically between the first and second metatarsals to maintain its alignment. The radiologic first intermetatarsal angle, metatarsophalangeal angle, and medial sesamoid position were measured by Hardy and Clapham's methods for deformity and correction evaluation. Clinical results were assessed by the AOFAS score.

Results

The intermetatarsal angle was improved from a preoperative mean of 14° to 7° (p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 1.8) at followup, the metatarsophalangeal angle from 31° to 18° (p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 3.1), the medial sesamoid position from position 6 to 3 (p < 0.001; Cohen's d = 2.4), and AOFAS hallux score from 68 to 96 points (p < 0.001). Neither patient age nor deformity severity affected the effectiveness of the osteodesis in correcting all three radiologic parameters; however, the deformities treated in this series generally were mild to moderate (mean intermetatarsal angle, 14°; range, 9°-22°). There were six stress fractures of the second metatarsal (5%), five temporary metatarsophalangeal joint medial subluxations all resolved in one month by the taping-reduction method without surgery, and six metatarsophalangeal joints with reduced dorsiflexion less than 60°.

Conclusions

The osteodesis is a soft tissue nonosteotomy technique, and provided adequate deformity correction and improvement in AOFAS scores for patients with mild to moderate hallux valgus deformities, although a small number of the patients had postoperative stress fractures of the second ray develop. Future prospective studies should compare this technique with osteotomy techniques in terms of effectiveness of the correction, restoration of hallux function, complications, and long-term recurrence.

### Percutaneous hallux valgus surgery: a prospective multicenter study of 189 cases [^7ee9d7f6]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Distal first metatarsal osteotomies have been indicated for the correction of mild-to-moderate hallux valgus deformity. The aim of this study was to assess the clinical and radiographic results of the distal Reverdin-Isham first metatarsal osteotomy with use of a percutaneous procedure after a minimum 1-year followup. One hundred eighty-nine feet in 168 consecutive subjects were included in the present prospective multicenter study. A radiographic and clinical assessment using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society's (AOFAS) hallux-metatarsophalangeal-interphalangeal scale was performed for all the subjects with a minimum 1-year follow-up. One hundred fifty six subjects (87%) were satisfied or very satisfied with the outcome of the procedure. The median postoperative AOFAS score was 93 points. Subjects averaged a loss 17% of first metatarsophalangeal joint motion. The median hallux valgus angle and intermetatarsal angle improved from 28 degrees and 13 degrees preoperatively, to 14 degrees and 10 degrees postoperatively, respectively. Percutaneous correction of mild-to-moderate hallux valgus deformity with the Reverdin-Isham osteotomy of the first metatarsal enables us to achieve clinical and radiographic results comparable to other percutaneous or open distal metatarsal osteotomies after 1-year follow-up.

### Treatment of progressive first metatarsophalangeal hallux valgus deformity: a biomechanically based muscle-strengthening approach [^77c6d838]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on hallux valgus:

- **Definition**: Hallux valgus is a common foot deformity characterized by a lateral deviation of the hallux and a corresponding medial deviation of the first metatarsal, leading to a bony protrusion at the base of the toe.
- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of hallux valgus is multifactorial, with genetic factors playing a significant role. Biomechanical factors, including the collapse of the arch and the vertical orientation of the first metatarsal axis, also contribute to the development of the deformity. Additionally, wearing shoes that are too short or have high heels can contribute to the condition.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of hallux valgus is estimated at 23% in adults aged 18–65 years and 35.7% in elderly aged > 65 years.
- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for hallux valgus progression include age, female gender, and family history. Wearing tight, narrow shoes, or high heels can contribute to the development of hallux valgus. Additionally, certain occupations requiring prolonged standing or walking and forefoot disorders, such as metatarsalgia and lesser toe deformities, can also influence the development of hallux valgus.
- **Disease course**: Clinically, hallux valgus presents with pain, swelling, and a visible deformity at the base of the big toe. The condition can also cause difficulty in wearing certain types of footwear, including high-heeled and narrow shoes. Hallux valgus is a chronic, progressive, and degenerative condition. Over time, the angle of deformity increases, and symptoms may worsen. In the late stages, the hallux may become painful and lose its functional utility, leading to impaired gait.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis of hallux valgus varies. Without intervention, symptoms may worsen and complications, such as osteoarthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint, may arise. However, surgical intervention can correct the deformity and alleviate symptoms, with high rates of patients returning to both comfortable and heeled shoes post-surgery.

### Bunions [^bcfd7044]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2009). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Bunions are prominent and often inflamed metatarsal heads and overlying bursae, usually associated with hallux valgus where the great toe moves towards the second toe. Hallux valgus is found in at least 2% of children aged 9–10 years, and almost half of adults, with greater prevalence in women.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of conservative treatments, surgery, and postoperative care for bunions? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2008 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: arthrodesis (Lapidus procedure); bone fixation (absorbable pin fixation, screw fixation plus early weight-bearing, standard fixation, suture fixation plus delayed weight-bearing, percutaneous Kirschner-wire fixation); chevron osteotomy plus adductor tenotomy; distal metatarsal osteotomy; early weight-bearing; Keller's arthroplasty; Keller-Lelievre arthroplasty; night splints; orthoses (including antipronatory orthoses in children); phalangeal (Akin) osteotomy plus distal chevron osteotomy; proximal osteotomy, and slipper casts.

### Complications after surgery of the hallux [^8ee60146]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2001). Low credibility.

The great toe is affected by many congenital and acquired conditions including arthritis, hallux valgus, and hallux rigidus and disease of the hallucal sesamoids. Many surgical procedures have been described for the treatment of these conditions. With the increased popularity of forefoot surgery comes the potential for complications even when the surgery is done meticulously by an experienced surgeon under well-planned conditions. When a complication occurs, it can present difficult and challenging problems. It is, therefore, important to recognize a complication early so it may be analyzed and treated successfully. When recognized, a plan should be developed to identify, quantify, control, and resolve the problem. The current review defines some common complications and treatment options. Several problems may exist at the same time. A solution addressing all aspects of the problem must be designed so as not to augment the presenting complications. Salvage operations and long-term treatment are included to provide a perspective on treatment of residual deformity. It is important to realize that there often are several solutions to a difficult problem. Many factors influence the surgeon's choice and implementation of a solution, but the ultimate outcome always depends on a well thought out plan.

### Establishment and validation of a predictive nomogram for hallux valgus with pain under the second metatarsal [^30e2862f]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Hallux valgus is often associated with pain in the second-lower metatarsal, and metatarsalgia is often secondary to metatarsalgia after hallux valgus surgery. In cases where conservative treatment fails, surgery is the final solution. Research by Biz et alshowed that minimally invasive surgery with Reverdin-Isham and Akin percutaneous osteotomy combined with previous exostosectomy and subsequent lateral soft-tissue release is a safe, effective and reliable procedure for the correction of mild to moderate hallux valgus. The use of a minimally invasive intramedullary nail device for the correction of moderate and severe hallux valgus has also been proven to be a feasible method. The ideal treatment aim is to improve and eliminate the associated metatarsalgia while dealing with hallux valgus, which helps reduce the burden on patients and avoids the need for a secondary operation.

One of the most important diagnostic and evaluation basis of hallux valgus is X-ray measurement. The change in the X-ray angle of the foot arch can indirectly reflect the degree of change in the function of plantar soft tissue, and plantar pressure measurement can evaluate the change in plantar pressure. Some studies have found that hallux valgus with second submetatarsal pain is related to socio-demographic factors (age, gender, body mass index [BMI], etc.), imaging factors, hallux valgus angle (HVA), intermetatarsal angle 1–2 (IMA1–2), medial longitudinal arch angle, relative length of the second metatarsal head and gait factors, such as subpeak pressure, impulse and ground contact area of the first and second metatarsal heads.

Although previous studies have obtained relevant quantitative data, the relationship between hallux valgus and the risk of pain under the second metatarsal head has not been determined. Therefore, this study explored the risk factors affecting the occurrence of hallux valgus complicated with pain under the second metatarsal using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Our study aimed to clarify the risk factors for the occurrence of hallux valgus complicated with pain under the second metatarsal, construct an effective model for predicting hallux valgus complicated with pain under the second metatarsal and provide a valuable reference for the diagnosis and assessment of hallux valgus complicated with pain under the second metatarsal in clinical practice.

### PROSPECT guideline for hallux valgus repair surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^056348f4]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hallux valgus is a common forefoot deformity characterized by a medial prominence of the first metatarsus head and a valgus deviation of the first toe, with a prevalence of up to 33% in the general population. Hallux valgus repair is a frequent orthopedic surgery performed in industrialized countries, with estimates of more than 200 000 people operated in the USA every year. Pain after hallux valgus repair has been reported to be moderate to severe, with a median pain score of 5.1 out of 10. A systematic review previously assessed the evidence for analgesic interventions following ankle and foot surgery for inpatients and outpatients, but was not specific to hallux valgus repair. As there is a substantial body of literature limited specifically to hallux valgus repair comparing many preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative interventions to provide postoperative analgesia, a systematic review with an evidence-based approach is necessary to standardize interventions to reduce pain and improve patient comfort after hallux valgus repair specifically.

The PROSPECT (PROcedure SPECific Postoperative Pain ManagemenT) Working Group is a collaboration of anesthesiologists and surgeons working to formulate procedure-specific recommendations for pain management after common surgical procedures. The recommendations are based on procedure-specific literature review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews. A special feature of PROSPECT recommendations is that the methodology considers clinical practice, efficacy and adverse effects of analgesic techniques.

The objective of this review was to systematically assess the available literature on pain management after hallux valgus repair. Postoperative pain outcomes (pain scores and analgesic requirements) were the primary outcomes. Other recovery outcomes, including adverse effects, were also evaluated, and the limitations of the data were reviewed. The ultimate aim was to develop recommendations for pain management after hallux valgus repair surgery.

### What proportion of active-duty servicemembers functionally improve at 1 year post hallux valgus correction? [^5acefdef]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

When the symptoms of hallux valgus persist despite nonoperative management, surgical intervention may be considered to improve pain and restore function. Although most patients return to full or near-full activity after surgery, this is not always the case in higher-demand populations. In fact, little is known about the likelihood of a military servicemember returning to running or military duty, which is analogous to a recreationally active adult, after hallux valgus correction.

Questions/Purposes

(1) What percentage of military servicemembers are able to return to full duty, including the ability to run 1.5 to 2 miles, 1 year after hallux valgus surgery? (2) What demographic, radiographic, and surgical variables are associated with an increased likelihood of return to full duty?

Methods

This was a retrospective study of all military servicemembers who underwent surgical correction of hallux valgus deformities at a single tertiary institution from January 2005 to December 2016. We considered military servicemembers who were treated by four fellowship-trained foot and ankle orthopaedic surgeons and who had at least 1 year time-in-service remaining as potentially eligible. A total of 229 people underwent hallux valgus correction during this timeframe, but only 28% (64 of 229) of patients remained eligible: 41% (93 of 229) were excluded because they were not military members, 28% (64 of 229) were ineligible because they had less than 1 year remaining in service, 2% (4 of 229) were excluded because of prior surgery on the ipsilateral extremity, and 2% (4 of 2292) had an incomplete dataset. Interventions included a modified McBride procedure (9% [6 of 64]), distal metatarsal osteotomies (51% [33 of 64]), proximal metatarsal osteotomies (13% [8 of 64]), and Lapidus procedures (27% [17 of 64]). No bilateral procedures were performed. The mean age of our patients was 40 ± 10 years, and the mean BMI was 28 ± 9 kg/m². In addition, 23% (15 of 64) of patients were nicotine users, 38% (24 of 64) were officers, and 45% (29 of 64) were women. The indication for surgery was functionally limiting pain that persisted despite 4 to 6 months of activity modifications, accommodative footwear, and orthotics. Cosmesis was not an indication for surgery. Before surgery, all patients were unable to complete a 1.5- to 2-mile timed run due to pain. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who returned to full duty, which was defined as the ability to complete a 1.5-mile to 2-mile run for a military fitness test in a fixed time allotment, which varies by age and gender, and the ability to perform military-specific physical tasks at 1 year postoperatively. A secondary analysis according to demographic, radiographic, and surgical variables sought to determine any differences between those who did and did not return to full duty; this was assessed using univariable statistical comparisons at a p value of less than 0.01.

Results

A total of 28% (18 of 64) of patients who underwent surgery returned to full duty by 1 year after surgery as determined by the ability to complete a time-allotted 1.5- to 2-mile fitness test run. Of the factors we explored, we did not identify any variables associated with return to full duty. We note that our analysis may have been underpowered to detect differences among factors that could be clinically important, like BMI, age, and comparisons of officers versus enlisted servicemembers.

Conclusion

Although this study analyzed the functional outcomes of a group of military servicemembers after hallux valgus correction, we believe our findings may also apply to recreationally active adults in the general population. Only a minority of military servicemembers (28% [18 of 64]) returned to duty 1 year after hallux valgus correction, as determined by the ability to complete a timed 1.5- to 2-mile run. We believe surgeons can use the findings of this study to set realistic expectations for recreationally active adults, particularly runners, after hallux valgus correction.

### Should we use intermetatarsal angle as primary determinant to define the limits of distal chevron osteotomy? [^155e4658]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Classic treatment algorithms limit the use of distal chevron osteotomy (DCO) to cases with an intermetatarsal angle (IMA) < 14°. As the IMA increases, it is accepted that the contact between the metatarsal head and shaft will be insufficient. We have investigated the reliability of IMA to predict contact area percentage after DCO. Preoperative radiographs of patients with hallux valgus were subdivided as mild, moderate, and severe using traditional algorithms. After excluding the mild cases, we randomly selected 100 patients (50 moderate and 50 severe) and calculated the estimated bony contact (EBC) with our method and investigated the percentage of patients who could have > 50% contact area if we perform a DCO. Thirty of 50 (60%) and 17 of 50 (34%) patients had > 50% EBC in moderate and severe groups, respectively. We performed DCO for 24 patients (14 moderate and 10 severe cases). The 100-point American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hallux-metatarso-phalangeal-interphalangeal scale was used to assess the clinical outcome. For the moderate group, we calculated mean IMA 16° (standard deviation [SD] ± 1.4°) and mean EBC 66.9% (SD ± 10.8%). For the severe group, we calculated mean IMA 20.9° (SD ± 0.7°) and mean EBC 63.1% (SD ± 10.4%). Paired t tests showed significant improvement comparing preoperative and postoperative AOFAS scores, IMA, hallux valgus angle, and sesamoid position for all operated patients (p < .001). We did not see any recurrence of hallux valgus or hallux varus and had only 1 minor complication that we managed conservatively. IMA may not always be a reliable parameter to predict the stability of DCO. Because the stability depends on the contact surfaces of osteotomy fragments, metatarsal head diameter and remaining bone contact should be the primary concerns. Two patients with the same IMA can have a different contact surface varying on a broad spectrum.

### PROSPECT guideline for hallux valgus repair surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^4ed4912c]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

We adhered to previously described PROSPECT methodology in the conduct of this project. For this study, we specifically searched the following databases until December 14, 2019 for any RCTs: the US National Library of Medicine database (MEDLINE), the Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PubMed, and Web of Science. The following were the search terms: hallux valgus repair OR hallux valgus OR hallux abductus OR hallux abductovalgus OR hallux valgus OR bunionectomy OR bunion OR metatarsophalangeal joint surgery, AND pain OR analgesi* OR anaesthe* OR vas OR visual analog* OR vrs OR epidural OR neuraxial OR intrathecal OR spinal OR caudal OR peripheral nerve OR peripheral block OR regional nerve OR infiltration OR instillation OR NSAID OR COX-2 OR paracetamol OR acetaminophen OR gabapentin OR pregabalin OR clonidine OR opioid OR ketamine OR corticosteroid OR dexamethasone OR patient controlled analgesia OR PCA. We completed this process by hand searching the reference lists of the included articles to identify any additional trials.

We excluded any article describing a phase II study for a drug that was unlicensed at the time of this review, and any study that compared different agents, dosages, concentrations, or analgesic techniques with no control group.

Quality assessment, data extraction, and data analysis adhered to the PROSPECT methodology. Pain intensity scores were used as the primary outcome measure. We defined a change of more than 10 mm on the visual analog scale or numerical rating score as clinically relevant. The effectiveness of each intervention for each outcome was evaluated by assessing the differences reported between treatment arms in each study. A meta-analysis was not performed due to heterogeneity in study design and result reporting, restricting pooled analysis. We also examined whether patients received basic analgesics, defined as the prescription of any non-opioid analgesics such as paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitor.

Recommendations were made according to PROSPECT methodology. In brief, this involved a grading of A–D according to the overall level of evidence, as determined by the quality of studies included, consistency of evidence, and study design. The proposed recommendations were sent to the PROSPECT Working Group for review and comments and a modified Delphi approach was used as previously described. Once a consensus was achieved, the lead authors drafted the final document, which was ultimately approved by the Working Group.

### Third-generation minimally invasive chevron and akin osteotomies (MICA) in hallux valgus surgery: two-year follow-up of 292 cases [^0fdabbb5]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2021). Medium credibility.

Generalizability

The results are generalizable to the wider population of patients once the practicing surgeon has achieved technical proficiency. The range of preoperative deformities and the pragmatic treatment of related lesser-toe abnormalities reflect true clinical practice. The PROMs used are validated and will allow surgeons to draw a comparison between studies of different osteotomy techniques.

Conclusions

The third-generation MICA technique provided significant improvement in clinical measures at a 2-year follow-up with a low rate of symptomatic recurrence in our study of a wide range of hallux valgus deformities. Future research with radiographic and comparative studies to define the role of MICA in treatment for hallux valgus is required.

### A comparison of proximal and distal chevron osteotomy, both with lateral soft-tissue release, for moderate to severe hallux valgus in patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral correction: a prospective randomised controlled trial [^18a75358]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Moderate to severe hallux valgus is conventionally treated by proximal metatarsal osteotomy. Several recent studies have shown that the indications for distal metatarsal osteotomy with a distal soft-tissue procedure could be extended to include moderate to severe hallux valgus. The purpose of this prospective randomised controlled trial was to compare the outcome of proximal and distal Chevron osteotomy in patients undergoing simultaneous bilateral correction of moderate to severe hallux valgus. The original study cohort consisted of 50 female patients (100 feet). Of these, four (8 feet) were excluded for lack of adequate follow-up, leaving 46 female patients (92 feet) in the study. The mean age of the patients was 53.8 years (30.1 to 62.1) and the mean duration of follow-up 40.2 months (24.1 to 80.5). After randomisation, patients underwent a proximal Chevron osteotomy on one foot and a distal Chevron osteotomy on the other. At follow-up, the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) hallux metatarsophalangeal interphalangeal (MTP-IP) score, patient satisfaction, post-operative complications, hallux valgus angle, first-second intermetatarsal angle, and tibial sesamoid position were similar in each group. Both procedures gave similar good clinical and radiological outcomes. This study suggests that distal Chevron osteotomy with a distal soft-tissue procedure is as effective and reliable a means of correcting moderate to severe hallux valgus as proximal Chevron osteotomy with a distal soft-tissue procedure.

### Exploring the relationship between clinical presentation in hallux valgus and response to abobotulinumtoxinA treatment [^908c7186]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The relationship between pain/disability and angular deviation of the hallux valgus (HV), and the impact of orthotic use, laterality, and pain variability on treatment outcomes remain unclear. This was explored in post hoc analyses of a placebo-controlled trial of abobotulinumtoxinA (aboBoNT-A; Dysport®) for HV-associated pain (NCT03569098). The primary endpoint was not met in this study (change from baseline Numeric Pain Rating Scale [NPRS] score vs placebo at week 8); however, there was a greater reduction from baseline in mean NPRS score at week 12 with aboBoNT-A 500U versus placebo (p = .06). Adults with painful HV without surgery were randomized (1:1:1) to aboBoNT-A 300U, aboBoNT-A 500U, or placebo. NPRS was completed for 7 days before baseline and weeks 4, 8, and 12. Over-the-counter orthoses were permitted. Participants (N = 186) had a mean [standard deviation, SD] age of 48.2 [13.1] years, 18% (33/186) used orthotics, and 67% (124/186) had bilateral HV. No associations between baseline pain severity and angular deviation were identified. Participants with high pain variability at baseline (SD > 2) had a poorer response to aboBoNT-A treatment than those with less variability. In conclusion, no relationship between HV-related pain/disability and angular deviation was observed. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: A bunion (medical term: hallux valgus) is a common adult foot problem in which the big toe points inward toward the other toes, and this can be painful. How much the big toe points inward (how deformed the foot is) has been linked to the amount of pain the patient experiences. A better understanding of this foot deformity and bunion pain will help doctors and patients to make the right treatment decisions. A study was completed looking at how injections of a type of botulinum toxin (abobotulinumtoxinA) into specific muscles in the foot may help to reduce bunion pain in patients without surgery. This subsequent analysis of the study data looked at the amount of foot deformity in patients, the bunion pain they experienced, and which factors affected how well abobotulinumtoxinA worked to reduce bunion pain. The results of this study showed that the amount of foot deformity was not linked to the level of bunion pain. When deciding the best treatment option to relieve bunion pain, it is important that doctors not only consider how deformed the foot is, but also other important factors such as foot pain levels.

### Treatment of progressive first metatarsophalangeal hallux valgus deformity: a biomechanically based muscle-strengthening approach [^bf64bf4e]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Synopsis Hallux valgus is a progressive deformity of the first metatarsophalangeal joint that changes the anatomy and biomechanics of the foot. To date, surgery is the only treatment to correct this deformity, though the recurrence rate is as high as 15%. This clinical commentary provides instruction in a strengthening approach for treatment of hallux valgus deformity, by addressing the moment actions of 5 muscles identified as having the ability to counter the hallux valgus process. Unlike surgery, muscle strengthening does not correct the deformity, but, instead, reduces the pain and associated gait impairments that affect the mobility of people who live with the disorder. This review is organized in 4 parts. Part 1 defines the terms of foot motion and posture. Part 2 details the anatomy and biomechanics, and describes how the foot is changed with deformity. Part 3 details the muscles targeted for strengthening; the intrinsics being the abductor hallucis, adductor hallucis, and the flexor hallucis brevis; the extrinsics being the tibialis posterior and fibularis longus. Part 4 instructs the exercise and reviews the related literature. Instructions are given for the short-foot, the toe-spread-out, and the heel-raise exercises. The routine may be performed by almost anyone at home and may be adopted into physical therapist practice, with intent to strengthen the foot muscles as an adjunct to almost any protocol of care, but especially for the treatment of hallux valgus deformity.

### PROSPECT guideline for hallux valgus repair surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^f705752e]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hallux valgus repair is associated with moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the available literature and develop recommendations for optimal pain management after hallux valgus repair. A systematic review using PROcedure SPECific Postoperative Pain ManagemenT (PROSPECT) methodology was undertaken. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the English language from inception of database to December 2019 assessing postoperative pain using analgesic, anesthetic, and surgical interventions were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Database, among others. Of the 836 RCTs identified, 55 RCTs and 1 systematic review met our inclusion criteria. Interventions that improved postoperative pain relief included paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors, systemic steroids, ankle block, and local anesthetic wound infiltration. Insufficient evidence was found for the use of gabapentinoids or wound infiltration with extended release bupivacaine or dexamethasone. Conflicting evidence was found for percutaneous chevron osteotomy. No evidence was found for homeopathic preparation, continuous local anesthetic wound infusion, clonidine and fentanyl as sciatic perineural adjuncts, bioabsorbable magnesium screws, and plaster slippers. No studies of sciatic nerve block met the inclusion criteria for PROSPECT methodology due to a wider scope of included surgical procedures or the lack of a control (no block) group. The analgesic regimen for hallux valgus repair should include, in the absence of contraindication, paracetamol and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitor administered preoperatively or intraoperatively and continued postoperatively, along with systemic steroids, and postoperative opioids for rescue analgesia.

### Postoperative pain management with transdermal fentanyl after forefoot surgery: a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^043f79bc]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

In mild and moderate hallux valgus cases, distal Chevron osteotomy was used. A straight medial incision was routinely performed. The medial capsule was opened in a Y-shaped manner. The medial eminence was excised and a normal V-type Chevron osteotomy was made with 5–6 mm lateral displacement of the distal fragment. In all cases, the osteotomy was fixed with one or two 1.5 mm bioabsorbable pins. Immediate weight bearing was allowed with a special postoperative shoe. In cases of severe hallux valgus, a Lapidus procedure was used. Appropriate resection of joint surfaces in the first tarsometatarsal joint was made with an oscillating saw, and correct alignment of the first metatarsal was checked with fluoroscopy. One 4.0 mm cannulated screw and a medially placed plate with unlocked and locked screws were used to achieve a sufficiently strong fixation. Postoperatively, a shoe was used as above-mentioned, with crutches and only partial weight bearing continued for 6–8 weeks postoperatively. In cases of advanced hallux rigidus, first metatarsophalangeal arthrodesis was the method of choice. A dorsal incision was used and the capsule was opened just medial to the extensor hallucis longus tendon. Hallux reamers were used to achieve round surfaces. A routine method of fixation consisted of two crossed 3.0 mm cannulated screws. Immediate weight bearing with a postoperative shoe was allowed. In cases of mild or moderate hallux rigidus, cheilectomy of the first metatarsophalangeal joint was used. All osteophytes were resected through a dorsal incision. Additionally, 20%–30% of the dorsal joint surface of the first metatarsal was resected. A small corresponding resection was made in the proximal side of the phalanx, if necessary. Peroperatively, 70–80 degrees of passive dorsiflexion was achieved in the first metatarsophalangeal joint. After the operation, weight bearing was allowed immediately and patients were encouraged to move their big toe both passively and actively as soon as tolerated.

### Perioperative analgesia with a buprenorphine transdermal patch for hallux valgus surgery: a prospective, randomized, controlled study [^f013e2fd]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Patients and methods

General data

This was a randomized controlled study and was approved by the Severance Institutional Review Board of Xiangya Hospital at Central South University. The study protocol was designed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki guidelines, and all patients signed a written informed consent form. The study is also registered at. Both the protocol and the statistical analysis plan are available at.

Patients with mild and low-moderate hallux valgus who underwent hallux valgus correction under peripheral nerve blocks between October 2015 and July 2017 were enrolled in the study. All patients underwent a unilateral procedure. We use random number table method, and the patients were randomly divided into the following three groups based on the perioperative analgesic method used: flurbiprofen axetil intravenous injection (Group F), oral celecoxib (Group C), and BTDS (Group BTDS) (n = 30 patients for each group). No significant differences in age, gender, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) of the patients were found between the groups (Table 1). The preoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores, mean preoperative hallux valgus angles and intermetatarsal angles, and total surgical times of the three groups were also similar (Table 2).

### PROSPECT guideline for hallux valgus repair surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^659c8799]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Insufficient evidence was found for the use of gabapentinoids, or for wound infiltration with extended release bupivacaine or dexamethasone, as the analgesic benefits were only demonstrated by a single trial each (table 1). Consequently, future studies are required to confirm the preliminary results of these interventions. Additionally, studies exploring the potential reduction in pain scores beyond the first 24 postoperative hours with extended release bupivacaine for ankle block, along with the optimal technique of injection, would be valuable, although not approved for this indication by the Food and Drug Administration.

Table 1
Analgesic interventions that are not recommended for pain management in patients undergoing hallux valgus repair

Finally, interventions that are not recommended were percutaneous chevron osteotomy due to conflicting evidence, and homeopathic preparation (Traumeel), bioabsorbable magnesium screws, and plaster slipper for immobilization due to lack of evidence (table 1).

The limitations in this review are related to those of the included studies. There was considerable heterogeneity between studies with regard to dosing regimens and route of administration, as well as timing of pain assessments. The small size of many studies has the potential for estimation effect and does not provide safety profile of the analgesic interventions. In a majority of the studies the analgesic intervention was not evaluated against an optimized multimodal analgesic regimen. Indeed, in many of the trials, the patients did not receive basic analgesics inclusive of paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Moreover, pain scores were reported in many trials with unusual metrics, such as summed pain intensity differences through 24 hours; time-weighted sum of total pain relief through 24 hours; time-adjusted sum of pain intensity differences over 48 hours; or total pain relief over 8 hours. Finally, the recommendation on ankle block is based on just two studies and blocks were combined with general anesthesia.

### Comparison of the effects of two different orthoses on individuals with hallux valgus… [^ecb995e5]. ClinicalTrials (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical and conservative treatment methods are used in the treatment of hallux valgus deformity. Conservative treatment methods are more preferred due to possible complications of surgical treatment methods such as infection, skin problems, bone nonunion, bone malunion, hallux valgus and complex regional pain syndrome. Conservative treatment methods aim to reduce the hallux valgus angle in individuals with hallux valgus deformity, reduce pain and prevent the severity of the deformity from increasing. Different orthosis applications are used in the conservative treatment of hallux valgus deformity. In the literature, it is reported that finger spreader orthosis, dynamic orthosis, and night orthosis are effective in the treatment of mild and moderate hallux valgus deformities.

The most commonly used finger separator orthoses and dynamic orthoses in clinics are orthoses with proven effectiveness in the treatment of hallux valgus deformity, but there is no study comparing the effectiveness of these orthoses. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of toe separation orthosis and dynamic orthosis on hallux valgus angle and plantar pressure. The individuals included in the study will be randomly divided into two groups: those using the finger separation orthosis and those using the dynamic orthosis. Foot pressure analysis after the participants use the toe separation orthosis and dynamic orthosis for 1 month will be evaluated. Pressure analysis evaluation will be performed 3 times; before using the orthosis, when first wearing the orthosis, and 1 month after using the orthosis. It is a scale developed by Garrow to classify hallux valgus deformity. It deals with hallux valgus deformity at 4 levels; none, mild, moderate, severe.

The classification is evaluated by comparing 4 different photographs containing the hallux valgus deformity between individuals with the deformity. A universal standard goniometer will be used to measure the hallux valgus angle. To measure the hallux valgus angle, the pivot part of the goniometer is placed in the 1st Metatarsophalangeal joint. One arm of the goniometer is placed parallel to the 1st Metatarsal bone and the other arm is parallel to the proximal phalanx, the angle between them is measured and the hallux valgus angle is found.

### PROSPECT guideline for hallux valgus repair surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^4b4b7b8c]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, this review has identified that analgesic regimen for hallux valgus repair should include, in the absence of contraindications, paracetamol and a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitor administered preoperatively or intraoperatively and continued postoperatively, along with systemic steroids, and postoperative opioids for rescue analgesia. As a regional technique, ankle block should be preferred, while wound infiltration with local anesthetic constitutes a reasonable alternative. There is insufficient evidence to recommend gabapentinoids or wound infiltration with extended release bupivacaine after hallux valgus repair.

### Metatarsal pronation in hallux valgus deformity: a review [^cd71b91b]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Hallux valgus deformity has historically been defined as a varus deviation of the first metatarsal bone and a valgus orientation of the hallux, without considering additional components of the deformity. Classic teaching decades ago considered just the intermetatarsal angle to guide treatment, and certain algorithms were applied by this angular measure. Over the past 5 years, new information has been published regarding the multiplanar characteristic of hallux valgus deformity, and considerable importance has been given to the rotational deformity of the first ray.

### The SERI distal metatarsal osteotomy and scarf osteotomy provide similar correction of hallux valgus [^04e4b42c]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Ideal surgical treatment for hallux valgus is still controversial. A traditional distal metatarsal osteotomy with rigid fixation (Scarf procedure) and a more minimally invasive approach to a distal metatarsal osteotomy, termed SERI (Simple, Effective, Rapid, Inexpensive), have proven successful with short-term followup. However, no data are available directly comparing the two procedures.

Questions/Purposes

We performed a prospective randomized trial to determine which technique (SERI or Scarf) was associated with (1) better functional outcomes, (2) better radiographic correction, and (3) fewer complications at 2 and 7 years followup.

Methods

Twenty patients, 53 ± 11 years of age, with bilateral hallux valgus, clinically and radiographically similar, underwent bilateral surgery with Scarf on one side and SERI on the other, at random. Clinical (AOFAS score) and radiographic assessments were considered before surgery, and at 7 years followup.

Results

SERI and Scarf techniques provided correction of the hallux valgus angle, intermetatarsal angle, and distal metatarsal angle in the range of normal. Both led to similar clinically important improvements in the AOFAS. No differences were observed between the groups. All osteotomies healed, and two patients who underwent the Scarf procedure required hardware removal. Reduction of ROM with respect to preoperative was observed in three patients for SERI and three patients for Scarf procedures.

Conclusions

Scarf and SERI techniques resulted in effective correction of hallux valgus with similar outcomes, however the SERI technique required a shorter skin incision, less surgical time, less expensive fixation device, and was without residual pain attributable to hardware.

### Do weight-bearing films affect decision making in hallux valgus surgery? [^a20dd1a2]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Hallux valgus is a complex deformity of the first ray and forefoot that can be surgically treated using different procedures and osteotomies. Preoperative planning includes anteroposterior and lateral plain films. The effect of weight-bearing on the results of the standardized measurements is still the subject of debate. We evaluated the effect of weight-bearing on the results of measurements and decision making by expert evaluators. A total of 21 foot and ankle surgeons were given weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing anteroposterior plain foot films of patients with hallux valgus. They were asked to measure 3 standard angles and then to select the most appropriate procedure from a short list. Using a paired Student's t test, no difference in the angles measured nor in the procedures chosen was detected between the weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing films. Although it is generally accepted that decisions regarding the treatment of hallux valgus should be based on plain weight-bearing films, in the present study, we established that non-weight-bearing films can reliably be used to choose the surgical procedure.

### Pain management after hallux valgus repair surgery: an updated systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management (PROSPECT) recommendations [^11498e71]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Hallux valgus repair surgery is associated with moderate-to-severe postoperative pain. The aim of this systematic review was to assess the available literature and update previous PROSPECT (PROcedure SPECific Postoperative Pain ManagemenT) recommendations for optimal pain management after hallux valgus repair surgery.

Methods

A systematic review utilising PROSPECT methodology was performed. Randomised controlled trials and systematic reviews published in the English language from January 1, 2019 to November 19, 2024 that assessed postoperative pain using analgesic, anaesthetic and surgical interventions were identified from CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE and Web of Science.

Results

Of the 375 articles identified, 17 RCTs and 7 systematic reviews/meta-analyses met our inclusion criteria (total: 24 publications). Interventions that improved postoperative pain relief included: paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors; dexamethasone; ankle block and, as an alternative, local anaesthetic wound infiltration; and minimally invasive surgery or percutaneous osteotomy. Insufficient evidence was found for the use of perineural magnesium or liposomal bupivacaine. No evidence was found for continuous popliteal sciatic nerve block or for the use of the plantar compartment nerve block.

Discussion

This review provides an update to the previous guidelines written by the PROSPECT group: there is one important change, minimally invasive surgery or percutaneous osteotomy is recommended over open osteotomy. Contemporary publications confirm the analgesic effects of ankle block as a first-choice modality with wound infiltration as an alternative. In addition, the analgesic regimen for hallux valgus repair should include, in the absence of contraindication, paracetamol and a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitor administered preoperatively or intra-operatively and continued postoperatively, along with systemic dexamethasone, and postoperative opioids for rescue analgesia.

### Minimally invasive hallux valgus correction [^513acb90]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

The most common complication following minimally invasive surgery (MIS) foot procedures is recurrence of the deformity, likely a direct consequence of incorrect selection of the procedure, incorrect surgical technique, or underestimated healing time of the osteotomy. This article describes our surgical MIS for hallux valgus correction, including the postoperative management, and reviews the literature on MIS for hallux valgus correction. The reports on such techniques are few, and mainly case series are reported. More adequately planned and executed randomized prospective clinical trials are needed. Historical attempts, indications, preferred surgical techniques, and complications are discussed.

### PROSPECT guideline for hallux valgus repair surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^d54f22a2]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Following the PROSPECT approach and based on available evidence, recommendations for analgesia following hallux valgus repair include paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors, started preoperatively or intraoperatively and continued in the postoperative period, along with systemic steroids administered preoperatively or just before surgery, but only in the absence of contraindications (box 1). An ankle block should be the preferred analgesic technique, while wound infiltration with local anesthetic constitutes a reasonable alternative (box 1). Of note, continuous local anesthetic wound infusion without a preliminary bolus does not provide postoperative analgesia and is therefore not recommended. With concerns of opioid-related adverse effects such as postoperative nausea and vomitingand the contribution to the current opioid crisis, opioids should only be considered as rescue analgesics, if the above recommended approaches are not adequate (box 1).

Although there is limited procedure-specific evidence for paracetamol, as only one trial investigated the analgesic efficacy of this medication for hallux valgus specifically, the methodology was robust, with more than 300 patients included. Also, the PROSPECT methodology considers paracetamol as basic analgesic because it is well tolerated without significant side effects and has a favorable risk-benefit profile.

Regarding systemic steroids, although the studies used intramuscular betamethasone and oral dexamethasone, the effects of these drugs are systemic. We recommend intravenous dexamethasone because it is recommended for postoperative nausea and vomiting prophylaxis. Moreover, intravenous dexamethasone enhances the impact of a regional analgesic technique such as ankle block or anesthetic infiltration.

To date, only two trials have investigated the benefit of an ankle block for this surgery specifically, but they both showed an important effect size. Additionally, two trials published more than 15 years ago concluded that an anatomical landmark ankle block combined with general anesthesia reduced pain scoresor increased the time to first pain after forefoot surgery, when compared with general anesthesia alone. Despite the publication of a single trial showing the superiority of the ankle block over wound infiltration of local anesthetics, ankle block should be favored as it may allow the surgery to be performed without additional general or spinal anesthesia. Moreover, it also reduces the anesthesia-related time in the operating theater, especially if the regional procedure is performed prior to operating room entry.

### Is our current paradigm for evaluation and management of the bunion deformity flawed? A discussion of procedure philosophy relative to anatomy [^459ddaeb]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Of the > 100 procedures that have been proposed to treat hallux valgus or the "bunion" deformity, most have focused on correction through metatarsal osteotomies at various levels combined with soft tissue balancing procedures at the first metatarsophalangeal joint. This paradigm of metatarsal osteotomy and soft tissue balancing has been so commonplace, any argument for a fundamental change to the approach becomes uncomfortable and seems unwarranted to most foot and ankle surgeons. However, the simple fact that so many procedures exist, with so many modifications of these procedures, can be interpreted as a failure of our basic paradigm of metatarsal osteotomy and soft tissue balancing. We have observed that failure to recognize frontal plane rotation of the first metatarsal and our willingness to ignore deformity correction principles and create osteotomies outside the center of rotation of angulation are factors that can result in inconsistent outcomes. Our current multiprocedural mindset drives the search for yet more procedures and modifications in an attempt to reduce the incidence of complications. We present an anatomic analysis of hallux abducto valgus and metatarsus primus adducto valgus and critically analyze some of the shortcomings of currently popular corrective procedures. We also review the available data regarding frontal plane rotation of the first metatarsal and propose a new paradigm that considers frontal plane rotation of the first metatarsal as a priority in choosing the most appropriate procedure for bunion correction.

### The effects of a new foot-toe orthosis in treating painful hallux valgus [^448d2b7a]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the effects of a new foot-toe orthosis on painful hallux valgus.

Design

Uncontrolled intervention study.

Setting

An outpatient clinic in a tertiary medical center with an orthotic laboratory in Taiwan.

Participants

Seventeen patients with painful hallux valgus.

Intervention

Application of a new total contact insole with fixed toe separator.

Main Outcome Measures

The hallux valgus angle, an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS-11) for pain assessment, and walking ability scale.

Results

The average hallux valgus angle reduction ± standard deviation was 6.5 degrees ± 3.8 degrees after insole application (P < .001). An improvement on the NRS-11 pain scale from 4.06 ± 2.8 to 0.88 ± 1.17 (P < .001) was noted after immediate insole application and was.42 ± .67 (P = 0.002) 3 months later for the 12 patients who completed the study. The walking ability scale improved at least 1 grade or more after the insole was worn for 3 months (P = 0.002). All patients tolerated the insole well without any clinical evidence of skin ulcers or blisters.

Conclusion

Our new total contact insole with fixed toe separator reduced pain, and improved walking ability and the hallux valgus angle. It is an effective alternative treatment for patients with painful hallux valgus.

### Fourth-generation percutaneous transverse osteotomies for hallux valgus [^799aaefa]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In conclusion, fourth-generation percutaneous hallux valgus correction utilizing a transverse osteotomy is safe and effective. This technique offers large deformity correction with significant improvement in foot function and a low risk of complications such as screw removal and nonunion. Further work should focus on evaluation of this technique in comparison with other surgical techniques as well as longer-term outcomes in more diverse populations, to determine if the results found here are reproducible.

### Clinical rating systems for the ankle-hindfoot, midfoot, hallux, and lesser toes [^bd5a83cf]. Foot & Ankle International (1994). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Hallux Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal Rating System (AOFAS score)" for hallux valgus.

The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Hallux Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal Rating System, commonly referred to as the AOFAS score, is a clinical tool used to evaluate the condition of the foot and ankle, specifically the hallux metatarsophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. This calculator is primarily used in patients with foot and ankle disorders, including but not limited to hallux rigidus, hallux valgus, and other deformities or injuries of the big toe.

The AOFAS score provides a comprehensive assessment of the patient's foot and ankle condition, taking into account pain, function (including limitation of activity and walking distance), and alignment. The score ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better foot and ankle health.

The AOFAS score is not recommended for use in patients with systemic conditions that may affect the foot and ankle, such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, as these conditions may confound the score. It is also not suitable for use in children or in patients with cognitive impairment who may not be able to accurately report their symptoms.

The American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Hallux Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal Rating System (AOFAS score) assesses foot health based on several functional and anatomical criteria. The assessment involves a patient's responses related to various facets of foot pain and functionality, translating these responses into a score that categorizes overall foot health.

Here are the input categories and their scoring:

- **Pain**:
- None (40 points)
- Mild, occasional (30 points)
- Moderate, daily (20 points)
- Severe, almost always (0 points)

- **Function, activity limitations**:
- No activity limitations (10 points)
- Limitations on recreational activities (7 points)
- Some limitations on daily and recreational activities (4 points)
- Severe limitations on daily and recreational activities (0 points)

- **Function, footwear requirements**:
- Can wear conventional shoes (10 points)
- Comfort footwear and shoe insert required (5 points)
- Modified shoes or brace required (0 points)

- **Function, metatarsophalangeal joint motion (dorsiflexion plus plantarflexion)**:
- Normal or mild restriction (≥ 75 degrees) (10 points)
- Moderate restriction (30–74 degrees) (5 points)
- Severe restriction (< 30 degrees) (0 points)

- **Function, interphalangeal joint motion (plantarflexion)**:
- No restriction (5 points)
- Severe restriction (< 10 degrees) (0 points)

- **Function, metatarsophalangeal-interphalangeal stability (all directions)**:
- Stable (5 points)
- Unstable or able to dislocate (0 points)

- **Function, callus or corn/clavus**:
- No or asymptomatic callus or corn/clavus (5 points)
- Painful callus or corn/clavus (0 points)

- **Alignment**:
- Good, well-aligned (15 points)
- Fair, mild-to-moderate malalignment (8 points)
- Poor, severe malalignment (0 points)

After each condition is evaluated, the associated points are summed to provide a total score ranging from 0 to 100. This score is then interpreted to categorize the foot's condition:

- A score of 90 to 100 is considered "Excellent", reflecting optimal foot health and function with minimal or no limitations.
- Scores between 75 and 89 are labeled "Good", indicating a satisfactory degree of foot function with minor issues.
- A score from 60 to 74 is termed "Fair", suggesting notable limitations that may affect daily activities.
- Scores below 60 are categorized as "Poor", signifying significant impairments that substantially hinder foot function and comfort.

This scoring system allows patients and clinicians to quantitatively assess the impact of foot conditions on daily life and to gauge improvements or deteriorations over time.

### Third-generation minimally invasive chevron and akin osteotomies (MICA) in hallux valgus surgery: two-year follow-up of 292 cases [^b95c0924]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2021). Medium credibility.

Multivariable Linear Regression Analysis

The model identified that the significant factors affecting the change in the MOXFQ index score following MICA are the preoperative MOXFQ scores in the social interaction and walking/standing domains, change in the HVA, and age. The effect of the other variables on the change in the MOXFQ index score varied but none were statistically significant. The multivariable linear regression results are consistent with expected findings in clinical practice — for example, patients with an improvement in the HVA may well be expected to have an improvement in their MOXFQ index score. The preoperative MOXFQ pain score was not significantly related to the change in the MOXFQ index score 2 years following surgery. We were unable to identify other studies performing regression analysis for minimally invasive hallux valgus surgery, which prevented us from making comparisons. However, Chong et al. performed regression analysis on a population consisting predominantly of patients treated with scarf osteotomies and found no association between radiographic evidence of severity or the degree of correction and the MOXFQ score; the latter finding contradicts ours.

Strengths

The strengths of this study include the large number of feet (292 for the MOXFQ analysis and 319 for the radiographic analysis) and utilization of validated outcome measures. Data were collected prospectively for consecutive patients, and there was an in-depth analysis of all adverse events. There was consistency in operative technique, as it was a single-surgeon series (accounting for the learning curve). Patients with a severe HVA or IMA were not excluded from surgery, enabling a valid assessment of third-generation MICA for a large spectrum of deformities. The duration of and small loss to follow-up provide representative insight into the 2-year outcomes of this technique.

Limitations

The main limitation of this study is the lack of long-term radiographic follow-up, which may lead to a different estimation of the recurrence rate, osteonecrosis, and degenerative changes. Radiographic assessments were based on imaging performed 6 weeks postoperatively, when incomplete weight-bearing on the medial column may have potentially altered the "true" IMA and HVA. Also, the high female sex proportion in this cohort may reduce the applicability of this procedure in males. In addition, because there was no comparator cohort, we were unable to compare MICA with other osteotomy techniques.

### Is double metatarsal osteotomy superior to proximal chevron osteotomy in treatment of hallux valgus with increased distal metatarsal articular angle? [^04251c67]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

We compared the results of proximal chevron osteotomy and double metatarsal osteotomy for hallux valgus with an increased distal metatarsal articular angle (DMAA). From October 2008 to December 2012, first metatarsal osteotomies were performed in 64 patients (69 feet) with symptomatic hallux valgus associated with an increased DMAA. Proximal chevron with Akin osteotomy and lateral soft tissue release was performed in 46 feet (PCO group); double metatarsal osteotomy and Akin osteotomy without lateral soft tissue release was performed in 23 feet (DMO group). Clinical assessments were performed using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale and visual analog scale (VAS). The hallux valgus angles, intermetatarsal angles, sesamoid positions, metatarsus adductus angles, and DMAAs were compared at different postoperative times. Postoperative shortening of first the metatarsal and complications were compared. The mean AOFAS scale and VAS scores showed significant improvement in both groups after surgery; however, no significant difference was observed between the 2 groups. The immediate postoperative hallux valgus angle and sesamoid position were significantly larger in DMO group; however, no intergroup difference was observed at the last follow-up visit, with the hallux valgus angle gradually increasing in the PCO group. The postoperative DMAA was significantly smaller in the DMO group. The mean shortening of the first metatarsal after surgery was significantly larger in the DMO group than in the PCO group. Transfer metatarsalgia developed in 1 foot (2.2%) in the PCO group and 2 feet (8.7%) in the DMO group. Partial avascular necrosis of the metatarsal head with advanced arthritis of the first metatarsophalangeal joint developed in 1 foot (4.3%) in the DMO group. In conclusion, no differences in the clinical and radiographic results were observed between the 2 groups for hallux valgus deformity with an increased DMAA.

### Metatarsal pronation in hallux valgus deformity: a review [^c97a56c9]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Summary

Hallux valgus recurrence is the most frequent complication in hallux valgus surgery. No consensus exists about how to define recurrence, and therefore, varying degrees of relapse rate are mentioned in the literature, being as low as 16% or as high as 50%. The factors involved in hallux valgus recurrence have been identified in the immediate postoperative period and include an immediate hallux valgus angle greater than 8°, postoperative sesamoid position of grade 4 or greater, metatarsal pronation, metatarsus adductus, and severe hallux valgus preoperatively. If we use an adequate surgical correction technique with adequate correction power, we will improve the correction of the varus of the metatarsal and the valgus of the big toe, but we will not necessarily improve the correction of the sesamoid position. This undercorrection has been cited as the main cause of recurrence in several other studies, and as stated in the first paragraphs of this article, tibial sesamoid position is related directly to the pronation of the metatarsal. Therefore, we can suggest that correcting the metatarsal pronation is of utmost importance specially if we want to improve our tibial sesamoid position correction postoperatively, and techniques capable of achieving the mentioned correction should be considered in our surgical armamentarium. More work has yet to be done to know exactly which are normal values of metatarsal pronation, how to measure it in a reliable and easy way, and how to correctly address the rotational deformity in patients with hallux valgus.

### Bunionectomy as an acute postoperative pain model: overview of common experimental methods, and insights from past clinical trials [^582705ea]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgical Procedure

Postoperative pain after bunionectomy largely arises from the osteotomy (cutting of bone) required for the procedure, and to a lesser degree from the damage to surrounding soft tissues required for surgical exposure. Therefore, standardization of the surgical osteotomy is paramount to ensure experimental homogeneity.

The Austin/ Chevron bunionectomy procedure used in most bunionectomy pain trials is performed entirely on the first metatarsal head and provides correction for moderate Type 2 hallux valgus deformity. Subjects requiring alternate types of metatarsal head osteotomy, as well as base wedge osteotomies (in which the base of the first metatarsal is cut to correct severe deformities), are excluded. Collateral procedures, including hammertoe repair, are generally not allowed. Only subjects undergoing primary unilateral surgeries are included. Total length of convalescence is approximately 8 weeks or more postoperatively, with approximately 4 weeks spent in a surgical shoe.

An illustrated outline of a typical Austin procedure is below (Figure 1):

Study Design Paradigms: Timing of First Study Treatment Dose

In bunionectomy studies, the most critical design consideration centers around the timing of the first dose of investigational product relative to the time of the surgery. There are 4 paradigms:

A. Preoperative Dosing

First dose of study drug is given before surgery (study drug is administered prior to the patient entering the operating room).
Since subjects are not yet experiencing postsurgical pain when the first dose is administered, a pre-dose baseline pain measurement will not be available for endpoint calculations. Preoperative designs therefore cannot use summed pain intensity difference (SPID) endpoints and must employ an area under the curve (AUC)/ summed pain intensity (SPI) methodology (see Endpoints).
Speed of onset measures such as the 2-stopwatch technique cannot be employed.

A preoperative design is typically utilized when the IP has a delayed onset of action (> 90–120 minutes). For example, for an oral drug that takes 4 hours to reach an efficacious blood level, one might administer the drug 2 hours prior to surgery. By the time the patient wakes up from anesthesia and is ready for postsurgical efficacy assessments, the drug is able to provide analgesic relief.

### PROSPECT guideline for hallux valgus repair surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^38fac612]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hallux valgus repair can also be performed under a combined saphenous and popliteal sciatic nerve blocks, but no trial specifically investigated this approach with a control group. Noteworthy, one trial compared a sciatic nerve block with another regional technique, a mid-foot block, both combined with sedation; the authors concluded that both techniques provided similar postoperative analgesia after hallux valgus repair, although ambulation was delayed in the sciatic nerve block group. McLeod and colleaguescompared sciatic nerve block with wound infiltration and also found similar postoperative analgesia in both groups when patients had foot surgery under general anesthesia. Finally, a trial published more than 25 years ago showed that sciatic nerve block and ankle block performed with anatomical landmarks after forefoot surgery under general anesthesia resulted in comparable postoperative pain control. Of note, these last two studies showed significantly longer analgesia with sciatic nerve block compared with wound infiltrationor ankle blockwith the same solution (0.5% bupivacaine). Notwithstanding, additional research is needed to properly compare a sciatic nerve block with an ankle block under ultrasound guidance in a contemporary practice. Many trials compared different injection techniques or different concentrations of local anesthetic for sciatic nerve block. But according to our methodology, we do not elaborate recommendations on these items because no comparison is performed against a control group. That said, combining fentanyl or clonidine with local anesthetics for a combined femoral and sciatic nerve block does not reduce pain scores or opioid consumption but prolongs time to first analgesic request in the postoperative period. When considering a sciatic nerve block for an outpatient procedure, the patient's recovery plan and weightbearing status should be considered. For patients whose surgeons do not restrict weightbearing postoperatively, an ankle block avoids foot drop from sciatic nerve block, which may improve safety at home.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic foot pain [^cd578b87]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hallux valgus, more specifically with respect to foot MRI, ACR 2020 guidelines recommend to obtain foot MRI after negative or equivocal radiographs in patients with chronic metatarsalgia, including plantar great toe pain, when clinical concern includes sesamoiditis, Morton's neuroma, intermetatarsal bursitis, chronic plantar plate injury, or Freiberg's infraction.

### Radiological approach to metatarsalgia in current practice: an educational review [^7b642032]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

The dorsoplantar view of the foot reveals an enlargement of the metatarsophalangeal angle (angle M1–P1 > 15°) and a varus of M1 (angle M1–M2 > 10°).

The subluxation of the sesamoids is assessed both on the frontal and the sesamoid views. This last incidence may also reveal a hypoplasia of the crest in favor of the congenital origin of the deformity and osteoarthritis between sesamoid and metatarsal head.

The lateral view can reveal a flatfoot and dorsal dislocation of P1.

Moreover, radiographs allow for the evaluation of lateral osteoarthritis of the first MTPJ, microtraumatic changes to the medial aspect of the head of M1, and medial capital exostosis.

MRI and CT scan are not necessary for a simple hallux valgus. However, they may be indicated in order to assess the bone or adjacent soft tissues.

Medical treatment is limited to physical therapy, footwear advice, and orthotic use. Surgical treatment aims to realign the big toe, correct deformities, and relieve related pain. Conservative surgery typically involves metatarsal and phalangeal osteotomies, while joint fusion is reserved for severe or recurrent cases, especially in cases of advanced arthritic hallux valgus.

### Role of fixation and postoperative regimens in the long-term outcomes of distal chevron osteotomy: a randomized controlled two-by-two factorial trial of 100 patients [^40378bd3]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

The necessity of chevron osteotomy fixation is controversial and evidence for the effectiveness of postoperative regimens is limited. In a prospective, randomized study, we compared the long-term results of 2 operative techniques (osteotomy fixation versus no fixation) and 2 postoperative regimens (a soft cast versus an elastic bandage) in 100 patients who underwent surgery for hallux valgus. Clinical evaluations with the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale scoring were performed at baseline and 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, and a mean of 7.9 years postoperatively. The mean AOFAS function score were better in the group treated without osteotomy fixation and with an elastic bandage at 6 weeks postoperatively, but the differences then disappeared. The total AOFAS scores improved significantly in all 4 subgroups during the first 12 months; however, in the long term, some deterioration occurred. In the AOFAS scores, the average function, alignment, and total points were significantly worse when the preoperative hallux valgus angles exceeded 30°. The incidence of complication was low (1%); there was 1 superficial wound infection. The AOFAS score did not differ statistically among the groups in our population. An elastic bandage for postoperative treatment is recommended. The risk of recurrence is greater and functional result worse if the preoperative hallux valgus angle exceeds 30°.

### Establishment and validation of a predictive nomogram for hallux valgus with pain under the second metatarsal [^5ebdcaf1]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

The first ray plays a key role in maintaining the structure of the medial arch, and as the main load-bearing structure, it is subject to substantial forces during gait. Failure anywhere along the first ray, from the distal phalanx to the talonavicular joint, can result in hallux valgus. First-ray hypermobility (FRH) was considered a pathological entity in previous studies and was seen as a primary cause of hallux valgus. However, the relationship between FRH and hallux valgus remains controversial.

The collapse of the arch of the foot causes the stress on the forefoot of the hallux valgus foot to shift laterally, resulting in a painful callus under the second and third metatarsal heads. Forefoot alterations cause imbalances in weight-bearing distribution that may lead to mechanical overload on the affected metatarsal heads and may evolve into pain and plantar callosities. Initial metatarsalgia treatment is conservative; however, when these conservative measures fail and the metatarsalgia becomes recalcitrant, it requires surgical treatment with or without procedures on the first ray. The primary goal of surgery is to relieve pain and restore an ideal forefoot morphology with normal forefoot pressure distribution. In our study, the multivariate logistic regression results revealed that the HVA (OR = 1.068, 95% CI [1.028, 1.109]) and IMA1–2 (OR = 1.222, 95% CI [1.044, 1.43]) indirectly shows the pathological changes of the hallux valgus foot arch, which is consistent with the reports of previous studies, that is, with the increase in the HVA and IMA1–2, abnormal dynamic factors, such as muscle ligaments, will lead to hallux valgus foot complicated with pain under the second metatarsal head. Therefore, it is proven that HVA and IMA1–2 are risk factors for hallux valgus combined with pain under the second metatarsal head.

### PROSPECT guideline for hallux valgus repair surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^c22b7ae0]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors

One large study (n = 323) administered intravenous propacetamol 2 g or oral paracetamol 1 g in the postanesthesia care unit and reported that both reduced pain scores within 6 postoperative hours when compared with placebo, without mentioning whether basic analgesics (ie, in this case non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) were prescribed or not; propacetamol was superior to paracetamol within 4 postoperative hours.

A total of 12 studies examined the analgesic efficacy of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or cyclo-oxygenase-2 selective inhibitors. Three trials administered celecoxib 400 mg daily and showed a reduction in pain scores on postoperative day (POD) 0or within the first 48 postoperative hoursand a reduction in opioid consumption on POD1 and POD2or only on POD2after including 187,212, and 212 patients. After prescribing diclofenac 100 mg for 48 hours, pain scores and opioid consumption were consistently reduced during the study period in four large trials (n = 200; n = 389; n = 201; n = 376), while another one including 187 patients reported no difference for both outcomes. Two trials investigated intravenous parecoxib 20 mg or 40 mg daily with the first dose administered 45 min preoperatively (n = 50)or 8 hours postoperatively (n = 376)and demonstrated a reduction in pain scores within 24 postoperative hoursand a reduction in opioid consumption on POD1 and POD2without an apparent dose–response effect. One trial (n = 59) showed a reduction in pain scores with meloxicam 30 mg or 60 mg during the first 48 postoperative hours without having any impact on opioid consumption and without an apparent dose–response effect. Finally, one trial (n = 89) assessing pregabalin 300 mg or naproxen 550 mg versus placebo showed a reduction in pain scores on POD1 in the pregabalin group, on POD1 and POD2 in the naproxen group, and a reduction in opioid consumption on POD1 and POD2 in both active groups. Among these studies, two did not prescribe basic analgesics (ie, in this case, paracetamol).

One trial of 276 patients showed that the combination of ibuprofen and paracetamol reduced pain scores and opioid consumption during the first 48 postoperative hours when compared with placebo, ibuprofen, or paracetamol.

### Management of hallux valgus in general practice in Australia [^a46e09e9]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the management of hallux valgus by general practitioners (GPs) in Australia.

Methods

We analyzed data from the Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health program from April 2000 to March 2016. Patient and GP encounter characteristics were extracted. Hallux valgus encounters were identified using the International Classification of Primary Care, Version 2 Plus terms hallux valgus and bunion. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics and 95% confidence intervals around point estimates.

Results

The data set included 1,568,100 patient-encounter records among which hallux valgus was managed 658 times (4.2 management occasions per 10,000 encounters). This management rate extrapolates to an estimated 60,000 GP-patient encounters across Australia in the most recent year data were available (from 2015 to 2016). The management rate was 3 times higher in female compared to male patients and was most frequent among patients ages 45–64 years. Hallux valgus was most frequently managed by referral to orthopedic surgeons (28 per 100 management occasions), counseling or advice (25 per 100), and referral to podiatrists (16 per 100). Pharmacologic management was also frequently used (20 per 100) and primarily involved prescription of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (7 per 100).

Conclusion

Hallux valgus is a commonly encountered problem in Australian general practice and is mostly managed by provision of advice and referral to orthopedic surgeons and podiatrists. Further research is required to examine the factors that influence the selection of surgical and nonsurgical treatment pathways by GPs and their comparative effectiveness.

### The use of a syndesmosis procedure for the treatment of hallux valgus: good clinical and radiological results two years post-operatively [^b31d69fd]. The Bone & Joint Journal (2014). Low credibility.

Metatarsus primus varus deformity correction is one of the main objectives in hallux valgus surgery. A 'syndesmosis' procedure may be used to correct hallux valgus. An osteotomy is not involved. The aim is to realign the first metatarsal using soft tissues and a cerclage wire around the necks of the first and second metatarsals. We have retrospectively assessed 27 patients (54 feet) using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, radiographs and measurements of the plantar pressures after bilateral syndesmosis procedures. There were 26 women. The mean age of the patients was 46 years (18 to 70) and the mean follow-up was 26.4 months (24 to 33.4). Matched-pair comparisons of the AOFAS scores, the radiological parameters and the plantar pressure measurements were conducted pre- and post-operatively, with the mean of the left and right feet. The mean AOFAS score improved from 62.8 to 94.4 points (p < 0.001). Significant differences were found on all radiological parameters (p < 0.001). The mean hallux valgus and first intermetatarsal angles were reduced from 33.2° (24.3° to 49.8°) to 19.1° (10.1° to 45.3°) (p < 0.001) and from 15.0° (10.2° to 18.6°) to 7.2° (4.2° to 11.4°) (p < 0.001) respectively. The mean medial sesamoid position changed from 6.3(4.5 to 7) to 3.6 (2 to 7) (p < 0.001) according to the Hardy's scale (0 to 7). The mean maximum force and the force-time integral under the hallux region were significantly increased by 71.1% (p = 0.001), (20.57 (0.08 to 58.3) to 35.20 (6.63 to 67.48)) and 73.4% (p = 0.014), (4.44 (0.00 to 22.74) to 7.70 (1.28 to 19.23)) respectively. The occurrence of the maximum force under the hallux region was delayed by 11% (p = 0.02), (87.3% stance (36.3% to 100%) to 96.8% stance (93.0% to 100%)). The force data reflected the restoration of the function of the hallux. Three patients suffered a stress fracture of the neck of the second metatarsal. The short-term results of this surgical procedure for the treatment of hallux valgus are satisfactory.

### Custom-made foot orthoses for the treatment of foot pain [^c1c2ca16]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Custom foot orthoses are commonly recommended for the treatment of foot pain.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of custom foot orthoses for different types of foot pain.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 2), MEDLINE (from January 1966), EMBASE (from January 1980), CINAHL (from January 1982) and the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) (to June 2007). We also contacted authors of included trials and known researchers in the field and checked the reference lists of included trials to identify trials. No language or publication restrictions were applied.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and controlled clinical trials evaluating custom-made foot orthoses for any type of foot pain. Outcomes included quantifiable levels of foot pain, function, disability, health-related quality of life, participant satisfaction, adverse effects and compliance.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, rated methodological quality and cross checked data extraction. Data were analysed separately for different diagnoses of foot pain and follow-up time points.

Main Results

Eleven trials involving 1332 participants were included: five trials evaluated custom-made foot orthoses for plantar fasciitis (691 participants); three for foot pain in rheumatoid arthritis (231 participants); and one each for foot pain in pes cavus (154 participants), hallux valgus (209 participants) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (47 participants). Comparisons to custom-made foot orthoses included sham orthoses; no intervention; standardised interventions given to all participants; non-custom (prefabricated) foot orthoses; combined manipulation, mobilisation or stretching; night splints; and surgery. Follow up ranged from one week to three years. Custom-made foot orthoses were effective for painful pes cavus (NNTB:5), rearfoot pain in rheumatoid arthritis (NNTB:4), foot pain in JIA (NNTB:3) and painful hallux valgus (NNTB:6); however, surgery was even more effective for hallux valgus and non-custom foot orthoses appeared just as effective for JIA but the analysis may have lacked sufficient power to detect a difference in effect. It is unclear if custom-made foot orthoses were effective for plantar fasciitis or metatarsophalangeal joint pain in rheumatoid arthritis. Custom-made foot orthoses were a safe intervention in all studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There is limited evidence on which to base clinical decisions regarding the prescription of custom-made foot orthoses for the treatment of foot pain. Currently, there is gold level evidence for painful pes cavus and silver level evidence for foot pain in JIA, rheumatoid arthritis, plantar fasciitis and hallux valgus.

### Metatarsal pronation in hallux valgus deformity: a review [^eaba9396]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Hallux valgus deformity is a multiplanar deformity, where the rotational component has been recognized over the past 5 to 10 years and given considerable importance. Years ago, a rounded shape of the lateral edge of the first metatarsal head was identified as an important factor to detect after surgery because a less rounded metatarsal head was associated to less recurrence. More recently, pronation of the metatarsal bone was identified as the cause for the rounded appearance of the metatarsal head, and therefore, supination stress was found to be useful to achieve a better correction of the deformity. Using CT scans, up to 87% of hallux valgus cases have been shown to present with a pronated metatarsal bone, which highlights the multiplanar nature of the deformity. This pronation explained the perceived shape of the metatarsal bone and the malposition of the medial sesamoid bone in radiological studies, which has been associated as one of the most important factors for recurrence after treatment. Treatment options are discussed briefly, including metatarsal osteotomies and tarsometatarsal arthrodesis.

### PROSPECT guideline for hallux valgus repair surgery: a systematic review and procedure-specific postoperative pain management recommendations [^2b821427]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Wound infiltration

Six studies compared a wound infiltration technique with a control group, where all studies included basic analgesics, except one. In five studies, the authors compared wound infiltration with normal saline with bupivacaine (two studies: n = 34and n = 251), with a mixture of ropivacaine with morphine, ketorolac, and epinephrine (n = 60), with extended release (liposomal) bupivacaine (n = 193), or with dexamethasone alone (n = 51). In all five studies the active medication group showed a reduction of pain scores in the first 24 postoperative hours, and up to POD2or even POD7. Finally, Braito et al did not show any significant difference in 42 patients when running a continuous infusion of ropivacaine 0.2% at a rate of 2 mL/hour for 24 hours through a wound catheter, without initial bolus.

Surgical technique

Fourteen studies investigated different surgical techniques, such as scarf osteotomy, chevron osteotomy, Hohmann procedure, or Lapidus procedure. None was associated with a reduction in pain scores, except one (n = 50) that showed a reduction on POD1 to postoperative week 6, without difference at 6 postoperative months, in favor of percutaneous chevron/Akin osteotomy when compared with an open scarf/Akin osteotomy. In contrast, Kaufmann et al (n = 47) investigated a percutaneous approach versus an open chevron osteotomy, but did not find any difference. Of note, 2 out of these 14 trials (n = 96 and n = 55) specifically compared a scarf versus a chevron osteotomy and did not find any difference in postoperative pain scores.

A systematic review of hallux valgus surgery including 25 studies concluded that the clinical impact of the different surgical procedures on the clinical outcomes, such as gait measurement, quality of life, and patient satisfaction, was negligible. They also specified that surgery is more effective than conservative treatment or no treatment in reducing pain in the first year following surgery.

Two trials (n = 26 in both) compared the type of material used for the screws (bioabsorbable magnesium vs standard titanium) and did not find any difference in pain scores.

None of the aforementioned RCTs reported whether basic analgesics were prescribed or not.

### Fourth-generation percutaneous transverse osteotomies for hallux valgus [^6b5314ed]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2025). Medium credibility.

Outcome Measures and Study End Point

The primary outcome measure was a validated clinical patient-reported outcome measure (PROM), the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ), which was specifically validated for assessment of hallux valgus -. Secondary outcome measures included radiographic measures of deformity correction; other validated clinical PROMs, including the EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) Index, the EQ-5D-5L visual analog scale (EQ-VAS), and a VAS for pain (VAS-Pain); and complication data. The IMA and HVA were measured according to the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) technique and categorized with regard to deformity severity, preoperatively, 6 months following surgery, and at final follow-up. The round sign and lateral sesamoid coverage were classified according to methods described by Okuda et al.and Agrawal et al. The proximal IMA was measured using the method described by Lewis et al. Complication data were routinely collected prospectively for all patients until discharge and categorized using a modified Clavien-Dindo complication classification.

Bias

The use of prospectively collected data on consecutive patients reduced selection bias. All outcome data were collected and analyzed independent of the operating surgeon, who was blinded to the clinical outcomes collected for this study.

### Outcomes after scarf osteotomy for treatment of adult hallux valgus deformity [^b2bddedd]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Many procedures have been developed to correct hallux valgus deformity using distal soft tissue realignment, metatarsal osteotomy, and periodically, a proximal phalanx osteotomy (Akin). The ideal metatarsal osteotomy allows for varying degrees of correction with reliable improvement in deformity and patient satisfaction.

Questions/Purposes

We evaluated the results after scarf osteotomy with respect to American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, patient satisfaction, radiographic results, and complications.

Patients and Methods

We evaluated 29 patients (34 feet) during an 18-month period who underwent a unilateral scarf osteotomy combined with distal soft tissue realignment. Preoperative and postoperative AOFAS scores, patient satisfaction, and radiographic data were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the procedure. Complications were recorded. Minimal followup was 12 months (average, 26.4 months; range, 12–48 months).

Results

The mean AOFAS scores improved from 61.5 to 90.3. At final followup, 94% of patients were satisfied with the surgery. The hallux valgus angle improved from 34.6° to 14.9° and the intermetatarsal angle improved from 15.8° to 7.2° postoperatively. A combined Akin osteotomy was performed in only four cases. Complications included superficial wound infection (one), recurrence (two), and troughing (three).

Conclusions

Our results suggest the scarf osteotomy produces improved AOFAS scores, high percentage of patient satisfaction, and effective correction of hallux valgus deformities. Using our scarf technique of rotation combined with translation minimizes the need for an Akin osteotomy while still obtaining good correction and avoids associated complications described in the literature.

Radiographic Outcomes

Preoperative, 6-month, and final follow-up radiographic data regarding deformity correction were collected for 99.7% (727) of the 729 feet (Table II). There was no significant change in the IMA between 6 months (4.6° ± 2.5°) and the final follow-up (4.6° ± 2.5°) (p = 0.99). There was a statistically significant, but not clinically relevant, change in the HVA between 6 months (6.3° ± 5.6°) and final follow-up (7.3° ± 6.7°) (p < 0.01). The mean IMA correction (preoperative to final follow-up) was −8.4° ± 3.0° (range, −20.4° to 2.4°), while the mean HVA correction was −22.2° ± 7.4° (range, −53.4° to −4.1°). The mean proximal IMA increased from 12.9° ± 3.3° preoperatively to 17.7° ± 4.0° at final follow-up (p < 0.01).

### Postoperative pain management with transdermal fentanyl after forefoot surgery: a randomized, placebo-controlled study [^1dd75fb5]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients with hallux valgus deformity rate their quality of life as lower compared with the general population, mainly because of pain. Surgery usually produces a significant improvement in this regard. Most patients scheduled for forefoot surgery are suited for day case surgery, if pain and nausea, the two major complaints, can be prevented and taken care of. Many patients with hallux valgus express moderate to severe pain 2–3 days postoperatively.–Further, according to the results of our pilot study, female patients in particular seem to be sensitive to the adverse effects of strong pain medication like opioids after forefoot surgery.

In order to decrease the need for opioids, multimodal analgesia is widely recommended. Multimodal analgesia is particularly important in the treatment of ambulatory patients, as opioids tend to increase the incidence of nausea. Furthermore, orthopedic procedures are among the most painful procedures according to studies evaluating postoperative pain in outpatients. A transdermal fentanyl patch, used as an off-label treatment for postoperative pain, is supposed to deliver and maintain a stable plasma drug concentration, offering reliable background analgesiafor the 3 most painful days after hallux valgus surgery. It also offers an alternative route for opioid use in patients suffering from nausea or vomiting.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of transdermal fentanyl compared with placebo, each administered together with oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen in the treatment of postoperative pain after hallux valgus or hallux rigidus surgery.

### Intra-and interobserver agreement in hallux valgus angle measurements on weightbearing and non-weightbearing radiographs [^5a59de5a]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

The choice of treatment of hallux valgus deformity is influenced by angles measured on radiographs. Angles of interest are the hallux valgus angle (HVA), 1,2-intermetatarsal angle (IMA), and distal metatarsal articular angle (DMAA), as well as the presence of first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) subluxation. Guidelines for measuring those angles have been distributed by American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS), although the influence of weightbearing on these angles and its clinical relevance is not clear. We conducted a study to determine the influence of weightbearing and the inter- and intraobserver agreement in the measurement. A total of 104 patients were enrolled in this study. Both weightbearing and non-weightbearing radiographs were obtained. In 2 rounds, 2 orthopedic surgeons and 2 musculoskeletal radiologists measured the angles in blinded digital radiographs according to AOFAS guidelines. Agreement on measurement of HVA, IMA, and DMAA in both weightbearing and non-weightbearing radiographs, as well as the presence of MTPJ subluxation, was calculated using the linear-weighted kappa coefficient and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Examiner agreement strength was defined according to the guidelines of Landis and Koch. HVA decreases significantly with weightbearing, whereas IMA significantly increases. The change in magnitude was 1° to 2° on average. No significant influence on DMAA could be noted. Interobserver agreement was excellent in both weightbearing and non-weightbearing radiographs for HVA (ICC 0.99 and ICC 0.99, respectively), IMA (ICC 0.98 and ICC 0.86, respectively), and DMAA (ICC 0.95 and ICC 0.97, respectively). The agreement on presence of subluxation was moderate to good (Fleiss kappa 0.50 to 0.63). Weightbearing alters forefoot geometry significantly. Adhering to AOFAS guidelines yields excellent interobserver agreement on HVA, IMA, and DMAA. First MTPJ subluxation presence is not an alternative for DMAA. The magnitude of change in IMA and HVA is small and therefore not clinically important. Both weightbearing and non-weightbearing radiographs can be used for determination of the correct treatment of hallux valgus deformity.

### Surgery vs orthosis vs watchful waiting for hallux valgus… [^c6b8f0bd]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

More than 100 techniques have been introduced for correction of hallux valgus. 1 Distal metatarsal osteotomy is widely used to correct mild or moderate hallux valgus. 5 In uncontrolled case series, good clinical results have been reported in 80% to 90% of patients who have undergone the surgery. 6–8. However, recurrences or undercorrections have been reported in 10% to 14% of the cases. 5, 9, 10 Conservative treatments aim to reduce the angle of the first metatarsal–great toe joint by either stretching contracted soft tissue around the joints with the use of night splints, and improving muscle strength by foot exercises. or resolving abnormal function with insoles. 11 Orthoses are considered to be most effective in the early stages of hallux valgus. 12 Evidence for effectiveness of surgical and conservative treatments for patients with hallux valgus is very limited.

A recently published systematic review found only 12 randomized trials concerning surgical or conservative. treatment of hallux valgus. 11 None of the studies compared surgical treatment with any conservative treatment or with watchful waiting. 11 We thus set out to conduct a randomized controlled trial to assess the effectiveness and costs of surgical and orthotic treatments for hallux valgus patients, compared with a control group of patients. the aims and content of the study in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration13 before asking for their participation decision. Participants gave a written consent, went through the physical examination, and completed the questionnaires. Patients were told that both surgical and orthotic treatments could be used to decrease symptoms of hallux valgus. The ethics committee. hospital stay for a hallux valgus operation is longer in Finland than in the United States.

Therefore, the economical results cannot be generalized to other countries without a careful examination of the similarities and contrasts in health care practices. In conclusion, the chevron operation is an effective treatment for patients who have a mild to moderate hallux valgus deformity and bunion pain while. walking as their main symptom. Effectiveness is shown on several relevant outcome measures, and the effect increases during the postsurgical year. Orthotic treatment resulted in favorable outcome at the 6-month follow-up visit, after which the effect fades. Orthotic treatment may be considered an option when patients with disabling hallux valgus pain must wait for the surgery.

### Diagnosis and treatment of forefoot disorders. section 4. tailor's bunion [^5cb740d4]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2009). Medium credibility.

Tailor's bunion (Pathway 5) — definition, contributors, and epidemiology are outlined: Tailor's bunion (also called bunionette) involves deformity of the fifth metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ) and typically includes lateral prominence of the fifth metatarsal head; numerous factors can contribute such as a prominent lateral condyle, a plantarflexed fifth metatarsal, a splay foot deformity, lateral bowing of the fifth metatarsal, hypertrophy of soft tissues over the lateral aspect of the metatarsal head, and other contributors including a varus fifth toe, hallux valgus with abnormal pronation of the fifth metatarsal, hindfoot varus, and flatfoot; it is seen most commonly in adolescents and adults, with a mean age of presentation of 28 years (range, 16–57 years) and a female-to-male ratio greater than 2:1.

### Characteristics of foot structure and footwear associated with hallux valgus: a systematic review [^78ce15e2]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Factors associated with the development of hallux valgus (HV) are multifactorial and remain unclear. The objective of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to investigate characteristics of foot structure and footwear associated with HV.

Design

Electronic databases (Medline, Embase, and CINAHL) were searched to December 2010. Cross-sectional studies with a valid definition of HV and a non-HV comparison group were included. Two independent investigators quality rated all included papers. Effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated (standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous data and risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous data). Where studies were homogeneous, pooling of SMDs was conducted using random effects models.

Results

A total of 37 papers (34 unique studies) were quality rated. After exclusion of studies without reported measurement reliability for associated factors, data were extracted and analysed from 16 studies reporting results for 45 different factors. Significant factors included: greater first intermetatarsal angle (pooled SMD = 1.5, CI: 0.88–2.1), longer first metatarsal (pooled SMD = 1.0, CI: 0.48–1.6), round first metatarsal head (RR: 3.1–5.4), and lateral sesamoid displacement (RR: 5.1–5.5). Results for clinical factors (e.g., first ray mobility, pes planus, footwear) were less conclusive regarding their association with HV.

Conclusions

Although conclusions regarding causality cannot be made from cross-sectional studies, this systematic review highlights important factors to monitor in HV assessment and management. Further studies with rigorous methodology are warranted to investigate clinical factors associated with HV.

### Third-generation minimally invasive chevron and akin osteotomies (MICA) in hallux valgus surgery: two-year follow-up of 292 cases [^2ca28787]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2021). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Third-Generation MICA Technique

The surgical technique was adapted as described by Redfern and Vernoisand was similar for all cases. An extra-articular chevron osteotomy was made through a percutaneous incision at the metatarsal neck. Following displacement of the metatarsal head, the osteotomy site was fixed with 2 parallel screws. Medial ledge excision was performed, and any prominent medial exostosis were excised. A percutaneous Akin osteotomy and a lateral release of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (involving division of the lateral sesamoid-phalangeal ligament) were only performed if required to fully correct the hallux valgus deformity and restore first metatarsophalangeal joint congruity. Patients were allowed full weight-bearing in a flat rigid sandal immediately and were discharged the same day.

Study Design

This study was a prospective observational single-surgeon case series of consecutive patients.

Participants

Consecutive patients ≥ 16 years of age who underwent primary correction of hallux valgus (of any deformity severity) were included. Patients who underwent additional forefoot procedures — e.g. hammer-toe correction or distal metaphyseal metatarsal osteotomy — were included, but those who previously had hallux valgus surgery or had degenerative joint disease of the first ray were excluded.

Indications for MICA

Clinical judgment was used to decide on the indication for surgery. Symptoms included discomfort/pain in the medial eminence in footwear, transfer metatarsalgia, and/or symptomatic lesser-toe deformities associated with hallux valgus.

Data Collection

Each patient completed preoperative PROMs using a tablet device, remotely connected to PROM software (Amplitude Clinical Outcomes), during their first consultation. The PROMs were specifically designed for electronic completion by patients. Procedure data and intraoperative and/or postoperative complication data were inputted prospectively by the senior author (D.J.G.). The software automatically sent patients PROM questionnaires via email 2 years following the surgery. Those who did not complete these 2-year postoperative PROMs were contacted again via email and/or by telephone to prompt them to do so.

### Fourth-generation percutaneous transverse osteotomies for hallux valgus [^ac54c440]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2025). Medium credibility.

Background:

Fourth-generation percutaneous, or minimally invasive, hallux valgus surgery utilizes a transverse osteotomy to achieve deformity correction. There are only a small number of studies reporting the clinical and radiographic outcomes of transverse osteotomies, many of which have methodological limitations such as small sample size, limited radiographic follow-up, or use of non-validated outcome measures. The aim of this study was to provide a methodologically robust investigation of percutaneous transverse osteotomies for hallux valgus deformity.

Methods:

We studied a prospective series of consecutive patients undergoing fourth-generation metatarsal extracapsular transverse osteotomy performed by a single surgeon (P.L.) between November 2017 and January 2023. The primary outcome was clinical foot function assessed using the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ), a validated patient-reported outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included the radiographic deformity (the hallux valgus angle [HVA], 1–2 intermetatarsal angle [IMA], and sesamoid position) assessed according to American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) guidelines as well as a visual analog scale for pain and radiographic evidence of deformity recurrence (defined as an HVA of > 20° at final radiographic follow-up). P values of < 0.05 were considered significant.

Results:

Seven hundred and twenty-nine feet (483 patients; 456 female and 27 male; mean age, 57.9 ± 11.9 years) underwent fourth-generation metatarsal extracapsular transverse osteotomy. Radiographic data were available at a vminimum of 12 months postoperatively for 99.7% of the feet, which were followed for a mean of 2.6 ± 1.3 years (range, 1.0 to 5.7 years). There was a significant improvement (p < 0.05) in both the HVA (from 29.5° ± 8.5° preoperatively to 7.3° ± 6.7° at final follow-up) and the IMA (from 12.9° ± 3.3° to 4.6° ± 2.5°). All MOXFQ domains showed significant improvement (p < 0.05), with the MOXFQ Index improving from 36.9 ± 18.9 to 13.4 ± 15.8, Pain improving from 40.5 ± 22.0 to 17.2 ± 18.3, Walking/Standing improving from 32.3 ± 23.1 to 12.0 ± 18.2, and Social Interaction improving from 40.4 ± 20.4 to 11.0 ± 15.2. The recurrence rate was 4.5% (n = 33). The complication rate was 6.1%, which included a screw removal rate of 2.9%.

Conclusions:

This study, which was the largest consecutive series of any percutaneous osteotomy technique used to correct hallux valgus deformity, demonstrated significant improvement in clinical and radiographic outcomes with a low rate of recurrence.

### Establishment and validation of a predictive nomogram for hallux valgus with pain under the second metatarsal [^87c2f8fa]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hallux valgus is a forefoot deformity characterised by a valgus deviation of the hallux and widening of the first/second intermetatarsal angle (IMA). With the opening of society, increasing numbers of women are wearing high heels, and the incidence of hallux valgus is rising. According to statistics from the Foot and Ankle Surgery Group of the Chinese Medical Association, the incidence of hallux valgus in the female population in China is about 20%. Often, patients with hallux valgus also have metatarsalgia. The preliminary investigation of this research group found that 61.7% (148/240) of patients with hallux valgus were complicated with metatarsal pain, the most common of which was pain in the second-lower metatarsal. Patients with hallux valgus often complain of pain under the metatarsal head and seek medical treatment. Biomechanical studies have shown that the occurrence of hallux valgus complicated with pain under the second metatarsal is closely related to the change in plantar pressure in hallux valgus, and the two are positively correlated.

The main pathogenesis of hallux valgus combined with pain of the second-lower metatarsal is hallux valgus and pronation. Due to hallux valgus, the extensor and flexor tendons of the hallux play the role of bowstrings in the walking and propulsion movements of the hallux. This aggravates hallux valgus and pushes the first metatarsal head into varus, which increases the angle between the first and second metatarsal bones and moves the metatarsal head inwards. The change in the metatarsophalangeal angle inevitably disorders the balance system of the attached muscles (extensor hallucis longus, flexor hallucis longus, adductor hallucis and abductor hallucis), resulting in the collapse of the hallux valgus arch, the outward pressure of the forefoot upon loading and the formation of pain and callosities under the second metatarsal head. In addition, lateral medial cuneiform tilt is an important factor in aggravating the varus angle. Erduran et aldemonstrated that increasing the medial cuneiform lateral tilt increases the articulation obliquity of the first metatarsocuneiform joint.

### The scarf osteotomy: a salvage procedure for recurrent hallux valgus in selected cases [^d7abdede]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

The Scarf osteotomy was described as a technique to correct a metatarsus primus varus in primary hallux valgus surgery, but it is unclear whether the technique could correct recurrent hallux valgus when an initial procedure failed to provide any or an adequate lateral displacement of the metatarsal head.

Questions/Purposes

We asked whether the Scarf osteotomy could reduce pain, improve the AOFAS score, reduce the deformity, and prevent further recurrence when used as a revision procedure.

Patients and Methods

Of 41 patients (45 feet) we treated for failed initial operations, we retrospectively reviewed 35 (39 feet) who underwent a Scarf osteotomy. We administered a VAS for pain and the AOFAS score preoperatively and postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative radiographs were taken to assess the hallux valgus angle [HVA] and intermetatarsal angle [IMA]. The minimum followup was 24 months (mean, 42 months; range, 24–89 months).

Results

The mean VAS for pain improved from 5.9 to 0.4 points. The mean AOFAS score improved from 56 to 90 points. The radiographic evaluation showed improvement of the mean HVA from 30 degrees to 8 degrees and improvement of the IMA from 13 degrees to 4 degrees. Complications included one asymptomatic recurrence with a 20 degrees -HVA, one overcorrection with a 3 degrees-varus deformity, and pain attributable to irritation caused by screws in five patients.

Conclusions

As a revision procedure the Scarf osteotomy clinically and radiographically corrected recurrent hallux valgus recurrence in most patients.

### Management of bunionette deformity [^859e4686]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2018). Low credibility.

Bunionette deformity, historically known as tailor's bunion, is a forefoot protuberance laterally, dorsolaterally, or plantarlaterally along the fifth metatarsal head. Although bunionette deformity has been compared to hallux valgus deformity, it is likely due to a multifactorial, anatomic interplay between fifth metatarsal bony morphology and forefoot soft-tissue imbalance. Friction generated between the bony prominence, soft tissue, and associated constrictive footwear can result in keratosis, inflammation, pain, and ulceration. Symptomatic bunionettes are usually responsive to nonsurgical management. Surgical options are available based on the underlying bony deformity when nonsurgical treatment fails.

### Preoperative expectations versus reality: a patient experience study following scarf osteotomy for hallux valgus correction [^065f5848]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

The relationship between managing patient expectations and postoperative functional outcomes has been studied widely in other areas of orthopedics, but there is a paucity of information in the foot and ankle literature. The primary objective of the study was to identify the most common patient "expectations" from hallux valgus surgery and establish over what time period postsurgery they would meet those goals. A prospective study of 45 consecutive patients was performed at a single center. This included adult patients (> 18 years old) that underwent a scarf osteotomy for primary hallux valgus correction. Patients were followed up for 6 months and completed pre- and postoperative Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire and Visual Analogue Scale scores. A separate "expectations" questionnaire was designed and completed assessing the patient's preoperative rehabilitation expectations compared to the actual time taken to achieve those goals. These included 5 domains: pain improvement, return to walking unaided, return to normal foot sensation, return to normal footwear, and return to driving. The postoperative functional scores demonstrated statistically significant improvement postsurgery (p < .001). It also highlighted the overall time frame over which the above expectations were met. On average, patients achieved satisfactory pain improvements 1.4 weeks earlier than expected (p < .001) along with trends toward an earlier return to driving function of patient expectation (p < .05). Patients can thus be reliably informed that their pain symptoms are likely to settle within one month of surgery. This should allow patients to prepare for their rehabilitation more informed, thus facilitating earlier weightbearing and return to function.

Secondary outcomes included the radiographic deformity (the hallux valgus angle [HVA], 1–2 intermetatarsal angle [IMA], and sesamoid position) assessed according to American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society (AOFAS) guidelines as well as a visual analog scale for pain and radiographic evidence of deformity recurrence (defined as an HVA of > 20° at final radiographic follow-up). P values of < 0.05 were considered significant.

Results

Seven hundred and twenty-nine feet (483 patients; 456 female and 27 male; mean age, 57.9 ± 11.9 years) underwent fourth-generation metatarsal extracapsular transverse osteotomy. Radiographic data were available at a vminimum of 12 months postoperatively for 99.7% of the feet, which were followed for a mean of 2.6 ± 1.3 years (range, 1.0 to 5.7 years). There was a significant improvement (p < 0.05) in both the HVA (from 29.5° ± 8.5° preoperatively to 7.3° ± 6.7° at final follow-up) and the IMA (from 12.9° ± 3.3° to 4.6° ± 2.5°). All MOXFQ domains showed significant improvement (p < 0.05), with the MOXFQ Index improving from 36.9 ± 18.9 to 13.4 ± 15.8, Pain improving from 40.5 ± 22.0 to 17.2 ± 18.3, Walking/Standing improving from 32.3 ± 23.1 to 12.0 ± 18.2, and Social Interaction improving from 40.4 ± 20.4 to 11.0 ± 15.2. The recurrence rate was 4.5% (n = 33). The complication rate was 6.1%, which included a screw removal rate of 2.9%.

Conclusions

This study, which was the largest consecutive series of any percutaneous osteotomy technique used to correct hallux valgus deformity, demonstrated significant improvement in clinical and radiographic outcomes with a low rate of recurrence.

### Symptomatic course of foot osteoarthritis phenotypes: an 18-month prospective analysis of community-dwelling older adults [^c5233909]. Arthritis Care & Research (2018). Low credibility.

Between‐phenotype differences

Following adjustment for baseline scores, age, sex, and BMI, generally small between‐phenotype differences were seen over 18 months between the isolated first MTP joint OA and polyarticular foot OA phenotypes in relation to the reference category of the no or minimal foot OA phenotype (Table 2). The isolated first MTP joint OA phenotype was significantly more likely than the no or minimal foot OA phenotype to report unilateral hallux valgus in the left foot at 18 months (adjusted odds ratio 2.96 [95% CI 1.23, 7.12]).

Table 2
Between‐phenotype differences for the isolated first MTP joint OA and polyarticular foot OA phenotype at 18 months using the no or minimal foot OA phenotype as the reference category a

There were no statistically significant differences in perceived global change in foot pain or foot injuries incurred over 18 months among the foot OA phenotypes (Table 3). However, a higher proportion (40.6%) of individuals in the polyarticular foot OA phenotype perceived that their foot pain had worsened compared to the first MTP joint OA (27.0%) and no or minimal foot OA (27.9%) phenotypes. Approximately half of the participants in each phenotype reported using a service or treatment for foot pain in the preceding 18 months. The proportion of participants reporting a foot operation during this period was very low (≤ 4.0%) for each phenotype.

Outcome Measures and Study End Point

The clinical PROMs assessed were the EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) Index, EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS), a VAS for pain (VAS-pain), and the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ).

The EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS are validated quality-of-life assessment measures. The VAS-pain is a validated measure of acute and chronic pain. The MOXFQ is a PROM used specifically for patients undergoing foot surgery and has been validated for assessment of those undergoing hallux valgus surgery -. The MOXFQ consists of 3 domains (walking and standing, social interaction [based on the patient's self-consciousness regarding their feet/shoes as well as the overall impact on social, recreational, work, and other everyday activities], and pain), with the score in each domain ranging from 0 (best possible score) to 100 (worst possible score). An overall summary "index" score was also calculated. A detailed explanation of the MOXFQ can be found in the Appendix. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) has been shown to be 16, 12, and 24 for the walking and standing, pain, and social interaction domains, respectively.

Preoperative and 6-week postoperative weight-bearing radiographs were obtained to quantify preoperative and postoperative deformity correction (not recurrence). Radiographic parameters were measured retrospectively for all patients, in February 2020, by 1 of 2 fellowship-trained consultant surgeons (1 of whom [D.J.G.] performed all of the procedures). The 1–2 intermetatarsal angle (IMA) and hallux valgus angle (HVA) were measured according to the American Orthopaedic Foot & Ankle Society technique and categorized with regard to deformity severity.

Operations performed on both feet of the same patient were usually carried out consecutively; however, there were a number of simultaneous cases. Patients who underwent consecutive procedures completed a set of PROMs before each operation in order to accurately reflect their health status at that point in time. Simultaneous bilateral cases were included as independent observations, as the MOXFQ is foot-specific.

### Establishment and validation of a predictive nomogram for hallux valgus with pain under the second metatarsal [^ce169152]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Application of Prediction Model of Hallux Valgus Combined with Second Metatarsal Head Pain

When a medical model develops from empirical medicine to evidence-based medicine and then to precision medicine, the value of the data receives unprecedented attention. The rapid development of data acquisition, storage, analysis and prediction technology in the era of big data increases the prospect of personalised medicine. Clinical prediction models use mathematical formulae to estimate the probability of a specific individual currently suffering from a disease or a certain outcome in the future. As a quantitative tool for risk and benefit assessment, it can provide intuitive and rational information for decision making by doctors, patients and healthcare personnel. In the prevention and treatment of hallux valgus foot combined with pain under the second metatarsal head, the forefoot metatarsal pad can be used to alleviate the change in the arch of the hallux valgus foot through changes in imaging and plantar pressure in the early stage to indirectly reduce the load of the second metatarsal head and delay the aggravation of the HVA through the use of a hallux valgus correction belt or a split toe pad. Of course, it is very important to avoid soft tissue factors, such as the strain on internal and external muscles and ligaments, through internal and external muscle training.

Limitations

This study was a retrospective study and had some limitations. The clinical data came from the orthopaedic department of our hospital, so it lacked comparisons with data from different centres. Although the sample size was large, the verification of the model was internal; therefore, it needs further external verification to confirm the model's practicability. Additionally, as a retrospective study, there may have been a certain degree of selection bias. Based on the risk factors and prediction model for hallux valgus combined with pain under the second metatarsal head identified in this study, it is necessary to expand the sample size and deal with covariates. Furthermore, a future multicentre study is required to verify the validity of the prediction model for hallux valgus combined with pain under the second metatarsal head to expand the predictive model for clinical application.

### Fact or fiction? Iatrogenic hallux abducto valgus secondary to tibial sesamoidectomy [^a7c57e8f]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

First ray function and hallux misalignment after isolated tibial sesamoidectomy have been topics of debate. Although sesamoidectomy has been proved to be effective in the relief of sesamoid pain, many foot and ankle surgeons remain hesitant to perform the procedure fearing a possible joint perturbation. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to evaluate both laboratory and clinical evidence of the association between isolated tibial sesamoidectomy and hallux abducto valgus deformity. The bench study consisted of 10 cadaveric limbs that were dissected and prepared for testing. Controlled valgus loads were applied before and after tibial sesamoidectomy. No significant difference was found in the joint position after sesamoidectomy in both the rectus (p = .36) and the dorsiflexed (p = .062) positions. The clinical evaluation consisted of a retrospective cohort of 5 females; all of whom underwent isolated tibial sesamoidectomy. The pre- and postoperative radiographs and self-reported pain scores (visual analog scale) were compared. None of the patients developed a postoperative hallux abducto valgus deformity. Neither the hallux abductus angle (p = .180) nor the intermetatarsal angle 1–2 (p = .180) changed significantly in the postoperative setting. The visual analog scale pain scores changed from a mean of 6.8 to 1, a significant difference (p = .042). Based on our observations and clinical experience, we believe that isolated tibial sesamoidectomy does not have a significant effect on the position of the first metatarsophalangeal joint when meticulous surgical technique is used to excise the sesamoid. Isolated tibial sesamoidectomy can provide substantial pain relief and appears to be a safe treatment for a variety of conditions affecting the tibial sesamoid.

### Bosch osteotomy and scarf osteotomy for hallux valgus correction [^5b02d201]. The Orthopedic Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Minimally invasive distal metatarsal osteotomies are becoming broadly accepted for correction of hallux valgus. We compared the duration of surgery, the length of hospital stay, the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, and the Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS) in 36 patients who underwent a minimal incision subcapital osteotomy of the first metatarsal with 36 matched patients who had hallux valgus corrected by a scarf technique. The minimum follow-up was 2.1 years (mean, 2.5 years; range, 2.1–3.2 years). Patients having the osteotomy had similar AOFAS and FAOS scores with less operating time and earlier discharge. Less operative time may benefit the patients, and earlier discharge has financial implications for the hospital.

### Bunionectomy as an acute postoperative pain model: overview of common experimental methods, and insights from past clinical trials [^40cbb279]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Recruited vs Non-Recruited Surgeries

A key component of bunionectomy's strength as a model for clinical experiments lies in its origins as an actively recruited study model. Prior to the development of bunionectomy, pivotal postoperative pain studies generally enrolled patients who were scheduled for surgery independently of the research project (the subject's surgery was not predicated on study participation). Actively recruited models like bunionectomy introduced a new paradigm. Researchers recruit subjects through advertising and patient databases. Surgical costs are generally paid by the study sponsor, rather than by the subject or insurance. This paradigm allows researchers to enroll subjects quickly into a small number of research centers where surgery, anesthesia and perioperative care are strictly standardized and can be tailored to the needs of study protocols. Subjects can also be domiciled longer than typical clinical care standards would dictate (eg, a 72-hour inpatient stay for a bunionectomy), enabling:
Study assessments to be performed by study staff who are expert in analgesic assessments.
Control and verification of investigational product and rescue medication administration.
Control and verification of efficacy and safety assessment time points.
Control of activities that would likely confound efficacy assessments (such as subject ambulation).

Diagnosis

In an actively recruited surgical study model, fast, simple, unambiguous diagnosis of the underlying condition requiring surgery is key to rapid enrollment. Bunions requiring surgery of the type used in clinical trials (type 2 hallux valgus deformity) are relatively simple to diagnose. Generally, clinical presentation involves pain, difficulty with ambulation and improper fit of the shoe. A clinical examination and plain film X-ray are adequate for confirmation of the diagnosis in most cases.

### First metatarsophalangeal joint arthroscopy in patients with hallux valgus [^bae98788]. Arthroscopy (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the results of first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ) arthroscopy in patients with hallux valgus.

Methods

The arthroscopic findings of 121 first MTPJ arthroscopies were analyzed together with the radiologic assessment of hallux valgus angle, sesamoid position, and foot type.

Results

In those patients with first MTPJ pain, pain is associated with metatarsophalangeal compartment synovitis and cartilage lesions. Of those with first MTPJ pain, 90% had complete or significant relief of the joint pain after arthroscopic synovectomy.

Conclusions

Metatarsophalangeal compartment synovitis and cartilage lesions are significantly associated with first MTPJ pain in patients in hallux valgus. Synovitis and cartilage lesions of the metatarso-sesamoid compartment are not associated with first MTPJ pain. Patients with hallux valgus can complain of first MTPJ pain without any bunion pain. First MTPJ arthroscopy is an effective tool to control MTPJ pain when conservative management fails.

### Incidence and progression of hallux valgus: a prospective cohort study [^bb40a08d]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Hallux valgus is a common and disabling condition. The objective of the present study was to identify factors associated with hallux valgus incidence and progression.

Methods

Participants were from a population-based prospective cohort study, the Clinical Assessment Study of the Foot. All adults ages ≥ 50years who were registered at 4 general practices in North Staffordshire, UK, were invited to take part in a postal survey at baseline and at 7-year follow-up, which included health questionnaires and self-assessment of hallux valgus using line drawings.

Results

Complete baseline and follow-up data were available for 1,482 participants (739 women and 743 men, mean ± SD age 62.9 ± 8.1years), of whom 450 (30.4%) had hallux valgus in at least 1 foot at baseline. Incident hallux valgus was identified in 207 (20.1%) participants (349 [15.4%] feet) and was associated with baseline age, poorer physical health, foot pain, and wearing shoes with a very narrow toe-box shape between the ages of 20 and 29years. Hallux valgus progression was identified in 497 (33.6%) participants (719 [24.3%] feet) but was not associated with any baseline factors.

Conclusion

Incident hallux valgus develops in 1 in 5 adults ages ≥ 50years over a 7-year period and is related to age, poorer physical health, foot pain, and previous use of constrictive footwear. Progression occurs in 1 in 3 adults. These findings suggest that changes in first metatarsophalangeal joint alignment may still occur beyond the age of 50years.

### Role of first ray hypermobility in the outcome of the hohmann and the lapidus procedure. A prospective, randomized trial involving one hundred and one feet [^3cf6c63c]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The role of hypermobility of the first tarsometatarsal joint in the etiology of hallux valgus deformity is controversial. Consequently, the need to include an arthrodesis of this joint in the surgical treatment of hallux valgus has been questioned. We designed a study to evaluate the role of arthrodesis of the first tarsometatarsal joint on the outcome of surgical treatment of hallux valgus.

Methods

A prospective, blinded, randomized study was performed to compare the results of a distal osteotomy of the first metatarsal (the Hohmann procedure) with those of an arthrodesis of the first tarsometatarsal joint combined with a soft-tissue procedure of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (the Lapidus procedure) for correction of a symptomatic hallux valgus deformity. One hundred and one feet of eighty-seven patients were included in the study. Fifty feet had a Hohmann procedure, and fifty-one had a Lapidus procedure. The mobility of the first tarsometatarsal joint was assessed in the preoperative clinical examination. On the basis of this examination, two subgroups were identified: sixty-eight feet with a hypermobile first tarsometatarsal joint and thirty-three feet with a nonhypermobile first tarsometatarsal joint. The patients were assessed clinically and radiographically at two years after the operation.

Results

There was a significant improvement in the score on the great toe metatarsophalangeal-interphalangeal scale of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society and in the pain score following both procedures (p < 0.001). With the numbers available, no significant difference between the two procedures or between the subgroups of feet with a hypermobile first tarsometatarsal joint and those with a nonhypermobile joint could be identified. The patient satisfaction rating did not differ either between the two procedures or between the two subgroups. The radiographic results of the two methods were also similar, except for shortening of the first metatarsal, which was significantly greater (p < 0.001) in the Hohmann group, and plantar flexion of the first metatarsal, which was greater in the Lapidus group.

Conclusions

These short-term results were satisfactory and were comparable with those in previous isolated reports on these two procedures. As no significant differences between the two procedures or between the two subgroups (feet with a hypermobile first tarsometatarsal joint and those with a nonhypermobile joint) were found on clinical assessment, the theory that patients with hallux valgus and a hypermobile first tarsometatarsal joint should be managed with a Lapidus procedure was not supported.

### What is the efficacy of a nonoperative program including a specific stretching protocol for flexor hallucis longus tendonitis? [^9b287f02]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosis and treatment of tendonitis/entrapment of the flexor hallucis longus (FHL) has been sporadically described in the evidence, primarily in the context of dancers and other athletes. Although various nonspecific nonoperative treatments have been described, it is not clear how often they achieve a satisfactory amount of symptom improvement.

Questions/Purposes

The present study was designed to address the following questions regarding the nonoperative treatment of FHL tendonitis: (1) In a population of patients where the default management option for FHL tendonitis is a comprehensive nonsurgical approach, what proportion of patients thus treated opted not to have surgery? (2) What factors were associated with a patient's decision to undergo surgery after a period of nonsurgical management?

Methods

The 656 patients included were all those diagnosed with FHL tendonitis who were initially treated nonoperatively in the foot and ankle division between January 2009 and December 2018. Demographics, comorbidities, examination findings, imaging results, pain scores, treatment instituted, and final outcome were obtained from the electronic medical record. The primary outcome was the decision to have surgery due to unsatisfactory symptom improvement. We compared patients who opted for surgery with those who did not after nonoperative treatment with univariable and multivariable statistics using demographics, comorbidities, and clinical findings as potential risk factors, with p < 0.05.

Results

Forty-four percent (180 of 409) of patients decided to forgo surgery after the institution of a specific FHL stretching program. Surgery was more likely in patients with clinical hallux rigidus (OR 2.4 [95% CI 1.16 to 4.97]; p = 0.02) or posteromedial ankle pain (OR 1.78 [95% CI 1.12 to 2.83]; p = 0.01) and less likely in those who completed an FHL stretching program (OR 0.15 [95% CI 0.08 to 0.27]; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

FHL tendonitis is more common than the previous evidence suggests and frequently occurs in nonathletes. Once it was diagnosed by detection of tenderness anywhere along the tendon, most frequently at the fibroosseous tunnel, nonoperative treatment focused on specific FHL stretching and immobilization in more severe cases reduced the symptoms to the extent that 44% of patients decided that surgery was unnecessary. The key to its diagnosis is awareness that this injury is possible because most patients treated in this study had been previously seen by orthopaedic providers who had not appreciated the presence of the condition, leading to a delay in diagnosis and treatment of more than a year in many patients.

### Biomechanical evaluation of custom foot orthoses for hallux valgus Deformity [^164c89d6]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of the present study was to compare the hallux valgus deformity pressure parameters seen in standard footwear (no orthosis) versus the pressure observed in the same footwear with the addition of 3 different length orthoses. The forefoot pressure at a hallux valgus deformity was recorded with pressure sensors placed on the plantar, medial, and dorsal surface of the first metatarsal head. The participants performed walking trials without an orthosis and with orthoses of 3 different lengths. The average pressure and maximum pressure of each area was recorded for each orthosis, and comparisons were made across the groups. The plantar pressures were decreased in the full length and 3/4 length orthoses, and the dorsal pressures were increased with the use of the full-length and sulcus-length orthoses. Significant changes in medial pressure were not seen with the addition of any orthosis compared with standard footwear alone. However, a trend toward increased medial pressures was seen with the full- and sulcus-length orthoses, and the 3/4-length orthoses exhibited a trend toward decreased medial pressures. We were unable to demonstrate that the use of a custom foot orthosis significantly decreases the medial pressures on the first metatarsal head in patients with hallux valgus deformity. The 3/4-length orthosis was less likely to negatively affect the dorsal or medial pressures, which were noted to increase with the sulcus- and full-length orthoses. Our data suggest that if a clinician uses this treatment option, a 3/4-length orthosis might be a better choice than a sulcus- or full-length orthosis.

### A rotational scarf osteotomy decreases troughing when treating hallux valgus [^2fc5a406]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The traditional scarf osteotomy has been associated with complication rates between 1.1% and 45%. We have modified the traditional technique with a rotational osteotomy to reduce these complications.

Questions/Purposes

We determined whether a modified rotational scarf osteotomy improves functional outcome scores, allows correction of a wide degree of an intermetatarsal (IM) angle deformity, has a low incidence of troughing, and maintains normal ROM postoperatively in the treatment of symptomatic hallux valgus (HV).

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 140 patients: 38 men and 102 women with a mean age of 54 years (range, 35–66 years) who underwent surgery for HV and had a minimum followup of 24 months (mean, 41 months; range, 24–68 months). All patients had preoperative and postoperative American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) forefoot and Short Form (SF)-36 V2 outcome scores recorded.

Results

The mean AOFAS score improved from 52 points preoperatively to 92 points (range, 71–96 points) at followup. The mean SF-36 V2 score improved from 69 points preoperatively to 94 points (range, 67–98 points) at followup. The IM angle improved from a preoperative mean of 18° (range, 9°-23°) to a mean of 8° (range, 6°-12°). Eleven patients experienced a complication.

Conclusions

The modified rotational scarf osteotomy has a low complication rate (9%) and apparently reduces the risk of troughing. This procedure can reduce a high degree of IM angle deformity while restoring function to the forefoot.

### The utility of ultrasound in the evaluation of traumatic hallux valgus [^62a75bd2]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Isolated disruption of the medial collateral ligament of the great toe is rare and often misdiagnosed as turf toe. It may progress to acquired traumatic hallux valgus, often requiring operative intervention and a longer return to play. This case of a grade II medial collateral ligament injury highlights the importance of a thorough physical examination and consideration of the mechanism of injury. It demonstrates the utility of diagnostic musculoskeletal ultrasound in establishing a specific diagnosis upon initial patient presentation with great toe pain. It is an example of the use of ultrasound in guiding treatment and monitoring interval healing. In this case, differentiation of the injury from the classic "turf toe" led to proper stabilization with a toe spacer and activity modification, thus preventing progression of traumatic hallux valgus and leading to successful nonoperative treatment with full return to sport.

### Scarf-akin osteotomy correction for hallux valgus: short-term results from a district general hospital [^27901658]. The Journal of Foot and Ankle Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

This study assessed the radiological measurements, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scores, and patient satisfaction associated with performance of the scarf osteotomy, combined with an Akin osteotomy, for the treatment of hallux valgus in patients at a general hospital. Thirty-five patients were assessed before surgery, and at 6 months following performance of the scarf first metatarsal osteotomy plus Akin osteotomy. The mean first intermetatarsal and hallux abductus angles reduced from 14.1 degrees ± 3.5 degrees to 10.0 degrees ± 3.2 degrees and 32.1 degrees ± 9.9 degrees to 16.4 degrees ± 7.9 degrees, respectively, and these differences were statistically significant (P < .001). The mean first to second metatarsal sagittal plane length ratio was unchanged by the osteotomy (P > .05). The mean global AOFAS Hallux Metatarsophalangeal-Interphalangeal score increased from 58.8 ± 11.6 to 86.4 ± 11.6, and this difference was statistically significant (P < .0001). Of the 35 patients (36 operated feet), 20 (57.1%) were extremely satisfied, 10 (28.6%) were satisfied, and 5 (14.3%) were unsatisfied with the results of the surgery. Based on these results, we concluded that the improved radiographic angles and AOFAS scores observed in this study were comparable to previously reported results, and our findings indicated that, in the setting of a general hospital, the scarf osteotomy combined with the Akin osteotomy is a safe, versatile and useful procedure for the treatment of hallux valgus.

### Fourth-generation percutaneous transverse osteotomies for hallux valgus [^efdf4f6b]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2025). Medium credibility.

Materials and Methods

Fourth-Generation Percutaneous Transverse Osteotomy Technique

An extracapsular transverse osteotomy is performed through a percutaneous incision at the metatarsal neck (Fig. 1). Correction of the 1–2 intermetatarsal angle (IMA), the hallux valgus angle (HVA), and metatarsal pronation is achieved through 3D reduction of the metatarsal head using a specific reduction tool. Metatarsal rotation correction is assessed intraoperatively on the basis of the round sign and sesamoid position. The osteotomy site is fixed with 2 parallel or divergent beveled cannulated screws with chamfered heads (Novastep), ensuring that the proximal screw passes through the lateral cortex of the first metatarsal shaft proximal to the osteotomy site. Medial ledge and exostosis excision is performed. A percutaneous Akin osteotomy is performed to correct any residual deformity and restore congruence of the first metatarsophalangeal joint (MTPJ). Percutaneous lateral soft-tissue release was only performed in cases with residual joint incongruity at the end of the procedure. A detailed description of the technique is provided elsewhere.

Fig. 1
Preoperative and 18-month postoperative weight-bearing radiographs (anteroposterior, oblique, and lateral) demonstrating bilateral percutaneous hallux valgus correction with the fourth-generation percutaneous transverse osteotomy technique.

Patients are permitted immediate full weight-bearing following surgery. Initial recovery requires 2 weeks of foot elevation, with patients walking in a postoperative shoe. At 2 weeks postoperatively, dressings are removed, medial taping is performed to maintain alignment, and patients transition to regular athletic footwear. Active first MTPJ plantar flexion exercises begin at this time. Scar mobilization techniques commence at 3 weeks postoperatively. Physiotherapy may be prescribed at the 6-week follow-up if patients demonstrate difficulty with therapeutic exercises or scar management.

Study Design

This was a prospective observational study of a consecutive series of patients treated by a single surgeon (P.L.) in his specialist foot and ankle private practice in Sydney, Australia. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines were used to report on this study.
