## Question

What is the recommended dosage for: Treatment of graft-versus-host disease in children (chronic + failed at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy), weight ≥ 40 kg?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended dosage for treating chronic graft-versus-host disease in children who weigh at least 40 kg and have failed at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which FDA-approved agents are indicated for this exact scenario. Then, I should verify the labeled dosing for each agent, including any weight-based caps or age restrictions. Next, I will consider pediatric-specific nuances and whether the provided references support use in children weighing 40 kg or more. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically actionable recommendation with appropriate caveats and monitoring considerations.

> Let me first confirm the indication and scope. The question targets chronic GVHD after failure of at least two prior systemic therapies in pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg, which aligns with the FDA-labeled indications for belumosudil and axatilimab, and potentially with ruxolitinib depending on prior lines of therapy, so I need to check each label carefully to avoid overextending beyond approved use [^5f9575be] [^900b52c8] [^edb62a21].

> I will now examine belumosudil. The FDA labeling indicates belumosudil for adults and pediatric patients 12 years and older with chronic GVHD after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, and the recommended dose is 200 mg orally once daily with food until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, which applies regardless of weight once the age threshold is met, so for a child weighing at least 40 kg who is 12 years or older, 200 mg daily is appropriate [^5f9575be] [^262847f1] [^bc3ac45a].

> Next, I should review axatilimab. The FDA labeling specifies axatilimab for adults and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg with chronic GVHD after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy, with a dose of 0.3 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks up to a maximum of 35 mg per dose until progression or unacceptable toxicity, so for a child weighing 40 kg or more, the dose is 0.3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks capped at 35 mg per infusion [^900b52c8] [^007a4863] [^c8f83cc4].

> Hold on, I should verify ruxolitinib's position here. Ruxolitinib is FDA-approved for chronic GVHD after failure of one or two prior lines of systemic therapy in patients 12 years and older, so it is not labeled for "after two prior lines" specifically; however, if a child weighing at least 40 kg has failed only one or two prior lines and is 12 years or older, ruxolitinib 10 mg orally twice daily is a standard regimen, whereas if the child has already failed two lines, belumosudil or axatilimab would be the labeled options rather than ruxolitinib, so I need to be precise about prior therapy count when recommending ruxolitinib [^edb62a21] [^9bce00c5] [^aeb3868b].

> Let me consider pediatric-specific issues. Both belumosudil and axatilimab have explicit pediatric labeling for the indicated population, and axatilimab's label specifically notes that safety and effectiveness are established in pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg, with pediatric PK data informing the weight-based dosing and cap, which supports use in the described child; belumosudil's pediatric indication is age-based rather than weight-based, so weight alone does not change the dose once the child is 12 years or older [^345833db] [^5f9575be].

> I should double-check practical administration details. Belumosudil is taken orally once daily with food, and dose modifications are based on adverse effects and clinical response; axatilimab is administered as a 30-minute IV infusion every 2 weeks with no routine premedication specified in the label, though institutional practices may vary, and dose holds or reductions are guided by toxicity; both agents require ongoing monitoring for infections, cytopenias, and organ-specific toxicities per their labels and clinical experience [^262847f1] [^007a4863] [^c8f83cc4].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise. For a child with chronic GVHD who weighs at least 40 kg and has failed at least two prior systemic therapies, the FDA-approved options are belumosudil 200 mg orally once daily if the child is 12 years or older, or axatilimab 0.3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks up to 35 mg per dose regardless of age as long as weight is at least 40 kg; ruxolitinib 10 mg twice daily is appropriate if the child is 12 years or older and has failed only one or two prior lines, but it is not the labeled choice after two prior lines, so I should not recommend ruxolitinib for the exact scenario of two prior failures unless considering off-label use in a trial or exceptional circumstance [^5f9575be] [^900b52c8] [^edb62a21].

> Final answer: For a child weighing at least 40 kg with chronic GVHD after failure of at least two prior systemic therapies, the recommended regimens are belumosudil 200 mg orally once daily with food if the child is 12 years or older, or axatilimab 0.3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks up to a maximum of 35 mg per dose until progression or unacceptable toxicity; select based on age, comorbidities, organ involvement, and patient preference, and monitor closely for efficacy and adverse effects [^262847f1] [^007a4863] [^c8f83cc4].

---

For pediatric chronic GVHD after ≥ 2 prior systemic therapies and weight ≥ 40 kg, the **recommended dose is 0.3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks** (max 35 mg/dose) [^007a4863] until progression or unacceptable toxicity [^c8f83cc4]. This dosing is supported by the AGAVE-201 trial [^c8f83cc4] and FDA approval [^86e595ea] for axatilimab in patients ≥ 40 kg, including pediatric patients [^345833db]. Monitor for infections, cytopenias, and hepatic or renal dysfunction, and adjust dosing for toxicity.

---

## Recommended dosage and administration

- **Dosage**: 0.3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks (max 35 mg/dose) [^007a4863].
- **Administration**: IV infusion over 30 minutes [^c8f83cc4].
- **Duration**: Continue until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity [^007a4863].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting the recommended dosage

The AGAVE-201 trial (NCT04710576) [^c8f83cc4] enrolled patients with chronic GVHD after ≥ 2 prior systemic therapies, including pediatric patients ≥ 40 kg, and showed an **overall response rate of 75%** (95% CI 64–84) with a median duration of response of 1.9 months; 60% of responders remained alive without new systemic therapy for ≥ 12 months [^86e595ea]. These results led to FDA approval for axatilimab in this population [^86e595ea].

---

## Safety considerations and monitoring

Axatilimab is generally well tolerated; monitor for the following:

- **Infections**: Increased risk of infections, including respiratory and viral infections [^c8f83cc4].
- **Hematologic toxicity**: Neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia may occur [^notfound].
- **Hepatic and renal dysfunction**: Monitor liver and kidney function regularly [^notfound].
- **Musculoskeletal pain and fatigue**: Commonly reported adverse effects [^c8f83cc4].

## Comparison with alternative therapies

Alternative therapies for pediatric chronic GVHD include:

| **Therapy** | **Indication** | **Recommended dosage** | **Key considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Ruxolitinib | Chronic GVHD after failure of 1–2 prior lines | 10 mg orally twice daily (≥ 12 years) [^9bce00c5] | - Off-label for < 12 years <br/> - Monitor cytopenias and infections [^aeb3868b] |
| Belumosudil | Chronic GVHD after ≥ 2 prior lines (≥ 12 years) | 200 mg orally once daily [^262847f1] | - Limited pediatric data <br/> - Monitor liver function [^bc3ac45a] |
| Ibrutinib | Chronic GVHD after ≥ 1 prior line | 420 mg orally once daily (≥ 12 years) [^78d23ac8] | - Off-label for < 12 years <br/> - Monitor bleeding and infections [^notfound] |

---

Axatilimab is the **only FDA-approved therapy** specifically for pediatric patients ≥ 40 kg with chronic GVHD after ≥ 2 prior lines of systemic therapy [^86e595ea].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized treatment** based on disease severity, organ involvement, and patient-specific factors [^84d229c4]. Axatilimab is recommended as a **second-line or subsequent therapy** for pediatric chronic GVHD refractory to prior systemic treatments, particularly in patients weighing ≥ 40 kg [^notfound].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Axatilimab is recommended at **0.3 mg/kg IV every 2 weeks** (max 35 mg/dose) for pediatric chronic GVHD after ≥ 2 prior systemic therapies in patients ≥ 40 kg, with treatment continued until progression or unacceptable toxicity [^007a4863]. This regimen is supported by robust clinical evidence and FDA approval, offering a favorable safety profile and significant clinical benefit [^c8f83cc4]. Regular monitoring for infections, hematologic toxicity, and hepatic or renal dysfunction is essential [^notfound].

Ruxolitinib administration

Ruxolitinib administration presented slight differences among the reported cohorts. Details are reported in Supplementary Table S1. Regarding initial dose, most of the studies started with a dose of 2.5 or 5 mg twice daily according to patient weight (more or less than 25 kg) in children < 12 years. In patients > 12 years a dose of 10 mg twice daily was generally adopted, analogous to adult dose in REACH trials. In the French cohort a median dose according to body surface was reported (12.6 and 12.8 mg/m2/day in < 6 and > 6 years old patients). In the prospective study by Moiseev et al, the initial dose in patients < 40 kg was 0.15 mg/kg/day while patients weighting > 40 kg were treated with adult dose. Dose reduction was performed for patients treated with azoles or with chronic renal insufficiency in some included studies. In the majority of studies Ruxolitinib was escalated to the maximum adult dose of 10 mg twice daily in the absence of toxicities. Dose reduction was performed in the studies with different intents, specifically for maintenance or for adverse events. Time to start of treatment after diagnosis of GvHD varies among different studies, from a minimum value of 5 days in aGvHD and a maximum of 18 months in cGvHD. Ruxolitinib administration was almost invariably preceded by other lines of immunosuppressant therapies ranging from 1 to 6 lines. Median continuation of ruxolitinib treatment reported ranges from 14 days to 1127 days. Ruxolitinib was administered both in monotherapy and in combination with other immunosuppressant drugs such as calcineurin inhibitors, sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, ECP, anti-TNF antibodies, and rituximab.

### FDA approval summary: axatilimab for adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kilograms with chronic GVHD after two prior lines of systemic therapy [^c8f83cc4]. Clinical Cancer Research (2025). Medium credibility.

On August 14, 2024, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved axatilimab, a colony stimulating factor-1 receptor (CSF-1R)-blocking antibody, for chronic graft-versus-host disease (chronic GVHD) after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kilograms (kg). Approval was based on the results of the AGAVE-201 Study (NCT04710576), which included a cohort of 79 patients with chronic GVHD treated with axatilimab 0.3 mg/kg administered intravenously every 2 weeks in an open-label, single-arm cohort. Efficacy was determined by the overall response rate (ORR) through Cycle 7 Day 1, which included complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) according to the 2014 NIH consensus criteria, and the durability of response. The ORR through Cycle 7 Day 1 was 75% (95% CI 64, 84); all responses were PR. The median duration of response was 1.9 months (95% CI: 1.6, 3.5), but 60% (95% CI: 43, 74) of responding patients remained alive without new systemic therapy for at least 12 months from response. The common adverse reactions included infection, increased transaminases, decreased phosphate, decreased hemoglobin, musculoskeletal pain, increased lipase, fatigue, increased amylase, increased calcium, increased creatine phosphokinase, increased alkaline phosphatase, nausea, headache, diarrhea, cough, fever, and dyspnea. FDA issued a postmarket requirement to evaluate safety with long-term use.

### FDA approval summary: ruxolitinib for treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy [^aeb3868b]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

On September 22, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration approved ruxolitinib for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) after the failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older. Approval was based on Study INCB 18424–365 (REACH-3; CINC424D2301; NCT03112603), a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial of ruxolitinib in comparison to best available therapy (BAT) for the treatment of corticosteroid-refractory cGVHD occurring after the allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A total of 329 patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either ruxolitinib 10 mg twice daily (n = 165) or BAT (n = 164). BAT was selected by the investigator prior to randomization. The overall response rate through Cycle 7 Day 1 was 70% (95% CI, 63–77) in the ruxolitinib arm, and 57% (95% CI, 49–65) in the BAT arm. The median duration of response, calculated from first response to progression, death, or initiation of new systemic therapies for cGVHD, was 4.2 months (95% CI, 3.2–6.7) for the ruxolitinib arm and 2.1 months (95% CI, 1.6–3.2) for the BAT arm; and the median time from first response to death or initiation of new systemic therapies for cGVHD was 25 months (95% CI, 16.8-not estimable) for the ruxolitinib arm and 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.1–7.8) for the BAT arm. Common adverse reactions included anemia, thrombocytopenia, and infections. Given the observed response rate with durability, the clinical benefit of ruxolitinib appears to outweigh the risks of treatment for cGVHD after the failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy.

### Exposure-response relationships for axatilimab in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease [^89de600b]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Study Highlights

WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?

Axatilimab, a monoclonal antibody targeting colony‐stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF‐1R), was recently approved for chronic graft‐versus‐host disease (cGVHD) after ≥ 2 prior lines of systemic therapy. A population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model for axatilimab has recently been described.
WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?

We aimed to characterize exposure–efficacy and exposure–safety relationships for axatilimab among patients with cGVHD.
WHAT DOES THIS STUDY ADD TO OUR KNOWLEDGE?

In this analysis, lower axatilimab exposure was associated with higher clinical responses, and higher axatilimab exposure was associated with a higher frequency of adverse events. In patients with cGVHD, axatilimab 0.3 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) had the optimal benefit–risk profile. Model‐based predictions indicated that body weight–mediated changes in axatilimab exposure did not have a significant effect on efficacy and safety endpoints.
HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY OR TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE?

This analysis provides further support for the dose selection of axatilimab 0.3 mg/kg Q2W in patients with cGVHD.

Chronic graft‐versus‐host disease (cGVHD) is an immune‐mediated, potentially life‐threatening complication that affects approximately 50% of patients who receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo‐HSCT)., cGVHD is a leading cause of nonrelapse mortality following allo‐HSCT. In addition, there is a considerable symptom burden with cGVHD (most often assessed using the modified Lee Symptom Scale [mLSS]). Management of cGVHD is challenged by the need to balance immunosuppression, cumulative toxicity, and risk of infection from corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive therapies; infections are also a leading cause of nonrelapse mortality following allo‐HSCT.

### Steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease: treatment options and patient management [^7b85de7a]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, these three patient cases illustrate multiple options available for patients with SR-cGVHD. While there is one FDA-approved treatment currently available, enrollment in ongoing clinical trials is also an important option for eligible patients whose treatment has failed on one or more previous therapies. In the absence of robust evidence of benefits for any one intervention, treatment choices should be based on physician experience, ease of use, need for monitoring, risk of toxicity, and potential worsening of pre-existing comorbidities.

### Initial therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease: analysis of practice variation and failure-free survival [^7a35e334]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a common complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)and is associated with increased risk of death, morbidity, impaired quality of life, and prolonged immune suppressive (IS) therapy. Based on evidence arising from prior clinical trials and practice recommendations, initial therapy for cGVHD remains prednisone (generally starting at 1 mg/kg per day) with or without a calcineurin inhibitor. Previous work has demonstrated that this approach fails to provide durable control of cGVHD, as failure-free survival (FFS; a composite failure end point including death, malignancy relapse, or additional systemic IS therapy) after initial steroid therapy is 68% by 6 months and 54% by 12 months. Failure of initial therapy is important, because this is commonly followed by multiple lines of secondary therapy with associated adverse outcomes.

One major research question has been whether combination approaches (prednisone plus other systemic IS agents) may provide improved outcomes. Several large randomized trials of combination therapy have been completed, yet none have demonstrated superiority over prednisone alone. A more recent Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network 0801 trial tested sirolimus/prednisone vs calcineurin inhibitor/sirolimus/prednisoneand demonstrated comparable treatment success across these 2 approaches and improved quality of life in the 2-drug approach. This trial, published in 2018, has provided a current benchmark for initial therapy. Multiple novel approaches are being tested in smaller trials including other agents, lower-dose prednisone, or even non–prednisone-based therapy.

To date, no large survey of actual treatment practices has been conducted, although individual management of cGVHD initial therapy is anecdotally highly variable and may affect treatment response. The selection of treatment type and intensity may vary according to cGVHD features and severity and perceptions regarding individual patients' tolerance of certain therapies. To address this gap, we gathered data from 3 prior national cGVHD Consortium observational studies to examine variation in initial cGVHD therapy and its association with subsequent FFS.

### Towards better and more effective clinical trials for chronic graft-versus-host disease [^57f7760c]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

While the incidence of chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (chronic GVHD) is declining due to advances in prophylaxis and survival is improving due to better supportive care, first-line treatment of chronic GVHD continues to be based on corticosteroids. Numerous attempts to establish more effective or less toxic treatment alternatives have largely failed, likely due to the biological heterogeneity of chronic GVHD and uncontrolled use of systemic corticosteroids, indicating the need for new approaches. The 2020 NIH consensus conference proposed the systematic evaluation of steroid-free initial treatment combining clinical and biological assessment to establish personalized approaches. While the first generation of trials evaluating steroid-free single agent first-line therapy approaches are recruiting, they are still not able to consider the biological heterogeneity of chronic GVHD in deciding therapeutic approaches. To advance the field, we propose a two-stage adaptive trial design starting with an intervention under consideration followed by a replication phase after the first phase has identified candidate clinical features and or biomarker predicting success. For second and subsequent lines of treatment, current treatment decisions regarding the use of the four FDA approved agents are based on the product label or a trial-and-error approach, sometimes in combination regimens despite the lack of prospective data. Future trials and prospective observational studies should focus on the development of predictive markers to provide a biological rationale for sequencing treatment options and to identify synergistic combination treatments. The recently released FDA draft guidance document for developing drugs and treatments in GVHD serves as the starting point for clinical trials planning that should yield results during the next several years.

### FDA approves belumosudil for chronic graft-versus-host disease… [^bc3ac45a]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

On July 16, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration approved belumosudil, a kinase inhibitor, for adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older with chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy. Efficacy was evaluated in KD025-213, a randomized, open-label, multicenter dose-ranging trial that included 65 patients with chronic GVHD who were treated with belumosudil 200 mg taken orally once daily. The main efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate through Cycle 7 Day 1 where overall response included complete response or partial response according to the 2014 criteria of the NIH Consensus Development Project on Clinical Trials in Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease. The ORR was 75%; 6% of patients achieved a CR, and 69% achieved a PR. The median time to first response was 1. 8 months.

The median duration of response, calculated from first response to progression, death, or new systemic therapies for chronic GVHD, was 1. 9 months. In patients who achieved response, no death or new systemic therapy initiation occurred in 62% of patients for at least 12 months since response. The most common adverse reactions, including laboratory abnormalities, were infections, asthenia, nausea, diarrhea, dyspnea, cough, edema, hemorrhage, abdominal pain, musculoskeletal pain, headache, phosphate decreased, gamma glutamyl transferase increased, lymphocytes decreased, and hypertension. The recommended dosage of belumosudil is 200 mg taken orally once daily with food. This review used the Real-Time Oncology Review pilot program, which streamlined data submission prior to the filing of the entire clinical application, and the Assessment Aid, a voluntary submission from the applicant to facilitate the FDA's assessment.

The FDA approved this application 6 weeks ahead of the FDA goal date. This application was granted priority review and breakthrough therapy designation. A description of FDA expedited programs is in the Guidance for Industry: Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics.

### Ruxolitinib for the treatment of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in children: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^1a30be15]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease (SR-GvHD) represents a major complication of pediatric allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Ruxolitinib, a selective JAK 1–2 inhibitor, showed promising results in the treatment of SR-GvHD in adult trial, including patients > 12 years old. This systematic review aims to evaluate ruxolitinib use for SR-GvHD in the pediatric population. Among the 12 studies included, ruxolitinib administration presented slight differences. Overall response rate (ORR) ranged from 45% to 100% in both acute and chronic GvHD. Complete response rates (CR) varied from 9% to 67% and from 0% to 28% in aGvHD and cGvHD, respectively. Individual-patient meta-analysis from 108 children under 12 years showed an ORR and CR for aGvHD of 74% and 56%, respectively, while in cGvHD ORR was 78% but with only 11% achieving CR. Treatment-related toxicities were observed in 20% of patients, including cytopenia, liver toxicity, and infections. Age, weight, graft source, previous lines of therapy, and dose did not significantly predict response, while a higher rate of toxicities was observed in aGvHD patients. In conclusion, ruxolitinib shows promising results in the treatment of SR-GvHD in children, including those under 12 years.

### Ruxolitinib for the treatment of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in children: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^1cf0f145]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite improvement in preventive strategies, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in pediatric patients undergoing allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). Acute GVHD (aGvHD) affects up to 50% of children undergoing HCT, while 20% present a grade II-IV aGVHD. The incidence of chronic GVHD (cGvHD) is lower, between 6 and 33%, with higher risk after peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) HCT and in patients with previous aGvHD. Systemic corticosteroids represent the standard first-line therapy for both acute and chronic GvHD but only half of patients respond to steroids. The agreement on definition of steroid-refractory (SR) aGvHD has been reached in recent years, with the aim of ensuring standardized diagnostic criteria for participants in clinical trials. SR aGvHD is defined as one of the following: disease progression after 3 days of treatment with methylprednisolone (MP) 2 mg/kg per day equivalent; lack of improvement after 7 days of treatment with MP 2 mg/kg per day equivalent; progression to a new organ after treatment with MP 1 mg/kg per day equivalent for skin and upper gastrointestinal (GI) GvHD; or disease recurrence during or after a corticosteroid taper. cGvHD is defined SR when manifestations progress despite the use of a regimen containing prednisone at ≥ 1 mg/kg per day for at least 1 week or persist without improvement despite continued treatment with prednisone at ≥ 0.5 mg/kg per day or 1 mg/kg every other day for at least 4 weeks. Steroid-dependent cGvHD may be defined when prednisone doses > 0.25 mg/kg per day or > 0.5 mg/kg every other day are needed to prevent recurrence or progression of manifestations as demonstrated by unsuccessful attempts to taper the dose to lower levels on at least 2 occasions, separated by at least 8 weeks. Several second-line treatments have been proposed for SR GvHD in both acute and chronic settings, including anti–TNF-α antibodies, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, anti–IL-2R antibodies, extracorporeal photo apheresis (ECP). All these immunosuppressive drugs showed suboptimal results and are associated with high rate of complications due to profound immunosuppression. Pediatric experience is mainly derived from adult studies. No consensus exists regarding treatment of SR GvHD and the prognosis for patients with SR GvHD still remains poor with long term survival of 5–30%. These considerations lead to an urgent need for targeted therapies with higher response rate and minimal immunosuppression level. Ruxolitinb is an oral selective Janus kinase (JAK) 1 and 2 inhibitor, firstly approved for the treatment of myelofibrosis. JAK 1/2 are intracellular kinases that cause the activation of signal transducer and activation (STAT) proteins, involved in proliferation, activation and survival of cells. The role of this pathway is critical in T lymphocyte function, involved in activation, survival and lineage commitment. It is also important in innate immune response. The pathway has thus been studied with increasing interest as a potential target in immune disorders. JAK-STAT signaling demonstrated a major role in GvHD pathogenesis. Ruxolitinb was tested in preclinical models in which JAK-STAT blockade demonstrated to control clinical features of GvHD. Notably, ruxolitinib demonstrated to preserve graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect in in vitro models. Following these reports, ruxolitinib was firstly evaluated in acute SR GvHD showing promising results in retrospective adult studies. The impact of ruxolitinib on cGvHD was also reported in retrospective studies with high response rate. The mentioned encouraging reports led to the prospective trial REACH1 (NCT02953678), an open-label, single-arm, multicenter trial of ruxolitinib in patients 12 years and older with SR and steroid-dependent aGvHD showing an overall response rate at any time of 73% with complete response rate of 56%. Results of this trial led to the approval of ruxolitinib for treatment of SR GvHD by the FDA in 2019 and by EMA in 2021. Two large multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 trials, REACH2 (NCT02913261) and REACH3 (NCT03774082), demonstrated the efficacy of ruxolitinib in SR aGvHD and cGvHD, respectively, with greater overall response (62% vs 39% for 28 days aGvHD response, and 49% vs 25% for week 24 cGvHD response) and greater failure-free survival in the ruxolitinib group compared to control best available therapies. Pediatric patients with 12 to 18 years of age were included in the two analysis. Pediatric experiences of ruxolitinib in GvHD have been increasingly reported worldwide in recent years, also including patients < 12 years of age, that were excluded in the randomized clinical trials. In this specific cohort, the use of ruxolitinib in SR GvHD is still off-label. Peculiar concerns include pediatric dosing, prospectively evaluated in REACH trials between 12–18 years, but still lacking in < 12 years children, as well as toxicities. Moreover, a difference between pediatric and adult settings is that younger children present a lower incidence of cGvHD, also related to the limited use of PBSC. Furthermore, a consistent percentage of patients receives transplantation for a non-malignant disease, making the control of transplant related mortality and prevention of severe GvHD a particularly relevant issue in pediatric HCT recipients. The aim of this review is to provide a systematic review on current evidence about the use of ruxolitinib for SR GvHD in the pediatric population. The two parts of the analysis include a first "qualitative" analysis on ruxolitinib administration, response, and toxicities in pediatric SR GvHD and a second "quantitative" analysis on available single-patient data about children < 12 years. The clinical relevance of this review is particularly significant for this class of age, considering the lack of solid evidence in children < 12 years that will be obtained by the ongoing perspective pediatric trial REACH4.

### Ruxolitinib for the treatment of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in children: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^8e9e6b01]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease (SR-GvHD) represents a major complication of pediatric allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Ruxolitinib, a selective JAK 1–2 inhibitor, showed promising results in the treatment of SR-GvHD in adult trial, including patients > 12 years old. This systematic review aims to evaluate ruxolitinib use for SR-GvHD in the pediatric population. Among the 12 studies included, ruxolitinib administration presented slight differences. Overall response rate (ORR) ranged from 45% to 100% in both acute and chronic GvHD. Complete response rates (CR) varied from 9% to 67% and from 0% to 28% in aGvHD and cGvHD, respectively. Individual-patient meta-analysis from 108 children under 12 years showed an ORR and CR for aGvHD of 74% and 56%, respectively, while in cGvHD ORR was 78% but with only 11% achieving CR. Treatment-related toxicities were observed in 20% of patients, including cytopenia, liver toxicity, and infections. Age, weight, graft source, previous lines of therapy, and dose did not significantly predict response, while a higher rate of toxicities was observed in aGvHD patients. In conclusion, ruxolitinib shows promising results in the treatment of SR-GvHD in children, including those under 12 years. Specific pediatric perspective trials are currently ongoing to definitely assess its efficacy and safety.

Discussion

Given the encouraging results of REACH2 and REACH3 trials, ruxolitinib has been increasingly administered in pediatric patients with SR GvHD, also including children < 12 years. In this systematic review, we summarized current literature consisting of 12 papers regarding the use of ruxolitinib for SR GvHD in pediatric patients < 18 years. We specifically collected single patient data about 108 younger children < 12 years old that received ruxolitinib for both acute and chronic GvHD, a category of extreme interest for pediatric hematologists, given the off-label indication in this class of age.

Among the included studies in both the qualitative and quantitative synthesis, the initial ruxolitinib dose was generally given according to patient's weight. Among patients < 12 years, children < 25 kg frequently received a dose of 5 mg daily while those > 25 kg received 10 mg daily, but a certain degree of heterogeneity in the administered dose in this category of patients is present (Supplementary Table S1) and should be taken in consideration in response and toxicity analysis. Patients > 12 years almost invariably received an adult dose of 10 mg BID, consistent with the dose prescribed in 12–18 years patients in the REACH2 and 3 trails. Dose increase was generally allowed according to toxicities and response, and 23 patients < 12 years reached a dose of 20 or 15 mg/daily. Interestingly, in the French cohort study, no relationship between initial dose of ruxolitinib and response as well as time to the best response was demonstrated. Similarly, in our single-patient analysis, a daily dose < or > 10 mg was not associated with response. The preliminary pharmacokinetic results of the Phase I/II REACH-4 trial (NCT03491215) on pediatric aGvHD presented at the ASH meeting in 2022 confirmed an age-appropriate recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of 5 mg BID in the 6–12 years group and of 4 mg/m2 in the < 6 years group. Definitive results of this trial are awaited and will certainly provide solid data in order to help pediatric clinicians, also considering the current available formulations of oral tablets, with a minimum dosage of 5 mg.

### National Institutes of Health consensus development project on criteria for clinical trials in chronic graft-versus-host disease: III. the 2020 treatment of chronic GVHD report [^84d229c4]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Positive results from recent clinical trials have significantly expanded current therapeutic options for patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, new insights into the associations between clinical characteristics of chronic GVHD, pathophysiologic mechanisms of disease, and the clinical and biological effects of novel therapeutic agents are required to allow for a more individualized approach to treatment. The current report is focused on setting research priorities and direction in the treatment of chronic GVHD. Detailed correlative scientific studies should be conducted in the context of clinical trials to evaluate associations between clinical outcomes and the biological effect of systemic therapeutics. For patients who require systemic therapy but not urgent initiation of glucocorticoids, clinical trials for initial systemic treatment of chronic GVHD should investigate novel agents as monotherapy without concurrently starting glucocorticoids, to avoid confounding biological, pathological, and clinical assessments. Clinical trials for treatment-refractory disease should specifically target patients with incomplete or suboptimal responses to most recent therapy who are early in their disease course. Close collaboration between academic medical centers, medical societies, and industry is needed to support an individualized, biology-based strategic approach to chronic GVHD therapy.

Analysis

We performed two types of analysis: firstly, we pooled together data regarding ruxolitinib administration, response, and toxicities both in the setting of aGvHD and cGvHD for all pediatric cohorts (< 18 years) including also patients under 12 years of age in the so-called "qualitative" synthesis. Then, we analyzed selectively available single-patient data about children < 12 years regarding response rate to ruxolitinib ("quantitative" synthesis).

The following outcomes were evaluated in descriptive analysis, when available: overall response rate (ORR), complete response (CR), partial response (PR), non-response (NR), treatment failure (TF), time to achieve response, overall survival (OS) and treatment-related toxicity (TRT). CR was defined as complete resolution of GvHD symptoms, PR as improvement in the stage of GvHD without worsening in other organ, NR as no improvement or deterioration of GvHD symptoms or development of GvHD symptoms in other organs, TF as discontinuation of ruxolitinib due to toxicities. Data about single patients < 12 were collected in a database to calculate the previous mentioned outcomes of this cohort in the "quantitative" analysis. In this sub-analysis, frequencies were estimated after pooling data from different contributing authors, and then reported in subgroups of interest based on GvHD characteristics (aGvHD, cGvHD, gut aGvHD, chronic lung GvHD), daily dose received, (≤ and > 10 mg), and previous treatments (1–2 vs > 2 lines of therapy). A backward stepwise linear regression was used to identify possible predictors of the outcomes, namely ORR and TRT, out of candidate variables age, weight, source of stem cell, acute GvHD (vs chronic), previous lines of therapy, and dose. At each step, variables were chosen based on p -values, and the p-value threshold of 0.2 was used to set a limit on the total number of variables included in the final model.

### How we treat chronic graft-versus-host disease [^96068955]. Blood (2015). Low credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a common and potentially life-threatening complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT). The 2-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD requiring systemic treatment is ~30% to 40% by National Institutes of Health criteria. The risk of chronic GVHD is higher and the duration of treatment is longer after HCT with mobilized blood cells than with marrow cells. Clinical manifestations can impair activities of daily living and often linger for years. Hematology and oncology specialists who refer patients to centers for HCT are often subsequently involved in the management of chronic GVHD when patients return to their care after HCT. Treatment of these patients can be optimized under shared care arrangements that enable referring physicians to manage long-term administration of immunosuppressive medications and supportive care with guidance from transplant center experts. Keys to successful collaborative management include early recognition in making the diagnosis of chronic GVHD, comprehensive evaluation at the onset and periodically during the course of the disease, prompt institution of systemic and topical treatment, appropriate monitoring of the response, calibration of treatment intensity over time in order to avoid overtreatment or undertreatment, and the use of supportive care to prevent complications and disability.

### Axatilimab for chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of at least two prior systemic therapies: results of a phase I / II study [^6e23f4c8]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) remains the major cause of late morbidity after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation. Colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R)-dependent macrophages promote cGVHD fibrosis, and their elimination in preclinical studies ameliorated cGVHD. Axatilimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits CSF-1R signaling and restrains macrophage development.

Patients and Methods

This phase I (phI)/phase II (phII) open-label study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03604692) evaluated safety, tolerability, and efficacy of axatilimab in patients age ≥ 6 years with active cGVHD after ≥ 2 prior systemic therapy lines. Primary objectives in phI were to identify the optimal biologic and recommended phII dose and in phII to evaluate the overall (complete and partial) response rate (ORR) at the start of treatment cycle 7.

Results

Forty enrolled patients (17 phI; 23 phII) received at least one axatilimab dose. In phI, a dose of 3 mg/kg given once every 4 weeks met the optimal biologic dose definition. Two dose-limiting toxicities occurred at the 3 mg/kg dose given once every 2 weeks. At least one treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) was observed in 30 patients with grade ≥ 3 TRAEs in eight patients, the majority known on-target effects of CSF-1R inhibition. No cytomegalovirus reactivations occurred. With the 50% ORR at cycle 7 day 1, the phII cohort met the primary efficacy end point. Furthermore, the ORR in the first six cycles, an end point supporting regulatory approvals, was 82%. Responses were seen in all affected organs regardless of prior therapy. Fifty-eight percent of patients reported significant improvement in cGVHD-related symptoms using the Lee Symptom Scale. On-target activity of axatilimab was suggested by the decrease in skin CSF-1R-expressing macrophages.

Conclusion

Targeting profibrotic macrophages with axatilimab is a therapeutically promising novel strategy with a favorable safety profile for refractory cGVHD.

### Initial therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease: analysis of practice variation and failure-free survival [^a7b404b0]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Therapy type definitions

We examined all IS therapies given throughout each patient's history to fully characterize variation in treatment practices. The following definitions for background, initial, and failure therapies were developed for the purpose of this analysis. Background therapy was defined as any systemic IS agent that the patient was taking when they were diagnosed with cGVHD. These agents were identified with a start date range from before HCT to cGVHD onset, with an indication that was not cGVHD (included initial acute GVHD prophylaxis, acute GVHD therapy, or other), and did not have a stop date before cGVHD onset. Initial therapy was defined as first-line systemic IS therapy akin to that in therapeutic cGVHD trials. It included any systemic agent started 30 days before cGVHD diagnosis to any time afterward with an indication of cGVHD and included any new systemic IS agent or therapy including steroids newly started for cGVHD at any dose or steroids increased to ≥ 0.4 mg/kg per day from a lower dose that was started more than 30 days before cGVHD onset. The threshold of ≥ 0.4 mg/kg per day from a lower dose was selected to capture a therapeutic intent to escalate background steroid dose to nearly 0.5 mg/kg per day (with possible rounding for dose/weight considerations) or greater. Changes in doses of other background medications (eg, tacrolimus) were not considered initial therapy, as detailed information on doses of medications besides steroids was not captured. Finally, failure therapy was defined as new systemic therapy to treat inadequately responding, recurrent, or progressive cGVHD. It was defined as having an indication of cGVHD and being added ≥ 10 days after initial therapy, except that certain agents (extracorporeal photopheresis [ECP], rituximab, ibrutinib, ruxolitinib, sirolimus) were considered failure therapy if started ≥ 30 days after initial therapy, acknowledging that these agents may have more prolonged time to approval and initiation compared with others. Any systemic IS agent or therapy was eligible to be considered a failure therapy, including steroids newly started at any dose, whereas dose increases in prednisone from initial therapy dose were not considered failure.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of NIKTIMVO for the treatment of cGVHD after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy have been established in pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg. Use of NIKTIMVO in pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg is supported by evidence from clinical trials that included 3 children (ages 6 to less than 12 years old) and 5 adolescents (ages 12 to less than 17 years old) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The safety and effectiveness of NIKTIMVO have not been established in pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg.

Compared to adult and pediatric patients weighing 40 kg and above, patients weighing less than 40 kg had lower maximum concentration, trough concentration, and average concentration at the same weight-based dosage.

Based on findings of thickening of the growth plate and metaphysis and/or degeneration of the growth plate in the femur in animals, monitor bone growth and development in pediatric patients [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.2)].

8.5 Geriatric Use

Of the 79 patients with cGVHD treated with NIKTIMVO, 21 (26.6%) were 65 years and older, and 2 (2.5%) were 75 years and older [see Clinical Studies (14)]. No overall differences in the safety or effectiveness of NIKTIMVO have been observed between patients 65 years of age and older and younger patients.

### Ruxolitinib for the treatment of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in children: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^3400aeb1]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Patients were highly pretreated and have received a median of 3 lines of immune-suppressive therapies before ruxolitinib in the quantitative synthesis, potentially limiting the capacity to attribute the response to ruxolitinib. This potential bias has been partially overcome in the REACH trials in which patients were excluded if they have received more than 1 ore more than 2 systemic immunosuppressive therapies in addition to steroids for the treatment of SR aGvHD or cGvHD, respectively. Even though, number of previous therapies was not significantly associated to response in our analysis, similar to what reported by Laisne et al. More robust results will be hopefully achieved by the REACH4 study that will include, interestingly, also patient with treatment-naïve severe aGvHD, in order to explore the efficacy of ruxolitinib also as first-line therapy.

### Initial therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease: analysis of practice variation and failure-free survival [^8e2dc8ba]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Beyond characterizing variation in treatment practices, this analysis suggests that marked variation in both initial therapy group and prednisone dose among prednisone-containing treatment regimens did not significantly impact FFS, OS, or use of second-line agents. Similar conclusions were reached when examining effect of therapy type and prednisone dose within NIH overall severity categories. Overall, both the magnitude of failure and time to failure did not appear to differ according to these factors, and there was no evidence of different mortality risk according to these factors. These observational data suggest that treating clinicians were trying to integrate cGVHD- and patient-level considerations to select initial therapy, and the result was that outcomes were comparable both to other groups within this analysis and current benchmarks for expected FFS after initial cGVHD therapy. These data are hypothesis-generating only, however, and require confirmation in well-designed prospective clinical trials. One major area of focus in clinical trials could be the safety and efficacy of lower initial prednisone dose in initial therapy of cGVHD. Careful deliberation will need to go into assembly of eligibility criteria for such trials focused on lower-dose prednisone therapy. Another approach of interest is the use of nonprednisone systemic IS therapy for cGVHD initial therapy. On this point, our observational data do not provide robust guidance given there were approximately 20 to 40 total cases per each agent in the nonprednisone initial therapy group, limiting conclusions that could be drawn regarding differential outcome per agent and according to background medications. In addition, novel agents were not represented in this study population.

Patients

Single-patient data were available for 108 patients from 9 studies. Main patient, disease and transplant characteristics are reported in Table 4. The median age was 6 years (range 1–12). Seventy-two (67%) patients received HCT for non-malignant and 36 (33%) for malignant diseases. Fifty-one (65%) patients were treated for aGvHD and 27 (35%) for cGvHD, while 29 patients were not reported as treated for acute or chronic. All 108 patients were previously treated with steroids and received a median of 3 further lines of immune-suppressive therapies before ruxolitinib (range 1–7). More frequently used second-line therapies before ruxolitinib start were TNF inhibitors, calcineurin inhibitors (CNI), extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), sirolimus and mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC).

Ruxolitinib administration

Seventy-one of the included patients had a weight < 25 Kg and twenty-two > 25 kg. Overall, median starting daily dose was 10 mg (range 2.5–20). Twenty-four out of 51 (47%) patients < 25 kg received a starting daily dose of 5 mg (2.5 mg BID) while 19/51 (37%) of 10 mg (5 mg BID). Twenty-two ot of 27 (81%) patients > 25 Kg received an initial dose of 5 mg BID, while 5/27 (19%) of 10 mg BID. In 25 patients, dose was increased during treatment. When reported, the reason for dose increase was the lack of adequate response with the current dose in the absence of severe toxicities. Median dose increase was 5 mg (range 2.5–15) and 10 patients reached a maximum dose of 10 mg BID (identical to adult dose explored in REACH 2 and REACH3). In 6 patients, daily dose has been administered every 24 h and in one case every other day, whereas in all the other cases two times/day (BID). Median length of treatment was 80 days (1–610). Details are reported in Table 5.

### FDA approves axatilimab-csfr for chronic graft-versus-host disease… [^86e595ea]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

On August 14, 2024, the Food and Drug Administration approved axatilimab-csfr, a colony stimulating factor-1 receptor-blocking antibody, for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of at least two prior lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients weighing at least 40 kg. Full prescribing information for Niktimvo will be posted on Drugs@FDA. Efficacy and Safety Efficacy was evaluated in AGAVE-201, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial investigating 3 dosages of axatilimab-csfr in adult and pediatric patients with recurrent or refractory cGVHD who had received at least 2 lines of systemic therapy and required additional treatment. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate through Cycle 7 Day 1, where overall response included complete response or partial response according to the 2014 NIH Consensus Development Project on Response Criteria.

ORR was 75% in the 79 patients treated with the recommended dosage. The median time to first response was 1. 5 months. The median duration of response, calculated from first response to progression, death, or new systemic therapies for chronic GVHD, was 1. 9 months. In patients who achieved response, no death or new systemic therapy initiation occurred in 60% of patients for at least 12 months since response. The recommended axatilimab-csfr dose in patients who weigh at least 40 kg is 0. 3 mg/kg, up to a maximum dose of 35 mg, as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Expedited Programs This review used the Assessment Aid, a voluntary submission from the applicant to facilitate the FDA's assessment. This application was granted priority review.

FDA expedited programs are described in the Guidance for Industry: Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and Biologics. Axatilimab-csfr was granted Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation for the treatment of cGVHD.

### Failure-free survival after second-line systemic treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease [^fc16fd29]. Blood (2013). Low credibility.

This study attempted to characterize causes of treatment failure, identify associated prognostic factors, and develop shorter-term end points for trials testing investigational products or regimens for second-line systemic treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The study cohort (312 patients) received second-line systemic treatment of chronic GVHD. The primary end point was failure-free survival (FFS) defined by the absence of third-line treatment, nonrelapse mortality, and recurrent malignancy during second-line treatment. Treatment change was the major cause of treatment failure. FFS was 56% at 6 months after second-line treatment. Lower steroid doses at 6 months correlated with subsequent withdrawal of immunosuppressive treatment. Multivariate analysis showed that high-risk disease at transplantation, lower gastrointestinal involvement at second-line treatment, and severe NIH global score at second-line treatment were associated with increased risks of treatment failure. These three factors were used to define risk groups, and success rates at 6 months were calculated for each risk group either without or with various steroid dose limits at 6 months as an additional criterion of success. These success rates could be used as the basis for a clinically relevant and efficient shorter-term end point in clinical studies that evaluate agents for second-line systemic treatment of chronic GVHD.

### Durable discontinuation of systemic therapy for chronic graft – host disease: myth or reality? [^bb246063]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

Progress in research into chronic graft- versus -host disease (GvHD) over last two decades has been impressive. Disease manifestations and clinical course are now well characterized, the complex pathophysiology is much better understood, many investigational agents are available for treatment, and a regulatory approval pathway has been established. The goals of the first National Institutes of Health consensus conference, held in 2005, have been achieved and we now have three Food and Drug Administration-approved novel agents for the treatment of chronic GvHD. These new drugs hold promise of less toxicity, improved symptom control, and better patient function in steroid-refractory disease. Effective chronic GvHD prevention is now well established and the incidence of chronic GvHD can range as low as 10–12% with novel prophylactic regimens. However, much work remains to be done. Initial treatment is still prednisone with or without a calcineurin inhibitor, which fails in about 50% of patients. Best choices of subsequent treatments are still being debated and even with novel drugs complete responses in these patients are still in the range of only 10%. Furthermore, highly morbid and disabling forms of chronic GvHD still exist. We are still waiting to see published data on improved survival in patients with chronic GvHD and infections remain the leading cause of death in these patients. The financial burden of the cost of therapy for chronic GvHD surpasses an average of $300,000/year per patient in the USA. Taking all this together, it is no wonder that achieving sustained discontinuation of systemic therapy remains a highly desirable and still elusive goal in chronic GvHD. One of the major barriers is our current inability to reliably choose the timing and rate of tapering off systemic therapy, which results in endless cycles of trial-and-error treatments intertwined with disease flares and cumulative drug toxicities. In this issue of Haematologica, Chen et al. evaluate the factors associated with durable discontinuation of systemic therapy, defined rigorously as cessation of systemic therapy for at least 12 months, using data from two prospectively followed cohorts from the chronic GvHD consortium. The cumulative incidence estimate of durable discontinuation of systemic therapy was 24% and 32% at 5 and 10 years, respectively, after enrollment. Among patients who discontinued systemic therapy, the median time from chronic GvHD diagnosis to durable discontinuation of systemic therapy was 3.6 years. In multivariate analysis, several factors were identified as being associated with a lower likelihood of discontinuation of systemic therapy (Table 1). The authors also found that many factors known to be associated with the development of chronic GvHD were not associated with the likelihood of discontinuation of systemic therapy, suggesting that the pathophysiological mechanisms of chronic GvHD treatment and control may differ from those driving its initial development. These results suggest that a mandatory 6- to 12-month observation period is required to support the conclusion that systemic therapy has been discontinued permanently.

### Real-world experience with low-dose IL-2 for children and young adults with refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease [^a240e47e]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

As with our previous pediatric trial experience, we found that LD IL-2 is well tolerated, with the majority of patients continuing daily subcutaneous injections for > 1 year. In addition, we observed a high ORR in pediatric patients with cGVHD that had failed multiple lines of prior therapy. All patients were started on our previously determined maximum tolerated dose of 1 × 10 6 IU/m 2 per day, which was sustained daily for the entire duration of therapy with a few exceptions. Three patients electively reduced their dose because of malaise or discomfort. Despite these alternate dosing regimens, the ORR in our real-world study was 85%, which is similar to the response rate observed in our previous phase 1 dose-escalation study in children (ORR, 82%; n = 11). Furthermore, the 2 nonresponders in this off-study cohort were not patients for whom LD IL-2 doses had been reduced. As with this previous study, PR was seen in most patients by 8 weeks on therapy, and several patients attained organ-specific CR with extended-duration therapy (ie, > 8 weeks), particularly for cutaneous and liver manifestations of cGVHD. Although steroid weaning practices are not standardized and do not always reflect improvement of cGVHD, almost all patients in this cohort were able to reduce their steroid dose without experiencing a cGVHD flare, including 6 patients who were able to discontinue altogether. Limiting steroid exposure is important for all patients, but it is particularly important in children to permit healthy growth, development, and metabolism. Overall, we recapitulated our previous on-study response rate despite dose reduction or alternate day dosing regimens for several patients. Thus, regimens other than daily dosing for LD IL-2 may also be efficacious.

### Optimal management of chronic graft-versus-host disease in children [^f3e4f4b4]. British Journal of Haematology (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Not only is it the major cause of late mortality in HSCT patients, but it also accounts for significant morbidity. Much of the literature on chronic GVHD has focused on adults. Chronic GVHD is of major importance in children, especially since they have years to live following the complications of chronic GVHD and its therapy. The goal is to review incidence, manifestations, and therapies, especially when applicable to the paediatric population.

### An endpoint associated with clinical benefit after initial treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease [^e5dbeb40]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

No gold standard has been established as a primary endpoint in trials of initial treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and evidence showing the association of any proposed primary endpoint with clinical benefit has not been conclusively demonstrated. To address this gap, we analyzed outcomes in a cohort of 328 patients enrolled in a prospective, multicenter, observational study within 3 months after diagnosis of chronic GVHD. Complete and partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease were defined according to the 2014 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on Criteria for Clinical Trials in Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease. Success was defined as complete or partial response with no secondary systemic treatment or recurrent malignancy at 1 year after enrollment. Success was observed in fewer than 20% of the patients. The burden of disease manifestations at 1 year was lower for patients in this category than for those with stable or progressive disease. Systemic treatment ended earlier, and subsequent mortality was lower among patients with complete or partial response than among those with stable or progressive disease and those who had received secondary systemic treatment. We conclude that survival with a complete or partial response and no previous secondary systemic treatment or recurrent malignancy at 1 year after initial systemic therapy is associated with clinical benefit, a critical characteristic for consideration as a primary endpoint in a pivotal clinical trial. This prospective observational study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00637689.

ROCKstar

This clinical trial enrolled subjects at 28 centers across the US. Important eligibility criteria included age ≥ 12 years, ongoing chronic GVHD manifestations, 2–5 prior lines of systemic therapy, and stable dose of corticosteroids for 2 weeks prior to screening.

In total, 132 subjects were enrolled onto the study and randomized 1:1 to receive either 200 mg QD or 200 mg BID of belumosudil. Subjects were treated until unacceptable toxicity or clinically significant progression of chronic GVHD on treatment. Best ORR at any time, defined as the rate of participants experiencing either CR or PR per 2014 NIH Consensus Criteria was the primary endpoint of the study.

The median age of enrolled subjects was 56 years and the majority of subjects had either moderate (31%) or severe (67%) GVHD at the time of enrollment. More than one-half (52%) of participants had ≥ 4 organs involved. In this heavily pre-treated population, 72% of subjects received ≥ 3 prior lines of systemic therapy including 34% who received ibrutinib and 29% who received ruxolitinib. The median duration of belumosudil treatment was 10 months, with 44% staying on treatment for ≥ 1 year. The most common reasons for treatment discontinuation were progression of disease (15.9%), AEs (12.1%), voluntary withdrawal (9.8%), and physician discretion (8.3%). The ORR was similar between the QD (74%, 95% CI: 62%-84%) and BID dosing groups (77%, 95% CI: 65%-87%). The CR rate of all subjects was 5.3% (n = 7). The ORR was similar for participants who received prior ibrutinib (74%, 95% CI: 59%-86%) or ruxolitinib (68%, 95% CI: 51%-83%). During treatment with belumosudil, 65% of subjects reduced their corticosteroid dose. Additionally, a clinically meaningful improvement in the LSS summary score from baseline was observed in 59% and 62% of subjects in the 200 mg daily and 200 mg twice daily cohorts.

### More evidence for low-dose IL-2 for chronic GVHD in children [^e3d79dcb]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

In this issue of Blood Advances, Wobma et al report that subcutaneous low-dose interleukin-2 (LD IL-2) reversed chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) manifestations in children and young adults who were treated outside of the context of a clinical trial. In this report of real-world data (RWD), 15 patients whose cGVHD was long standing (median, 8 months from diagnosis) and not responding despite multiple treatments (median, 3 prior therapies) were treated with LD IL-2 for a median of 15 months. LD IL-2 treatment was safe; there were no serious adverse events attributed to LD IL-2, and although 4 patients did not tolerate the maximum dose of 1 × 10 6 IU/m 2 per day because of malaise (n = 3) or renal impairment (n = 1), 13 of 15 patients received at least 4 weeks of treatment and were evaluated for response. Most patients responded in at least 1 target organ (85%, 11 of 13) with an impressive complete response rate (46%, 6 of 13) in a disease in which complete responses are rare especially when symptoms have been resistant to treatment for a long duration. Children aged as young as 1 year experienced benefit and importantly, responses were observed across the full spectrum of cGVHD targets such as the liver, gastrointestinal tract, joints, and even in particularly hard-to-treat manifestations such as sclerotic skin and lung GVHD.

### Initial therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease: analysis of practice variation and failure-free survival [^27628e34]. Blood Advances (2021). Medium credibility.

Therapy categories

All therapy approaches were initially summarized, revealing marked heterogeneity in treatment practices. From this initial summary, therapy subgroups were defined to bring together conceptually related treatment approaches and to ensure sufficient sample sizes per treatment group for analysis. The 3 initial groups included the following: (a) prednisone only (or prednisone dose-equivalent), (b) prednisone + additional systemic IS agent(s), and (c) other systemic agent(s) without prednisone. For the prednisone + additional IS agents group, the additional IS agents had to be newly started per the initial therapy definition and did not meet the failure medication definition. Thus, these were truly an intentional combined therapy bundle. Sole use of topical agents was not considered in this analysis. For groups 2 and 3, additional subgroups were defined. For group 2, subgroups included the following: (a) prednisone ± calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), (b) prednisone + sirolimus ± CNI, (c) prednisone + mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or methotrexate (MTX) ± CNI, (d) prednisone + ECP ± CNI, (e) prednisone + rituximab ± CNI ± other, and (f) prednisone + other/rare combinations. For group 3, subgroups included the following: (a) CNI only, (b) MMF or MTX ± CNI without sirolimus, (c) sirolimus ± CNI without MMF, and (d) other/rare combinations ± CNI. For all prednisone-containing approaches (groups 1 and 2 above), prednisone (or equivalent) doses were categorized to examine the impact of steroid dose on treatment outcome: < 0.25, 0.25 to 0.74, 0.75 to 1.25, and > 1.25 mg/kg per day dose, to bracket common doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg per day. The 3 parent consortium observational studies informing this analysis did not capture whether IS agents were given as part of a concurrent therapeutic clinical trial vs off-protocol therapy.

### Ruxolitinib in treatment-naive or corticosteroid-refractory paediatric patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (REACH5): interim analysis of a single-arm, multicentre, phase 2 study [^39b6dbcd]. The Lancet: Haematology (2024). High credibility.

Background

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a debilitating, and sometimes life threatening, complication of allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). We aimed to investigate the activity, pharmacokinetics, and safety of ruxolitinib added to corticosteroids in paediatric patients (ie, < 18 years) with moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD.

Methods

In this single-arm, phase 2 study, patients were recruited at 21 hospitals or clinics across 14 countries in Asia, Europe, and Canada. Eligible patients were aged 28 days to younger than 18 years, had undergone allogenic HSCT, and had been diagnosed with treatment-naive or corticosteroid-refractory moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD, per 2014 National Institutes of Health consensus criteria. Patients received oral ruxolitinib dosing on the basis of their age at the start of treatment: those aged 12 years to younger than 18 years received 10 mg twice daily (age ≥ 12 to < 18 years group), those aged 6 years to younger than 12 years (age ≥ 6 to < 12 years group) received 5 mg twice daily, and those aged 2 years to younger than 6 years received 4 mg/m 2 twice daily (age ≥ 2 to < 6 years group). Treatment was to be administered in 28-day cycles for approximately 36 months, alongside supportive treatment per institutional guidelines. The primary activity endpoint was overall response rate at cycle 7 day 1. Activity and safety analyses are reported in the full analysis set, which included all patients who received at least one dose of ruxolitinib. Here we report the prespecified interim analysis, scheduled to occur after all patients had completed 1 year of treatment or discontinued treatment, and the results for the primary endpoint evaluation reported here is to be considered final. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03774082, enrolment is complete, and the study is ongoing.

Findings

Between May 20, 2020, and Sept 17, 2021, 48 patients were screened, of whom 45 were enrolled and received at least one dose of study drug (median age was 11·0 years [IQR 7·2–14·3], 16 [36%] were female, 29 [64%] were male, 21 [47%] were White, one [2%] was Black or African American, 23 [51%] were Asian, 17 [38%] were treatment-naive, 28 [62%] were corticosteroid-refractory). As of data cutoff (Oct 19, 2022), after a median ruxolitinib exposure of 55·1 weeks (IQR 13·1–75·3), the overall response rate at cycle 7 day 1 was 40·0% (18 of 45; 90% CI 27·7–53·3), with responses seen in seven (41%) of 17 treatment-naive patients and 11 (39%) of 28 corticosteroid-refractory patients. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse were neutropenia (eight [18%] of 45) and thrombocytopenia (six [13%]). Seven (16%) patients had grade 3 or worse serious treatment-related adverse events; the most common was hyponatraemia (two [4%] of 45). Three (7%) patients died while on-treatment (within 30 days of treatment discontinuation), one due to Aspergillus infection, one due to septic shock, and one due to acute respiratory distress syndrome; none were considered to be related to study drug.

Interpretation

Pending final analysis, this study suggests that ruxolitinib is active and well tolerated in both treatment-naive and corticosteroid-refractory patients aged 2 years to younger than 18 years with chronic GVHD, thereby supporting its use in this patient population. The safety profile of ruxolitinib in this patient population is consistent with that of adults. Final analysis of this study will provide further information on the long-term benefits of ruxolitinib in children with chronic GVHD.

### Ibrutinib for chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of prior therapy [^ea1e7e7c]. Blood (2017). Low credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation with few effective options available after failure of corticosteroids. B and T cells play a role in the pathophysiology of cGVHD. Ibrutinib inhibits Bruton tyrosine kinase in B cells and interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase in T cells. In preclinical models, ibrutinib reduced severity of cGVHD. This multicenter, open-label study evaluated the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in patients with active cGVHD with inadequate response to corticosteroid-containing therapies. Forty-two patients who had failed 1 to 3 prior treatments received ibrutinib (420 mg) daily until cGVHD progression. The primary efficacy end point was cGVHD response based on 2005 National Institutes of Health criteria. At a median follow-up of 13.9 months, best overall response was 67%; 71% of responders showed a sustained response for ≥ 20 weeks. Responses were observed across involved organs evaluated. Most patients with multiple cGVHD organ involvement had a multiorgan response. Median corticosteroid dose in responders decreased from 0.29 mg/kg per day at baseline to 0.12 mg/kg per day at week 49; 5 responders discontinued corticosteroids. The most common adverse events were fatigue, diarrhea, muscle spasms, nausea, and bruising. Plasma levels of soluble factors associated with inflammation, fibrosis, and cGVHD significantly decreased over time with ibrutinib. Ibrutinib resulted in clinically meaningful responses with acceptable safety in patients with ≥ 1 prior treatments for cGVHD. Based on these results, ibrutinib was approved in the United States for treatment of adult patients with cGVHD after failure of 1 or more lines of systemic therapy. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT02195869.

### Recent FDA approvals in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease [^5ca6f95d]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a common complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. For many years, there have been few effective treatment options for patients with GVHD. First-line systemic treatment remains corticosteroids, but up to 50% of patients will develop steroid-refractory GVHD and the prognosis for these patients is poor. Elucidation of the pathophysiological mechanisms of acute and chronic GVHD has laid a foundation for novel therapeutic approaches. Since 2017, there have now been 4 approvals by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for GVHD. Ruxolitinib, an oral selective JAK1/2 inhibitor, received FDA approval for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD in 2019 and remains the only agent approved for acute GVHD. There are currently 3 FDA approvals for the treatment of chronic GVHD: (1) ibrutinib, a BTK inhibitor traditionally used for B-cell malignancies, was the first agent approved for chronic GVHD after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy, (2) belumosudil, an oral selective inhibitor of ROCK2, for patients with chronic GVHD who received at least 2 prior lines of treatment, and (3) ruxolitinib for chronic GVHD after failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy. In this review, we highlight the clinical data which support these FDA approvals in acute and chronic GVHD with a focus on mechanism of actions, clinical efficacy, and toxicities associated with these agents.

### A phase 2 multicenter trial of ofatumumab and prednisone as initial therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease [^f704251c]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Treatment plan

Prednisone was started at 1 mg/kg actual body weight per day. The duration of prednisone therapy and tapering schedule were not mandated by the protocol and were coordinated by the treating physicians according to their institutional guidelines. If cGVHD activity increased upon taper, prednisone could be increased to an upper limit of 2 mg/kg per day (or equivalent), but doses higher than that were considered a separate line of additional systemic IST. Taper of other systemic agents and use of topical agents (eg, ocular drops, mouth rinses, topical steroid creams) were similarly not regulated by the trial or considered treatment failure. Ofatumumab was administered by IV infusion; preparation and infusion conditions were per standard procedures. Subjects in this phase II portion of the trial were uniformly dosed at 1000 mg of ofatumumab (delivered once on day 0 and again on day 14 of therapy). Premedication was uniformly delivered within 30 minutes before each infusion: acetaminophen 1000 mg, diphenhydramine 50 mg, and methylprednisolone IV 50 mg. Vital signs were monitored every 30 (± 5) minutes during infusion or more frequently as needed. The initial infusion rate, timing of sequential infusion rate escalation, and rules surrounding response to observed infusion reactions were enforced. If grade 4 infusion reactions occurred, no further ofatumumab therapy was to be given; lesser grade infusion reactions were managed with supportive care, including IV fluids, antihistamines, and steroids. Supportive antimicrobial prophylaxis followed institutional standards. IV immunoglobulin replacement was delivered per discretion of the treating physician.

### Recognizing and managing chronic graft-versus-host disease [^e70a8b8c]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2008). Low credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is an immune-mediated disorder that occurs frequently after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Most cases are diagnosed within the first year at a median of 4 to 6 months after HCT, but 5–10% of cases are initially diagnosed beyond the first post-transplant year. Chronic GVHD most often involves the skin and mouth, but almost any other organ system can be involved. Correct diagnosis is critical so that appropriate therapy can be started promptly to minimize symptoms and prevent irreversible organ damage. Initial treatment should be with cortico-steroid-based therapy. Optimal secondary treatment as not been established, although a large number of agents may provide benefits. A 2004 NIH conference focused on development of consensus criteria for chronic GVHD. Six papers published in 2005 and 2006 propose consensus definitions for chronic GVHD diagnosis and scoring, pathology, biomarkers, response criteria, supportive care and design of clinical trials. This review will focus on common clinical presentations and principles for managing chronic GVHD. The most frequently used secondary therapies and ongoing trials are summarized. New concepts from the NIH consensus conference are discussed.

### Taiwan consensus on pulmonary chronic graft-versus-host disease: a joint statement from the Taiwan society of blood and marrow transplantation (TBMT) and Taiwan society of pulmonary and critical care medicine (TSPCCM) [^abc33d68]. British Journal of Haematology (2025). Medium credibility.

The duration of systemic corticosteroid use is not specified in most studies, with the exception of the FAM trial, which specified a 2‐week course followed by tapering. However, prolonged systemic corticosteroid treatment is associated with increased mortality from infectious complications. Therefore, the duration of systemic corticosteroid should be carefully individualized by the treating physicians according to the patient's condition.

Although systemic corticosteroids have been recommended as the first‐line treatment option for BOS, the long‐term outcome is not satisfactory. Steroid pulse therapy has been tested for BOS, but the evidence is mainly based on paediatric patients. In a 12‐patient cohort, five patients (42%) had a good response to treatment, four patients (33%) stabilized with moderate lung disease and three patients (25%) progressed to end‐stage disease. Additionally, in a survey of 31 centres in Germany, Austria and Switzerland, 16 of 31 centres administer a pulse of steroids during the course of BOS, with six centres administering steroids at the time of diagnosis of pulmonary cGVHD and four centres administering it as a second‐line therapy. Based on this evidence, steroid pulse therapy at a dosage of 10 mg/kg/day for 3 days has been listed as a 2C recommendation in two guidelines. Due to the relatively low evidence level, we reserve steroid pulse therapy as an option for more advanced BOS, as an adjunct to the FAM regimen and regular systemic corticosteroids.

Patients and methods

Patients

Patients (n = 68) were included in the compassionate access program for belumosudil at the request of their referring physician between April 2022 and September 2024 from sixteen different transplantation centers in France, following verification of eligibility criteria by the French National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM). The inclusion criteria were: age over 12 years, weight over 40 kg, performance status above 60%, diagnosis of moderate to severe chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease (cGVHD) according to NIH criteria, and having received at least two prior lines of treatment. Corticosteroid doses had to be stable for at least two weeks and below 1 mg/kg. Patients could not have signs of hematologic malignancy relapse or post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) at treatment initiation, cytopenia (platelet count < 50 G/L or neutrophil count < 1.5 G/L), chronic renal insufficiency defined by a glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m², liver cytolysis (defined as ASAT or ALAT levels greater than three times the upper normal limit (ULN)), or bilirubin levels exceeding 1.5 ULN. Active viral infections with hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV, and secondary cancers (except basal cell carcinoma) were also exclusion criteria. Women could not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and all participants had to agree to use contraception. Patient data were extracted from the EBMT Data registry (European Blood and Marrow Transplantation) and systematically reviewed and updated by their referring physician. Data were pseudonymized, and the following information was collected: donor and recipient age, weight, height, initial hematologic disease and pre-transplant status, donor and recipient CMV serology status, donor and recipient blood group, conditioning regimen, GVHD prophylaxis, stage and grade of acute and chronic GVHD, prior chronic GVHD treatments and response to each line according to NIH criteria, start and end dates of belumosudil, treatment response at 3 months, 6 months, relapse and status at the last follow-up. Treatment-related toxicities were documented as part of the compassionate access program and reported by clinicians.

### Novel targets in the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease [^83ef0b19]. Leukemia (2017). Low credibility.

Despite advances that have improved survival after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remains a leading cause of late morbidity and mortality after transplant. Current treatment options show limited efficacy in steroid-refractory disease, and there exists a paucity of robust data to guide management decisions. Lack of United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)- or European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved agents in GVHD underscore the importance of developing novel therapies. Better understanding of the biology of chronic GVHD has provided novel targets for treatment, and structured guidelines in diagnosis and in clinical trial design have provided a common language and pathways for research in this area. These, combined with the surge of drug development in Oncology and Immunology, are factors that have contributed to the accelerating field of drug development and clinical research in chronic GVHD. In these exciting times, it is possible to foresee long awaited advances in the treatment of this devastating complication of HCT. This review will summarize the ongoing clinical development for novel therapies in chronic GVHD.

### FDA approves ruxolitinib for chronic graft-versus-host disease… [^9bce00c5]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

On September 22, 2021, the Food and Drug Administration approved ruxolitinib for chronic graft-versus-host disease after failure of one or two lines of systemic therapy in adult and pediatric patients 12 years and older. Efficacy was evaluated in REACH-3, a randomized, open-label, multicenter clinical trial of ruxolitinib compared to best available therapy for corticosteroid-refractory cGVHD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The trial randomized 329 patients to receive either ruxolitinib 10 mg twice daily or BAT. The major efficacy outcome used to support approval was overall response rate through cycle 7 day 1. The ORR was 70% for the ruxolitinib arm and 57% for the BAT arm with a difference in response rate of 13%.

The median durations of response, calculated from first response to progression, death, or new systemic therapies for chronic GVHD, were 4. 2 months and
2. 1 months for the ruxolitinib and BAT arms, respectively. The median times from first response to death or new systemic therapies for cGVHD were 25 months and 5. 6 months for the ruxolitinib and BAT arms, respectively. In cGVHD, the most common hematologic adverse reactions of ruxolitinib were anemia and thrombocytopenia. The most common nonhematologic adverse reactions were infections and viral infection. The recommended ruxolitinib starting dose for cGVHD is 10 mg given orally twice daily.

### A phase 2 multicenter trial of ofatumumab and prednisone as initial therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease [^99e98f91]. Blood Advances (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a common immune-mediated disorder after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), affecting approximately 40% to 50% of HCT recipients. It is a leading cause of late HCT-associated morbidity, mortality, impaired quality of life, disability, and prolonged duration of immunosuppressive therapy (IST). Thus, it has a significant adverse impact on the life and well-being of alloHCT recipients.

Standard initial therapy for cGVHD includes high-dose glucocorticoids (commonly 1 mg/kg per day of prednisone) with or without calcineurin or mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors. Although current combination therapies have not demonstrated superiority to glucocorticoids, trials of concurrent therapies with glucocorticoids are critical for limiting cumulative glucocorticoid exposure and related toxicities. Unfortunately, only approximately one-half of all initially treated patients achieve complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), whereas glucocorticoid-refractory nonresponders succumb to substantially higher risk of nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Additionally, failure of initial therapy is a poor prognostic factor because it necessitates subsequent IST with resulting adverse outcomes and treatment-related complications.

Given these challenges, multiple prior large, well-designed trials have examined combined initial therapy approaches (corticosteroids plus other systemic IST), yet none has proven superiority over corticosteroids alone. More recently, the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) 0801 trial tested the approach of sirolimus/prednisone vs calcineurin inhibitor/sirolimus/prednisone. The primary endpoint of CR/PR according to National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria without death/relapse/secondary therapy at 6 months was 48.6% for 2-drug and 50% for 3-drug regimens, with comparable failure-free survival (FFS) to previously published estimates. Despite similar efficacy, the 2-drug regimen was associated with less renal impairment and an improvement in quality of life. Although the BMT CTN 0801 trial adhered to the NIH consensus criteria for cGVHD and set the current standard for the field, new therapies and approaches are still needed to optimize frontline therapy for cGVHD.

### Ruxolitinib in patients with corticosteroid-refractory or corticosteroid-dependent chronic graft-versus-host disease: 3-year final analysis of the phase III REACH3 study [^dd046e68]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD); however, additional treatment options are needed for patients refractory to or dependent on corticosteroids (SR/D). The phase III, REACH3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier:) demonstrated the superiority of ruxolitinib over best available therapy (BAT) at 24 weeks in patients with SR/D-cGVHD. Subsequently, ruxolitinib was approved for the treatment of cGVHD in patients (age ≥ 12 years) with an inadequate response to corticosteroids or other systemic therapies, and is recommended as second-line treatment in the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation guidelines.

After the primary analysis, REACH3 assessed the long-term efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib over 3 years and response in patients who switched from BAT to ruxolitinib.

### Recent FDA approvals in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease [^e8bdc12e]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

FDA Approved Agents for Chronic GVHD

Similar to acute GVHD, corticosteroids have traditionally been the recommended first-line treatment for chronic GVHD. Although there is no consensus treatment for SR chronic GVHD, commonly used agents include calcineurin inhibitors, extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, rituximab, and mycophenolate mofetil. There have been 3 recent approvals for the treatment of refractory chronic GVHD: ibrutinib, belumosudil, and ruxolitinib.

Ibrutinib

Ibrutinib is an oral selective and irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), which inhibits signal transduction from the B-cell receptor, activation of B-cells, and interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinases (ITK). Pre-clinical models found that mice who underwent HCT from BTK- or ITK-deficient donors did not develop chronic GVHD, suggesting a possible role for ibrutinib for the treatment of chronic GVHD. Ibrutinib became the first FDA-approved agent for chronic GVHD in 2017 based on the results of a single-arm Phase II trial (PYC-1129) (Table 3).

PCYC-1129

This clinical trial enrolled subjects across 11 centers in the US. Participants were eligible for the trial if they were ≥ 18 years old with steroid-dependent or SR chronic GVHD and had ≤ 3 prior systemic treatment regimens. Steroid-dependent disease was defined as GVHD requiring at least 12 weeks of prednisone ≥ 0.25 mg/kg, while SR disease was defined as progression of chronic GVHD after at least 4 weeks of treatment with ≥ 0.5 mg/kg prednisone. Patients were eligible if they had active chronic GVHD, defined as having an erythematous rash involving at least 25% of body surface area or a NIH mouth score > 4. The requirement of one of these inflammatory manifestations of chronic GVHD has not been adopted in subsequent trials. The primary efficacy endpoint for the phase II portion of the trial was best ORR at any time, defined as a CR or PR based on the 2005 NIH Chronic GVHD Consensus Panel and modified based on the 2014 NIH response criteria.

Regarding medical management for chronic graft-versus-host disease, more specifically with respect to management of cutaneous chronic GvHD, systemic therapy, BCSH/BSBMT 2012 guidelines recommend to consider initiating imatinib as second-line therapy in patients with refractory sclerodermatous chronic GvHD.

### Recent FDA approvals in the treatment of graft-versus-host disease [^f3bb18ff]. The Oncologist (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

With an increasing number of allogeneic HCT being performed each year, nontransplant oncologists are more likely to be involved in the management of patients with ongoing GVHD. While the recommended frontline systemic therapy for both acute and chronic GVHD remains corticosteroids, there has long been no consensus on the treatment of SR-GVHD. There are now 3 agents approved for SR-GVHD: ruxolitinib (acute and chronic), ibrutinib (chronic), and belumosudil (chronic). The results of REACH2 make a compelling case that ruxolitinib should be considered the consensus first choice in the treatment for acute SR-GVHD and its uptake into clinical practice is increasing. In chronic GVHD, all 3 agents have shown good efficacy and favorable toxicity profiles in clinical trials. Future studies will continue to investigate these agents and other novel therapies in multiple settings and combinations and are sure to further advance the therapeutic landscape for GVHD.

### Real-world experience with low-dose IL-2 for children and young adults with refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease [^deb88eea]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a multisystem disorder that complicates allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in between 20% and 50% of children. It arises from a failure of donor-derived B and T cells to develop tolerance to allo- and autoantigens during immune reconstitution after transplantation. The immune-mediated damage in cGVHD eventually results in fibrotic changes that can affect any organ system and can lead to debilitating complications such as sclerotic skin, joint contractures, and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Given these serious multiorgan effects, cGVHD is the leading cause of nonrelapse morbidity and mortality after allogeneic HCT.

The development of cGVHD is driven by tissue damage that primes dendritic cells to display costimulatory molecules to T cells. Subsequently, allo- and autoreactive T cells can activate pathogenic B cells, which release damaging immunoglobulins. Lymphocyte activation is accompanied by macrophage activation and release of profibrotic growth factors. Because of thymic injury from transplant conditioning and T-cell alloreactivity, central tolerance is impaired. Poor reconstitution of the CD4 + regulatory T-cell (Treg) compartment after transplantation also leads to dysfunctional peripheral tolerance. The failures in central and peripheral tolerance enable unchecked inflammation to drive fibrosis.

With broad immunosuppressive effects, corticosteroids remain the first-line therapy for cGVHD; however, prolonged steroid exposure is associated with significant morbidity, and between 40% and 50% of patients are steroid refractory (SR). There are now 3 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved second-line agents for treatment of refractory cGVHD: ibrutinib, ruxolitinib, and belumosudil, with overall response rates (ORR) of 50% to 77% in phase 2 and 3 adult studies. Ibrutinib inhibits Bruton tyrosine kinase and IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase, targeting pathogenic B- and T-cell activation, respectively. Ruxolitinib is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that blocks signaling through multiple cytokine receptors on lymphocytes. Finally, belumosudil inhibits Rho-associated coiled coil–containing protein kinase-2, which prevents STAT3 phosphorylation and development of Th17 and T-follicular helper cell populations.

### Dose-escalated interleukin-2 therapy for refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease in adults and children [^70e69f11]. Blood Advances (2019). Medium credibility.

Low-dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) generates a rapid rise in plasma IL-2 levels and CD4 + CD25 + CD127 - Foxp3 + regulatory T-cell (CD4Treg) proliferation, but both decrease over time despite continued daily administration. To test whether IL-2 dose escalation at the time of anticipated falls in plasma levels could circumvent tachyphylaxis and enhance CD4Treg expansion, we conducted a phase 1 trial in 10 adult and 11 pediatric patients with steroid-refractory cGVHD (www.clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02318082). Daily IL-2 was initiated in children and adults (0.33 × 10 6 and 0.67 × 10 6 IU/m 2 per day, respectively). Dose escalations were scheduled at weeks 2 and 4 to a maximum dose of 1 × 10 6 IU/m 2 per day in children and 2 × 10 6 IU/m 2 per day in adults. Patients continued at their maximum tolerated dose (MTD) until week 8. Children tolerated IL-2 dose escalation with partial responses (PRs) in 9 of 11 patients (82%) at multiple cGVHD sites, including lung. Patient-reported outcome scores for skin and lung improved significantly in pediatric patients. In contrast, 5 of 10 adults required dose reduction, and only 2 of 7 evaluable patients (29%) had PRs at week 8. CD4Tregs and natural killer cells expanded in both cohorts without significant changes in conventional CD4 + T cells (Tcons) or CD8 + T cells. Children achieved a higher median CD4Treg/Tcon ratio at week 8 (0.4 vs 0.18, P = 0.02) despite lower IL-2 doses. We show for the first time that low-dose IL-2 is safe and effective in children with advanced cGVHD. In adults, escalation above the previously defined MTD did not improve CD4Treg expansion or clinical response.

### Real-world experience with low-dose IL-2 for children and young adults with refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease [^ed2afee9]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Lastly, because patients could be on multiple concomitant therapies, we explored whether cotherapies might impair Treg expansion from LD IL-2. This was not seen, as high starting steroid dose (median 0.79 mg/kg per day) or the presence of ruxolitinib or calcineurin inhibitors did not appear to impair Treg expansion (or clinical response for those without laboratory data). Ruxolitinib is of interest because the IL-2 receptor is a JAK 1/3 receptor. Although ruxolitinib is more specific for JAK 1/2-based cytokine receptors, there could theoretically be nonspecific blockade that could dampen the therapeutic effect of LD IL-2. This was not reflected in our small cohort, as 5 patients were concurrently receiving ruxolitinib at time of LD IL-2 start and 4 had objective clinical responses (1 inevaluable) with Treg expansion in all 3 patients with available immune cell data. Calcineurin inhibitors block IL-2 production by effector T cells, which may be detrimental to Tregs by eliminating their critical source of IL-2. However, by providing the IL-2 exogenously, this problem is overcome, and Tregs can still expand while on concurrent LD IL-2 therapy and calcineurin inhibition. The ability for LD IL-2 to pair well with other drugs makes it attractive for clinical use, although our findings require further validation with higher patient numbers.

Although we are encouraged by our collective pediatric data, which now includes 24 pediatric patients with multiple years of follow-up, it has become increasingly difficult to obtain insurance approval for LD IL-2 because new small molecules have achieved FDA approval for second-line therapy of cGVHD. While our results reflect only single-center experience, LD IL-2 has consistently been shown as a safe and effective therapy with 105 adult and 11 pediatric patientstreated across 5 clinical trials with efficacy at least on par with the FDA-approved agents. It is our hope that a Children's Oncology Group–sponsored trial of LD IL-2 for refractory cGVHD in children, currently in development (Carrie Kitko, personal communication, 30 March 2023), can help to establish efficacy in a multicenter setting and subsequently advance the approval status of LD IL-2 for this indication.

### Updates in chronic graft-versus-host disease management [^8ac778aa]. American Journal of Hematology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD) remains the most important long-term complication of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), but the field has seen significant changes in the last decade. Remarkable advances in the understanding of the biological pathways of cGvHD, lead to the development of targeted therapy with novel drugs thereby minimizing the exposure to harmful corticosteroids, preserving function and mobility, preventing disability, and improving quality of life (QoL) and overall survival (OS). Steroid-refractory cGvHD management has recently experienced significant improvement since ibrutinib and ruxolitinib were approved for patients that failed at least one line of treatment and belumosudil for patients that failed two lines. These recently approved drugs will be discussed in this review, along with perspectives regarding cGVHD management and additional promising drug in development.

### Ibrutinib for therapy of steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease: a multicenter real-world analysis [^7bef8828]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a common late immune-mediated disorder after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). Standard initial therapy with prednisone often fails to provide durable complete resolution, thus next-line systemic immune suppressive agents (ISs) are commonly required. Multiple agents are used for steroid-refractory cGVHD (SR-cGVHD), and 3 of these currently have the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (ibrutinib, ruxolitinib, and belumosudil). Durable success in SR-cGVHD therapy is limited, however. In secondary cGVHD therapy, failure-free survival (FFS; a composite end point inclusive of death, relapse, and requirement of an additional line of IS therapy) has been reported to be 56% by 6 months and 45% by 12 months. Thus, advances are needed to improve outcomes.

Prior work supports the importance of cell signaling mediators (Bruton tyrosine kinase in B cells and interleukin-2 inducible T-cell kinase in T cells) in the immune response that drives cGVHD. In the preclinical setting, targeted disruption of Bruton tyrosine kinase and T-cell kinase ameliorated cGVHD. In a multicenter phase 2 clinical trial, ibrutinib was tested in patients with cGVHD who had failed at least 1 prior line of IS therapy. The trial enrolled 42 patients, and they were treated with ibrutinib 420 mg daily until cGVHD progression. With a median follow-up of 13.9 months, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) best overall response was 67%, and most responders demonstrated response for at least 20 weeks. Responses were seen across involved organ sites, and steroid dose reduction was observed. Adverse events included diarrhea, fatigue, muscle spasm, nausea, and bruising. These results led to an FDA indication for ibrutinib in the treatment of cGVHD failing at least 1 prior line of therapy in August 2017. A subsequent report described longer-term outcomes, a pediatric trial has been conducted, and a single-center retrospective study has been completed.

Questions remain regarding the efficacy, safety, and use of ibrutinib in SR-cGVHD, and no large-scale study has been conducted since approval. We hypothesized that a multicenter real-world observational study would provide information regarding ibrutinib treatment response, variation in response according to baseline cGVHD features, durability of treatment success, and treatment-emergent toxicities leading to ibrutinib dose reduction or discontinuation.

14	CLINICAL STUDIES

14.1	Chronic Graft versus Host Disease

Study KD025-213 (NCT03640481) was a randomized, open-label, multicenter study of REZUROCK for treatment of patients with chronic GVHD who had received 2 to 5 prior lines of systemic therapy and required additional treatment. Patients were excluded from the studies if platelets were < 50 × 109/L; absolute neutrophil count < 1.5 × 109/L; AST or ALT > 3 × ULN; total bilirubin > 1.5 × ULN; QTc(F) > 480 ms; eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2; or FEV1 ≤ 39%. There were 66 patients treated with REZUROCK 200 mg taken orally once daily. Concomitant treatment with supportive care therapies for chronic GVHD was permitted. Concomitant treatment with GVHD prophylaxis and standard care systemic chronic GVHD therapies was permitted as long as the subject has been on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to study. Initiation of new systemic chronic GVHD therapy while on study was not permitted.

Demographics and baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 5.

The efficacy of REZUROCK was based on overall response rate (ORR) through Cycle 7 Day 1 where overall response included complete response or partial response according to the 2014 NIH Response Criteria. The ORR results are presented in Table 6. The ORR was 75% (95% CI: 63, 85). The median duration of response, calculated from first response to progression, death, or new systemic therapies for chronic GVHD, was 1.9 months (95% CI: 1.2, 2.9). The median time to first response was 1.8 months (95% CI: 1.0, 1.9). In patients who achieved response, no death or new systemic therapy initiation occurred in 62% (95% CI: 46, 74) of patients for at least 12 months since response.

ORR results were supported by exploratory analyses of patient-reported symptom bother which showed at least a 7-point decrease in the Lee Symptom Scale summary score through Cycle 7 Day 1 in 52% (95% CI: 40, 65) of patients.

### Ruxolitinib (Jakafi) [^81a3e42a]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Recommended Dosage for Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease

The recommended starting dose of Jakafi is 5 mg given orally twice daily. Consider increasing the dose to 10 mg twice daily after at least 3 days of treatment if the ANC and platelet counts are not decreased by 50% or more relative to the first day of dosing with Jakafi.

Consider tapering Jakafi after 6 months of treatment in patients with response who have discontinued therapeutic doses of corticosteroids. Taper Jakafi by one dose level approximately every 8 weeks (10 mg twice daily to 5 mg twice daily to 5 mg once daily). If aGVHD signs or symptoms recur during or after the taper of Jakafi, consider retreatment.

Dose Modification Guidelines for Patients with Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease

Monitor complete blood counts (CBC), including platelet count and ANC, and bilirubin prior to initiating therapy, every 2 to 4 weeks until doses are stabilized, and then as indicated clinically.

Modify the dose of Jakafi for adverse reactions as described in Table 7. For dose reductions, patients who are currently receiving Jakafi 10 mg twice daily may have their dose reduced to 5 mg twice daily; patients receiving 5 mg twice daily may have their dose reduced to 5 mg once daily. Patients who are unable to tolerate Jakafi at a dose of 5 mg once daily should have treatment interrupted until their clinical and/or laboratory parameters recover.

### Reduced-intensity conditioning and HLA-matched haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation in patients with chronic granulomatous disease: a prospective multicentre study [^04cd39b2]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

In chronic granulomatous disease allogeneic haemopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) in adolescents and young adults and patients with high-risk disease is complicated by graft-failure, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and transplant-related mortality. We examined the effect of a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen designed to enhance myeloid engraftment and reduce organ toxicity in these patients.

Methods

This prospective study was done at 16 centres in ten countries worldwide. Patients aged 0–40 years with chronic granulomatous disease were assessed and enrolled at the discretion of individual centres. Reduced-intensity conditioning consisted of high-dose fludarabine (30 mg/m(2) [infants < 9 kg 1·2 mg/kg]; one dose per day on days -8 to -3), serotherapy (anti-thymocyte globulin [10 mg/kg, one dose per day on days -4 to -1; or thymoglobuline 2·5 mg/kg, one dose per day on days -5 to -3]; or low-dose alemtuzumab [< 1 mg/kg on days -8 to -6]), and low-dose (50–72% of myeloablative dose) or targeted busulfan administration (recommended cumulative area under the curve: 45–65 mg/L×h). Busulfan was administered mainly intravenously and exceptionally orally from days -5 to -3. Intravenous busulfan was dosed according to weight-based recommendations and was administered in most centres (ten) twice daily over 4 h. Unmanipulated bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells from HLA-matched related-donors or HLA-9/10 or HLA-10/10 matched unrelated-donors were infused. The primary endpoints were overall survival and event-free survival (EFS), probabilities of overall survival and EFS at 2 years, incidence of acute and chronic GVHD, achievement of at least 90% myeloid donor chimerism, and incidence of graft failure after at least 6 months of follow-up.

Findings

56 patients (median age 12·7 years; IQR 6·8–17·3) with chronic granulomatous disease were enrolled from June 15, 2003, to Dec 15, 2012. 42 patients (75%) had high-risk features (ie, intractable infections and autoinflammation), 25 (45%) were adolescents and young adults (age 14–39 years). 21 HLA-matched related-donor and 35 HLA-matched unrelated-donor transplants were done. Median time to engraftment was 19 days (IQR 16–22) for neutrophils and 21 days (IQR 16–25) for platelets. At median follow-up of 21 months (IQR 13–35) overall survival was 93% (52 of 56) and EFS was 89% (50 of 56). The 2-year probability of overall survival was 96% (95% CI 86·46–99·09) and of EFS was 91% (79·78–96·17). Graft-failure occurred in 5% (three of 56) of patients. The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD of grade III-IV was 4% (two of 56) and of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 7% (four of 56). Stable (≥ 90%) myeloid donor chimerism was documented in 52 (93%) surviving patients.

Interpretation

This reduced-intensity conditioning regimen is safe and efficacious in high-risk patients with chronic granulomatous disease.

Funding

None.

### Impact of concomitant azoles on ruxolitinib treatment in patients with GVHD: post hoc analyses of REACH2 and REACH3 [^9c3603b7]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a serious and potentially fatal complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) that develops when alloreactive donor T cells mount an immunologic attack against recipient organs or tissues. Despite prophylactic immunosuppressive therapies, GVHD develops in ∼50% of allogeneic HSCT recipients, leading to severe morbidity, reduced quality of life, and increased mortality. Acute GVHD (aGVHD) manifests primarily in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and liver, and it accounts for up to one-third of deaths within a year of HSCT. Chronic GVHD (cGVHD) manifests with multiorgan pathology, including the skin, mouth, eye, gastrointestinal tract, liver, genitalia, lungs, and musculoskeletal system, and is a leading cause of nonrelapse mortality (22%-37% at 5 years).

Systemic corticosteroids are the recommended first-line treatment for aGVHD and cGVHD, but ∼35% to 60% of patients become either steroid refractory (SR) or steroid dependent (SD; patients with cGVHD become SD because of an inability to taper corticosteroids below 0.25 mg/kg per day in 2 attempts over 8 weeks), requiring second-line therapies. Since 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration has approved 4 therapies (ibrutinib, belumosudil, axatilimab, and ruxolitinib) for GVHD after failure of at least 1 line of systemic therapy. Ibrutinib, a selective Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor; belumosudil, a selective Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2 inhibitor; and axatilimab, a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor–blocking antibody, are approved for treatment of cGVHD only. Ruxolitinib, a selective Janus kinase 1/2 (JAK1/JAK2) inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of both aGVHD and cGVHD in adult and pediatric patients aged ≥ 12 years, and is the only category 1 systemic option recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology.

### Prognostic value of blood biomarkers in steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent acute graft-versus-host disease: a REACH2 analysis [^733362dc]. Blood (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is used to treat a variety of hematologic conditions. Although allo-HSCT can be curative, patients are at an increased risk of developing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), whereby donor T cells initiate an immune response against host tissues. GVHD is a major cause of nonrelapse mortality among patients who have undergone allo-HSCTand can present as acute or chronic. Even with prophylactic treatment, ∼40% to 60% of allo-HSCT recipients develop acute GVHD (aGVHD), typically within 100 days of transplantation.

Systemic steroids are the recommended first-line treatment for aGVHD, but ∼50% of patients become steroid-refractory or dependent (SR/D). The overall survival is reduced in such patients, highlighting the need for effective second-line treatment. The Janus kinase inhibitor, ruxolitinib, is the only therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of SR-aGVHD in adults and pediatric patients aged ≥ 12 years. This approval was based on findings from the phase 2, single-arm REACH1 study, in which 54.9% of patients with grade II-IV SR/D aGVHD had a response on day 28.

In the phase 3 randomized REACH2 trial, ruxolitinib demonstrated superior efficacy to the best available therapy (BAT), leading to a significantly higher overall response rate (ORR; complete or partial response) on day 28 (62.3% vs 39.4%; odds ratio [OR], 2.64; P < .001) and durable ORR on day 56 (39.6% vs 21.9%; OR, 2.38; P < .001). Similarly, the rate of best overall response at any time up to day 56 was greater with ruxolitinib (81.8% vs 60.6%; OR, 3.07), and the median overall survival was prolonged compared with BATs (11.1 vs 6.5 months). Treatment with ruxolitinib did not result in any new safety signals from those previously observed, and the rates of adverse events were similar between the treatment arms, even with a longer follow-up.

### Durable discontinuation of systemic therapy in patients affected by chronic graft – host disease [^8add1a7a]. Haematologica (2023). Medium credibility.

The applicability of this study is limited by the population studied. A diagnosis of chronic GvHD was required for inclusion. Consequently, patients at low risk of developing chronic GvHD, such as young children or those who received post-transplant cyclophosphamide, antithymocyte globulin, or in vivo/ex vivo T-cell depletion as acute GvHD prophylaxis are not well represented. Our findings may not be applicable to these specific populations when they do not develop chronic GvHD. Finally, our findings are based on the clinical course of patients who agreed to participate in observational research. Despite these limitations, we believe our results are still valid and generalizable to patients under treatment with chronic GvHD.

Our findings suggest that for most patients, ST is likely to be a long-term proposition and that there is a much lower probability of being able to discontinue treatment than had been anticipated from earlier studies. Chronic GvHD may behave more like an ongoing autoimmune disease without resolution than a temporary state in which eventual tolerance is expected. Viewing chronic GvHD in this way has implications for management approaches and the development of therapeutic agents for chronic GvHD. The goal of defining a regimen that minimizes (rather than discontinues) ST or fosters operational immunological tolerance may need to be given higher priority to avoid the see-saw of stopping and restarting ST. Similarly, addressing the factors that contribute to persistent immune deficiency may improve outcomes by decreasing the risk of infections, a major cause of death.

Systemic therapies

Systemic corticosteroids are the first line of systemic therapy for newly diagnosed moderate to severe cGVHD. Systemic steroids are typically initiated at a dose of 0.5 to 1 mg/kg prednisone equivalent daily and gradually tapered if improvement is seen. However, if patients do not sufficiently improve with systemic steroids, an agent for steroid-refractory GVHD should be considered. Currently, ibrutinib, ruxolitinib, and belumosudil are Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in steroid-refractory cGVHD. The overall response rate (ORR) in cGVHD was 67% in the open-label phase II trial of ibrutinib, and cutaneous responses occurred in 88% of subjects, noting however that subjects were required to have erythematous-type skin disease at trial entry. In the randomized REACH3 trial of ruxolitinib, in which 70% of enrolled patients had cutaneous involvement, skin response in the ruxolitinib-treated group (41.2%) was higher compared to the control group (15.2%). A meta-analysis of the use of ruxolitinib in steroid-resistant cGVHD demonstrated best ORRs for oral disease, followed by skin and GI, suggesting it may be a preferred choice for patients with cutaneous involvement. Similarly, in the pivotal trial of belumosudil, 83% patients had cutaneous disease and the ORR in the skin was 37%. Out of 41 patients with a reported skin response, 15 had a decrease in BSA involvement, 11 had a decrease in fibrosis and 13 had both a decrease in fibrosis and involved BSA. If these options are ineffective, consideration can be given to additional agents such as calcineurin inhibitors, extracorporeal photopheresis, rituximab, or emerging candidate treatments and clinical trials.

### Ruxolitinib for the treatment of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in children: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^f6ec131c]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

In cGvHD setting low-dose MTX, imatinib and ECP were among the most commonly employed therapies in SR children before introduction of ruxolitinib. Overall responses spaced from 50 to 77% in the few pediatric studies, but, again, toxicities limited use of these strategies. The recently introduced ibrutinib may be considered the only actual competitor in cGvHD treatment, as the IMAGINE phase I-II trial revealed 73% ORR in patients aged 1–22 years, even if low CR rates were reported in steroid refractory group (4%).] Severe adverse events rates were low, and the drug was approved by FDA for pediatric patients. Nevertheless, ruxolitinib showed similar response rate in our review, with generally lower toxicity compared to aGvHD. It is important to note that pediatric cGvHD represents a multi-system disease with variable individual clinical course. In this view, a personalized approach needs to be adopted, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and treatment and taking into consideration the clinical status and individual needs of each patient when choosing the most appropriate treatment option.

Efficacy

Results of the primary and secondary endpoints are summarized in Table 2. The primary efficacy endpoint ORR was 73.3% (95% CI: 54.1–87.7%), and all responses were PRs (n = 22). High ORR was maintained in all subgroups (Fig. 2) regardless of cGVHD severity, number of organs involved, prior number of lines of therapy, or prior ibrutinib and ruxolitinib treatment. The best response to belumosodil in each organ is listed in Additional file 1: Table S3. Responses, including CRs, were observed in all affected organs (Additional file 1: Figure S1). A total of seven patients were treated with glucocorticoids alone without any other immunosuppressive therapy at screening and during the study period, and six achieved response, with an ORR of 85.7% in this subgroup of patients. In the mITT population, ORR was observed at 40.0% in the skin, 27.3% in the eyes, 54.5% in the mouth, 60.0% in the esophagus, 66.7% in the upper gastrointestinal tract and liver, 15.4% in the lungs, and 77.8% in the joints/fascia.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) of the skin is a serious cause of long-term morbidity and mortality among patients who receive hematopoietic stem cell transplants. Systemic corticosteroids remain first-line treatment for cutaneous cGVHD; however, there is currently no consensus on second-line therapy for steroid-refractory disease. We herein present a case of a pediatric patient with severe cGVHD of the skin, nonresponsive to corticosteroids, who was successfully treated with a prolonged course of ruxolitinib with minimal side effects.

Systemic treatment and lung transplantation

The most promising literature regarding BOS treatment comes from a phase 2 study reported by Williams et al.which evaluated the efficacy of a combination regimen consisting of FAM (Table 2) for newly diagnosed BOS within 6 months after allo‐HSCT. In this single‐arm, open‐label trial, all patients received the FAM regimen along with a short course of systemic corticosteroids at 1 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks. The biological rationale for this regimen is grounded in BOS pathophysiology: Inhaled corticosteroids reduce bronchiolar inflammation, azithromycin exerts immunomodulatory effects by reducing neutrophilia and interleukin‐8 levelsand montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, helps decrease airway inflammation. The regimen was well tolerated and yielded encouraging outcomes. Treatment failure, defined as a ≥ 10% decline in FEV1 at 3 months, occurred in only 6% of patients, which was significantly lower than the historical rate of 40%. Although the failure rate increased to 36% by 6 months, nearly half of the patients (48%) were able to reduce their systemic steroid dose by more than 50%. The 6‐month overall survival rate was 97%. Due to the encouraging data, this FAM regimen is the recommended treatment for BOS in the consensus recommendation of GVHD management from EBMT.

TABLE 2
Suggested dosage of fluticasone, azithromycin and montelukast.

In Taiwan, most of the available fluticasone products are combined with long‐acting beta‐agonists (LABAs), such as fluticasone/formoterol (Flutiform® MDI), fluticasone/vilanterol (Relvar® Ellipta) and fluticasone/salmeterol (Seretide® Accuhaler). Physicians may select their own preference provided the dose of fluticasone is appropriate.

Systemic corticosteroids remain the drug of choice when cGVHD develops. For BOS, systemic corticosteroids have been recommended as first‐line treatments in several guidelines, with a dosage of 1 mg/kg/day. In the FAM trial mentioned above, systemic corticosteroids (1 mg/kg/day) were administered concomitantly with the FAM regimen. Therefore, 1 mg/kg/day is the suggested systemic corticosteroid dose.

Methods

Patients

Adult and pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant recipients were eligible if they had classic chronic GvHD ± acute GvHD (overlap subtype) that met 2005 NIH diagnostic consensus criteria. Eligibility criteria were broad and allowed a period of steroid exposure prior to enrollment to ensure congruence with standard practice. Thus, eligible patients were either: newly diagnosed patients, defined as individuals who had received < 14 days of prednisone (or equivalent) before randomization to the study therapy, or previously treated, but responding inadequately after ≤ 16 weeks of initial therapy with prednisone and/or a CNI ± an additional non-sirolimus agent started at the time that the chronic GvHD was diagnosed. Major reasons for exclusion were patients with late persistent acute GvHD or recurrent acute GvHD only, patients unable to begin prednisone at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg day (or equivalent), patients already receiving sirolimus for treatment of chronic GvHD, and patients already receiving sirolimus (for prophylaxis or treatment of acute GvHD) along with prednisone at ≥ 0.25 mg/kg/day (or equivalent) ± additional agents. Patients were also ineligible if they had an invasive fungal or viral infection not responding to appropriate therapies, a creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min/1.73 m 2 based on the Cockcroft-Gault (adults) or Schwartz (age ≤ 12 years) formula, an absolute neutrophil count < 1.5×10 9 /L, a requirement for platelet transfusion, or a progressive or recurrent malignancy defined other than by quantitative molecular assays. Institutional review boards at all participating centers provided ethics approval. All patients or their parents signed informed consent to participation in the trial in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

### Ruxolitinib for the treatment of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease in children: a systematic review and individual patient data meta-analysis [^0b376be8]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2024). Medium credibility.

Regarding the time to achieve a response to therapy, this field was not completely clarified in pediatric patients and several studies do not report specific data. Moiseev et al reported a median time to PR in patients with aGvHD of 20 days to CR of 53 days, with a very wide range and a maximum time of 112 days for PR and 255 days for CR. As previously mentioned, the delay to reach the best response was not influenced by dosage in another study. Unfortunately, this information was available only for 33 patients < 12 years in our analysis. Even thought, results are very interesting, with a median time to response (including both CR and PR) of 11 days with a range of 5–101, possibly suggesting a faster response in younger patients.

Several studies investigated different response rates according to GvHD severity and organs involved with variable results. Regarding acute GvHD, in NCT02997280 prospective study by Moiseev et al, patients with grade III–IV GvHD had significantly reduced ORR. Furthermore, liver GvHD severity and grade IV GI GvHD were associated with worse response rate, and a trend with longer time to response in patients with GI involvement was reported. Reduced response in grade IV GI aGvHD was reported also in REACH2 trial, if compared to other organ involvement. Nevertheless, the highest odds ratio for response with ruxolitinib group compared to control was also reported in grade IV disease, suggesting a considerable efficacy even in this high-risk setting. Involved organs were not significantly associated with response in the study by Laisne et al. In the < 12 years cohort, patients with III-IV aGvHD (n = 29) presented a ORR of 72% while gut aGvHD (n = 39) reached a ORR of 69%, without a significant difference in response according to grading and gut involvement. As regards cGvHD, REACH3 founded higher ORR with ruxolitinib than with control therapy regardless of the organs involved, with odds ratios favoring ruxolitinib in all organ subgroups. Interestingly, a promising good ruxolitinib performance on lung GvHD/bronchiolitis obliterans (BOS) was reported in five pediatric studies (50–90%). These data were confirmed in our < 12 years analysis, with a ORR of 75% in 12 children with lung GvHD.

### High response rate and corticosteroid sparing with arsenic trioxide-based first-line therapy in chronic graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [^30913542]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2022). Medium credibility.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) occurs in 20% to 50% of recipients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Corticosteroids (CS) remain the first-line therapy but have suboptimal efficacy and carry a risk of long-term side effects. New agents with a better safety profile and higher efficacy are urgently needed. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a first-line combination of arsenic trioxide (ATO) and CS in adult patients with cGVHD requiring systemic therapy after first allo-HSCT for a hematologic disease. In this prospective national multicenter single-arm open-label Phase II study conducted in 5 university hospital centers in France, ATO was started within 10 days of CS at 1 mg/kg/day. Patients received 11 infusions per cycle of 28 days at a dose of .15 mg/kg per infusion. According to the clinical response and depending on the clinician's opinion, patients received 1 or 2 cycles of treatment. Cycles were separated by an 8- to 11-week interval from the first infusion of ATO. Patients were evaluated at 6 weeks, 14 weeks, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after the first ATO infusion, using the Chronic GVHD Activity Assessment Form A. The primary endpoint was preliminary efficacy based on the overall response rate (ORR; complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) at 6 months. Response rates were estimated with 2-sided 95% exact confidence intervals (CIs). Twenty-one patients entered the study and received at least 1 ATO infusion (1 incomplete cycle for 1 patient, 1 complete cycle for 11 patients, and 2 complete cycles for 9). Six patients continued ongoing cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment after inclusion, and 4 other patients resumed CsA treatment during the study. The ORR at 6 months was 75.0% (95% CI, 50.9% to 91.3%), with CR in 35% and PR in 40%. Failure-free survival was 90.0% (95% CI, 65.6% to 97.4%) at 6 months and 65.0% (95% CI, 40.3% to 81.5%) at 12 months. The progression-free survival rate was 95.0% (95% CI, 69.5% to 99.3%) at 6 months and 83.8% (95% CI, 57.7% to 94.5%) at 12 months. The mean CS dose was decreased by 74.6 ± 32.7% from baseline to the 6-month visit and by 91.0 ± 14.6% from baseline to the 12-month visit. CS was definitively stopped in 30.0% of patients at the 6-month visit and in 47.4% at the 12-month visit. Two patients died, at 7 months and 12 months after the first ATO infusion from causes unrelated to ATO. One patient withdrew because of transient hepatotoxicity. The first-line combination of ATO and CS was associated with a high clinical response rate and rapid CS sparing in cGVHD after previous allo-HSCT.

REACH3

Participants were enrolled onto this international trial at 49 centers across 28 countries in the US, Europe, Asia, Canada, and Australia. Eligible subjects were ≥ 12 years of age who had previously undergone allogenic HCT and subsequently developed moderate-to-severe SR or steroid-dependent chronic GVHD per NIH consensus criteria. Subjects were excluded if they received 2 or more systemic therapies for chronic GVHD in addition to steroids and they were eligible if they previously received a JAK inhibitor for acute GVHD if they met the following criteria: (1) had a PR or CR to prior JAK inhibitor treatments and (2) JAK inhibitor had been discontinued at least 8 weeks prior to enrollment onto the trial. The primary endpoint was objective response at 24 weeks, defined as a CR or PR per NIH criteria.

In total, 329 subjects were randomized. Most participants (61.1%) were male and the median age was 49 years. More than half (56.5%) had severe disease, while 42.9% had moderate disease. The most common investigator choice agents used as control therapy were ECP (34.8%), mycophenolate mofetil (22.2%), and ibrutinib (17.1%). The ORR at 24 weeks was significantly higher in the ruxolitinib group compared to best available therapy (49.7% vs. 25.6%, P < .001). More subjects in the ruxolitinib group had a CR compared to the control therapy group (6.7% vs. 3.0%). The best overall response was also significantly higher in the ruxolitinib group compared to the control group (76.4% vs. 60.4%, P = 0.001). Participants receiving ruxolitinib also had longer FFS (> 18.6 vs. 5.7 months, P < .001) and higher Modified LSS response rate (24.2% vs. 11.0%, P < .001) compared to the control group. The ruxolitinib group was more likely to discontinue treatment for toxicity (17.0% vs. 4.9%) and less likely to discontinue for lack of efficacy (14.5% vs. 42.7%).

### Weight loss and reduced body mass index: a critical issue in children with multiorgan chronic graft-versus-host disease [^2776ac38]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2006). Low credibility.

Weight loss and malnutrition are major problems in patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In adults, low body mass index (BMI) is a predictor for mortality; however, weight loss and BMI have not been studied in pediatric chronic GVHD. A retrospective study on 18 children with extensive chronic GVHD was completed. Median age at SCT was 12.3 (range 0.6–23) years; age at chronic GVHD diagnosis was 12.5 (1–23) years. Patients with multiorgan involvement had a mean maximal decrease in BMI of 20.9% and most dropped below 10th percentile in expected weight-for-age. This change in BMI not only indicates a significant decrease in weight but often a plateau in stature. In contrast, patients with one organ system involved had a mean maximal decrease in BMI of 5% and did not fall below 10th percentile. All patients with multiorgan involvement required salvage therapy beyond steroids and CSA. Three patients died due to complications of chronic GVHD. Weight loss and malnutrition (as reflected by a decrease in BMI) are clinically significant issues in children with multisystem chronic GVHD. Weight loss is likely another systemic manifestation of the disease and may contribute, along with other factors such as increased immunosuppression and infection, to increased mortality in this group.

### Sclerodermatous chronic graft-versus-host disease – a report of four pediatric cases [^5bd54727]. Pediatric Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

The sclerodermatous variant of chronic graft-versus-host disease postallogeneic bone marrow transplantation is rare. We present four pediatric cases of sclerodermatous variant of chronic graft-versus-host disease describing their clinical appearance, management, and outcomes. We compare the pharmacologic and supportive therapies administered to these patients with the management suggested in the current literature. Several key findings were noted. There was a significantly higher mortality rate observed in this series compared with previous reports, with three of the four patients dying ultimately as a result of sclerodermatous variant of chronic graft-versus-host disease. The development of widespread ulceration, in two of the four patients, appeared to be associated with an overall deterioration in the clinical condition. In two patients high-dose thalidomide at 12 mg/kg/day seemed to halt the progression of cutaneous disease. Optimal care of sclerodermatous variant of chronic graft-versus-host disease patients required a multidisciplinary team. A lack of community services observed in this case series led to the need for unnecessarily prolonged inpatient admissions.
