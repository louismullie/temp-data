## Question

Gadobutrol

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about gadobutrol's pharmacology, indications, dosing, safety, and comparative efficacy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacology and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the approved indications and standard dosing by regulatory labeling. Next, I will examine comparative efficacy data versus other GBCAs and the evidence for dose reduction. After that, I need to review safety, including NSF risk, renal considerations, pediatric use, and postmarketing signals. Finally, I will consider practical administration, special populations, and how emerging high-relaxivity agents like gadopiclenol and gadoquatrane fit into the landscape, making sure I double-check any claims against the cited sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic identity and mechanism. Gadobutrol is a nonionic, macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent with a 1.0 mol/L concentration, roughly twice that of most other extracellular GBCAs, which reduces injection volume and yields a more compact bolus profile. Its T1 relaxivity at 1.5 T is about 5.2 L/mmol/s, contributing to robust T1 shortening and signal enhancement on T1-weighted sequences, with pharmacodynamics driven by concentration and relaxivity rather than receptor-mediated effects [^111XEucT] [^112wBgp2] [^112h2kgo].

> Wait, let me verify the labeled indications and standard dose before moving further. The FDA label indicates gadobutrol for CNS MRI to detect areas of disrupted blood–brain barrier or abnormal vascularity, for breast MRI to assess malignant disease, for MRA of supra-aortic or renal arteries, and for cardiac MRI to assess myocardial perfusion and late gadolinium enhancement. The recommended dose for most indications is 0.1 mmol/kg (0.1 mL/kg), with cardiac perfusion protocols using two 0.05 mmol/kg boluses, and no dose adjustment by age in pediatrics, including term neonates, based on established PK and safety data [^112WBLmE] [^113agsxa] [^114NLmWQ].

> I will now examine comparative efficacy, but hold on, I should verify head-to-head data. In LEADER-75, a 25% reduced gadobutrol dose (0.075 mmol/kg) was noninferior to standard-dose gadoterate (0.1 mmol/kg) for CNS lesion enhancement, border delineation, and internal morphology, with a post hoc analysis suggesting near-equivalence, supporting dose-sparing strategies in brain MRI [^116vqiEm]. In REMIND, gadoterate was noninferior to gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg for overall lesion visualization and characterization despite higher quantitative enhancement with gadobutrol, reinforcing clinically comparable diagnostic performance at standard doses [^114mt3w6]. For brain metastases, gadobutrol 0.1 mmol/kg was noninferior to gadoteridol 0.2 mmol/kg, indicating single-dose gadobutrol can match double-dose gadoteridol for lesion detection and SRS planning utility [^114tGazr]. In breast MRI, gadobutrol produced higher relative enhancement and less washout than gadoterate, suggesting potential advantages for lesion conspicuity and specificity, though clinical impact varies by reader and protocol [^113VWYux]. In MS at 3 T, gadobutrol yielded higher lesion signal intensity than gadoterate without changing lesion counts over time, consistent with greater enhancement magnitude rather than more lesions detected [^112pcX1H].

> Let me consider dose reduction more broadly, and I should double-check emerging agents. The LEADER-75 data support 25% dose reduction for gadobutrol in CNS imaging, and next-generation high-relaxivity agents like gadopiclenol have demonstrated noninferiority to gadobutrol at half the dose (0.05 vs 0.1 mmol/kg) in phase III trials, with higher quantitative enhancement metrics and similar lesion counts, aligning with ESR recommendations that dose optimization can preserve diagnostic yield while reducing gadolinium exposure [^116vqiEm] [^112SdqFe] [^112fYq9b]. But wait, what if even lower doses suffice? Gadoquatrane, a tetrameric macrocyclic agent, achieved gadobutrol-equivalent signal at less than half the gadolinium dose in healthy-volunteer studies, though clinical confirmation is pending, so I should be cautious not to over-extrapolate to routine practice yet [^117WED2r].

> Next, I should review safety, starting with NSF, and I need to ensure I distinguish macrocyclic from linear risk. Macrocyclic GBCAs, including gadobutrol, have high kinetic inertness with dissociation half-lives exceeding 1,000 years at physiologic pH, placing them in the lowest NSF risk category; prospective data in renally impaired patients (GRIP) showed no NSF cases with gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg over 2-year follow-up, though the study was underpowered for incidence estimation and patients with severe renal impairment were included, so vigilance remains warranted [^112h2kgo] [^111D7DV7] [^111JvaUr]. Hold on, I should verify labeling language: the FDA carries a boxed warning for NSF for all GBCAs and advises screening for renal dysfunction, avoiding use when possible in severe impairment, and spacing repeat dosing to allow elimination; despite this, gadobutrol is not contraindicated in severe renal impairment, and case reports of NSF with gadobutrol are exceedingly rare and often confounded, reinforcing a favorable risk–benefit profile when imaging is essential [^117BKb38] [^116XfaYr] [^115LipX4].

> I should confirm acute safety signals and tolerability across large cohorts. In GARDIAN, encompassing over 23,000 patients, the overall adverse drug reaction rate was 0.7% with excellent image quality ratings, and serious adverse events were rare; pediatric subanalyses likewise showed low ADR rates and no SAEs, supporting broad tolerability across ages and comorbidities [^117YFUgv] [^111iQt7H]. Integrated safety across 42 studies and postmarketing surveillance totaling more than 29 million exposures reported drug-related AEs around 3.5% in trials and 0.05% in spontaneous reporting, with hypersensitivity reactions uncommon and no new safety signals identified, consistent with a class-typical safety profile for macrocyclic agents [^1143mcUC] [^112h2kgo].

> Let me verify pediatric pharmacokinetics and safety, especially in the youngest patients. PK studies demonstrate that clearance and volume scale with body weight, with no independent age effect, and approximately 99% of gadolinium is recovered in urine within 6 hours in children 2–17 years; in infants and term neonates, PK mirrors adults, supporting the same 0.1 mmol/kg dose without age adjustment, and safety data in over 1,000 children show very low ADR rates and no SAEs attributable to gadobutrol [^notfound] [^114uS9Uv] [^1177yHJA] [^111iQt7H]. Hold on, I should verify neonatal specifics: the FDA label supports use in term neonates for CNS and MRA indications, but effectiveness for breast and cardiac MRI in pediatrics is not established, so indications should be matched to labeling [^114NLmWQ].

> I need to check renal handling and dialysis considerations. Gadobutrol is eliminated unchanged via glomerular filtration, with more than 50% excreted within 2 hours and over 90% within 12 hours in healthy subjects. In severe renal impairment, elimination is prolonged, and for patients on hemodialysis, prompt post-injection dialysis can enhance elimination, though its role in preventing NSF is uncertain and should be individualized [^114uS9Uv] [^117BKb38]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought elimination could take weeks in severe CKD. I should correct that: while terminal half-life may extend to days in severe impairment, the clinical guidance emphasizes spacing injections and considering dialysis logistics rather than avoiding necessary imaging when benefits outweigh risks [^114uS9Uv] [^117BKb38].

> Next, I should review practical administration parameters and sequence timing. For CNS MRI, gadobutrol is administered intravenously at about 2 mL/s with a saline flush, and post-contrast imaging can begin immediately. For MRA, slower injection rates around 1.5 mL/s are typical to align with arterial peak. For cardiac perfusion, two 0.05 mmol/kg boluses at about 4 mL/s are used, timed with pharmacologic stress and rest phases, each followed by a flush, which I should confirm against the label table to avoid dosing errors [^113agsxa]. Let me reconsider sequence optimization: recent work suggests that adjusting flip angle and TR for T1-weighted spoiled gradient echo imaging can further leverage gadobutrol's relaxivity to maximize contrast, which may be particularly useful when pursuing dose-sparing strategies or enhancing subtle lesions [^111xD9BQ] [^112iCcYY].

> I should confirm special populations and cautions. Elderly patients have slightly higher exposure and lower clearance, but observed ADR rates are not higher than in younger adults, supporting routine dosing with attention to renal function screening. Pregnancy remains a setting where GBCAs should be avoided unless essential, and lactation data are limited, so shared decision-making is prudent. Patients with prior GBCA hypersensitivity warrant caution and premedication strategies per institutional policy [^114uS9Uv] [^115DSM5F] [^117BKb38]. Hold on, I should verify intrathecal issues: intrathecal use of gadobutrol is off-label and not approved; serious adverse reactions including neurotoxicity have been reported with GBCAs given intrathecally, so if used in research or exceptional clinical contexts, doses should be conservative and protocols carefully managed, recognizing that available series suggest feasibility at 0.25–0.5 mmol with predominantly nonspecific symptoms, but this remains investigational [^112a4c5M] [^113fpQEU] [^1161dzqf] [^115pRCRx].

> But wait, what about gadolinium deposition and long-term brain effects. Gadolinium, including from macrocyclics, can be detected in brain and other tissues months after exposure; however, no causal link to clinical neurologic sequelae has been established to date, and ongoing research seeks to clarify clinical significance, which supports a risk–benefit approach rather than avoidance of indicated contrast-enhanced MRI [^114uS9Uv] [^112X5Uk7]. I should double-check that macrocyclics show lower deposition propensity than linears in preclinical models, but deposition has been observed with gadobutrol in humans, reinforcing judicious use and documentation of cumulative exposure when feasible [^112X5Uk7].

> Finally, I will synthesize the clinical positioning. Gadobutrol is a high-concentration, high-relaxivity macrocyclic GBCA with broad regulatory approval, robust safety across ages and comorbidities, and strong comparative efficacy data. Dose-sparing to 0.075 mmol/kg is reasonable for brain MRI in select scenarios, and emerging high-relaxivity agents like gadopiclenol enable further dose reductions while maintaining diagnostic performance, which aligns with contemporary practice trends toward minimizing gadolinium exposure without sacrificing image quality [^112WBLmE] [^116vqiEm] [^112SdqFe] [^112fYq9b].

Gadobutrol is a **macrocyclic GBCA** with high relaxivity and a 1.0 M concentration that enables smaller injection volumes and a more compact bolus for high-quality vascular and perfusion imaging [^112h2kgo] [^114c6Ja9] [^114TJ74k]. It is indicated for CNS, breast, MRA, and cardiac MRI [^112WBLmE], with a **standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg** and no dose adjustment by age or renal function, though caution is advised in severe renal impairment due to NSF risk [^113agsxa] [^114NLmWQ] [^117BKb38]. Gadobutrol has a favorable safety profile with low adverse reaction rates and no NSF cases reported in prospective studies of renally impaired patients [^111D7DV7] [^1143mcUC]. It is superior to gadoteridol for brain tumor imaging and noninferior to gadoterate for CNS lesions, and reduced-dose regimens (0.075 mmol/kg) are noninferior to standard-dose gadoterate in brain MRI [^115ihLv1] [^114mt3w6] [^116vqiEm]. Gadobutrol is approved for pediatric use, including term neonates, and is widely used in clinical practice [^114NLmWQ].

### Safety of gadobutrol: results from 42 clinical phase II to IV studies and postmarketing surveillance after 29 million applications [^112h2kgo]. Investigative Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Gadobutrol (Gadovist, Gadavist; Bayer Pharma AG, Leverkusen, Germany) is a gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), approved for a broad range of indications in all age groups. In Europe and a number of other countries, gadobutrol is indicated for all body regions in adults and children including term newborns. However, the range of approved indications and the age range depend on the country-specific label.

Gadobutrol is a second-generation extracellular, macrocyclic, nonionic GBCA, with particular physicochemical properties that enable the unique formulation of a 1 mol/L solution, twice the gadolinium concentration of other currently licensed extracellular GBCAs. Thus, gadobutrol's 1 mol/L concentration halves the injection volume compared with 0.5 mol/L agents. In addition, Gadobutrol features a 20% to 30% higher relaxivity at 1.5 T compared with other macrocyclic agents. The macrocyclic structure of gadobutrol provides greater chelate stability and therefore a lower propensity of gadolinium release compared with linear GBCAs. In this context, it is important to understand that for macrocyclic GBCAs, thermodynamic stability (ie, equilibrium between chelate and ligand + free gadolinium) is an inadequate and irrelevant parameter to assess the stability. The only relevant parameter is kinetic inertness (ie, the dissociation half-life to reach the equilibrium). It can only be measured under extreme conditions such as pH 1, and the dissociation half-lives have been extrapolated from these measurements to pH 7.4. As a result, at physiological pH, all macrocyclic GBCAs — also irrespective of their ionicity — show half-lives exceeding 1000 years, which by far exceeds the elimination time even in patients with severe renal impairment of approximately 15 days. The stability of GBCAs is clinically important because the release of gadolinium ions has been associated with the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with severe renal impairment. In view of these characteristics, gadobutrol has been placed in the lowest risk category for development of NSF. –

### Toxicological safety evaluation of gadobutrol [^116S6pv5]. Investigative Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Gadobutrol (Gadovist/Gadavist, Bayer Pharma AG, Berlin, Germany) is a nonionic, macrocyclic, gadolinium-based contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging of the central nervous system as well as liver and kidneys and for contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance angiography. For risk assessment of the single diagnostic use in humans, the toxicity of this compound was evaluated with a series of preclinical studies.

Materials and Methods

Preclinical studies into acute, repeated-dose, reproductive, and developmental toxicity as well as genotoxicity, local tolerance, contact-sensitizing potential, and antigenicity were performed.

Results

In rodents, lethality was observed after a single intravenous administration of 20 mmol/kg, representing doses at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than the standard single diagnostic dose in humans (0.1 mmol/kg). The no observed adverse effect levels after repeated (daily) administrations over the course of 4 weeks exceeded the single diagnostic dose in humans by a factor of 12 in rats and 10 in dogs (calculated on the basis of body weight), and no unexpected organ toxicity was observed. The most salient finding of repeated dosing in both rats and dogs was vacuolization of renal tubular epithelium without concomitant effect on kidney function, which represents a well-known finding for this class of compounds. Gadobutrol was not teratogenic in rats, rabbits, and monkeys even when given repeatedly during organogenesis at maximum dose levels tested, being 25 to 100 times (based on body weight) above the diagnostic dose in humans. No indications of potential genotoxic, contact allergenic, or immunotoxic effects were observed. In local tolerance testing, gadobutrol was well tolerated after intravenous administration.

Conclusions

Gadobutrol was well tolerated with high safety margins between the single diagnostic dose of 0.1 mmol/kg in humans and the doses showing effects in animal studies.

### Safety of gadobutrol in over 23, 000 patients: the GARDIAN study, a global multicentre, prospective, non-interventional study [^116vzYUg]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) enhance tissue contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and are an essential tool for diagnosis in a range of indications. Gadobutrol (Gd-DO3A-butrol, Gadovist®, Gadavist®) is a non-ionic, macrocyclic GBCA with high T1-relaxivity and is marketed as a 1 mmol/mL gadolinium concentration. The higher-concentration formulation of gadobutrol compared to almost all other marketed GBCAs (typically 0.5 mmol/mL) may theoretically influence the diagnostic efficacy of the compound in first-pass dynamic techniques, since the higher concentration alters delivery of gadolinium. Doses of gadobutrol up to 0.3 mmol/kg BW are approved in some regions for specific indications in adults. Gadobutrol rapidly distributes into the extracellular space following infusion and is eliminated intact by glomerular filtration.

The macrocyclic chemical structure contributes to the high kinetic stability of gadobutrol compared with linear contrast agents, and is associated with a lower propensity to release gadolinium ions (Gd 3+). European, US, and other guidelines categorize gadobutrol within the lowest risk category for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).

Clinical and observational studies on a range of indications in adults and children have demonstrated gadobutrol to be efficacious with a favourable safety and tolerability profile. At the request of the European Medicines Agency (EMA), a prospective, multicentre, non-interventional study, GARDIAN (Gadovist® in Routine Diagnostic MRI – Administration in Non-selected Patients), was initiated to evaluate the acute safety and tolerability of gadobutrol use in approved indications in a large patient population in routine practice, including the age group 2 to 7 years as well as patients with renal impairment or cardiac disease and patients considered at risk for contrast media (CM) reactions.

### Intraindividual, randomized comparison of the macrocyclic contrast agents gadobutrol and gadoterate meglumine in breast magnetic resonance imaging [^113VWYux]. European Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare intraindividually two macrocyclic contrast agents - gadobutrol and gadoterate meglumine (Gd-DOTA) - for dynamic and quantitative assessment of relative enhancement (RE) in benign and malignant breast lesions.

Methods

This was an ethically approved, prospective, single-centre, randomized, crossover study in 52 women with suspected breast lesions referred for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Each patient underwent one examination with gadobutrol and one with Gd-DOTA (0.1 mmol/kg BW) on a 1.5 T system 1–7 days apart. Dynamic, T1-weighted, 3D gradient echo sequences were acquired under identical conditions. Quantitative evaluation with at least three regions of interest (ROI) per lesion was performed. Primary endpoint was RE during the initial postcontrast phase after the first and second dynamic acquisition, and peak RE. All lesions were histologically proven; differences between the examinations were evaluated.

Results

Forty-five patients with a total of 11 benign and 34 malignant lesions were assessed. Mean RE was significantly higher for gadobutrol than Gd-DOTA (p < 0.0001). Gadobutrol showed significantly less washout (64.4%) than Gd-DOTA (75.4%) in malignant lesions (p = 0.048) CONCLUSIONS: Gadobutrol has higher RE values compared with Gd-DOTA, whereas Gd-DOTA shows more marked washout in malignant lesions. This might improve the detection of breast lesions and influence the specificity of breast MRI-imaging.

### Gadolinium concentration dependent signal enhancement profiles using routine clinical sequences with gadopiclenol, gadoterate, gadobutrol, and gadoxetate at 1.5, 3 and 7 tesla [^1114x8Qp]. European Journal of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Gadopiclenol, a new gadolinium-(Gd) based contrast agent (GBCA), exhibits a higher longitudinal relaxivity (r 1) than current standard GBCAs, and, thus, has the potential to be used at lower dose or to generate a brighter T1-weighted (T1w) signal at equivalent dose. As the relationship between enhancement and contrast agent concentration is non-linear, the signal profiles should be experimentally explored and compared to those of current GBCAs.

Materials and Methods

Standardized aqueous dilution series (0.0 to 25 mmol/L) of gadopiclenol, and current standard GBCAs gadoterate, gadobutrol, and gadoxetate were imaged with nine clinical sequences at 1.5, 3, and 7 Tesla(T). Signal intensities(SIs) were measured for each concentration and set in relation to the SI of water(rSI). Additionally, T1 relaxation times were measured at 3 T and r 1 was calculated.

Results

The maximum rSI in T1w fast-spin-echo images was observed at a lower Gd concentration (1.0 mmol/L) at all three field strengths in the gadopiclenol series than in the current standard GBCAs series (gadoterate and gadobutrol, 2.5 mmol/L, all field strengths, gadoxetate, 2.5 mmol/L at 1.5 and 3 T, 1.0 and 2.5 mmol/L at 7 T). The maximum rSI measured at 1.0 mmol/l gadopiclenol was comparable (± 12%rSI) to the rSI at 2.5 mmol/l of standard GBCAs. Molar gadopiclenol relaxivity, r 1, (13.5 ± 1.5 s -1 ∙mM -1) was three to four times higher than r 1 of gadoterate and gadobutrol (3.4 ± 0.4 and 4.1 ± 0.5 s -1 ∙mM -1, respectively), and 2.2 times higher than of that of gadoxetate (6.0 ± 0.7 s -1 ∙mM -1).

Conclusion

Our results confirm the maximum signal intensity in clinical T1w images to be shifted to lower gadolinium concentrations of gadopiclenol compared to standard GBCAs at all field strengths.

### Small bowel adenocarcinoma, version 1.2020, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^111uguKx]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

NCCN Small bowel adenocarcinoma — principles of imaging and endoscopy for initial workup/staging include chest, abdomen, pelvis computed tomography (CT) to evaluate local extent of tumor infiltration into surrounding structures and assess for distant metastatic disease to lungs, lymph node, liver, peritoneal cavity, and other organs. Abdomen/pelvis CT should be performed with intravenous (IV) iodinated contrast and oral contrast agents unless contraindicated, and chest CT does not require contrast (although it may be given if performed with abdominal CT). Consider CT enterography for specific cases where the primary tumor is poorly visualized by standard methods. If IV iodinated contrast is contraindicated, magnetic resonance (MR) examination of the abdomen/pelvis with IV gadolinium-based contrast may be obtained instead, and in patients with chronic kidney failure, including patients on dialysis, IV gadolinium-based contrast may be administered in select cases using gadobutrol, gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadobenate dimeglumine, or gadoteridol. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) options state that MR of the abdomen/pelvis or MR enterography may be considered where there is contraindication to CT; consider MR of the abdomen with and without contrast for further evaluation of indeterminate liver lesions on CT; and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may need to be obtained in the initial workup of suspected duodenal malignancies to further ascertain tumor site of origin, particularly in cases of biliary obstruction. Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) is not indicated as efficacy and clinical benefit have not been examined compared to CT or MR; consider obtaining FDG-PET/CT in instances of equivocal CT or MR results, including evaluation of potential peritoneal disease, particularly where potential lesions are sized greater than the lower limits of FDG-PET detection. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Safety of gadobutrol in more than 1, 000 pediatric patients: subanalysis of the GARDIAN study, a global multicenter prospective non-interventional study [^111iQt7H]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Gadobutrol is a gadolinium-based contrast agent, uniquely formulated at 1.0 mmol/ml. Although there is extensive safety evidence on the use of gadobutrol in adults, few studies have addressed the safety and tolerability of gadobutrol in pediatric patients.

Objective

This subanalysis of data from the GARDIAN study evaluated the safety and use of gadobutrol in pediatric patients (age < 18 years).

Materials and methods

The GARDIAN study was a large phase IV non-interventional prospective multicenter post-authorization safety study performed in Europe, Asia, North America and Africa. A total of 23,708 patients were included who were scheduled to undergo cranial or spinal MRI, liver or kidney MRI, or MR angiography with gadobutrol enhancement. The primary study endpoint was the overall incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) following gadobutrol administration.

Results

The GARDIAN study included 1,142 children (age < 18 years) who received gadobutrol at a mean dose of 0.13 (range 0.04–0.50) mmol/kg body weight. Gadobutrol was well tolerated in these children, with low rates of ADRs (0.5%) and no SAEs, consistent with results in adults enrolled in the GARDIAN study. Rates of adverse events and ADRs were unrelated to pediatric age or gadobutrol weight-adjusted dose. There were no symptoms suggestive of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Investigators rated the contrast quality of gadobutrol-enhanced images as good or excellent in 97.8% of pediatric patients, similar to the main study population.

Conclusion

Gadobutrol is very well tolerated and provides excellent contrast quality at the recommended weight-adjusted dose in children (age < 18 years), similar to the profile in adults.

### Intraindividual comparison of gadobutrol and gadopentetate dimeglumine for detection of myocardial late enhancement in cardiac MRI [^113fAhSv]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Gadobutrol is an extracellular macrocyclic gadolinium chelate recently introduced in MRI, and it has already been used for cardiac late enhancement imaging; however, until now it has never been compared with gadopentetate dimeglumine. The purpose of our study was to compare 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol to 0.2 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine for the detection of myocardial late enhancement in the same group of patients.

Subjects and Methods

This was an exploratory single-blind parallel group study comparing gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg) to gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.2 mmol/kg) in 20 adult patients scheduled for cardiac late enhancement MRI with gadopentetate dimeglumine and whose MR images showed late enhancement. MR images were acquired at 10, 15, and 20 minutes after peripheral injection of gadobutrol by using a 3D turbo field echo inversion recovery T1-weighted sequence. Volume and percentage of late enhancement, number of involved segments, late enhancement localization and pattern, and late enhancement signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared between contrast agents.

Results

Late enhancement was not significantly different with gadobutrol and gadopentetate dimeglumine both in terms of total volume of myocardium (mean ± SD, 37.8 ± 56.1 and 35.1 ± 46.7 cm(3), respectively; p = 0.33) and percentage of myocardial wall involvement (22.5% ± 19.1% and 22.0% ± 17.2%, respectively; p = 0.67). The number of segments involved was not different (138 with gadobutrol vs 134 with gadopentetate dimeglumine). Furthermore, SNR and CNR were not different (gadopentetate dimeglumine, 123.8 ± 82.9 and gadobutrol, 117.2 ± 88.6, p = 0.58 and gadopentetate dimeglumine, 96.2 ± 68.9 and gadobutrol, 88.4 ± 72.9, p = 0.53, respectively).

Conclusion

A single dose of gadobutrol seems to be as effective as a double dose of gadopentetate dimeglumine for the detection of late enhancement.

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

The safety and effectiveness of ELUCIREM for lesion visualization were evaluated in two prospective, double blind, randomized, crossover clinical studies. Study 1 (NCT03996447) was performed in adults with known or highly suspected CNS lesions with focal areas of disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Study 2 (NCT03986138) was performed in adults with suspected enhancing abnormalities in at least one body region among the head and neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and musculoskeletal system.

In each study, patients received both ELUCIREM 0.05 mmol/kg and gadobutrol 0.1 mmol/kg (as an active comparator) in random order separated by 2 days to 14 days. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after administration of each contrast agent.

Pre-contrast and paired (consisting of both pre-contrast and post-contrast images for the same drug) image sets were independently evaluated by three central readers who were blinded to identity of the contrast agent. Readers scored up to three lesions per patient for border delineation, internal morphology, and contrast enhancement, each on a scale from 1 to 4. The total number of lesions was also reported. An additional independent central reader performed lesion tracking to allow matching of lesions between pre-contrast and paired images.

The analysis compared the patient-level average score for matching lesions for each visualization parameter between pre-contrast and paired image sets.

14.2 Visualization of CNS Lesions

Study 1 included 256 patients with known or highly suspected CNS lesion(s). Among the enrolled patients, 239 had assessable pre-contrast and paired images with at least one matching lesion for at least one reader. These patients had a mean age of 57 years (range: 18 years to 84 years), 52% were female, and 83% were White.

All three blinded readers' evaluations of paired pre-contrast plus post-contrast images and pre-contrast images alone for all lesion visualization criteria, the pre-specified co-primary efficacy endpoints, are presented in Table 6.

LS: Least Squares; SE: Standard Error; CI: Confidence Interval.

Only matching lesions are considered. The mixed models based on the full analysis set (N = 239) include lesion visualization factor as dependent variable, MRI modality (Precontrast and Paired MRI) as fixed factors, and patient as a random factor.

### Gadobutrol in renally impaired patients: results of the GRIP study [^111r9k7r]. Investigative Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Target Variables

The primary target variable was defined as the number of patients with moderate to severe renal impairment who developed NSF during the 2-year follow-up period. Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis was defined as described by Girardi et al. Secondary target variables included (1) number of patients without biopsy but who later developed NSF-like symptoms based solely on the clinical score by Girardi et al; and (2) number and characteristics of adverse events reported in association with the administration of gadobutrol.

Study Procedures

The study procedures were identical to those described by Lauenstein et al. Our focus was to establish a standardized diagnostic workup and data collection for potential NSF cases in the daily clinical routine.

Blood sampling to assess eGFR was performed twice — first during screening within 6 weeks before the MRI examination at the local laboratory and second at baseline (ie, 48 hours before gadobutrol administration) at a central laboratory.

After gadobutrol administration, patients were followed for clinical examination and review of source documents after 12 and 24 months. In addition, telephone interviews were performed 1, 3, 6, and 18 months after gadobutrol administration by health care professionals who were trained on the study protocol and specifically for identification of clinical signs of NSF.

Any skin finding with the faintest suspicion of NSF was clinically assessed. In cases where a biopsy was taken, a histopathological assessment had to be performed. Here, the Girardi criteria had to be applied. This strategy ensured that the risk to miss a potential case of NSF was minimized.

### Gadobutrol in renally impaired patients: results of the GRIP study [^113KQSNj]. Investigative Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The risk of a GBCA to trigger NSF seems to be related to the stability of the agent. Thus, nonionic linear GBCAs are more likely to trigger NSF than ionic linear agents both of which are distinctly more likely to trigger the disease than the macrocyclic agents in patients with reduced renal function.

Gadobutrol is a gadolinium (Gd)-based contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is approved for a wide range of clinical indications covering the age range from full-term newborns to adults. However, approved indications and age ranges are country-specific. In Europe, gadobutrol is approved for the entire spectrum of indications in all age groups.

Gadobutrol (Gadovist, Gadavist; Bayer Pharma AG, D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany) is a second-generation nonionic, multipurpose, extracellular, macrocyclic GBCA, provided in a 1 molar concentration. In addition to its unique double concentration, gadobutrol features the highest relaxivity of all macrocyclic GBCAs. As a macrocyclic contrast agent, gadobutrol provides high chelate stability with substantially less — if any — in vivo release of Gd ions as opposed to linear GBCAs. The release of Gd ions has been linked to an increased risk of NSF in patients with impaired renal function. Because of these characteristics, gadobutrol was categorized as a low-risk GBCA for development of NSF by several medical organisations, and authorities.

### Efficacy and safety of gadopiclenol for contrast-enhanced MRI of the central nervous system: the PICTURE randomized clinical trial [^112SdqFe]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Developing new high relaxivity gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allowing dose reduction while maintaining similar diagnostic efficacy is needed, especially in the context of gadolinium retention in tissues. This study aimed to demonstrate that contrast-enhanced MRI of the central nervous system (CNS) with gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg is not inferior to gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg, and superior to unenhanced MRI.

Materials and Methods

PICTURE is an international, randomized, double-blinded, controlled, cross-over, phase III study, conducted between June 2019 and September 2020. Adult patients with CNS lesions were randomized to undergo 2 MRIs (interval, 2–14 days) with gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) then gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg) or vice versa. The primary criterion was lesion visualization based on 3 parameters (border delineation, internal morphology, and contrast enhancement), assessed by 3 off-site blinded readers. Key secondary outcomes included lesion-to-background ratio, enhancement percentage, contrast-to-noise ratio, overall diagnostic preference, and adverse events.

Results

Of the 256 randomized patients, 250 received at least 1 GBCA administration (mean [SD] age, 57.2 [13.8] years; 53.6% women). The statistical noninferiority of gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) to gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg) was achieved for all parameters and all readers (n = 236, lower limit 95% confidence interval of the difference ≥ -0.06, above the noninferiority margin [-0.35], P < 0.0001), as well as its statistical superiority over unenhanced images (n = 239, lower limit 95% confidence interval of the difference ≥ 1.29, P < 0.0001). Enhancement percentage and lesion-to-background ratio were higher with gadopiclenol for all readers (P < 0.0001), and contrast-to-noise ratio was higher for 2 readers (P = 0.02 and P < 0.0001). Three blinded readers preferred images with gadopiclenol for 44.8%, 54.4%, and 57.3% of evaluations, reported no preference for 40.7%, 21.6%, and 23.2%, and preferred images with gadobutrol for 14.5%, 24.1%, and 19.5% (P < 0.001). Adverse events reported after MRI were similar for gadopiclenol (14.6% of patients) and gadobutrol (17.6%). Adverse events considered related to gadopiclenol (4.9%) and gadobutrol (6.9%) were mainly injection site reactions, and none was serious.

Conclusions

Gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg is not inferior to gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg for MRI of the CNS, confirming that gadopiclenol can be used at half the gadolinium dose used for other GBCAs to achieve similar clinical efficacy.

### Intra-individual randomised comparison of gadobutrol 1.0 M versus gadobenate dimeglumine 0.5 M in patients scheduled for preoperative breast MRI [^114cE9Xu]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To demonstrate non-inferiority of gadobutrol versus gadobenate dimeglumine by intra-individually comparing 0.1 mmol/kg body weight doses for contrast-enhanced breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and prospectively evaluating lesion detection and characterisation in a multicentre trial.

Methods

Two identical breast MRI examinations were performed in 72 patients with biopsy-proven breast cancer, separated by 1–7 days. Gadobutrol 1.0 M or gadobenate 0.5 M were administered in a randomised order. Lesion detection and characterisation were performed by two independent blinded readers. Lesion tracking, which compared on-site readings and histology from surgery or biopsy, was performed by a third reader. Differences in lesion detection and characterisation were compared between the two contrast agents.

Results

Among 103 lesions, 96 were malignant and 7 were benign. No difference in lesion detection was identified between the contrast agents (82.33% for gadobutrol, 81.60% for gadobenate). Assessment of sensitivity in lesion characterisation and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems showed no difference between gadobutrol (92.63%) and gadobenate (90.53%). Regarding morphology, there was more non-focal enhancement for gadobutrol than for gadobenate (P = 0.0057).

Conclusion

Non-inferiority of gadobutrol compared with gadobenate was demonstrated for breast lesion detection and sensitivity in lesion characterisation in breast MRI.

Study 2 (NCT03986138) was performed in adults with suspected enhancing abnormalities in at least one body region among the head and neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and musculoskeletal system.

In each study, patients received both Vueway 0.05 mmol/kg and gadobutrol 0.1 mmol/kg (as an active comparator) in random order separated by 2 days to 14 days. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after administration of each contrast agent.

Pre-contrast and paired (consisting of both pre-contrast and post-contrast images for the same drug) image sets were independently evaluated by three central readers who were blinded to identity of the contrast agent. Readers scored up to three lesions per patient for border delineation, internal morphology, and contrast enhancement, each on a scale from 1 to 4. The total number of lesions was also reported.

TABLE 5
ADRs From Postmarketing Surveillance (Exposure n = > 29.6 million); Cutoff at 25 Events (≥ 0.0001%)

As of December 2015, a total of 12 reports of NSF or NSF-like symptoms in patients who reportedly were administered gadobutrol have been received. Four of these are "single-agent reports"; that is, in which patients reportedly received only gadobutrol, 3 of the 4 single-agent reports were derived from literature. The other 8 reports are confounded by the administration of other GBCAs ("multiple-agent reports"). In assessing these reports, Bayer utilizes the criteria developed by Girardi et aland applies the criteria very conservatively. Not having direct access to the patient, the patient's past contrast use, or even to the biopsy report in most cases, thus often having to rely on minimal information, Bayer gives the report the highest possible score based on the information available. Using this conservative "worst-case scenario" approach, 3 of the 4 single-agent reports meet the criteria for being diagnostic of or consistent with NSF, and a possible association with gadobutrol cannot be excluded. The fourth single-agent report contained information that was insufficient for evaluation. All 3 patients were multimorbid. The largest single dose administered to any patient with reported NSF was 0.49 mmol/kg bw. Onset of NSF-like symptoms in these 3 reports occurred in 2006, 2008, and 2009. Onset latency ranged from 14 days to 18 months.

### Safety of gadobutrol: results from 42 clinical phase II to IV studies and postmarketing surveillance after 29 million applications [^117PaWZd]. Investigative Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

The recommended standard dose of gadobutrol for intravenous injection is 0.1 mmol/kg body weight (bw), with doses up to 0.3 mmol/kg bw approved in Europe and some other countries for specific indications in adults. At these doses, the efficacy and safety of gadobutrol have been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies in adults and children, including term newborns.–

Gadobutrol was first introduced in Switzerland in February 1998. Through December 31, 2015, more than 29.6 million patients worldwide are estimated to have received gadobutrol. While monitoring safety continuously, passing the 29 million landmark was the trigger for this comprehensive summary of gadobutrol's safety data.

Verified intracranial distribution of gadobutrol

Entry of gadobutrol to cranial CSF spaces was verified in all individuals at MRI (Fig. 1). The time from intrathecal gadobutrol administration until first visual detection of the contrast agent in subarachnoid space at the level of foramen magnum was 22 ± 34 min (spinal transit time; Fig. 2), with no significant differences across the patient groups (Fig. 3).

Fig. 1
Intrathecal injection of gadobutrol in a dose of (a) 0.25 mmol (0.25 mL of 1.0 mmol/ml) or (b) 0.5 mmol (0.50 mL of 1.0 mmol/ml) at the lower lumbar level. Entry of gadobutrol in CSF within the intracranial compartment was preceded by unenhanced T1-weighted MRI (time point "Pre"), and acquisition of identical consecutive T1 scans was initiated immediately and repeated at different time points. Image window/level is adjusted to optimize qualitative illustration of CSF contrast enhancement

Fig. 2
There was no significant difference between patient groups regarding time from intrathecal administration of gadobutrol until first enhancement of the contrast agent within the subarachnoid space of the foramen magnum (spinal transit time). For the entire group of 149 individuals, the mean ± stdev spinal transit time was 22 ± 34 min. The tentative diagnoses were as follows: iNPH, idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus; SIH, spontaneous intracranial hypotension; AC, arachnoid cyst; PC, pineal cyst; IIH, idiopathic intracranial hypertension; cHC, communicating hydrocephalus; and ncHC, non-communicating hydrocephalus

Fig. 3
CSF tracer enrichment in cisterna magna depending on dose of CSF tracer (gadobutrol), measured as percentage change in normalized T1 signals after intrathecal injection of gadobutrol in doses of 0.5 mmol (protocols #1–2; blue line) or 0.25 mmol (protocol #3; red line). The first time point is after 10 min. The CSF tracer level was significantly different after 3 h (P < 0.001), 6 h (P = 0.001), and 48 h (P = 0.047; independent samples t test).

The CSF enrichment within cisterna magna was dose-dependent with larger T1 intensity increase in CSF after 3, 6, and 48 h in individuals receiving intrathecal gadobutrol in a dose of 0.5 mmol as compared with 0.25 mmol (Fig. 3).

FIGURE 8
In vivo contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted 3D FSPGR image from a subject at 3.0T using gadoterate meglumine with (top left image) default acquisition parameters TR/TE = 8.6/3.2 ms and flip angle = 12 o, and (bottom left image) proposed acquisition parameters TR/TE = 13.6/3.2 ms and flip angle = 14 o. On the right side of the figure, we see bar charts corresponding to the ROI signal intensities and contrast estimations. F1/F2 correspond to the lesion ROIs, and B1/B2 correspond to the background ROIs.

To quantify the image contrast for extended areas of enhancement, we defined 2 ROIs in foreground (enhancing) tissue and 2 ROIs in background tissue (nonenhancing white matter) on each slice in Figure 5. The ROIs were delineated on the default parameter image and then propagated onto corresponding locations on the co-registered image of the optimized protocol. The image contrast between enhancing and nonenhancing tissue was increased 25%–44% for the 4 combinations of foreground and background ROI in the first slice (Fig. 5, images on the left sides of the figure, where the foreground ROIs were symbolized with F1 and F2), and 19%–36% for the second slice (Fig. 5, images on the right sides of the figure, where the foreground ROIs were symbolized with F3 and F4). The image contrast gain for a focal, more weakly enhancing lesion was quantified for the small lesion indicated in Figure 6 as 91% (i.e. the lesion corresponding to the F1 foreground ROI) compared to the default acquisition.

### Gadobutrol [^111XEucT]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occurs with:

Differences in proton density
Differences of the spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T1)
Differences in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation time (T2)

When placed in a magnetic field, gadobutrol shortens the T1and T2relaxation times. The extent of decrease of T1and T2relaxation times, and therefore the amount of signal enhancement obtained from gadobutrol, is based upon several factors including the concentration of gadobutrol in the tissue, the field strength of the MRI system, and the relative ratio of the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times. At the recommended dose, the T1shortening effect is observed with greatest sensitivity in T1-weighted magnetic resonance sequences. In T2✱-weighted sequences the induction of local magnetic field inhomogeneities by the large magnetic moment of gadolinium and at high concentrations (during bolus injection) leads to a signal decrease.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Gadobutrol leads to distinct shortening of the relaxation times even in low concentrations. At pH 7, 37°C and 1.5 T, the relaxivity (r1) - determined from the influence on the relaxation times (T1) of protons in plasma - is 5.2 L/(mmol·sec) and the relaxivity (r2) - determined from the influence on the relaxation times (T2) - is 6.1 L/(mmol·sec). These relaxivities display only slight dependence on the strength of the magnetic field. The T1shortening effect of paramagnetic contrast agents is dependent on concentration and r1relaxivity (see Table 3). This may improve tissue visualization.

Compared to 0.5 molar gadolinium-based contrast agents, the higher concentration of gadobutrol injection results in half the volume of administration and a more compact contrast bolus injection. At the site of imaging, the relative height and width of the time intensity curve for gadobutrol injection varies as a function of imaging location and multiple patient, injection, and device-specific factors.

Gadobutrol is a water-soluble, hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient between n-butanol and buffer at pH 7.6 of about 0.006.

### Off-label intrathecal use of gadobutrol: safety study and comparison of administration protocols [^113T9eaK]. Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

It should be noted that the present comparison of different administration protocols was hampered by the diagnostic categories allocated to the respective administration protocols. The frequency of non-serious adverse events heavily depended on the clinical indication for intrathecal gadobutrol. It is well recognized that IIH and symptomatic pineal gland cysts may sometimes be accompanied with severe symptoms such as headache, nausea, and dizziness, which overlap with symptoms typically seen after intrathecal contrast agent injections. Furthermore, headache is a predominant symptom in individuals with symptomatic arachnoid cysts. Adding iohexanol as in protocol #1 would be expected to increase occurrence of adverse events. This effect was, however, not seen here, probably related to the substantial contribution of symptoms from the diagnoses pineal gland cyst, IIH, and arachnoid cyst to the adverse event profile. Taken together, given the high proportion of individuals with a pineal cyst or IIH in protocol #2 (42%) than in protocol #1 (30%; Table 1), this probably explains the higher frequency of the non-serious adverse events headache, nausea, and dizziness in days 1–3 with protocol #2.

One concern regarding intrathecal use of MRI contrast agents is the potential for deposition within brain parenchyma. In a previous study, 4 week after one single intrathecal administration of 0.5 mmol gadobutrol, we found no detectable change in normalized T1 signal in any brain region, including basal ganglia indicative of no retention. Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that it is now established that after an ordinary clinical intravenous dose of gadolinium, the contrast agent is present in CSF samples for days and weeks, even despite normal renal function and intact blood-brain barrier. One study of rodents reported that the concentration of MRI contrast agent in CSF exceeded that of blood 4.5 h after intravenous administration. A typical intravenous dose (0.1 mmol/kg in an 80-kg patient = 8 mmol and with half-time in blood being approximately 2 h) may therefore, theoretically, render for a notable passage of contrast agent to CSF, as recently shown in an MRI study. The difference in peak CSF concentration of gadobutrol after conventional intravenous dose compared with intrathecal doses of 0.5 or 0.25 mmol remains to be determined. This may potentially be quantified with MRI using T1-maps, allowing for quantification of gadobutrol concentration in different locations intracranially.

Next-gen MRI contrast agents: something's brewing

The European Medicines Agency recently released authorization for gadopiclenol to improve the quality of the resulting MRI scan compared to an unenhanced scan. Gadopiclenol is a new extracellular GBCA with a comparable safety profile and stability but higher relaxivity than other approved macrocyclic GBCA. Based on its hydration number of 2, two water nuclei interact with the gadopiclenol-caged gadolinium ion, thus reaching a 2–3-fold increase of relaxivity and similar contrast enhancement at a 50% lower dose than that approved for standard GBCA. The PICTURE and PROMISE randomized clinical trials have indeed shown that 0.05 mmol/kg gadopiclenol is not inferior to 0.1 mmol/kg gadobutrol for MRI of the CNS and body, and achieves similar clinical efficacy.

### Contrast agent-specific parameter optimization for T 1-weighted fast spoiled gradient echo imaging: use cases for gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol at 1.5T and 3.0T [^111xD9BQ]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agents, which exploit MR's sensitivity to paramagnetic effects, has significantly broadened MR imaging (MRI) applications in clinical practice. – These agents, typically injected into the bloodstream, enhance image contrast, improving visualization of anatomical structures and pathological changes. Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs), with a central gadolinium ion bound by a chelating agent, are particularly effective in highlighting tissue abnormalities and pathologies. –

However, the appropriate choice of acquisition parameters (and optimization thereof) for contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) sequences remains, even today, a hot topic of discussion among MR practitioners in the contrast media space. For instance, during the meeting of the Gadolinium Research & Education Committee working group at the European Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine and Biology conference in 2024, there was an entire session focused on optimizing contrast-enhanced MRI, including 3 presentations specifically on parameter optimization and protocol optimization for contrast-enhanced MRI.

While the issue of signal optimization/maximization for spoiled gradient recalled echo (SPGR) sequences has been solved since the 60sas a function of flip angle for a given repetition time (TR), and since the early 90s as a function of flip angle for T 1 contrast optimization in unenhanced MRI, neither of these 2 cases correspond to the optimal flip angle to obtain maximum contrast for T 1 -weighted sequences in the presence of paramagnetic contrast media such as GBCAs. The optimization of T 1 -dependent contrast (in the absence of contrast agents) has been studied extensively in the past, – but these efforts have primarily focused on optimizing the contrast between unenhanced gray and white matter. While this is important for unenhanced T 1 -weighted imaging, it is not of primary importance for contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted imaging. Additional challenges faced by current practitioners include the availability of multiple field strengths(which affect both relaxation times and relaxivities of contrast agents), diverse imaging sequences and their various implementations, and differing relaxivity profiles of contrast agents. Considering these multiple variables, we propose a theoretical framework, grounded in MR physics, to guide the choice of MR sequence parameters in the context of contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted imaging. The specific outcome measure we sought to optimize was the image contrast between enhancing and nonenhancing tissue.

### Efficacy and safety of gadopiclenol for contrast-enhanced MRI of the central nervous system: the PICTURE randomized clinical trial [^112fRpQ1]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Safety Results

Overall, 49 AEs were reported for 36 patients (14.6%) after MRI with gadopiclenol and 55 AEs for 43 patients (17.6%) after MRI with gadobutrol, most of which were of mild intensity (48/49 [98%] with gadopiclenol and 50/55 [91%] with gadobutrol). Adverse events considered related to gadopiclenol (12 patients [4.9%]) and gadobutrol (17 patients [6.9%]) were mostly similar in nature and mainly injection site reactions (Table 1).

TABLE 1
Postinjection Adverse Events Related to Contrast Agent

Four serious AEs were reported during the study: 3 occurred before any contrast agent administration, and 1 (fatal respiratory failure) occurred 5 days after the first MRI performed with gadobutrol and was due to patient's underlying disease.

No safety concerns were raised from laboratory results and vital signs.

### Comparison of 1.0 M gadobutrol and 0.5 M gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in five hundred seventy-two patients with known or suspected liver lesions: results of a multicenter, double-blind, interindividual, randomized clinical phase-III trial [^112UTkuU]. Investigative Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the diagnostic efficacy (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) of 1.0 M gadobutrol versus 0.5 M gadopentetate for the classification of lesions as either benign or malignant in patients with known or suspected liver lesions.

Methods and Materials

A multicenter, phase-III, randomized, interindividually controlled comparison study with blinded reader evaluation was performed to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of a bolus injection of 1.0 M gadobutrol compared with 0.5 M gadopentetate at a dose of 0.1 mmol Gd/kg BW. The imaging protocol included a dynamic 3D-evaluation, static conventional, and fat saturated T1-weighted sequences. MR datasets were evaluated by 3 independent radiologists. The standard of reference was defined by an independent truth panel (radiologist or hepatologist). The safety evaluation included adverse events, vital signs, and physical examination.

Results

A total of 497 of 572 patients were eligible for the final efficacy analysis. Noninferiority of gadobutrol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the classification of liver lesions was demonstrated on the basis of diagnostic accuracy determined by the on-site investigators (-0.098, 0.021) as well as for the average reader of the blinded evaluation (-0.096, 0.014) (95% confidence interval), compared with the predefined standard of reference. Very similar increases in sensitivity (ranging from approximately 10% to approximately 55%) and specificity (ranging from approximately 1% to approximately 18%) compared with precontrast MRI were also observed for the 2 contrast agent groups, with maximum differences of 4%. Very similar, low rates of adverse events were recorded for each of the 2 groups. No clinically relevant changes in vital signs or the results of the physical examination were observed in any patient.

Conclusion

This study documents evidence for the noninferiority of a single i.v. bolus injection of 1.0 M gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg body weight) to 0.5 M gadopentetate (0.1 mmol/kg body weight) in the diagnostic assessment of liver lesions with contrast-enhanced MRI. The known excellent safety profile of gadobutrol was confirmed in this clinical trial and is similar to that of gadopentetate.

### Relationship of dose and signal enhancement properties of gadoquatrane, a new tetrameric, macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent, compared with gadobutrol: a randomized crossover study in healthy adults [^117WED2r]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the signal-enhancement properties of the tetrameric gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) gadoquatrane in relation to the administered dose and compare its properties to those of a standard dose of gadobutrol, as a representative of the currently established macrocyclic GBCAs for magnetic resonance imaging.

Materials and Methods

In this randomized, single-blind, 4 × 4 crossover study, 43 healthy adults (19–50 years of age) received 3 single IV injections of gadoquatrane (0.01, 0.03, and 0.06 mmol gadolinium/kg body weight) and 1 injection of gadobutrol (0.1 mmol gadolinium/kg body weight) in randomized sequence with 1-week washout periods between administrations. The relative signal enhancement (RSE) was determined in predefined areas of interest in magnetic resonance image sets of the head-neck region. RSE-vs-dose curves (dose-response curves) were established by linear regression, and comparator-equivalent doses were determined by Bayesian inverse regression analysis. Further, 3 blood samples were taken after each injection for pharmacokinetic analyses, and safety data were assessed.

Results

The RSE increased with gadoquatrane dose. A linear function adequately fitted this relationship. In line with the more than 2-fold higher r1 relaxivity of gadoquatrane per gadolinium ion, gadobutrol-equivalent RSE was achieved with gadoquatrane at less than half the gadolinium dose and less than one eighth of the molecule dose. Administration of gadoquatrane and gadobutrol resulted in very similar dose-normalized gadolinium concentrations in plasma, indicating that the pharmacokinetic profiles are essentially the same. Both contrast agents were well tolerated. Adverse events were rare and not dependent on the dose administered.

Conclusions

Gadoquatrane has the potential to be an effective GBCA that can be used at substantially lower doses in clinical routine than the currently established macrocyclic GBCAs.

### Improved display of abdominal contrast-enhanced MRA using gadobutrol: comparison with Gd-DTPA [^114TJ74k]. Clinical Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To qualitatively and quantitatively compare gadobutrol with gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA) in abdominal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (CE-MRA) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) during one-stop imaging.

Materials and Methods

This prospective, blinded, multicentre, intra-individual comparison study was approved by the institutional review board. All patients underwent gadobutrol- and Gd-DTPA-enhanced MRA and MRI. Qualitative analysis for vessels was performed using a three-point scale while quantity analysis was performed by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Visceral organs enhancements were also analysed. A Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-rank test was used to evaluate the quality and quantity results.

Results

One hundred and twelve patients were enrolled. Quality analyses results for large vessels and small vessels of gadobutrol and Gd-DTPA were 18.38 ± 1.51 and 6.76 ± 1.58 and 17.87 ± 1.84 and 6.09 ± 1.55, respectively. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed gadobutrol was significantly superior to Gd-DTPA (p = 0.036) for small vessels. For large vessel quantity analysis, gadobutrol demonstrated significantly higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR; p = 0.041) than Gd-DTPA, with mean values of 948.156 ± 349.731 and 838.925 ± 248.197. There was no statistically significant in enhancement of liver, spleen, and renal tissue during gadobutrol- and Gd-DTPA-enhanced imaging (p > 0.05). One patient reported an adverse event. Dizziness and vomiting occurred after injection of Gd-DTPA.

Conclusions

The present study demonstrates gadobutrol-enhanced MRA was superior to that of Gd-DTPA without statistical significance in visceral organ enhancement. It indicates gadobutrol may be more suitable for abdominal one-stop imaging for CE-MRA and CE-MRI by improving depiction of vessels in MRA images.

### A comprehensive overview of the efficacy and safety of gadopiclenol: a new contrast agent for MRI of the CNS and body [^114e2AYT]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

As for the diagnostic preference, the 3 readers expressed in majority a preference for images with gadopiclenol when used at 0.1 mmol/kg (45.3% to 86.8% of images), and in majority no preference between images with gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg and gadobenate dimeglumine at 0.1 mmol/kg (46.6% to 77.6% of images).

The pivotal phase III study, named PICTURE, was also performed to evaluate the efficacy of gadopiclenol in MRI of the CNS. It was an international randomized, double-blind, controlled, and cross-over study. Based on the same design as for the phase IIb study, patients with highly suspicious CNS lesions underwent a series of 2 MRIs: one with gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg and another with gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg. A total of 242 patients were randomized and received the 2 GBCAs. Most patients (72%) presented with brain tumors, 20% had brain or spine metastases, and 8% presented with other pathologies.

### Comparison of gadoterate meglumine and gadobutrol in the MRI diagnosis of primary brain tumors: a double-blind randomized controlled intraindividual crossover study (the REMIND study) [^114mt3w6]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Effective management of patients with brain tumors depends on accurate detection and characterization of lesions. This study aimed to demonstrate the noninferiority of gadoterate meglumine versus gadobutrol for overall visualization and characterization of primary brain tumors.

Materials and Methods

This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled intraindividual, crossover, noninferiority study included 279 patients. Both contrast agents (dose = 0.1 mmol/kg of body weight) were assessed with 2 identical MRIs at a time interval of 2–14 days. The primary end point was overall lesion visualization and characterization, scored independently by 3 off-site readers on a 4-point scale, ranging from "poor" to "excellent". Secondary end points were qualitative assessments (lesion border delineation, internal morphology, degree of contrast enhancement, diagnostic confidence), quantitative measurements (signal intensity), and safety (adverse events). All qualitative assessments were also performed on-site.

Results

For all 3 readers, images of most patients (> 90%) were scored good or excellent for overall lesion visualization and characterization with either contrast agent; and the noninferiority of gadoterate meglumine versus gadobutrol was statistically demonstrated. No significant differences were observed between the 2 contrast agents regarding qualitative end points despite quantitative mean lesion percentage enhancement being higher with gadobutrol (P < .001). Diagnostic confidence was high/excellent for all readers in > 81% of the patients with both contrast agents. Similar percentages of patients with adverse events related to the contrast agents were observed with gadoterate meglumine (7.8%) and gadobutrol (7.3%), mainly injection site pain.

Conclusions

The noninferiority of gadoterate meglumine versus gadobutrol for overall visualization and characterization of primary brain tumors was demonstrated.

### Gadobutrol in renally impaired patients: results of the GRIP study [^113BtBFx]. Investigative Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

In our study cohort, most patients had renal disease caused by hypertension (58.5%) or diabetes (31.9%), both being very common in the modern Western world.

No new safety concerns came up during the study period. No serious adverse events occurred between the date of informed consent and the date the patient left the MRI facility or on the day of gadobutrol injection or during the follow-up period. Progression of renal disease was the most frequent cause of death. Our results are in accordance with other reports on gadobutrol use in patients with renal impairment. Even in patients with chronic renal impairment, including hemodialysis, gadobutrol can safely be applied at doses up to 0.3 mmol/kg, providing evidence that gadobutrol is safe in patients with renal impairment.

Today, gadobutrol is approved in more than 100 countries worldwide, including the European Union, Switzerland, Australia, United States, Canada, Japan, and China. Since its introduction to the market in February 1998 until December 2015, the cumulative patient exposure is estimated to be more than 29 million patients. As of May 2016, the pharmacovigilance department of Bayer Pharma AG has received 3 single-agent reports, so-called unconfounded reports, for gadobutrol consistent with the clinicohistopathological definition of NSF. This classification was rigorously performed after a most stringent and conservative approach according to the criteria by Girardi et al. In case clinicopathological criteria or laboratory parameters reached a score of ≥ 1, Bayer always assumed a worst-case scenario. Bayer continues to follow a policy of total transparency regarding NSF, with expedited case reporting to health authorities all over the world.

### Safety of gadobutrol, a new generation of contrast agents: experience from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance [^1144G8HW]. Investigative Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the clinical safety and tolerability of the macrocyclic contrast agent gadobutrol (Gadovist/Gadavist) overall and in specific patient populations based on clinical trials and postmarketing experience.

Materials and Methods

In total, 5545 patients enrolled in 34 prospective clinical studies were evaluated in an integrated analysis of safety. Of all enrolled patients, 4549 received gadobutrol at a dose of ≤ 0.09 mmol/kg body weight to a maximum of 0.51 mmol/kg body weight, with most patients (53.5%) receiving the recommended dose of > 0.09 to 0.11 mmol/kg body weight. Data include comparisons with other extracellular contrast agents and subgroup analyses in pediatric patients, and patients with allergic disposition, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, or cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, worldwide postmarketing safety surveillance results, including nephrogenic systemic fibrosis reports, based on more than 5.7 million estimated applications are described.

Results

One or more adverse events (AEs) assessed as related to the administration of gadobutrol were reported by 182 (4.0%) of the 4549 patients who participated in clinical trials. This is comparable to the incidence observed with the comparator contrast agents (74/1844 patients, 4.0%). The most common AEs, independent of drug relationship, were headache, nausea, feeling hot, and dysgeusia. The favorable safety profile of gadobutrol was also demonstrated in the following specific subpopulations in whom similar incidence rates were seen: pediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years (8/138 patients, 5.8%), patients with severe or moderate renal impairment (9/366 patients, 2.5%), patients with severe or moderate hepatic impairment (9/214 patients, 4.2%), and patients with cardiovascular disorders (42/1506 patients, 2.8%). Having been established in controlled clinical trials, this safety profile was also confirmed by postmarketing surveillance data. With more than 5.7 million estimated administrations of gadobutrol, a total of 1175 (0.02%) suspected adverse drug reactions have been reported. The most serious adverse reactions seen in postmarketing surveillance included rare reports of cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, anaphylactoid shock, and nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Incidence and type of AEs from postmarketing surveillance were consistent with the established safety profile.

Conclusion

The comprehensive analysis of safety data obtained from 34 clinical studies demonstrates that gadobutrol has an excellent safety profile and a positive benefit risk profile when used in patients in need of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. Gadobutrol was well tolerated by adults, by children, by patients with impaired liver or kidney function, and by patients with cardiovascular disease. The favorable safety profile is confirmed by the available postmarketing surveillance data and is compared with that of other gadolinium-based contrast agents.

### Off-label intrathecal use of gadobutrol: safety study and comparison of administration protocols [^112LcCh2]. Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

The available evidence points to a small gap between advantageous diagnostic effects and neurotoxic effects of intrathecal MRI contrast agents. From our experience, intrathecal gadobutrol in a dose of 0.5 mmol or less is safe, which in an adult with a brain weighing 1400 g represents an exposure 0.36 μmol/g gadobutrol to brain. Intrathecal gadobutrol in a dose of 2.0 mmol or higher may cause neurotoxic effects. It was previously reported in humans that overdose of gadopentetic acid (6–20 times normal dose) could be neurotoxic. One individual who by accident received 20 mmol gadopentetic acid (7.0 μmol/g brain) developed neurological deficits (speech problems, visual impairment, fatigue, and psychotic symptoms) lasting 2 weeks, but symptoms had disappeared after 2 months. Intrathecal gadobutrol in a dose of 2.0 mmol caused spastic pain of the lower extremities. Recently, another study reported fatal outcome in a 67-year-old person who by accident received 2.0 mmol gadoteridol, corresponding to a concentration 2.3 μmol/g brain. The authors reviewed the literature about neurotoxic effects of intrathecal gadolinium; the literature reports no neurological complications after doses causing concentration of < 1.0 μmol/g brain.

Taken together, the existing data suggest intrathecal gadobutrol in a dose of 0.5 mmol (corresponding to a dose of 0.36 μmol gadobutrol per gram brain) to be safe. Nevertheless, the present study provides preliminary data that gadobutrol in a dose of 0.25 mmol causes less severe nausea than 0.5 mmol. Since only five individuals received 0.25 mmol, this need to be further studied. We further note that intrathecal gadobutrol in a dose of 0.25 mmol provided strong enrichment within CSF of cisterna magna, though the CSF tracer level was significantly lower than 3, 6, and 48 h after a dose of 0.5 mmol. Nevertheless, a dose of 0.25 mmol may be considered sufficient for diagnosis of CSF leaks from the spinal canal or at the skull base. We will explore the clinical utility of this dose in future studies where intrathecal gadobutrol is used as CSF tracer to assess the glymphatic system and craniospinal molecular clearance capacity.

### Off-label intrathecal use of gadobutrol: safety study and comparison of administration protocols [^115bW9Xm]. Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main result of this prospective study is that intrathecal gadobutrol in doses of either 0.25 or 0.5 mmol caused no serious adverse events in individuals without prior history of allergic reactions to contrast agents. The frequency of non-serious adverse events after days 1–3 or 4 weeks was primarily determined by the tentative patient diagnosis prior to intrathecal injection. There were no definitive adverse events after 12 months.

The clinical indications for intrathecal gadobutrol in this study were various forms of suspected CSF circulation disorders, where gadobutrol at the same time served as a CSF tracer as part of our gMRI protocol. We administered gadobutrol off-label based on special permission from the National Medicines Agency of Norway, in a standardized research setting only. However, intrathecal MRI contrast agents in similar concentrations have previously been used clinically off-label to visualize CSF leakage in individuals with spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) and otorhinorrhea, as well as in the diagnostic assessment of disorders such as arachnoid cysts and iNPH.

The safety profile of gadolinium-based contrast agents was recently reviewed in this journal; the authors concluded that no cause-effect relationship has been shown in humans regarding brain gadolinium exposure and clinical consequences specific to neurological toxicity. Previously, several studies found the linear contrast agent gadopentetic acid to have low risk when given intrathecally to patients in a dose 0.5–1.0 mmol. A recent systematic review concluded that serious adverse events of intrathecal administered MRI contrast agents are highly dose-dependent; the observed serious adverse events were seen after administration of 2 mmol or higher doses. Non-serious adverse events, primarily headache, occurred following doses of 1 mmol or lower, but they were not able to conclude about the cause since headache occurs post lumbar puncture in about 49% of patients. Headache also was the most common non-serious adverse event in the present study. In comparison, intrathecal gadopentetic acid caused headache in 10/36 (27%) iNPH patients and in 6/20 (30%) patients with arachnoid cysts.

### Clinical efficacy of reduced-dose gadobutrol versus standard-dose gadoterate for contrast-enhanced MRI of the CNS: an international multicenter prospective crossover trial (LEADER-75) [^116vqiEm]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2021). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND. Gadobutrol and gadoterate are widely used macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agents. Given gadobutrol's higher T1 relaxivity, a reduced gadobutrol dose should achieve essentially equivalent diagnostic efficacy as a standard dose of gadoterate. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of our study was to show efficacy of a 25% reduced dose of gadobutrol is noninferior to 100% standard dose of gadoterate for contrast-enhanced MRI of the CNS. METHODS. In this international prospective multicenter open-label crossover trial (LEADER-75 [Lower Administered Dose With Higher Relaxivity: Gadovist vs Dotarem]), adult patients with known or suspected CNS pathology underwent contrast-enhanced brain MRI with standard-dose gadoterate (0.1 mmol/kg); if an enhancing lesion was identified, a second MRI with reduced-dose gadobutrol (0.075 mmol/kg) was performed within 15 days of the first MRI. Three radiologists independently reviewed images to score three primary efficacy measures: subjective lesion enhancement, lesion border delineation, lesion internal morphology. A noninferiority analysis used readers' mean scores of the primary efficacy measures. Noninferiority of reduced-dose gadobutrol to standard-dose gadoterate for primary efficacy measures was defined as the difference in score between reduced-dose gadobutrol images and unenhanced images achieving at least 80% of the difference in score between standard-dose gadoterate images and unenhanced images. A post hoc analysis was performed to directly compare contrast-enhanced images for equivalence. Secondary efficacy variables included the number of lesions detected, reader confidence, diagnostic performance for malignancy, and reader preference in side-by-side comparison. RESULTS. The efficacy analysis included 141 patients (78 men, 63 women; mean age, 58.5 ± 13.5 [SD] years). Improvement of reduced-dose gadobutrol over unenhanced images was noninferior to improvement of standard-dose gadoterate over unenhanced images using a 20% noninferiority margin for all three primary efficacy measures using mean readings (p ≤ .025). In the post hoc analysis, the mean reading for the three primary efficacy measures differed by less than 1% between reduced-dose gadobutrol and standard-dose gadoterate, supporting equivalence of all measures using a narrow ± 5% margin (p ≤ .025). The total number of lesions detected by mean reading was 301 for reduced-dose gadobutrol versus 291 for standard-dose gadoterate. Mean reader confidence was 3.3 ± 0.6 for reduced-dose gadobutrol versus 3.3 ± 0.6 for standard-dose gadoterate. Sensitivity (58.7%), specificity (91.8%), and accuracy (70.2%) for malignancy from majority reading were identical for reduced-dose gadobutrol and standard-dose gadoterate. Reader preference was not different (95% CI, -0.10 to 0.11). CONCLUSION. A 25% reduced dose of gadobutrol is noninferior to standard-dose gadoterate for contrast-enhanced brain MRI. CLINICAL IMPACT. Use of reduced-dose gadobutrol should be considered for brain MRI, particularly in patients undergoing multiple contrast-enhanced examinations. TRIAL REGISTRATION. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03602339; EU Clinical Trials Register EudraCT 2018–00690–78.

### Gadobutrol in renally impaired patients: results of the GRIP study [^111D7DV7]. Investigative Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to assess the potential risk of gadobutrol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment for the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF).

Materials and Methods

We performed a prospective, international, multicenter, open-label study in 55 centers. Patients with moderate to severe renal impairment scheduled for any gadobutrol-enhanced MRI were included. All patients received a single intravenous bolus injection of gadobutrol at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight. The primary target variable was the number of patients who develop NSF within a 2-year follow-up period.

Results

A total of 908 patients were enrolled, including 586 with moderate and 284 with severe renal impairment who are at highest risk for developing NSF. The mean time since renal disease diagnosis was 1.83 and 5.49 years in the moderate and severe renal impairment cohort, respectively. Overall, 184 patients (20.3%) underwent further contrast-enhanced MRI with other gadolinium-based contrast agents within the 2-year follow-up. No patient developed symptoms conclusive of NSF.

Conclusions

No safety concerns with gadobutrol in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment were identified. There were no NSF cases.

### Prevalence of acute adverse reactions to gadobutrol – a highly concentrated macrocyclic gadolinium chelate: review of 14, 299 patients from observational trials [^111QQoDp]. European Journal of Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the safety and tolerability of gadobutrol in a large number of non-selected patients from routine clinical radiology practices.

Materials and Methods

Six prospectively planned, observational surveillance studies were conducted at more than 300 institutions in Europe and Canada from 2000 to 2007. Demographic and medical status data, details of the diagnostic procedure, contrast agent administration and adverse drug reaction (ADR) data were collected using a standardized questionnaire.

Results

A total of 14,299 patients were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 53.7 years; 1.3% of the patients were < 18 years old and 40.8% were 60 years or older. The body regions most frequently examined were head/neck/brain (54.3%), followed by spine (7.2%), pelvis/joints/limbs (6.7%) and multiple body regions (6.4%). Gadobutrol-enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was performed in 14.7% of patients. Overall, the mean volume of gadobutrol administered for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was 12 mL (0.16 mmol gadolinium [Gd]/kg body weight [BW]; mean BW: 75.5 kg), whereas for contrast-enhanced MRA the mean volume was 15.7 mL (0.21 mmol Gd/kg BW). Seventy-eight of the 14,299 patients (0.55%) reported at least one ADR. Two (0.01%) serious ADRs were reported. The most frequently reported ADR was nausea, which occurred in 36 patients (0.25%).

Conclusion

Gadobutrol 1.0M is very well tolerated and has a good safety profile. The occurrence of ADRs observed following the intravenous injection of gadobutrol is comparable with the published data of other Gd-based contrast agents.

### A comprehensive overview of the efficacy and safety of gadopiclenol: a new contrast agent for MRI of the CNS and body [^116fkR18]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

This review describes the pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of gadopiclenol, a new macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration at the dose of 0.05 mmol/kg. Gadopiclenol is a high relaxivity contrast agent that shares similar pharmacokinetic characteristics with other macrocyclic GBCAs, including a predominant renal excretion. In pediatric patients aged 2–17 years, the pharmacokinetic parameters (assessed through a population pharmacokinetics model) were comparable to those observed in adults, indicating no need for age-based dose adjustment. For contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system (CNS) and body indications, gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg was shown to be noninferior to gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg in terms of 3 lesion visualization parameters (ie, lesion border delineation, internal morphology, and contrast enhancement). Moreover, for contrast-enhanced MRI of the CNS, compared with gadobenate dimeglumine at 0.1 mmol/kg, gadopiclenol exhibited superior contrast-to-noise ratio at 0.1 mmol/kg and comparable contrast-to-noise ratio at 0.05 mmol/kg. A pooled safety analysis of 1047 participants showed a favorable safety profile for gadopiclenol. Comparative studies showed that the incidence and nature of adverse drug reactions with gadopiclenol were comparable to those observed with other GBCAs. Importantly, no significant safety concerns were identified in pediatric and elderly patients, as well as in patients with renal impairment. Overall, these findings support the clinical utility and safety of gadopiclenol for MRI in adult and pediatric patients aged 2 years and older in CNS and body indications.

### Off-label intrathecal use of gadobutrol: safety study and comparison of administration protocols [^112zQpYn]. Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since the glia-lymphatic (or glymphatic) system was described in 2012, it has attracted a lot of interest and scientific discussion by providing a new perspective on brain-wide clearance of toxic brain metabolites such as amyloid-β and tau protein and thereby playing a pivotal role in neurodegenerative disease. Later, intrathecal contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) gave in vivo evidence for the existence of a brain-wide glymphatic system in humans and also demonstrated molecular efflux pathways from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to neck lymph nodes, the parasagittal dura, and choroid plexus.

Several concerns exist about the off-label intrathecal use of MRI contrast agents, primarily due to potential neurotoxic effects, and report on retention of linear gadolinium chelates within the human brain extra-vascular space after repeated intravenous administrations. A potential mechanism for the findings of gadolinium outside the blood-brain barrier was given by recent observations of MRI contrast agents leaking from blood to CSF, even in individuals without blood-brain barrier dysfunction, mainly through the choroid plexus, but also via the ciliary body. In principle, an intravenous dosage of contrast agent to venous blood therefore also represents a small dosage of contrast agent to CSF; one MRI study indicated that CSF concentration of contrast agent is one-fifth of the intravenous concentration after intravenous administration.

We recently reported the safety profile of intrathecal gadobutrol in 100 subjects. The purpose of the present study was to expand the analysis to include additional 49 patients in order to compare different administration protocols of intrathecal gadobutrol, i.e. 0.5 mmol gadobutrol (0.5 mL of Gadovist TM, 1.0 mmol/ml), with or without 3 mL iodixanol (Visipaque TM, 270 mg I/ml). In addition, we performed MRI using 0.25 mmol gadobutrol. Adverse events, categorized as serious or non-serious, were assessed days 1–3 and after 4 weeks and 12 months.

2.1 Recommended Dose

The recommended dose of gadobutrol injection for adult and pediatric patients (including term neonates) is 0.1 mL/kg body weight (0.1 mmol/kg). Refer to Table 1 to determine the volume to be administered.

*for Cardiac MRI, the dose is divided into 2 separate, equal injections

2.2 Administration Guidelines

Gadobutrol injection is formulated at a higher concentration (1 mmol/mL) compared to certain other gadolinium based contrast agents, resulting in a lower volume of administration. Use Table 1 to determine the volume to be administered.
Use sterile technique when preparing and administering gadobutrol injection.

MRI of the Central Nervous System

Administer gadobutrol injection as an intravenous injection, manually or by power injector, at a flow rate of approximately 2 mL/second.
Follow gadobutrol injection with a normal saline flush to ensure complete administration of the contrast.
Post contrast MRI can commence immediately following contrast administration.

Administer gadobutrol injection as an intravenous bolus by power injector, followed by a normal saline flush to ensure complete administration of the contrast.
Start image acquisition following contrast administration and then repeat sequentially to determine peak intensity and wash-out.

MR Angiography

Image acquisition should coincide with peak arterial concentration, which varies among patients.

Adults

Administer gadobutrol injection by power injector, at a flow rate of approximately 1.5 mL/second, followed by a 30 mL normal saline flush at the same rate to ensure complete administration of the contrast.

Pediatric patients

Administer gadobutrol injection by power injector or manually, followed by a normal saline flush to ensure complete administration of the contrast.

Cardiac MRI

Administer gadobutrol injection through a separate intravenous line in the contralateral arm if concomitantly providing a continuous infusion of a pharmacologic stress agent.
Administer gadobutrol injection as two (2) separate bolus injections: 0.05 mL/kg (0.05 mmol/kg) body weight at peak pharmacologic stress followed by 0.05 mL/kg (0.05 mmol/kg) body weight at rest.
Administer gadobutrol injection via a power injector at a flow rate of approximately 4 mL/second and follow each injection with a normal saline flush of 20 mL at the same flow rate.

### A comprehensive overview of the efficacy and safety of gadopiclenol: a new contrast agent for MRI of the CNS and body [^112QrZvL]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

No preference between images with gadopiclenol and those with gadobutrol was reported in most cases (75%–83%, depending on the reader). Example MRI scans of patients with breast cancer or liver metastasis from colon cancer, obtained after gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) and gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg) administration, are provided in Figure 3 and Figure 4, respectively.

Contrast-enhanced breast MRI with gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) and gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg). Axial 3D T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI for a 62-year-old female with breast cancer. Images were acquired after gadopiclenol administration at 0.05 mmol/kg (A) or gadobutrol administration at 0.1 mmol/kg (B).

FIGURE 4
Contrast-enhanced liver MRI with gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) and gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg). Axial 3D T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI during the arterial (A, D), portal venous (B and E) and delayed (C and F) phases for a 58-year-old female with liver metastasis from colon cancer; images were obtained after administration of gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg (A–C) or gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg (D–F).

Regarding the quantitative measurements, the percentage of contrast enhancement was significantly higher with gadopiclenol for 2 of 3 readers, whereas no significant difference was observed between the 2 GBCAs for LBR.

Taking into account the 3 body regions including at least 20% of patients, namely, the abdomen, thorax, and pelvis, the noninferiority of gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg versus gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg was also demonstrated in each of these regions.

No meaningful differences were noted in the total number of lesions detected with gadopiclenol as compared with gadobutrol.

### Pharmacokinetics, safety, and dialyzability of gadoquatrane in patients with impaired renal function: a comprehensive investigation using clinical trial data, modeling and simulation, and in vitro data [^114xEawF]. Investigative Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Gadoquatrane is a next-generation gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)⁠ – currently in clinical development. It is of tetrameric, macrocyclic structure and characterized by high complex stability and high relaxivity.⁠Because of its high relaxivity, it has the potential to be used in clinical routine at a substantially lower dose than established macrocyclic GBCAs such as gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, and gadoteridol.⁠

Three phase 1 studies of gadoquatrane in healthy volunteers have shown that the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of gadoquatrane is very similar to that of gadobutrol and other established GBCAs. After intravenous (IV) administration, gadoquatrane shows fast distribution into the extracellular space and is rapidly eliminated — almost exclusively via the renal route.⁠, No indications of in vivo degradation or release of gadolinium (Gd) from the molecule were detected in these studies.

In the present paper, we report on the results of a phase 1 PK and safety study of gadoquatrane in participants with mildly to moderately impaired renal function and matching controls with normal renal function. Furthermore, we report on supplementary investigations: (i) a PK modeling and simulation analysis to estimate the exposure in patients with severely impaired renal function and (ii) in vitro tests for dialyzability.

The primary objective of the phase 1 study was to evaluate the PK profile of gadoquatrane over 7 days after injection (p.i.). The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of gadoquatrane in this population as well as the long-term renal excretion over 6 months.

Participants with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease were not included in this study. Given that the elimination pathway of gadoquatrane is determined by its physicochemical properties and is essentially the same as for all other agents of its class, exposing participants with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease who are not in need of a contrast-enhanced MRI was deemed unnecessary. Instead, we used modeling and simulation to extrapolate the PK data obtained in study participants with nonseverely impaired renal function to patients with severe renal impairment. Furthermore, an in vitro approach was used to assess the dialyzability of gadoquatrane.

### Efficacy and safety of gadopiclenol for contrast-enhanced MRI of the central nervous system: the PICTURE randomized clinical trial [^115LYY6z]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Efficacy Results

The per-protocol set included 236 patients, and full analysis set included 239 patients. When comparing gadopiclenol to gadobutrol paired images, the differences in mean of scores for border delineation, internal morphology, and contrast enhancement were close to 0 in all cases, with a lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference (≥ −0.06) above the noninferiority margin for all 3 readers (P < 0.0001 in all cases) (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 3; Fig. 2). Therefore, the statistical noninferiority of gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) versus gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg) paired images was achieved. The differences in mean of scores were significantly in favor of gadopiclenol paired compared with pre images for all 3 readers and all 3 parameters (P < 0.0001 in all cases) (see Table, Supplemental Digital Content 4; Fig. 2). Therefore, the statistical superiority of paired gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) over pre images was achieved.

FIGURE 2
Noninferiority and superiority analyses for lesion visualization. Up to 3 most representative lesions in each patient were qualitatively scored (from 1 to 4) for each parameter by 3 offsite independent blinded readers, and a mean of scores was calculated. A noninferiority analysis between gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) and gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg) combined unenhanced (pre) and contrast-enhanced (paired) images (A), and a superiority analysis between pre and gadopiclenol (0.05 mmol/kg) paired images (B) were performed. Data are presented as bar graphs showing the least squares (LS) mean (standard error [SE]) of the scores, and the confidence interval (CI) of the difference between the scores are shown above each bar graph, with a P value > 0.0001 for all readers and all visualization criteria.

### Optimizing contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging characterization of brain metastases: relevance to stereotactic radiosurgery [^111eF6oi]. Neurosurgery (2013). Low credibility.

Intracranial metastases are the most common form of intra-axial brain tumor. Management approaches to brain metastases include surgical resection, whole-brain radiotherapy, and stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). The management approach that is selected is based typically on algorithms that incorporate the number, size, and location of lesions. SRS is the treatment of choice when metastases detected on imaging are few (maximum, 3–5) and/or of small size (≤ 30 mm) and offers the advantages of noninvasiveness and the ability to treat inaccessible lesions compared with surgical resection. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard imaging technique for determining the number, size, and location of metastatic lesions. In SRS, the capability of MRI to delineate lesion borders precisely in 3 dimensions helps reduce recurrence rates and minimize radiation necrosis in surrounding tissue. Optimization of the MRI protocol, including selection of the appropriate gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA), is paramount for accurate lesion imaging. GBCAs differ in their safety, tolerability, and efficacy because of their diverse physicochemical properties. Gadobutrol and gadobenate dimeglumine are high-relaxivity GBCAs that demonstrate superior efficacy for imaging metastatic lesions compared with other GBCAs, whereas gadobutrol additionally provides macrocyclic stability. This article reviews recent comparative trials of GBCAs and discusses their relevance for optimizing MRI protocols in the management of brain metastases, with particular relevance to SRS.

6.2 Postmarketing Experience

The following additional adverse reactions have been identified during postmarketing use of gadobutrol injection or other GBCAs. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

Cardiac arrest
Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF)
Hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylactic shock, circulatory collapse, respiratory arrest, bronchospasm, cyanosis, oropharyngeal swelling, laryngeal edema, blood pressure increased, chest pain, angioedema, conjunctivitis, hyperhidrosis, cough, sneezing, burning sensation, and pallor)
Respiratory, Thoracic, and Mediastinal Disorders: Acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary edema
General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions: Adverse reactions with variable onset and duration have been reported after GBCA administration These include fatigue, asthenia, pain syndromes, and heterogeneous clusters of symptoms in the neurological, cutaneous, and musculoskeletal systems.
Skin: Gadolinium associated plaques
Gastrointestinal Disorders: Acute pancreatitis with onset within 48 hours after GBCA administration

### Safety of gadobutrol in over 23, 000 patients: the GARDIAN study, a global multicentre, prospective, non-interventional study [^112ZrViw]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Outcome measures

Patient demographics, medical data (concomitant diseases and treatments), contrast agent risk factors (including previous CM reactions), as well as any signs and symptoms or treatments administered for contrast reactions were documented by the treating physician or nurse in case report forms at the time of MRI. Information on the CM intravenous injection (dose, amount) and subjective assessment of contrast-enhanced image quality were also recorded.

The primary study endpoint was the overall incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) following gadobutrol administration, including the rates, severity, and symptoms of events. Adverse events (AEs) documented by the treating physician or nurse were categorized as ADRs based on the judgment of the treating physician. SAEs were defined as events that are medically important, life-threatening, fatal, or involved hospitalization or prolongation of current hospitalization, disability/incapacity, or birth defects.

Secondary study endpoints were the rates, quality, and symptoms of AEs and ADRs associated with gadobutrol in special patient groups, including patients at risk for any CM reaction (i.e. with previous CM reactions, allergies, or bronchial asthma), patients with renal impairment or cardiac disease and patients aged < 18 years. ADR rates were analysed with respect to the gadobutrol dose administered, geographic region and medical indication. Additionally, the image quality was rated subjectively by investigators on a four-point scale (poor, moderate, good, or excellent).

### Gadobutrol in renally impaired patients: results of the GRIP study [^116KDhgo]. Investigative Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

The recommended standard dose of gadobutrol for intravenous injection is 0.1 mmol/kg body weight (bw), with doses up to 0.3 mmol/kg bw approved for specific indications in adults. The efficacy and safety of gadobutrol have been demonstrated in numerous clinical studies in adults and children, including full-term newborns.–

Following an FDA postmarketing requirement to all manufacturers of GBCAs in the United States in December 2009, we voluntarily initiated this study on gadobutrol adhering to the FDA's stipulations. The study title was "Prospective non-randomized cohort study (open-label, multicenter) to assess the magnitude of potential risk with the administration of Gadovist in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment for the development of NSF based on diagnostically specific clinical and histopathologic information" (EudraCT no. 2008–004496–22, NCT00828737). The initiation of this "GRIP" study (Gadobutrol in Renally Impaired Patients) was a preemptive measure. In 2009, gadobutrol was not yet approved in the United States, but Bayer planned its market introduction in the near future and therefore decided to voluntarily perform this study with gadobutrol following the specific FDA stipulations.

### Gadobutrol (Gadavist) [^112wBgp2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occurs with:

Differences in proton density
Differences of the spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation times (T1)
Differences in the spin-spin or transverse relaxation time (T2)

When placed in a magnetic field, Gadavist shortens the T1and T2relaxation times. The extent of decrease of T1and T2relaxation times, and therefore the amount of signal enhancement obtained from Gadavist, is based upon several factors including the concentration of Gadavist in the tissue, the field strength of the MRI system, and the relative ratio of the longitudinal and transverse relaxation times. At the recommended dose, the T1shortening effect is observed with greatest sensitivity in T1-weighted magnetic resonance sequences. In T2✱-weighted sequences the induction of local magnetic field inhomogeneities by the large magnetic moment of gadolinium and at high concentrations (during bolus injection) leads to a signal decrease.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Gadavist leads to distinct shortening of the relaxation times even in low concentrations. At pH 7, 37°C and 1.5 T, the relaxivity (r1) - determined from the influence on the relaxation times (T1) of protons in plasma - is 5.2 L/(mmol·sec) and the relaxivity (r2) - determined from the influence on the relaxation times (T2) - is 6.1 L/(mmol·sec). These relaxivities display only slight dependence on the strength of the magnetic field. The T1shortening effect of paramagnetic contrast agents is dependent on concentration and r1relaxivity (see Table 3). This may improve tissue visualization.

r1relaxivity in plasma at 37°C

Compared to 0.5 molar gadolinium-based contrast agents, the higher concentration of Gadavist results in half the volume of administration and a more compact contrast bolus injection. At the site of imaging, the relative height and width of the time intensity curve for Gadavist varies as a function of imaging location and multiple patient, injection, and device-specific factors.

Gadavist is a water-soluble, hydrophilic compound with a partition coefficient between n-butanol and buffer at pH 7.6 of about 0.006.

### Intrathecal use of gadobutrol for glymphatic MR imaging: prospective safety study of 100 patients [^115pRCRx]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

Intrathecal contrast-enhanced glymphatic MR imaging has shown promise in assessing glymphatic function in patients with dementia. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety profile and feasibility of this new MR imaging technique.

Materials and Methods

A prospective safety and feasibility study was performed in 100 consecutive patients (58 women and 42 men, 51 ± 19 years of age) undergoing glymphatic MR imaging from September 2015 to August 2018. Short- and long-term serious and nonserious adverse events were registered clinically and by interview after intrathecal administration of 0.5 mL of gadobutrol (1.0 mmol/mL) along with 3 mL of iodixanol (270 mg I/mL). Adverse events are presented as numbers and percentages.

Results

One serious adverse event (anaphylaxis) occurred in a patient with known allergy to iodine-containing contrast agents (1%). The main nonserious adverse events during the first 1–3 days after contrast injection included severe headache (28%) and severe nausea (34%), though the frequency depended heavily on the diagnosis. After 4 weeks, adverse events had resolved.

Conclusions

Intrathecal administration of gadobutrol in conjunction with iodixanol for glymphatic MR imaging is safe and feasible. We cannot conclude whether short-duration symptoms such as headache and nausea were caused by gadobutrol, iodixanol, the lumbar puncture, or the diagnosis. The safety profile closely resembles that of iodixanol alone.

### A comprehensive overview of the efficacy and safety of gadopiclenol: a new contrast agent for MRI of the CNS and body [^115kqGZ7]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

EFFICACY OF GADOPICLENOL

Several studies have been conducted to assess the efficacy of gadopiclenol across various indications for MRI, including the CNS and other anatomical regions of the body such as head and neck, breast, abdomen, pelvis, and musculoskeletal system. Gadopiclenol, given at different doses, was compared with 2 other GBCAs, namely, gadobenate dimeglumine and gadobutrol, both used at the standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg.

Gadopiclenol Efficacy in MRI of the Central Nervous System

An international, double-blind, randomized, controlled, cross-over phase IIb study was conducted on patients exhibiting highly suspicious CNS lesions. A total of 240 patients underwent 2 MRI scans separated by a time interval of 2–14 days. The patients were randomly administered gadopiclenol at a dose of 0.025, 0.05, 0.1, or 0.2 mmol/kg, for the first MRI and gadobenate dimeglumine at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg for the second MRI, or vice versa. The majority of patients (72%) presented with brain tumors, 22% had brain or spine metastases, and 6% presented with other pathologies.

The primary evaluation criterion was contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) assessed by 3 independent readers. Compared with gadobenate dimeglumine at 0.1 mmol/kg, CNR was 32% to 45% higher with gadopiclenol at 0.1 mmol/kg (P ≤ 0.0007 for all 3 readers), and at similar level with gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg (P ≥ 0.19 for all 3 readers). Likewise, the secondary evaluation criteria lesion-to-brain ratio (LBR), which quantify the visibility of a lesion relative to the surrounding normal tissue, and the percentage of contrast enhancement (increase in the lesion's signal intensity relative to its baseline value) were both significantly higher with gadopiclenol at 0.1 mmol/kg (P < 0.0002), and of similar magnitude with gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg (P ≥ 0.11 for all 3 readers) compared with gadobenate dimeglumine at 0.1 mmol/kg.

### Intra-individual, randomised comparison of the MRI contrast agents gadobutrol versus gadoteridol in patients with primary and secondary brain tumours, evaluated in a blinded read [^115ihLv1]. European Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To prove that 1.0 M gadobutrol provides superior contrast enhancement and MRI image characteristics of primary and secondary brain tumours compared with 0.5 M gadoteridol, thereby providing superior diagnostic information.

Methods

Brain MRI was performed in two separate examinations in patients scheduled for neurosurgery. Independent injections of 1.0 M gadobutrol and 0.5 M gadoteridol at doses of 0.1 mmol Gd/kg body weight were administered per patient in randomised order. Evaluation was performed in an off-site blinded read.

Results

Fifty-one patients in the full analysis set (FAS) were eligible for efficacy analysis and 44 for the per-protocol analysis. For the primary efficacy variable "preference in contrast enhancement for one contrast agent or the other", the rate of "gadobutrol preferred" was estimated at 0.73 (95% confidence interval 0.61; 0.83), showing significant superiority of gadobutrol over gadoteridol. Calculated lesion-to-brain contrast and the results of all qualitative secondary efficacy variables were also in favour of gadobutrol. Keeping a sufficient time delay after contrast application proved to be essential to get optimal image quality.

Conclusion

Compared with 0.5 M gadoteridol, 1.0 M gadobutrol was proven to have significantly superior contrast enhancement characteristics in a routine MRI protocol of primary and secondary brain tumours.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of gadobutrol injection have been established in pediatric patients, including term neonates, for use with MRI to detect and visualize areas with disrupted blood brain barrier and/or abnormal vascularity of the central nervous system and for use in MRA to evaluate known or suspected supra-aortic or renal artery disease. Use of gadobutrol injection in these indications is supported by adequate and well-controlled studies in adults and supportive imaging data in two studies in 135 patients 2 to less than 18 years of age and 44 patients less than 2 years of age with CNS and non-CNS lesions, and pharmacokinetic data in 130 patients 2 to less than 18 years of age and 43 patients less than 2 years of age, including term neonates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The frequency, type, and severity of adverse reactions in pediatric patients were similar to adverse reactions in adults [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. No dose adjustment according to age is necessary in pediatric patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3), and Clinical Studies (14.1)]. The safety and effectiveness of gadobutrol injection have not been established in preterm neonates for any indication or in pediatric patients of any age for use with MRI to assess the presence and extent of malignant breast disease, or for use in CMRI to assess myocardial perfusion (stress, rest) and late gadolinium enhancement in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease (CAD).

### Cerebral neoplastic enhancing lesions: multicenter, randomized, crossover intraindividual comparison between gadobutrol (1.0M) and gadoterate meglumine (0.5M) at 0.1 mmol Gd / kg body weight in a clinical setting [^112Epynq]. European Journal of Radiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Two macrocyclic extracellular contrast agents, one-molar neutral gadobutrol and ionic gadoterate meglumine, were compared to determine the overall preference for one or the other in a clinical setting.

Materials and Methods

Multicenter, randomized, single-blind, intra-individually controlled, comparison study with a corresponding blinded read. Efficacy analysis was based on 136 patients who underwent identical MRI examinations: group A first received 1.0M gadobutrol followed by 0.5M gadoterate meglumine 48 h to 7 days later; group B had a reversed administration order. Three independent blinded readers assessed off-site their overall diagnostic preference (primary efficacy parameter) based on a matched pairs approach.

Results

Superiority of gadobutrol over gadoterate meglumine was demonstrated for the qualitative assessment of overall preference across all readers by a statistically significant difference between both contrast agents for this primary endpoint. Preferences in lesion enhancement (secondary endpoint) were also found significantly in favor of gadobutrol. For preference in lesion delineation from surrounding tissue/edema and for internal structure only a trend towards a higher proportion for gadobutrol was found (except for internal structure reported by one reader, which showed a result of statistical significance). Lesion contrast and relative lesion enhancement (quantitative parameters) were statistically significantly higher for gadobutrol compared to gadoterate meglumine.

Conclusion

Contrast-enhanced MRI of neoplastic brain lesions at a dose of 0.1 mmol Gd/kg body weight, assessed in a standardized off-site blinded reading, results in a significantly higher qualitative and quantitative preference for gadobutrol compared to gadoterate meglumine.

### Pharmacokinetics and safety of macrocyclic gadobutrol in children aged younger than 2 years including term newborns in comparison to older populations [^1177yHJA]. Investigative Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

This clinical study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety data of macrocyclic extracellular contrast agent gadobutrol in pediatric subjects aged younger than 2 years.

Materials and Methods

Pediatric subjects (term newborns to those aged younger than 2 years) with normal renal function undergoing magnetic resonance imaging with gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg body weight [BW]) were prospectively enrolled in this open-label, multicenter clinical trial to evaluate PK as a primary end point. Plasma PK was analyzed using a population-based PK approach. Safety and qualitative efficacy (evaluation of images) were secondary end points. Safety and tolerability were assessed throughout study participation (approximately 7 days). Imaging efficacy variables were assessed by investigators.

Results

Forty-four subjects were evaluated for safety and efficacy; 43 subjects were eligible for PK evaluation including 9 term newborns and infants aged younger than 2 months. Gadobutrol PK in pediatric subjects aged younger than 2 years were adequately described by a linear 2-compartmental model with elimination from the central compartment. Total median systemic exposure (area under the curve) of gadobutrol was estimated at 776 μmol · h/L (range, 544–1470 μmol · h/L). Simulated median concentration at 20 minutes after injection of gadobutrol (C20) was 339 μmol/L (range, 230–456 μmol/L). Safety and tolerability profile were similar to older populations. In 1 subject (2.3%), vomiting was reported as a mild adverse event related to gadobutrol, and there were no reported serious adverse events. The evaluation of gadobutrol-enhanced images provided improved diagnosis, increased confidence in diagnosis, and contributed to subject clinical management.

Conclusions

The PK profile of gadobutrol in children aged younger than 2 years including newborns is similar to that in older children and adults. At the dose of 0.1 mmol/kg BW, gadobutrol had a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated with similar profile across the age range 0 to younger than 2 years and compared with older children and adults. Extrapolation of efficacy data from adults to the younger pediatric population, including term newborns, is justified. The recommended standard dose of gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg BW), as used in the population aged 2 years and older, is also appropriate in children aged younger than 2 years.

### Safety of gadobutrol: results from 42 clinical phase II to IV studies and postmarketing surveillance after 29 million applications [^114hNGQZ]. Investigative Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Study Population

The study population of the 42 clinical phase II to IV studies consisted of patients of all ages (term newborns up to patients older than 90 years) with a clinical need for various diagnostic contrast-enhanced MRI. Special attention was paid to patients with specific risk factors, for example, renal impairment, reduced liver function, cardiovascular disorders, general history of allergies, and specific history of allergies to contrast agents. Two studies recruited children aged 0 to 18 years. All patients (or their legal representatives) gave written informed consent before the start of the study.

No selection criteria were applied for patients for whom ADRs were reported to the Pharmacovigilance Department.

Treatments

In the 42 clinical development phase II to IV studies, a total of 6809 patients received gadobutrol, and 2184 received one of the following comparators: Gd-DTPA (n = 1097), gadodiamide (n = 150), gadoversetamide (n = 227), gadoteridol (n = 555), and Gd-DOTA (n = 155). All contrast agents were administered by a single intravenous bolus injection followed by a saline chaser.

Gadobutrol was administered at a dose range from 0.01 mmol/kg to 0.51 mmol/kg bw. Most subjects (n = 4765) received the standard dose of 0.1 mmol/kg bw. Two hundred ninety-two subjects received a dose between 0.01 and less than 0.09 mmol/kg, and 47 patients received 0.31 to 0.51 mmol/kg bw, a dose above the approved dose. The dose for comparators was mainly 0.1 mmol/kg bw.

Study Procedures

In all clinical phase II–IV studies, demographic data and medical history (in particular history of renal, liver, cardiovascular diseases, and allergies) were recorded. Once contrast-enhanced MRI was performed, patients were asked about their well-being in an unsolicited way to gather information about adverse events (AEs). The follow-up period lasted from just the examination day up to 72 hours.

### Magnetic resonance evaluation of brain metastases from systemic malignances with two doses of gadobutrol 1.0 M compared with gadoteridol: a multicenter, phase II / III study in patients with known or suspected brain metastases [^114tGazr]. Investigative Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the efficacy and safety of 2 doses of gadobutrol 1.0 M (0.1 and 0.2 mmol/kg body weight [BW]), compared with gadoteridol 0.5 M (0.2 mmol/kg BW), in contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) of brain metastases in patients with known or suspected brain metastases from systemic malignancies. The study also compared the usefulness of gadobutrol in treatment planning for stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

Materials and Methods

This was a Phase II/III, multicenter, single-blind, randomized, controlled, crossover, intraindividual comparison study. Each patient underwent one MRI study examination with gadobutrol and the other with gadoteridol, each at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg BW, administered twice, for a total dose of 0.2 mmol/kg BW. Image acquisition was carried out after the first and second doses of gadobutrol, but only after the second dose of gadoteridol. Contrast agents were assigned in a randomized order and their administration separated by an interval of 1 to 14 days. Images were evaluated through blinded readings by 3 independent experienced radiologists. Treatment planning for SRS was assessed in a blinded manner, as a consensus between a diagnostic neuroradiologist and a radiation oncologist, in addition to the clinical investigator's assessment. The safety and tolerability of gadobutrol and gadoteridol were evaluated in all patients who received the study drugs. The primary efficacy variable was the number of lesions detected in CE-MRI images; the secondary efficacy variables were the degree of contrast enhancement and border delineation of lesions, and experts' confidence in treatment planning for SRS.

Results

A total of 175 patients were enrolled and randomized, with 164 (93.7%) included in the safety analysis set, and 151 (86.2%) evaluable in the efficacy analysis. The mean number of detected lesions per patient using the average of the 3 blinded readers was 6.28, 6.92, and 6.87 for gadobutrol 0.1 and 0.2 mmol/kg BW, and gadoteridol 0.2 mmol/kg BW, respectively. Noninferiority of gadobutrol (both doses) to gadoteridol 0.2 mmol/kg BW was demonstrated. The degree of contrast enhancement and the border delineation of each lesion were categorized as "good" or "excellent" for most lesions for both agents. Almost all enhanced images were rated as "confident" in treatment planning for SRS. Sixty-five (43%) and 62 (41%) patients in the gadobutrol 0.1 and 0.2 mmol/kg BW groups, respectively, were selected as eligible for SRS treatment. The percentage of images assessed as "gadobutrol was better than gadoteridol" was higher than that assessed as "gadoteridol was better than gadobutrol" for both doses of gadobutrol. Eight adverse events were reported as being related to the study drug in 7 patients (4.3%) in each group.

Conclusion

In this study, a single dose of gadobutrol was shown to be noninferior to a double dose of gadoteridol at detecting brain metastases, and could be effectively used for treatment planning in patients eligible for SRS. A dose of gadobutrol 0.1 mmol/kg BW is recommended as the clinical dose for the detection of brain metastases.

### Vascular CT and MRI: a practical guide to imaging protocols [^112X5Uk7]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Paramagnetic contrast agents shorten the T1 and T2 relaxation times of water protons in their immediate surroundings, creating a locally increased magnetic field strength. This change in the local magnetic field strength results in increased local field inhomogeneity, driving the shortening of T1 and T2 relaxation. The resultant increased signal intensity (SI) on T1-weighted images provides the basis behind the use of contrast agents in MR. GBCAs are the most commonly used in MRA, and there are currently nine available GBCAs licensed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA for clinical use. GBCAs can be divided into two different groups, linear and macrocyclic, based on how the ligand chelates the gadolinium ion. In the linear agents, the ligand wraps around the gadolinium (Gd 3+) ion, but does not completely enclose it. The macrocyclic agents consist of a chelator, which completely surrounds the Gd 3+ ion in a cage-like structure. The latter agents demonstrate greater stability in vivo than the linear agents, with little (if any) free Gd 3+ ion dissociation, reducing the risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). The recent discovery of cerebral gadolinium deposition in patients with normal renal function is also of concern, although the clinical significance of this phenomenon is yet to be determined. Linear GBCAs are thought to confer a higher risk of cerebral deposition, and their use is now discouraged by the EMA, although this guidance has not been reciprocated by the FDA. Cerebral gadolinium deposition is not only associated with linear GBCA use, however, and has been demonstrated in macrocyclic GBCAs in both animals and humans, in particular the macrocyclic agent gadobutrol.

### Safety of gadobutrol: results from 42 clinical phase II to IV studies and postmarketing surveillance after 29 million applications [^115LipX4]. Investigative Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Finally, pharmacovigilance databases generally yield lower ADR rates compared with results from clinical development phase II to IV studies, as reporting is voluntary, and the motivation to report depends on a number of factors.

As of Dec 2015, pharmacovigilance has received 3 single-agent reports consistent with the clinicohistopathological definition of NSF. This classification was rigorously performed by Bayer scientists after the most stringent and conservative approach according to the criteria by Girardi; that is, the assessment/classification represents a worst-case scenario. This needs to be considered when data and numbers regarding NSF reports from different sources are compared as the interpretation and the use of a categorical score when assessing noncategorical biological parameters leaves some room for interpretation and may introduce variance. Bayer continues to follow a policy of total transparency regarding NSF, with expedited case reporting to health authorities all over the world.

Finally, it is important to note that the European Medicines Agencyhas defined 3 risk categories for GBCAs, which are also applied in the recommendations by the European Society of Urogenital Radiology. Three macrocyclic agents, including gadobutrol, have been identified as GBCAs with the lowest risk potential for NSF. Nevertheless, even macrocyclics should be used with caution in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 4 or 5 (glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min). There should be at least 7 days between 2 injections, and in pregnant women, contrast enhancement should only be considered in case essential information is expected. However, laboratory testing of renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate) is not mandatory. In the United States, the FDA has mandated a boxed warning on the product labeling of all GBCAs, including gadobutrol, but gadobutrol is not one of the products that is contraindicated in the severely renally impaired population.

### Safety of gadobutrol in over 23, 000 patients: the GARDIAN study, a global multicentre, prospective, non-interventional study [^11746iE2]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

A boxed warning relating to risk of NSF is included in the prescribing information at the request of the US Food and Drug Administration in patients with impaired elimination of GBCAs, including gadobutrol. While case reports have described individuals who developed NSF following exposure to gadobutrol, confounders were present in these cases that may have contributed to NSF development. GARDIAN is the first large-scale, prospective study to evaluate the safety of gadobutrol in routine clinical practice, including at-risk patients, since the gadolinium-related risks for NSF were reported. Investigators found no NSF-related symptoms in the study patients, including patients with renal impairment who were followed up approximately 3 months later. This is consistent with retrospective analyses of gadobutrol use in renal impaired patients, which found no cases of NSF within a longer follow-up duration. An ongoing prospective study (Safety of Gadovist in Renally Impaired Patients, "GRIP"; NCT00828737) evaluating the safety of gadobutrol in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment over a 2-year follow up will further contribute to understanding the risk of NSF.

One case of fatal anaphylactic shock was assessed to be related to administration of gadobutrol. To place this event in perspective, pharmacovigilance data that included 12.67 million gadobutrol administrations reported 17 deaths possibly related to gadobutrol (1.34 deaths per million doses). This estimated death rate is within the range previously reported for GBCA use in the USA (0.15–2.7 deaths per million doses). These data indicate that lethal reactions to gadolinium-based contrast agents are very rare.

Further conclusions from the GARDIAN study are that the ADRs associated with gadobutrol used in the approved dose range are unrelated to dose or medical indication. Females had a slightly higher rate of ADRs than males (0.9% versus 0.6%), as reported previously for gadobutrol in a large review of patients from observational trials and which has been reported for other CM including iodinated agents.

### MRI in multiple sclerosis: an intra-individual, randomized and multicentric comparison of gadobutrol with gadoterate meglumine at 3 T [^112pcX1H]. European Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare contrast effects of gadobutrol with gadoterate meglumine for brain MRI in multiple sclerosis (MS) in a multicentre, randomized, prospective, intraindividual study at 3 T.

Methods

Institutional review board approval was obtained. Patients with known or suspected active MS lesions were included. Two identical MRIs were performed using randomized contrast agent order. Four post-contrast T1 sequences were acquired (start time points 0, 3, 6 and 9 min). If no enhancing lesion was present in first MRI, second MRI was cancelled. Quantitative (number and signal intensity of enhancing lesions) and qualitative parameters (time points of first and all lesions enhancing; subjective preference regarding contrast enhancement and lesion delineation; global preference) were evaluated blinded.

Results

Seventy-four patients (male, 26; mean age, 35 years) were enrolled in three centres. In 45 patients enhancing lesions were found. Number of enhancing lesions increased over time for both contrast agents without significant difference (median 2 for both). Lesions signal intensity was significantly higher for gadobutrol (p < 0.05 at time points 3, 6 and 9 min). Subjective preference rating showed non-significant tendency in favour of gadobutrol.

Conclusion

Both gadobutrol and gadoterate meglumine can be used for imaging of acute inflammatory MS lesions. However, gadobutrol generates higher lesion SI.

Key Points

Contrast-enhanced MRI plays a key role in the management of multiple sclerosis. Different gadolinium-based contrast agents are available. Number of visibly enhancing lesions increases over time after contrast injection. Gadobutrol and gadoterate meglumine do not differ in number of visible lesions. Gadobutrol generates higher signal intensity than gadoterate meglumine.

### Safety of gadobutrol: results from 42 clinical phase II to IV studies and postmarketing surveillance after 29 million applications [^111c85Vz]. Investigative Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Gadobutrol is a well-tolerated macrocyclic GBCA with higher relaxivity and higher concentration, which has a good safety profile as shown from results of 42 clinical phase II to IV studies and postmarketing surveillance over 17 years and more than 29 million applications.

### Gadobutrol in renally impaired patients: results of the GRIP study [^111JvaUr]. Investigative Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Finally, it is important to note that the FDAand the European Medicines Agencyhave defined risk categories for GBCAs. Gadobutrol, as well as the 2 other macrocyclic GBCAs, gadoterate meglumine and gadoteridol, belong to the class with the lowest risk for NSF development. Also, the European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR) followed those categories in their recommendations. The ESUR classified macrocyclic agents as "low risk" but still recommends that they should be used with caution in patients with CKD 4 and 5 (GFR < 30 mL/min per 1.73 m 2), and there should be at least 7 days between 2 injections. Furthermore, pregnant women should only be imaged with contrast-enhanced MRI if the expected diagnostic information is essential. However, laboratory testing of renal function (eGFR) is not mandatory, and the ESUR Contrast Medium Safety Committee guidelines state that a questionnaire on renal function should be sufficient. On May 23, 2007, the FDA mandated a boxed warning on the product labeling of all GBCAs.

There are several limitations to our study that need to be taken into account when interpreting the results. Although we followed the FDA's stipulations, the sample size must be considered as a major limitation. In a letter dated June 2, 2011, the FDA stated that "the estimate of the incidence of NSF in patients with renal insufficiency, based on postmarketing surveillance reports, is lower than the original literature-based estimate". Therefore, the trial's sample size became inadequate to assess the magnitude of NSF risk of GBCAs in patients with renal insufficiency. We stopped enrollment on December 31, 2012, but still conducted the 2-year follow-up.

The second limitation is related to the concomitant application of other GBCAs during the course of the study. However, we consider it reassuring that none of these patients developed signs of NSF.

Because the FDA asked all manufacturers of GBCAs marketed in the United States to run similar studies, further reports on other GBCAs are expected to be published soon. Once all results are available, we suggest that a final assessment of the impact of GBCA administration on NSF development should be performed.

### Off-label intrathecal use of gadobutrol: safety study and comparison of administration protocols [^1161dzqf]. Neuroradiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents have been used off-label for diagnosis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks and lately also for assessment of the glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatic drainage. The purpose of this study was to further evaluate the short- and long-term safety profile of intrathecal MRI contrast agents.

Methods

In this prospective study, we compared the safety profile of different administration protocols of intrathecal gadobutrol (Gadovist TM; 1.0 mmol/ml). Gadobutrol was administered intrathecal in a dose of 0.5 mmol, with or without iodixanol (Visipaque TM 270 mg I/ml; 3 ml). In addition, a subgroup was given intrathecal gadobutrol in a dose of 0.25 mmol. Adverse events were assessed at 1 to 3 days, 4 weeks, and after 12 months.

Results

Among the 149 patients, no serious adverse events were seen in patients without history of prior adverse events. The combination of gadobutrol with iodixanol did not increase the occurrence of non-serious adverse events after days 1–3. Intrathecal gadobutrol in a dose of 0.25 mmol caused less severity of nausea, as compared with the dose of 0.5 mmol. The clinical diagnosis was the major determinant for occurrence of non-serious adverse events after intrathecal gadobutrol.

Conclusion

This prospective study showed that intrathecal administration of gadobutrol in a dose of 0.5 mmol is safe. Non-serious adverse events were to a lesser degree affected by the administration protocols, though preliminary data are given that side effects of intrathecal gadobutrol are dose-dependent.

### Safety of gadobutrol in more than 1, 000 pediatric patients: subanalysis of the GARDIAN study, a global multicenter prospective non-interventional study [^113b58it]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Outcome measures

Patient data (demographics, medical data, safety parameters, treatment signs and symptoms) were documented by the treating physician, nurse or other eligible person during the MR visit. Details on the contrast medium intravenous injection (dose, amount and flow rate) and physician assessment of contrast quality were also recorded.

ADRs and SAEs were the primary study outcomes. The rates, quality and symptoms of AEs and ADRs were recorded over approximately 1 day from the administration of gadobutrol and were coded using the standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA, version 13.0). AEs were defined as any undesirable outcomes that occurred during or after administration of gadobutrol, while ADRs were AEs that were considered by the treating physician to be attributable to gadobutrol administration. The categorization and severity of AEs and ADRs were based on the judgment of the treating physician. Secondary safety outcomes included ADR rates analyzed by the gadobutrol dose administered and by medical indication.

To monitor patients at high risk for NSF in this observational trial, a set of questions was provided to investigators to assess the children's precise renal conditions. Any skin reactions suggestive of NSF were compulsorily followed up by investigators as AEs.

The image quality was rated subjectively by investigators on a four-point scale (poor, moderate, good or excellent).

Statistical analyses

Descriptive analyses were performed on non-missing continuous (median, mean, standard deviation, maxima and minima, upper and lower quartiles) and categorical data (frequency tables).

Event rates for AEs and ADRs in children were calculated as a proportion of the pediatric study population. All enrolled subjects who were administered at least 1 dose of gadobutrol were included in the safety population. Only patients who underwent an MRI/MR angiography scan were included in the efficacy population. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

### Pharmacokinetics and safety of gadobutrol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in pediatric patients [^113EAApL]. Investigative Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

This clinical study investigated the pharmacokinetics and safety of gadobutrol, a magnetic resonance (MR) imaging extracellular contrast agent, in pediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years.

Materials and Methods

In this open-label, multicenter study, patients scheduled for routine contrast-enhanced MR imaging of the brain, spine, liver or kidney, or MR angiography received a single intravenous injection of gadobutrol (0.1 mmol/kg/0.1 mL/kg). Patients were stratified by age groups (2–6, 7–11, and 12–17 years). Blood and urine samples were collected at prespecified time points and analyzed for gadolinium concentrations. Plasma data were evaluated by means of a nonlinear mixed effects model, and urine data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. In addition, the safety of gadobutrol was evaluated.

Results

A total of 130 patients (2–6 years, n = 45; 7–11 years, n = 39; 12–17 years, n = 46) were included in the final population pharmacokinetic analysis. Gadobutrol pharmacokinetics in children aged 2 to 17 years were adequately described by an open 2-compartment model with elimination from the central compartment. The median estimates (2.5th percentile, 97.5th percentile) of body weight-normalized total body clearance (L/h/kg) per age group were 0.10 (0.05, 0.17) for all ages, 0.13 (0.09, 0.17) in the 2 to 6 year age group, 0.10 (0.05, 0.17) in the 7 to 11 year age group and 0.09 (0.05, 0.10) in the 12 to 17 year age group. The body weight-normalized median estimates of total volume of distribution (L/kg) were 0.20 (0.12, 0.28) for all ages, 0.24 (0.20, 0.28) in the 2 to 6 year age group, 0.19 (0.14, 0.23) in the 7 to 11 year age group and 0.18 (0.092, 0.23) in the 12 to 17 year age group. Median gadolinium plasma concentrations at 20 minutes postinjection were simulated using the population pharmacokinetic model and ranged from 414 (13 kg subject) to 518 micromol/L (65 kg subject). Body weight was identified as the major covariate influencing the pharmacokinetic parameters of total body clearance and central volume of distribution. Age was not found to be an additional independent parameter. The median amount of renally excreted gadolinium was 77.0% of the administered dose within 6 hours postinjection, indicating that gadobutrol was renally excreted in this pediatric population aged 2 to 17 years. Gadobutrol was well tolerated, with drug-related adverse events of mild intensity reported for 8 (5.8%) of 138 patients.

Conclusions

Observed differences in pharmacokinetics were attributed to body weight, with no additional independent effect of age. Thus, no dose adjustment from the standard dose of gadobutrol in adults based on body weight (0.1 mmol/kg) is necessary in pediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years. Gadobutrol was safe and well tolerated in the pediatric population in this study.

### Gadobutrol for contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in elderly patients: review of the safety profile from clinical trial, post-marketing surveillance, and pharmacovigilance data [^115DSM5F]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the safety of gadobutrol administration in elderly patients (≥ 65 years) by comparing the incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) following gadobutrol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures in elderly patients with that in adults aged 18–64 years.

Materials and Methods

Safety data on gadobutrol administration from clinical trials, post-marketing surveillance (PMS) studies, and pharmacovigilance reports were collected in three databases. In each dataset, absolute and relative frequencies of ADRs between age groups were analysed, along with odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Logistic regression was used to identify significant influencing factors on ADRs in the PMS and pharmacovigilance data.

Results

Rates of reported ADRs were lower in elderly patients versus adults aged < 65 years due to a reduced incidence of non-serious ADRs; this was statistically significant for the clinical trials and pharmacovigilance populations, with a trend in the PMS database. Serious ADRs occurred infrequently in the clinical trials and PMS populations (too low for statistical comparison), and pharmacovigilance data demonstrated a low incidence (< 0.005%) in both age groups.

Conclusions

This evaluation involving three large databases demonstrated no greater incidence of ADRs following gadobutrol-enhanced MRI in elderly patients (≥ 65 years) compared with younger adults, with gadobutrol having a favourable safety profile in both age groups.

### Safety of gadobutrol in over 23, 000 patients: the GARDIAN study, a global multicentre, prospective, non-interventional study [^117YFUgv]. European Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the safety and tolerability of gadobutrol at the recommended dose in patients requiring contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging/angiography (MRI/MRA) in the routine setting.

Methods

GARDIAN prospectively enrolled 23,708 patients undergoing routine gadobutrol-enhanced MRI/MRA for approved indications at 272 study centres in Europe, Asia, North America, and Africa and monitored for adverse events.

Results

Median gadobutrol dose was 0.11 mmol/kg body weight. The overall incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) was 0.7% (n = 170 patients), with similar incidences in patients with renal impairment or cardiac disease, from different geographic regions and in different gadobutrol dose groups. Patients at risk for contrast media reaction had an ADR incidence of 2.5%. Five patients (0.02%) experienced serious adverse events, four were drug-related. One patient experienced a fatal anaphylactoid shock, assessed to be related to injection of gadobutrol. The contrast quality of gadobutrol-enhanced images was rated by treating physicians as good or excellent in 97% cases, with similar ratings in all patient subgroups and indications.

Conclusions

The GARDIAN study shows that gadobutrol at the recommended dose is well tolerated across a large, diverse patient population.

Key Points

- Gadobutrol at recommended dose shows low rates of adverse drug reactions
- Gadobutrol demonstrates a uniform safety profile across diverse patient groups
- Gadobutrol provides excellent contrast quality in routine practice.

Gadolinium-based contrast agent dosing and warnings — In summary, the administration of a GBCA via routes other than intravascular is an off-label use and that significant nervous system-related warnings are listed in the prescribing information, and specific formulations differ such that gadobutrol has the highest gadolinium concentration and the safety profile of one type is not directly applicable to another; based on published reports and reviews, physicians should stay below a gadolinium dose of 1 μmol/g brain.

Given the aforementioned relaxivity data, and the results from the phase IIb study, the objective of this study was to demonstrate that gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg is statistically not inferior to gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg for contrast-enhanced MRI of the CNS, and that it is superior to unenhanced MRI, in terms of lesion visualization.

### Efficacy and safety of gadopiclenol for contrast-enhanced MRI of the central nervous system: the PICTURE randomized clinical trial [^113smAij]. Investigative Radiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Statistical Methods

Based on the phase IIb study results, and taking into account a possible greater heterogeneity of patient population to be included and a patient dropout rate of 20%, an enrollment of 250 patients was deemed necessary for the 95% confidence interval (CI) lower limit to exceed the noninferiority margin set to −0.35 (10% of the expected mean score).

Differences in terms of lesions visualization were analyzed using a general linear model. Lesion visualization parameter was the dependent variable; contrast agent, period (ie, first or second MRI; for noninferiority analysis), and MRI modality (for superiority analysis) were the fixed factors; and patient was the random factor. A paired t test was used for statistical analyses of the primary criteria. To conclude on the superiority of gadopiclenol paired over pre images, the difference in mean scores had to be significantly greater than 0 for at least 2 of 3 readers and for all 3 parameters (type 1 error set at 0.025). The analysis was performed on patients who had both pre and paired images with gadopiclenol assessable for at least 1 matching lesion for at least 1 off-site reader (full analysis set). The noninferiority of gadopiclenol toward gadobutrol could be concluded if the lower limit of the 95% CI of the difference in mean scores was above the noninferiority margin (−0.35) for at least 2 of 3 readers and for all 3 parameters. The analysis was performed on patients, without major protocol deviation, who have both paired images for gadopiclenol and gadobutrol assessable for at least 1 matching lesion for at least 1 off-site reader (per-protocol set).

All secondary and subgroup analyses are considered as exploratory; therefore, no adjustment for type 1 error was performed.

Differences between contrast agents in quantitative parameters were analyzed using a general linear model. The quantitative parameter was the dependent variable; contrast agent, period, and unenhanced value (only for LBR and CNR) were the fixed factors; and patient was the random factor. Differences were tested using a t test. Diagnostic preference results were evaluated using a Wilcoxon signed rank test. Safety results were compared descriptively. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (Version 9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

### Gadobutrol [^117BKb38]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.2 Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis

GBCAs increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of gadobutrol injection among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m2) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following gadobutrol injection administration to Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC at 1–800–551–7176 or FDA (1–800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch).

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example, age > 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through laboratory testing.

Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended gadobutrol injection dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent's elimination [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### A comprehensive overview of the efficacy and safety of gadopiclenol: a new contrast agent for MRI of the CNS and body [^114r3UXt]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

The primary evaluation criteria were lesion visualization parameters (lesion border delineation, internal morphology, and contrast enhancement) assessed by 3 independent blinded readers, using a 4-point scoring system. The study showed that contrast-enhanced MRI with gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg was noninferior to that with gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg, for all lesion visualization parameters and all 3 readers (lower limit of the 95% confidence interval [CI] of the difference ≥ −0.06, above the noninferiority margin [−0.35], P < 0.0001).

No meaningful differences were noted in the total number of lesions detected with gadopiclenol as compared with gadobutrol.

The objective quantitative measurements in the PICTURE study demonstrated overall higher values with gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg as compared with gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg. The LBR and the percentage of contrast enhancement were significantly higher with gadopiclenol for all 3 readers, and the CNR was significantly higher with gadopiclenol for 2 of the 3 readers. Images with gadopiclenol at 0.05 mmol/kg were also in majority preferred to images with gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg (44.8% to 57.3% of images).

### A comprehensive overview of the efficacy and safety of gadopiclenol: a new contrast agent for MRI of the CNS and body [^113mUCCe]. Investigative Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES

The new GBCA, gadopiclenol, is distinguished by its high relaxivity and strong stability. It was developed in response to the medical need of reducing the administered dose of gadolinium, to minimize potential risks associated with gadolinium exposure, while maintaining a high level of diagnostic efficacy.

The 2 pivotal phase III studies performed with gadopiclenol for MRI of the CNS (PICTURE) and other body regions (PROMISE) showed that the diagnostic efficacy of gadopiclenol at half the standard dose used with other GBCAs (ie, 0.05 mmol/kg) can be at least as good as that of gadobutrol at 0.1 mmol/kg. The results of the pediatric studyindicate that the pharmacokinetic profile of gadopiclenol in pediatric patients aged 2 to 17 years and adults is comparable. Therefore, extrapolation from adult efficacy data is appropriate, and no dose adjustment is needed in this patient population other than per body weight.

The results from the phase IIb study indicated that gadopiclenol at a dose of 0.1 mmol/kg provides significantly higher contrast enhancement of lesions compared with gadobenate dimeglumine at the same dosage. These findings suggest that gadopiclenol, when used at 0.1 mmol/kg, has the potential to detect lesions that may be overlooked with other GBCAs. Yet, further studies are needed to evaluate the potential clinical benefits of using gadopiclenol at this dose, particularly in the detection of brain metastases.

The safety analysis performed on 1047 participants showed that gadopiclenol has a favorable safety profile, comparable to that observed with other GBCAs. The most common ADRs with gadopiclenol were injection site reactions, headache, and nausea. Overall, no significant changes were observed in hematology and biochemistry values, vital signs, and ECG data. No significant safety concerns were identified in pediatric and elderly patients, as well as in patients with renal impairment. These finding will be confirmed in real-world clinical settings.

### Safety of gadobutrol in more than 1, 000 pediatric patients: subanalysis of the GARDIAN study, a global multicenter prospective non-interventional study [^116KE6Jt]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Gadobutrol (Gd-DO3A-butrol, Gadovist®, Gadavist®; Bayer Pharma, Leverkusen, Germany) is a second-generation gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA) used to enhance tissue contrast in MRI for a range of approved indications in adults and children of all ages. Gadobutrol recently (January 2015) received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in MRI of the central nervous system in children younger than 2 years, and gadobutrol is approved in many other countries, including those in the European Union (EU), for whole-body MRI in this age group.

Gadobutrol is an extracellular non-ionic macrocyclic paramagnetic contrast agent that is uniquely formulated at 1.0 mmol/ml, i.e. twice the gadolinium concentration of other currently licensed GBCAs. Combined with its high relaxivity, gadobutrol provides the highest T1-shortening effect per milliliter compared with conventional GBCAs, which contributes to an increase in signal intensity. The more compact bolus shape permitted by the higher (1 M) gadolinium concentration is associated with enhanced image quality in faster imaging techniques. The macrocyclic structure of gadobutrol provides greater stability of the chelate and reduced release of gadolinium ions compared with linear GBCAs. Release of gadolinium ions has been associated with the development of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in people with impaired renal function. In view of these characteristics, gadobutrol has been placed by the American College of Radiology, European Medicines Agency (EMA), and the European Society of Urogenital Radiology in the lowest risk category for development of NSF.

Distribution

After intravenous administration, gadobutrol is rapidly distributed in the extracellular space. After a gadobutrol dose of 0.1 mmol/kg body weight, an average level of 0.59 mmol gadobutrol/L was measured in plasma 2 minutes after the injection and 0.3 mmol gadobutrol/L 60 minutes after the injection. Gadobutrol does not display any particular protein binding. Following GBCA administration, gadolinium is present for months or years in brain, bone, skin, and other organs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Elimination

Values for AUC, body weight normalized plasma clearance and half-life are given in Table 4, below.

Gadobutrol is excreted in an unchanged form via the kidneys. In healthy subjects, renal clearance of gadobutrol is 1.1 to 1.7 mL/(min∙kg) and thus comparable to the renal clearance of inulin, confirming that gadobutrol is eliminated by glomerular filtration.

Within two hours after intravenous administration more than 50% and within 12 hours more than 90% of the given dose is eliminated via the urine. Extra-renal elimination is negligible.

Gender

Gender has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of gadobutrol.

Geriatric

A single IV dose of 0.1 mmol/kg Gadavist was administered to 15 elderly and 16 non-elderly subjects. AUC was slightly higher and clearance slightly lower in elderly subjects as compared to non-elderly subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)].

Pediatric

The pharmacokinetics of gadobutrol were evaluated in two studies in a total of 130 patients age 2 to less than 18 years and in 43 patients less than 2 years of age (including term neonates). Patients received a single intravenous dose of 0.1 mmol/kg of Gadavist. The pharmacokinetic profile of gadobutrol in pediatric patients is similar to that in adults, resulting in similar values for AUC, body weight normalized plasma clearance, as well as elimination half-life. Approximately 99% (median value) of the dose was recovered in urine within 6 hours (this information was derived from the 2 to less than 18 year old age group).

10 OVERDOSAGE

The maximum dose of Gadavist tested in healthy volunteers, 1.5 mL/kg body weight (1.5 mmol/kg; 15 times the recommended dose), was tolerated in a manner similar to lower doses. Gadavist can be removed by hemodialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### ESR essentials: gadolinium-wise MRI-practice recommendations by the European society for magnetic resonance in medicine and biology [^112fYq9b]. European Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Key recommendations

For safety procedures regarding the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) refer to ESUR-CMSC guidelines. Thinking beyond single-patient safety, the choice of intravenous injection of GBCA in radiology should also incorporate MRI cost-effectiveness, MRI access to the patient community, and impact on the environment. Multi-society joint statements and cooperative actions are recommended to increase awareness of the consequences of inefficient use of GBCA (evidence level: low — expert opinions and recommendations exist; in vitro research is available, but further investigation is necessary).
The use of GBCAs is justified only when appropriate or when it can potentially influence clinical decisions, based on the patient's history and pre-MRI clinical assessment (evidence level: moderate — several recommendations exist, but further research is necessary to increase confidence).
GBCA standard dose is 0.1 mmol/kg body weight for most applications of gadobutrol, gadoterate meglumine, and gadoteridol; 0.05 mmol/kg body weight for liver imaging using gadobenate dimeglumine, and 0.025 mmol/kg body weight for liver imaging using gadoxetate disodium. Dose optimization is recommended, as administering a lower-than-standard dose can still provide equally effective diagnostic information. Virtual contrast-enhancement with zero-dose is unlikely to reflect pharmacokinetic events (evidence level: moderate — further research is necessary and lowering the dose can still affect diagnostic yield under specific circumstances).
Next-generation GBCAs have been developed to show higher kinetic stability and higher T1 relaxivity when compared with standard macrocyclic GBCAs. The additional benefit of these features is that comparable diagnostic efficacy is obtained with a lower (0.05 mmol/kg for gadopiclenol and 0.04 mmol/kg for gadoquatrane) than the current standard dose (evidence level: moderate — results of controlled phase III clinical trials are available).

### Safety of gadobutrol in more than 1, 000 pediatric patients: subanalysis of the GARDIAN study, a global multicenter prospective non-interventional study [^112d879P]. Pediatric Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

GARDIAN is a non-interventional MRI study that has provided the largest analysis of safety and tolerability for the routine use of gadobutrol in clinical practice. As observed in adults enrolled in GARDIAN, gadobutrol was very well tolerated in children, with low rates of AEs (0.7%) and ADRs (0.5%), and no SAEs. Rates of AEs and ADRs were unrelated to gadobutrol weight-adjusted dose and age in the pediatric population. The contrast quality of gadobutrol-enhanced images was good or excellent in almost all children (97.8%), similar to the main study population.

The incidence of ADRs in children was slightly lower than in the main GARDIAN study (0.5% vs. 0.7%). This is consistent with a lower rate of contrast medium reactions in children compared with adults in the large retrospective analyses by Dillman et al. and Davenport et al. A prospective open-label study of gadobutrol conducted by Hahn et al. in 138 children ages 2–17 years reported an ADR incidence of 5.8% during a 1-week follow-up, with the lowest rates reported in the younger age group (2–6 years, 2.2%). The higher ADR incidence in the Hahn et al. study compared with the current observational study may be attributed to its design as a controlled phase I/III study that included a longer follow-up duration, pre-defined in the study protocol. In an observational study like the GARDIAN study, mostly acute reactions are captured because no additional interventions, e.g. laboratory value analyses, are possible to uncover other potential AEs. It can be assumed that the ADR rate of gadobutrol in the GARDIAN study reflects the rate of allergy-like reactions. This contributes toward the lower rate of AEs in children in general and as compared to randomized clinical trials. Consistent with the current study, low AE rates have been reported for other GBCAs including gadodiamide, gadopentetate dimeglumine, gadobenate, dimeglumine, gadoteridol and gadoversetamide in children.

### Safety of gadobutrol: results from 42 clinical phase II to IV studies and postmarketing surveillance after 29 million applications [^1143mcUC]. Investigative Radiology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to provide a systematic safety analysis of gadobutrol after more than 29 million applications in clinical routine.

Materials and Methods

Forty-two clinical development phase II to IV studies on gadobutrol or comparator and the postmarketing safety surveillance database for gadobutrol (1998–2015) were analyzed. Adverse events (AEs) and drug-related AEs were evaluated in the clinical development database and spontaneous adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the postmarketing database. Subgroup analyses were run on patients with special medical history and on patients of different age groups.

Results

In the clinical development studies, 6809 and 2184 patients received gadobutrol or comparators, respectively. The incidence of drug-related AEs was 3.5% for both groups. With the exception of nausea (0.7% related cases in both groups), all other drug-related AEs were 0.3% or less in both groups. Hypersensitivity reactions were sporadic (< 0.1%). Patients with history of allergies to contrast agents experienced slightly more drug-related AEs. No differences were seen between age groups.

The overall reporting rate of ADRs from postmarketing surveillance was 0.05%. The most frequent ADRs were anaphylactoid/hypersensitivity reactions, nausea, vomiting, and dyspnea.

For 3 single-agent reports of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, using a conservative approach, association with gadobutrol could not be excluded.

Conclusions

Gadobutrol is well tolerated and has a favorable safety profile for patients of all age groups.

### Value of 1.0-M gadolinium chelates: review of preclinical and clinical data on gadobutrol [^114c6Ja9]. European Radiology (2002). Low credibility.

Several preclinical and clinical studies with the first commercially available highly concentrated Gd-chelate gadobutrol (1 mol/l) are reviewed. Physicochemical, pharmacological, and pharmacokinetic properties, safety analysis, as well as experimental and clinical efficacy studies are highlighted in comparison with 0.5- M Gd-chelates. The 1-mol gadobutrol has been proven to be safe in an examined dose range from 0.04 up to 0.5 mmol/kg body weight (b.w.). Even in patients with chronic renal impairment, including hemodialysis, gadobutrol can safely be applied at doses up to 0.3 mmol/kg b.w. For contrast-enhanced MRI in the equilibrium phase, efficacy data analysis shows comparable results to other commercially available extracellular Gd-chelates with lower Gd-concentrations (0.5 M). Studies focused on the potential benefit of a tighter bolus, such as brain perfusion imaging using T2✱-effects, document the superiority of a highly concentrated Gd contrast agent. For contrast-enhanced MRA, clinical studies are still ongoing; therefore, the ultimate potential of a more compact bolus, using 1- M Gd-chelates, for contrast-enhanced MRI, has still to be analyzed, especially for time-resolved magnetic resonance angiography.

14.4 Cardiac MRI

Two studies similar in design, Study E and Study F, evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of gadobutrol injection cardiac MRI (CMRI) for detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) in adult patients with known or suspected CAD. Patients were excluded from study if they had a history of coronary artery bypass grafting, or if it was known in advance that they were unable to hold their breath, or had atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmia likely to prevent electrocardiogram-gated CMRI. The studies were multi-center, open-label, and evaluated 764 subjects for efficacy: 376 in Study E, with an average age of 59 (range 20 to 84); 69% male; 74% white, 1% black, and 25% Asian; and 388 subjects in Study F, with an average age of 59 (range 23 to 82); 61% male; 67% white, 17% black, and 12% Asian.

All subjects underwent dynamic first-pass gadobutrol injection imaging during vasodilator stress, followed ~10 minutes later by dynamic first-pass gadobutrol injection imaging at rest, followed ~5 minutes later with imaging during a period of gradual gadobutrol injection washout from the myocardium (late gadolinium enhancement, LGE). Imaging was performed on 1.5 T or 3.0 T MRI devices equipped with multichannel surface coils to support accelerated acquisitions with parallel imaging, T1-weighted, 2D gradient-echo, dynamic acquisition of perfusion with at least 3 slices per heartbeat. Gadobutrol injection was administered intravenously at a rate of ~4 mL/second as two separate bolus injections (0.05 mmol/kg each), the first at peak pharmacologic stress (~3 minutes after start of ongoing adenosine infusion, or immediately after completion of regadenoson administration, at approved doses). No additional gadobutrol injection was administered for LGE imaging.

5.2 Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis

GBCAs increase the risk for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with impaired elimination of the drugs. Avoid use of Gadavist among these patients unless the diagnostic information is essential and not available with non-contrast MRI or other modalities. The GBCA-associated NSF risk appears highest for patients with chronic, severe kidney disease (GFR < 30 mL/min/1.73m2) as well as patients with acute kidney injury. The risk appears lower for patients with chronic, moderate kidney disease (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m2) and little, if any, for patients with chronic, mild kidney disease (GFR 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2). NSF may result in fatal or debilitating fibrosis affecting the skin, muscle and internal organs. Report any diagnosis of NSF following Gadavist administration to Bayer Healthcare (1–888–842–2937) or FDA (1–800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch).

Screen patients for acute kidney injury and other conditions that may reduce renal function. Features of acute kidney injury consist of rapid (over hours to days) and usually reversible decrease in kidney function, commonly in the setting of surgery, severe infection, injury or drug-induced kidney toxicity. Serum creatinine levels and estimated GFR may not reliably assess renal function in the setting of acute kidney injury. For patients at risk for chronically reduced renal function (for example, age > 60 years, diabetes mellitus or chronic hypertension), estimate the GFR through laboratory testing.

Among the factors that may increase the risk for NSF are repeated or higher than recommended doses of a GBCA and degree of renal impairment at the time of exposure. Record the specific GBCA and the dose administered to a patient. For patients at highest risk for NSF, do not exceed the recommended Gadavist dose and allow a sufficient period of time for elimination of the drug prior to re-administration. For patients receiving hemodialysis, consider the prompt initiation of hemodialysis following the administration of a GBCA in order to enhance the contrast agent's elimination [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The usefulness of hemodialysis in the prevention of NSF is unknown [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Table 6 shows a comparison of visualization results between paired images and pre-contrast images. Gadobutrol injection provided a statistically significant improvement for each of the three lesion visualization parameters when averaged across three independent readers for each study.

Performances of gadobutrol and gadoteridol for visualization parameters were similar. Regarding the number of lesions detected, Study B met the prespecified noninferiority margin of -0.35 for paired read versus pre-contrast read while in Study A, gadobutrol and gadoteridol did not.

For the visualization endpoints contrast enhancement, border delineation, and internal morphology, the percentage of patients scoring higher for paired images compared to pre-contrast images ranged from 93% to 99% for Study A, and 95% to 97% for Study B. For both studies, the mean number of lesions detected on paired images exceeded that of the pre-contrast images; 37% for Study A and 24% for Study B. There were 29% and 11% of subjects in which the pre-contrast images detected more lesions for Study A and Study B, respectively.

The percentage of patients whose average reader mean score changed by ≤ 0, up to 1, up to 2, and ≥ 2 scoring categories presented in Table 5 is shown in Table 7. The categorical improvement of (≤ 0) represents higher (< 0) or identical (= 0) scores for the pre-contrast read, the categories with scores > 0 represent the magnitude of improvement seen for the paired read.

For both studies, the improvement of visualization endpoints in paired gadobutrol injection images compared to pre-contrast images resulted in improved assessment of normal and abnormal CNS anatomy.

Pediatric Patients

Two studies in 44 pediatric patients age younger than 2 years and 135 pediatric patients age 2 to less than 18 years with CNS and non-CNS lesions supported extrapolation of adult CNS efficacy findings. For example, comparing pre vs paired pre- and post-contrast images, investigators selected the best of four descriptors under the heading, "Visualization of lesion-internal morphology (lesion characterization) or homogeneity of vessel enhancement" for 27/44 (62% = pre) vs 43/44 (98% = paired) MR images from patients age 0 to less than 2 years and 106/135 (78% = pre) vs 108/135 (80% = paired) MR images from patients age 2 to less than 18 years.
