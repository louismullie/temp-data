## Question

In a premenopausal woman with a hip Z-score of −2.7 and no other risk factors besides well-controlled ulcerative colitis, is treatment recommended?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether treatment is recommended for a premenopausal woman with a hip Z-score of −2.7, well-controlled ulcerative colitis, and no other risk factors. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which bone density metric is appropriate in premenopausal women. Then, I should verify whether a low Z-score alone triggers pharmacologic treatment. Next, I will consider how ulcerative colitis modifies fracture risk in this age group. After that, I need to check for other clinical risk factors and secondary causes. Finally, I will outline evidence-based nonpharmacologic measures, indications (if any) for medication in this scenario, and a monitoring plan with repeat DXA and targets for follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the correct interpretation framework for BMD in a premenopausal patient. Wait, I initially thought T-scores might apply broadly, but for women under 50, Z-scores — reflecting age-matched comparisons — are the recommended metric, with Z ≤ −2.0 interpreted as "below the expected range for age", which this patient (Z −2.7) meets [^114CLE53]. Hold on, I should verify guideline nuances: ISCD emphasizes Z-scores in younger adults, whereas some IOF language has historically referenced T-scores in special contexts, so in clinical practice I will align with ISCD-use of Z-scores for premenopausal women and confirm standard measurement sites (hip and lumbar spine) and technical quality before making decisions [^117MYr9p].

> Now, does a low Z-score by itself mandate pharmacologic therapy in a premenopausal woman? I need to ensure I do not over-treat. A Z-score ≤ −2.0 flags "below expected for age", but in premenopausal patients, treatment decisions hinge on the presence of fragility fractures or a clear, treatable secondary cause of bone loss; a low Z-score alone is not a stand-alone indication for antiresorptive therapy in this population, so I should focus on evaluation and risk modification first [^114CLE53] [^111bMsST]. Next, I should review disease-specific guidance: in IBD, first-line management emphasizes calcium/vitamin D adequacy, lifestyle, remission maintenance, and glucocorticoid minimization; routine bisphosphonates for premenopausal women without fractures are not suggested in these statements, reinforcing a conservative approach here [^notfound].

> I will now examine how ulcerative colitis modifies fracture risk. UC and other inflammatory diseases carry an elevated fracture risk overall, but the magnitude for IBD is modest (OR ~1.6 vs. controls), and disease activity and steroids are key drivers; this patient's UC is well-controlled, which likely attenuates risk [^1153G4dV]. But wait, what if UC per se confers a large risk even when controlled? A population-based study in UC did not show a significant increase in fractures versus matched controls, highlighting heterogeneity and the importance of individual risk profiles; this supports not assuming high risk solely from a UC diagnosis when inflammation is quiescent [^112ToQmt]. Let me also check premenopausal cohorts: contemporary IBD data show that among younger UC patients, BMD below the expected range for age is relatively uncommon, and population-based studies of premenopausal women with early-onset IBD have found average BMD to be normal with very low osteoporosis prevalence, which aligns with a more measured approach to therapy here [^115k3Qsz] [^1114ZsfP].

> Next, I should review other clinical risk factors and verify that none are present. The case states "no other risk factors", but I should double-check steroid exposure duration, menstrual history for hypogonadism/amenorrhea, BMI/weight loss, smoking, alcohol, malabsorption, and family fracture history, because these would shift management toward treatment or more intensive monitoring if present [^112dSBBR]. I need to ensure secondary causes are not being missed: abnormal BMD in younger patients warrants a directed workup — basic chemistries including calcium and creatinine, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, TSH, and if indicated PTH — to exclude conditions such as vitamin D deficiency and primary hyperparathyroidism; correcting deficiencies is part of care and is specifically encouraged in IBD where vitamin D deficiency is common [^114CLE53] [^113jwu3i].

> Let me consider first-line nonpharmacologic management, which is foundational. I should confirm adequate calcium intake (about 1000 mg/day for younger adults, through diet plus supplements as needed) and vitamin D (typically 400–800 IU/day, titrated to achieve sufficient serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D), reinforce regular weight-bearing and resistance exercise, and counsel on smoking cessation and alcohol moderation; in IBD specifically, maintaining remission and minimizing glucocorticoids are central to bone protection [^112dSBBR]. I should also verify disease control and nutrition are optimized per IBD nutrition guidance in remission, adjusting diet if clinical issues persist, while recognizing that overall healthy dietary patterns are advised rather than disease-specific bone regimens [^113e7eBG].

> Hold on, let's not jump to pharmacologic therapy unless the risk-benefit is clear. In premenopausal women without fragility fractures, routine bisphosphonate initiation is generally avoided; therapy may be considered if there is a documented secondary cause leading to ongoing bone loss that cannot be corrected, or if fragility fractures occur, but that is not this case as presented; moreover, in IBD statements, bisphosphonates are emphasized mainly in older adults or in the context of glucocorticoid prophylaxis rather than for younger women with isolated low Z-scores [^112dSBBR] [^111bMsST]. I should confirm there is no hypogonadism; if present, hormonal replacement for the underlying endocrine issue may be appropriate per IBD endocrine guidance, but in an otherwise eumenorrheic premenopausal woman with UC in remission and no fractures, I would not start antiresorptives now [^112dSBBR].

> I should double-check measurement and monitoring strategy. First, verify DXA technical quality, consider adding a spine measurement if not already done, and avoid forearm in settings of local bone loss confounders; ensure interpretation uses Z-scores in this age group and recognize that FRAX is calibrated for older adults and is not validated for premenopausal women, so I should not rely on FRAX here [^117MYr9p]. For follow-up, if secondary causes are addressed and nonpharmacologic measures optimized, I would repeat DXA after a reasonable interval to document stability — practically often in 1–2 years for an abnormal result in a younger patient — while noting that when BMD is normal, some guidance suggests 2–3 year intervals; individualized timing based on risk and clinical course is appropriate [^114CLE53] [^117MYr9p].

> Putting this together, my plan is: 1) confirm the premenopausal Z-score framework and that the hip Z −2.7 is "below expected for age", 2) perform a targeted secondary cause workup and correct abnormalities (especially vitamin D), 3) optimize lifestyle measures, disease control, and minimize glucocorticoids, 4) defer antiresorptive therapy absent fragility fracture or uncorrectable secondary cause, and 5) arrange follow-up DXA to ensure stability, adjusting cadence to clinical risk; this aligns with IBD-focused bone health recommendations and the general premenopausal bone care approach [^114CLE53] [^112dSBBR] [^113jwu3i] [^117MYr9p] [^115k3Qsz].

Pharmacologic treatment is not recommended for a premenopausal woman with a hip Z-score of -2.7 and only well-controlled ulcerative colitis as a risk factor. Current guidelines **advise against pharmacologic therapy** in premenopausal women without fragility fractures or ongoing glucocorticoid use, even with low BMD. Instead, **implement lifestyle measures** (weight-bearing exercise, calcium/vitamin D, smoking/alcohol avoidance) [^112dSBBR], reassess BMD in 1–2 years, and treat only if fractures occur or new risk factors emerge.

---

## Clinical significance of Z-score -2.7 in premenopausal women

In premenopausal women, a Z-score ≤ -2.0 is "below the expected range for age" but **does not alone indicate osteoporosis** or mandate pharmacologic therapy [^111bMsST]. Low BMD without fragility fractures or ongoing glucocorticoid use typically reflects low peak bone mass [^111bMsST] rather than high fracture risk.

---

## Impact of ulcerative colitis on bone health

Ulcerative colitis is associated with an **increased risk of osteoporosis**, driven by chronic inflammation, corticosteroid exposure, malabsorption, and nutritional deficits [^115k3Qsz]. When the disease is well controlled with minimal corticosteroid exposure and adequate nutrition, bone-loss risk is lower than during active disease.

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

- **Pharmacologic therapy**: Not recommended in premenopausal women with low BMD unless there are fragility fractures or ongoing glucocorticoid use.

- **Lifestyle measures**: Emphasize weight-bearing exercise, adequate calcium/vitamin D, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, and fall prevention [^112dSBBR].

- **Monitoring**: Repeat DXA in 1–2 years to track BMD and reassess risk.

---

## Evidence from clinical studies

Population data indicate **no significant increase in overall or osteoporotic fractures** in UC compared with controls, particularly when the disease is well controlled [^112ToQmt]. Evidence supporting pharmacologic therapy in premenopausal women without fractures or glucocorticoid exposure is limited, and the risks may outweigh the benefits.

---

## Potential risks and benefits of pharmacologic treatment

Pharmacologic therapy may increase BMD and reduce fractures in high-risk patients, such as those with fragility fractures or ongoing glucocorticoid use [^114wUxoj]. However, risks include atypical femur fractures, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and unknown reproductive effects; thus, **caution is advised in premenopausal women**.

---

## Recommended management approach

Given this profile (Z-score -2.7, well-controlled UC, no other risk factors), the **recommended approach** is:

- **Lifestyle interventions**: Weight-bearing/resistance exercise, calcium 1000–1200 mg/day, vitamin D 800–1000 IU/day, smoking cessation, alcohol moderation, and fall prevention [^112dSBBR].

- **Monitoring**: Repeat DXA in 1–2 years; initiate pharmacologic therapy only if fragility fractures occur or new risk factors develop.

- **UC management**: Maintain remission and minimize corticosteroid exposure to reduce bone loss risk [^112dSBBR].

---

Pharmacologic therapy is **not indicated** for a premenopausal woman with a hip Z-score of -2.7 and only well-controlled UC; prioritize lifestyle measures and monitoring, and treat only if fractures occur or new risk factors arise.

Diagnosis and evaluation

Osteoporosis can be diagnosed either when there is a history or evidence of fragility fractures (regardless of BMD), or according to the BMD as measured by DXA. The American Gastroenterological Association recommends DXA screening of IBD patients with one or more risk factors for osteoporosis and fractures: history of previous fragility fracture, postmenopausal status, male > 50 years, corticosteroid therapy for more than 3 months, or hypogonadism. The British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) recommends DXA screening of IBD patients with continuing active disease, weight loss > 10%, body mass index < 20, age > 70 years, or those on corticosteroids for more than 3 months.

BMD can be expressed as the number of standard deviations (SD) above or below either the mean BMD for young adults (T-score) or the mean BMD for age-matched controls (Z-score). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), osteoporosis in peri- and post-menopausal women or men > 50 years of age can be defined as a T-score at the spine or hip of < -2.5 SD. A T-score between -1 and -2.5 is defined as osteopenia. For premenopausal women or men < 50, however, Z-scores, not T-scores, should be used; a Z-score ≤ -2.0 should be interpreted as "below the expected range for age". If BMD is within the normal range, DXA should be repeated in 2–3 years. In patients with abnormal BMD measurements, further clinical and laboratory evaluation is required to exclude secondary causes of osteoporosis, such as primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Endocrine and metabolic manifestations in inflammatory bowel disease [^112dSBBR]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The main treatment aim is prevention of fractures. All patients should receive lifestyle advice on prevention of falls, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, avoidance of excess alcohol intake and smoking cessation, as well as regular weight-bearing exercise. An attempt should be made to control the underlying disease and maintain remission. If necessary, calcium and vitamin D supplements should be prescribed to ensure a daily calcium intake of 1000 mg in younger patients and 1200–1500 mg in postmenopausal women and men over 55, along with a daily vitamin D intake of 400–800 IU. Larger amounts of vitamins and calcium may be necessary in patients with Crohn's Disease (CD) and extensive small bowel disease.

Hypogonadal patients should receive hormone replacement. Premenopausal women with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and amenorrhea are usually treated with combined estrogen-progestin replacement, such as an oral contraceptive pill or transdermal estradiol plus oral progestin administered cyclically. Because glucocorticoids (GCs) may cause hypogonadism by suppressing gonadotrophins, men who are on long-term GC treatment should have periodic assessments of their morning serum testosterone and gonadotrophins and should be put on testosterone replacement if they become hypogonadal. GC use should be minimized when possible by using alternative therapies, such as appropriate and early use of immunomodulators, budesonide, elemental or polymeric diet, or surgery for resistant disease. All IBD patients receiving GCs should be given calcium and vitamin D supplements. Bisphosphonate prophylaxis should be used for those over 65 years old at the commencement of GC therapy.

- **Clinical studies**: Most prospective studies of efficacy for osteoporosis have been conducted primarily in white menopausal women without stratification by other risk factors. These studies generally show a universally positive effect on bone. A two-year, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging study demonstrated that treatment with 0.5 mg of estradiol daily for 23 days (of a 28-day cycle) prevents vertebral bone mass loss in postmenopausal women. When estrogen therapy is discontinued, bone mass declines at a rate comparable to the immediate postmenopausal period. Notably, there is no evidence that estrogen replacement therapy restores bone mass to premenopausal levels.

- **Women's Health Initiative studies**: The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled a total of 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women to assess the risks and benefits of either the use of oral 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens (CE) per day alone or the use of oral 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) per day compared to placebo in preventing certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), which included nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death, with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome studied. A "global index" was used, incorporating the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. The study did not evaluate the effects of CE or CE/MPA on menopausal symptoms.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^114wPvom]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for ulcerative colitis, particularly in the context of follow-up, AGA 2023 guidelines recommend considering endoscopic assessment of disease activity. This approach is preferable to implementing empiric treatment adjustments in patients with UC who exhibit mild symptoms and have normal stool or serum markers of inflammation (fecal calprotectin < 150 mcg/g, normal fecal lactoferrin, normal CRP).

### Medroxyprogesterone acetate [^112JN6ad]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Studies enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies. These aimed to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) (0.625 mg) alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (2.5 mg) compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), silent MI, and CHD death, with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE-alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms.

- **WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy**: The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the "global index". The absolute excess risk of events included in the "global index" was 19 per 10,000 women-years.

For outcomes in the WHI "global index" that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers. Meanwhile, the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years included 6 fewer colorectal cancer cases.

- **Pregnancy**:

	- **Risk summary**: Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see data). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see clinical considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with the administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.8 and 2.9 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see data).

	- **Estimated background risk**: The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriages in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**:

	- **Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk**: Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.

- **Data**:

	- **Human data**: Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy.

### Lack of relationship of calcium and vitamin D intake to bone mineral density in premenopausal women with inflammatory bowel disease [^114JpUVn]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Low bone mineral density has been widely reported in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The exact etiology of this condition is not completely understood but is suggested to be multifactorial, possibly including low calcium and vitamin D intake. The objective of this study was to assess calcium and vitamin D intake and its relationship to bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women with IBD.

- **Methods**: A total of 70 premenopausal women with IBD (mean age 33.3 years, range 18–44 years), drawn from the population-based University of Manitoba IBD Research Registry, participated in the study. Calcium and vitamin D intake was determined using a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire and compared to the Dietary Reference Intake values for adequacy. BMD of total body, lumbar spine, femoral neck, and hip was measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry.

- **Results**: Of the 70 subjects, 66 successfully completed the study. Inadequate calcium intake (< 1000 mg/day) was found in 69.7% of the subjects. This low intake group had a mean calcium intake of 508 mg/day. Inadequate vitamin D intake (< 200 IU/day) was found in 53% of the subjects, with a mean vitamin D intake of 76 IU/day in this group. Calcium and vitamin D intake correlated with each other (R² = 0.57, p < 0.00001). Daily calcium intake was not significantly different for subjects with T scores greater than -1 (901 mg) and subjects with T scores less than -1 (875 mg, p = 0.44). Daily vitamin D intake was not significantly different for subjects with T scores greater than -1 (297 IU) compared with subjects below that threshold.

### Hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons: US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation statement [^114cs6Gh]. JAMA (2022). High credibility.

Menopause is defined as the cessation of a person's menstrual cycle and is identified retrospectively, 12 months after the final menstrual period. Perimenopause, or the menopausal transition, is the few-year time period preceding a person's final menstrual period. It is characterized by increasing menstrual cycle length variability, periods of amenorrhea, and often symptoms such as vasomotor dysfunction. The prevalence and incidence of most chronic diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and fracture) increase with age. US persons who reach menopause are expected to live more than another 30 years on average.

The objective of this recommendation is to update the 2017 guidance. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of systemic (i.e. oral or transdermal) hormone therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons, and whether outcomes vary by age or timing of intervention after menopause.

This recommendation applies to asymptomatic postmenopausal persons who are considering hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions.

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that using combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons with an intact uterus has no net benefit. Similarly, the USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that using estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal persons who have had a hysterectomy has no net benefit.

### European consensus on the diagnosis and management of iron deficiency and anaemia in inflammatory bowel diseases [^116JELBx]. Journal of Crohn's & Colitis (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for ulcerative colitis, specifically concerning the evaluation of anemia, the ECCO 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining proper surveillance in patients at risk for vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency. This is especially relevant for those with small bowel disease or resection. Measure serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid at least annually, or if macrocytosis is present in the absence of thiopurine use.

### Assessment and management of low bone density in inflammatory bowel disease and performance of professional society guidelines [^116vtya8]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients have an increased prevalence of osteoporosis, leading to guideline recommendations for bone mineral density (BMD) testing. The study aimed to identify predictors of BMD testing and treatment and assess guideline effectiveness in identifying IBD patients with osteoporosis.

- **Methods**: Records of all IBD patients at seven medical facilities were reviewed for clinical data and BMD testing from January 1996 through October 2006.

- **Results**: A total of 2,035 patients had 317 bone density tests performed. Osteopenia was found in 48% of patients, and osteoporosis in 26%. Among patients meeting guideline criteria for BMD testing and with at least one year of follow-up, 23.3% underwent testing. The strongest predictors of testing were menopause (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR] 3.02) and receiving care at a tertiary center (AHR 2.56). Testing rates were low in patients aged 60 years or older, those with ulcerative colitis, and those with a history of inpatient IBD treatment. Osteoporotic patients received calcium/vitamin D and bisphosphonates in 59% and 75% of cases, respectively. Osteoporotic males had a 37% rate of hypogonadism. Guideline criteria do not distinguish patients with osteoporosis. The criteria had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 84%, 23%, 27%, and 81% for osteoporosis in the tested population, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: Osteoporosis is highly prevalent in the IBD population, but BMD testing and osteoporosis treatments are underutilized. Male hypogonadism is common in osteoporotic IBD patients. Guidelines do not effectively identify osteoporosis in these patients.

### Delzicol [^116jJfgT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Delzicol have been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Below is a description of the results of such studies for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults and pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years, as well as the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults.

- **Treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis**:

	**Adults**: Two placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) have demonstrated the efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis. In one randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks' duration (Study 1), involving 158 patients, participants received mesalamine delayed-release doses of 1.6 grams per day (800 mg twice a day; n = 53) and 2.4 grams per day (800 mg three times a day; n = 53), compared to placebo (n = 52). The scoring system for efficacy assessment included stool frequency, rectal bleeding, sigmoidoscopic findings, patient's functional assessment, and physician global assessment. At the dosage of 2.4 grams per day, 21 of 43 (49%) patients using mesalamine delayed-release tablets showed an improvement in the sigmoidoscopic appearance of the bowel compared to 12 of 44 (27%) patients using placebo (p = 0.048).

### Provera [^113xNR6P]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral conjugated estrogens (CE) (0.625 mg) alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (2.5 mg) compared to placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), silent MI, and CHD death, with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE alone or CE plus MPA on menopausal symptoms.

- **WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy**: The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the "global index". The absolute excess risk of events included in the "global index" was 19 per 10,000 women-years.

		- For those outcomes included in the WHI "global index" that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reduction per 10,000 women-years was 6 fewer colorectal cancer cases.

### Humira [^115jLWSe]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Ulcerative colitis**:
	- **Adults**: The recommended subcutaneous dosage of Humira for adult patients with ulcerative colitis is 160 mg initially on Day 1 (given in one day or split over two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15). Two weeks later (Day 29), continue with a dosage of 40 mg every other week. Discontinue Humira in adult patients without evidence of clinical remission by eight weeks (Day 57) of therapy. Aminosalicylates and/or corticosteroids may be continued during treatment with Humira. Azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) may be continued during treatment with Humira if necessary [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

	- **Pediatrics**: The recommended subcutaneous dosage of Humira for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older with ulcerative colitis is based on body weight as shown below:

- **Plaque psoriasis or adult uveitis**: The recommended subcutaneous dosage of Humira for adult patients with plaque psoriasis (Ps) or uveitis (UV) is an initial dose of 80 mg, followed by 40 mg given every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The use of Humira in moderate to severe chronic Ps beyond one year has not been evaluated in controlled clinical studies.

- **Hidradenitis suppurativa**:
	- **Adults**: The recommended subcutaneous dosage of Humira for adult patients with hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is an initial dose of 160 mg (given in one day or split over two consecutive days), followed by 80 mg two weeks later (Day 15). Begin 40 mg weekly or 80 mg every other week dosing two weeks later (Day 29).

### ACG clinical guideline update: Ulcerative colitis in adults [^1147Viaq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for ulcerative colitis, particularly concerning the maintenance of remission in moderate-to-severe disease through advanced therapy, the ACG 2025 guidelines recommend considering the measurement of serum drug levels and anti-drug antibodies. This is particularly important for patients with moderate-to-severely active UC who are responders to anti-TNF therapy and are now losing response. If there is insufficient drug present, it is crucial to assess the reason for this loss of response.

### Bone density in a population-based cohort of premenopausal adult women with early onset inflammatory bowel disease [^1114ZsfP]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

We aimed to determine the bone mineral density (BMD) using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry in a population-based sample of women with inflammatory bowel disease who were diagnosed before age 20 years and who are currently premenopausal and less than 45 years.

The University of Manitoba Inflammatory Bowel Disease Epidemiology Research Registry was accessed to find eligible women. Of 171 eligible subjects, 82 agreed to participate, and 70 appeared for dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. All subjects completed demographic, clinical, and lifestyle questionnaires and underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry with analyses for both areal and volumetric BMD.

The mean areal T scores at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, total hip, and total body were -0.14 ± 1.05, -0.15 ± 1.04, -0.25 ± 1.17, and +0.09 ± 1.04, respectively. Forty-five subjects had normal BMD, and 25 had a T score < -1. There were no significant differences between these groups for predictive variables. Only three (4%) had osteoporosis (T score < -2.5 at any site). There were 12 with disease onset before puberty and 58 after puberty. There were no differences between these groups for BMD. Volumetric BMD was slightly higher than areal BMD at the lumbar spine (p < 0.0002), femoral neck (p < 0.01), and total hip (p < 0.001).

In a population-based sample of women diagnosed with IBD before 20 years of age and who are currently premenopausal, their average BMD is normal and the prevalence of osteoporosis is very low. Despite the potential for children with IBD to develop osteoporosis, these findings suggest otherwise.

### Duavee [^1137KwqY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Duavee for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis were demonstrated in Study 1 and Study 2.

- **Study 1**: This was a 24-month, double-blind, randomized, placebo- and active-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of multiple combinations of conjugated estrogen/bazedoxifene, including conjugated estrogens 0.45 mg/bazedoxifene 20 mg, compared to placebo. The primary endpoint of the study was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia at Year 1. Bone mineral density change at the lumbar spine at Year 2 was the key secondary endpoint, assessed in two subsets of patients: Substudy I and Substudy II.

	- **Substudy I**: Patients had to be more than 5 years postmenopausal, have a lumbar spine or total hip T-score of -1 to -2.5, and possess at least one additional risk factor for osteoporosis, such as Caucasian race, family history of osteoporosis, early menopause, thin/small frame, inactive lifestyle, or tobacco abuse. This substudy enrolled a total of 1,454 women, with 182 receiving Duavee, and had mean baseline T-scores of -1.43 and -1.52 in the Duavee and placebo groups, respectively.

	- **Substudy II**: Participants were 1–5 years postmenopausal and also had at least one additional risk factor for osteoporosis. This substudy enrolled a total of 861 women, with 111 receiving Duavee, and had mean baseline T-scores of -0.81 and -0.94 in the Duavee and placebo groups, respectively.

A total of 3,397 women aged 40–75, with an average age of 56 years, were enrolled in the overall study.

### Increased fracture risk in patients with rheumatic disorders and other inflammatory diseases — a case-control study with 53,108 patients with fracture [^1153G4dV]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to identify the risk of hip and vertebral fractures in patients with rheumatic disorders (RD) and inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD).

- **Methods**: This population-based case-control study assessed the fracture risk of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM), systemic sclerosis (SSc), Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis (UC). The study cohort comprised 53,108 patients with fractures (66% women) and 370,602 age-matched and sex-matched controls. Conditional logistic regression analysis was performed, and results were expressed as OR with corresponding 95% CI.

- **Results**: There was a statistically significant increased fracture risk for all RD and for IBD compared with controls. The magnitude of fracture risk was higher for patients with RD (OR 3, 95% CI 2.9–3.2) than for those with IBD (OR 1.6, 1.4–1.8). The OR in RD ranged from 2.6 (1.3–4.9) for SSc to 4 (3.4–4.6) for AS. The largest increased fracture risk for vertebral fractures was seen in AS (OR 7.1, 6–8.4) and for hip fractures in JIA (OR 4.1, 2.4–6.9).

- **Conclusion**: Our results highlight the existence of an increased fracture risk from a variety of underlying causes in patients with RD and IBD. In many inflammatory diseases, the implementation of fracture prevention strategies may be beneficial.

### Physical activity and risk of inflammatory bowel disease: Prospective study from the Nurses' Health Study cohorts [^113UrF4X]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Through 2010, we documented 284 incident cases of Crohn's disease and 363 incident cases of ulcerative colitis among 194,711 women who contributed 3,421,973 person-years of follow-up. Compared with women in the lowest fifth of physical activity, women in the highest fifth were less likely to be obese (body mass index ≥ 30) or smokers. There were no significant differences according to age, history of appendicectomy, and use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives, or postmenopausal hormone therapy according to fifths of physical activity.

- **Baseline characteristics**: Participants in the Nurses' Health Study and Nurses' Health Study II were classified according to the fifths of physical activity. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise. MET h/wk represents metabolic equivalent task hours per week. All variables are standardized to the age distribution of the study population and derived from baseline questionnaires (1986 in Nurses Health Study and 1989 in Nurses Health Study II), with exceptions for geographic location (1992 and 1993, respectively), oral contraceptive use (1984 and baseline, respectively), and appendicectomy (baseline and 1995, respectively).

Compared with women in the lowest fifth of overall physical activity, the age-adjusted risk of Crohn's disease decreased with an increasing level of physical activity. The risk was not significantly altered after adjusting for known and potential risk factors for Crohn's disease, including body mass index, smoking, and appendicectomy.

	- Markers of inflammation.
- **Disease course**:
	- Need for hospitalization.
	- Need for corticosteroids.
	- Failure to respond to medications.
- **Disease impact**:
	- Functionality.
	- Quality of life (QoL).

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^117MYr9p]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). High credibility.

Absolute BMD values differ between the vendors due to inherent differences in how each technology works. However, for diagnostic classification, this value is converted into a T-score and/or Z-score, which represents a patient's BMD in standard deviations compared to a reference population, with a precision of 1 decimal place.

The ISCD guidance recommends T-scores for postmenopausal women, perimenopausal women, and men over the age of 50 years, while Z-scores are preferred for younger individuals. The International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) also supports the use of T-scores for premenopausal women and men under the age of 50 years.

As described in Part I, the standard skeletal sites for DXA measurement are the hip (total hip and femoral neck), with the femoral neck designated by the IOF as the reference site for epidemiological studies, the L1-L4 region of the lumbar spine, and the radius. However, in chronic arthritides such as rheumatoid arthritis, BMD should not be measured at the radius due to local, juxta-articular bone loss, resulting in a lower BMD than in other parts of the skeleton.

BMD in g/cm² is used primarily for input into fracture risk algorithms (e.g. FRAX) and to monitor the skeletal effects of osteoporosis. Incorporating ethnicity into FRAX (US, South Africa, and Singapore versions) aims to help calibrate interventions appropriately, addressing racial disparities in fracture risk assessment and intervention thresholds.

### British society of gastroenterology consensus guidelines on the management of inflammatory bowel disease in adults [^113jwu3i]. Gut (2019). Low credibility.

- **Vitamin D**: We suggest that vitamin D levels should be measured and deficiency corrected in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (GRADE: weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence. Agreement: 86.7%).

In a multicultural UK IBD cohort, the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was notable. Vitamin D deficiency is associated with low bone mineral density. Vitamin D is important in some immune-mediated diseases, although its role in IBD inflammation is not fully elucidated. Retrospective studies have shown an association between higher levels of vitamin D and remission rates, as well as the durability of response to anti-TNF therapy. It remains unclear whether this association is due to confounding by increased disease activity associated with lower vitamin D levels.

### International consensus on the prevention of venous and arterial thrombotic events in patients with inflammatory bowel disease [^114BSHXS]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2021). Low credibility.

- **Statement 11: Control of disease activity is an important factor in reducing the risk of venous and arterial thrombotic events in patients with IBD**: Consensus was reached at 93% with 40% fully agreeing and 53% mostly agreeing. The evidence level is 4. Moderate to severe IBD activity has been identified as a risk factor for both venous thromboembolism (refer to Statements 3 and 5) and arterial thrombotic events (refer to Statement 7). Disease activity should be regarded as a modifiable risk factor for these events, and aggressive control of inflammation might reduce the risk of thrombosis in patients with IBD. Physicians should aim for combined clinical and endoscopic remission, given that persistent subclinical inflammation can also increase the risk of events. In the general population, an elevation of inflammatory markers, particularly C-reactive protein (CRP), is associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease (IHD). IBD therapies have the potential to reduce these risks by halting inflammation and, therefore, reducing the risk of thrombotic events. However, some IBD therapies might have an intrinsic pro-thrombotic effect that could tilt the balance towards increased risk of venous and/or arterial events (see Statements 13 to 19).

- **Statement 12: Established cardiovascular disease risk factors should be actively investigated and controlled in patients with IBD**: Consensus was reached at 100% with 73% fully agreeing and 27% mostly agreeing. The evidence level is 4. Patients with IBD should be screened for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, as atherosclerosis is responsible for most arterial thrombotic events.

### Hormone therapy increases risk of ulcerative colitis but not Crohn's disease [^111yf8Qf]. Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

The role of postmenopausal hormone therapy in the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) is unclear. Estrogen has been proposed to modulate gut inflammation by affecting estrogen receptors on gastrointestinal epithelial and immune cells.

- **Methods**: We conducted a prospective cohort study involving 108,844 postmenopausal US women (median age, 54 years) enrolled in 1976 in the Nurses' Health Study, who had no prior history of CD or UC. Every two years, we updated information on menopause status, postmenopausal hormone use, and other risk factors. Self-reported diagnoses of CD and UC were confirmed through a medical record review by two gastroenterologists blinded to exposure information. We used Cox proportional hazards models to calculate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: Through 2008, with more than 1.8 million person-years of follow-up, we documented 138 incident cases each of CD and UC. Compared with women who never used hormones, the multivariate-adjusted HR for UC was 1.71 (95% CI, 1.07–2.74) among women who currently used hormones and 1.65 (95% CI, 1.03–2.66) among past users. The risk of UC appeared to increase with longer duration of hormone use (P(trend) = .04) and decreased with time since discontinuation. No difference in risk was observed according to the type of hormone therapy used (estrogen vs. estrogen plus progestin). In contrast, we did not observe an association between hormone use and the risk of CD (multivariate-adjusted HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.78–1.82).

With respect to the medical management of postmenopausal osteoporosis, particularly concerning antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, the ES 2020 guidelines recommend initiating romosozumab for up to one year. This treatment aims to reduce the risk of vertebral, hip, and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis who are at a very high risk of fractures. These patients typically have severe osteoporosis (characterized by a low T-score of < -2.5 and fractures) or multiple vertebral fractures.

### Increased histologic inflammation is an independent risk factor for nonconventional dysplasia in ulcerative colitis [^112s7khn]. Histopathology (2022). Low credibility.

Several types of nonconventional dysplasia have been described in inflammatory bowel disease. Hypermucinous, goblet cell-deficient, and crypt cell dysplasias are considered high-risk subtypes as they often have molecular features of advanced neoplasia (e.g. aneuploidy) and are more frequently associated with advanced neoplasia than conventional dysplasia. This study investigated if increased colonic inflammation is a risk factor for nonconventional dysplasia.

- **Methods and results**: A cohort of 125 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)-associated dysplasia were analyzed and compared with 50 control UC patients without a history of neoplasia. For each patient, all biopsies prior to the initial detection of dysplasia were scored using a 4-point inflammatory activity score. Both mean and maximum scores from all biopsies taken during each colonoscopy were derived. Inflammation burden was calculated by multiplying the average maximum score between each pair of surveillance episodes by the length of the surveillance interval in years. The average scores of all colonoscopies were used to calculate overall mean, maximum, and inflammation burden scores. In multivariate analyses, higher maximum (odds ratio [OR] 3.4) and inflammation burden (OR 4.2) scores were significantly associated with the detection of dysplasia (P < 0.05). Similarly, higher mean and maximum scores increased the odds of nonconventional dysplasia by 2.7 and 4.9, respectively (P < 0.05). There was a stronger association between these two scores and high-risk subtypes (ORs 4.0 and 7.5, respectively, P < 0.05).

### Mesalamine [^112oYiVk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release capsules have been established based on adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets. Below is a description of the results of the adequate and well-controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release tablets for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis in adults and pediatric patients aged 5 to 17 years and the maintenance of remission of ulcerative colitis in adults.

- **Treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis**: Two placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) have demonstrated the efficacy of mesalamine delayed-release tablets in patients with mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.

	- **Adults**: In one randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 6 weeks' duration in 158 patients (Study 1), patients received mesalamine delayed-release dosages of 1.6 grams per day (800 mg twice a day; n = 53) and 2.4 grams per day (800 mg three times a day; n = 53), compared to placebo (n = 52). The scoring system for determination of treatment efficacy included assessment of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, sigmoidoscopic findings, patient's functional assessment, and physician global assessment. At the dosage of 2.4 grams per day, 21 of 43 (49%) patients using mesalamine delayed-release tablets showed an improvement in sigmoidoscopic appearance of the bowel compared to 12 of 44 (27%) patients using placebo (p = 0.048).

In addition, significantly more patients in the mesalamine delayed-release tablets 2.4 grams per day group showed improvement.

### Prempro [^1175MgDv]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral CE (0.625 mg) alone or in combination with MPA (2.5 mg) compared to placebo, in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of CHD, defined as nonfatal MI, silent MI, and CHD death, with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, PE, endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE plus MPA or CE alone on menopausal symptoms.

- **Whi estrogen plus progestin substudy**: The WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits included in the "global index". The absolute excess risk of events included in the "global index" was 19 per 10,000 women-years.

For those outcomes included in the WHI "global index" that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers, while the absolute risk reductions per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer cases of other conditions.

### Oral contraceptives, reproductive factors and risk of inflammatory bowel disease [^114shDLa]. Gut (2013). Low credibility.

Oral contraceptive use has been associated with the risk of Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).

- **Objective**: To determine whether this association is confounded or modified by other important lifestyle and reproductive factors.

- **Design**: A prospective cohort study was conducted involving 117,375 US women enrolled since 1976 in the Nurses' Health Study I (NHS I) and 115,077 women enrolled since 1989 in the Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II), with no prior history of UC or CD. These women provided information every two years on age at menarche, oral contraceptive use, parity, menopause status, and other risk factors. Diagnoses of CD and UC were confirmed by reviewing medical records. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

- **Results**: Among 232,452 women, with over 5,030,196 person-years of follow-up, 315 cases of CD and 392 cases of UC were recorded through 2007 in NHS II and 2008 in NHS I. Compared with never users of oral contraceptives, the multivariate-adjusted HRs for CD were 2.82 (95% CI 1.65 to 4.82) among users and 1.39 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.85) among past users. The association between oral contraceptives and UC differed according to smoking history (p-heterogeneity = 0.04). Age at menarche, age at first birth, and parity were not associated with the risk of UC or CD.

- **Conclusion**: In two large prospective cohorts of US women, oral contraceptive use was associated with the risk of CD. The association between oral contraceptive use and UC was limited to women with a history of smoking.

### Incidence of osteoporosis and osteopenia in newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease: A population-based cohort study [^115k3Qsz]. Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Individuals with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are at risk of developing osteoporosis. In Denmark, osteoporosis has been observed in 12.0% of postmenopausal women and 2.6% in men aged ≥ 50 years in the general population. We aimed to conduct a population-based analysis determining bone mineral density (BMD) at diagnosis of UC and CD.

- **Methods**: All adult patients diagnosed with UC or CD between May 2021 and May 2023 in an area covering 20% (1.2 million inhabitants) of the Danish population were invited for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry at inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) diagnosis.

- **Results**: In total, 209 and 141 patients with UC and CD, respectively, were included. Among postmenopausal women (age ≥ 52 years) with UC, 15/42 (35.7%) had osteoporosis and 17/42 (40.5%) had osteopenia, while rates among patients with CD were 6/21 (28.6%, P = 0.57) and 8/21 (38.1%, P = 0.86), respectively. Among males aged ≥ 50 years, the rates were 5/38 (13.2%) and 17/38 (44.7%) in UC, respectively, and 3/24 (12.5%, P = 1.00) and 12/24 (50.0%, P = 0.69) in CD, respectively. Among younger patients, BMD below the expected range for age was observed in 3/69 (4.3%) and 3/60 (5.0%) of females and males with UC, and in 1/42 (2.4%) and 8/54 (14.8%) with CD, respectively. No nutritional or inflammatory marker, including C-reactive protein, fecal calprotectin, Mayo Endoscopic Score, or Simple Endoscopic Score for CD, correlated with the T-score.

- **Conclusions**: This population-based study demonstrated high rates of osteoporosis among postmenopausal women and males aged ≥ 50 years at IBD diagnosis.

### Uceris [^114bN1UP]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Fourteen clinical studies have investigated the induction of remission in active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis.

Two similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted with a total of 970 adult patients with active, mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (UC), defined as a Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (UCDAI) of ≥ 4 and ≤ 10. Eight hundred ninety-nine of these patients had histology consistent with active UC; this was considered the primary analysis population. The UCDAI is a four-component scale (total score of 0 to 12) that encompasses clinical assessments of stool frequency, rectal bleeding, mucosal appearance, and physician's rating of disease activity, with a score of 0 to 3 for each component. The baseline median UCDAI score in both studies was 7.

- **Study 1**: 56% of patients were male, and the median age was 42 years. The patient demographic included 50% Caucasian, 7% African American, and 34% Asian.
- **Study 2**: 57% of patients were male, with a median age of 44 years. More than 99% of participants were Caucasian.

Both studies compared UCERIS 9 mg and 6 mg with placebo and included an active reference arm (mesalamine 2.4 g in Study 1 and budesonide 9 mg, not approved for the treatment of UC, in Study 2). The primary endpoint was the induction of remission after 8 weeks of treatment. Remission was defined as a UCDAI score of ≤ 1, with subscores of 0 for rectal bleeding, stool frequency, and mucosal appearance, and a ≥ 1 point reduction in an endoscopy-only score. In both studies, UCERIS 9 mg extended-release tablets demonstrated significant efficacy.

The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Studies enrolled approximately 27,000 predominantly healthy postmenopausal women in two substudies to assess the risks and benefits of daily oral conjugated equine estrogens (CE) (0.625 mg) alone or in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) (2.5 mg) compared to a placebo in the prevention of certain chronic diseases. The primary endpoint was the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), silent MI, and CHD death, with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A "global index" included the earliest occurrence of CHD, invasive breast cancer, stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer (only in the CE plus MPA substudy), colorectal cancer, hip fracture, or death due to other causes. These substudies did not evaluate the effects of CE plus MPA or CE alone on menopausal symptoms.

- **WHI estrogen plus progestin substudy**: This substudy was stopped early. According to the predefined stopping rule, after an average follow-up of 5.6 years of treatment, the increased risk of invasive breast cancer and cardiovascular events exceeded the specified benefits in the "global index". The absolute excess risk of events included in the "global index" was 19 per 10,000 women-years.

For those outcomes included in the WHI "global index" that reached statistical significance after 5.6 years of follow-up, the absolute excess risks per 10,000 women-years in the group treated with CE plus MPA were 7 more CHD events, 8 more strokes, 10 more PEs, and 8 more invasive breast cancers. In contrast, the absolute risk reductions per 10,000 women-years were 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer endpoints compared to the baseline.

### Risks and benefits of estrogen plus progestin in healthy postmenopausal women: Principal results from the Women's Health Initiative randomized controlled trial [^111Um91k]. JAMA (2002). High credibility.

Despite decades of accumulated observational evidence, the balance of risks and benefits for hormone use in healthy postmenopausal women remains uncertain. The objective was to assess the major health benefits and risks of the most commonly used combined hormone preparation in the United States.

The study involved the estrogen plus progestin component of the Women's Health Initiative, a randomized controlled primary prevention trial with a planned duration of 8.5 years. In this trial, 16,608 postmenopausal women aged 50–79 years with an intact uterus at baseline were recruited by 40 US clinical centers between 1993–1998.

- **Interventions**: Participants received conjugated equine estrogens, 0.625 mg/d, plus medroxyprogesterone acetate, 2.5 mg/d, in one tablet (n = 8506) or placebo (n = 8102).

- **Main outcomes measures**: The primary outcome was coronary heart disease (CHD), including nonfatal myocardial infarction and CHD death, with invasive breast cancer as the primary adverse outcome. A global index summarizing the balance of risks and benefits included the two primary outcomes plus stroke, pulmonary embolism (PE), endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, hip fracture, and death due to other causes.

On May 31, 2002, following a mean of 5.2 years of follow-up, the data and safety monitoring board recommended stopping the trial of estrogen plus progestin versus placebo. This decision was made because the test statistic for invasive breast cancer exceeded the stopping boundary for this adverse effect, and the global index statistic supported the conclusion that risks exceeded benefits. This report includes data on the major clinical outcomes through April 30, 2002.

### Severity of inflammation is a risk factor for colorectal neoplasia in ulcerative colitis [^112YnMk1]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with ulcerative colitis are at increased risk of colorectal cancer. It is widely believed that this is secondary to colonic inflammation; however, the severity of colonic inflammation has never been shown to be a risk factor.

- **Aims**: We devised a case-control study of patients with long-standing extensive ulcerative colitis to examine various potential risk factors for neoplasia. All cases of colorectal neoplasia detected from our surveillance program between January 1, 1988, and January 1, 2002, were studied (n = 68). Each patient was matched with two control patients from the same surveillance population (n = 136). Matching was for sex, colitis extent, age at onset, duration of colitis, and year of index surveillance colonoscopy.

- **Methods**: Segmental colonoscopic and histological inflammation was recorded by using a simple score (0, normal; 1, quiescent/chronic inflammation; and 2, 3, and 4, mild, moderate, and severe active inflammation, respectively). Other data collected included history of primary sclerosing cholangitis, family history of colorectal cancer, and smoking and drug history (mesalamine 5-aminosalicylic acid, azathioprine, and folate).

- **Results**: Univariate analysis showed a highly significant correlation between the colonoscopic (odds ratio, 2.5; P = 0.001) and histological (odds ratio, 5.1; P < 0.001) inflammation scores and the risk of colorectal neoplasia. No other factors reached statistical significance. On multivariate analysis, only the histological inflammation score remained significant (odds ratio, 4.7; P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: The analysis indicates that only the histological inflammation score had a significant association with the risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with ulcerative colitis.

### Risk of fracture in ulcerative colitis: a population-based study from Olmsted County, Minnesota [^112ToQmt]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2003). Low credibility.

Osteopenia is common in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), but less is known about fracture risk. Previously, we were unable to demonstrate increased fractures in a population-based cohort with Crohn's disease.

- **Methods**: Medical records of 273 Olmsted County, Minnesota, residents initially diagnosed with UC from 1940–1993 were reviewed for evidence of subsequent fractures. These were compared to records of a control cohort of county residents matched on age and gender. Cumulative fracture incidence after diagnosis was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratio of fracture in cases relative to control subjects was estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression, which also evaluated potential risk factors for fracture.

- **Results**: Median follow-up was 13 years (range, 1 day-53 years). The cumulative incidence of any fracture from time of diagnosis was 40% at 25 years versus 42% in control subjects (P = 0.615). The hazard ratio in cases compared to control subjects was 1.1 (95% confidence interval, 0.8–1.6) for any fracture and 1.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.6–2.8) for any osteoporotic fracture (hip, spine, or wrist as a result of moderate trauma). Other causes of secondary osteoporosis were associated with increased fracture risk, whereas estrogen use was protective. One hundred three cases received any corticosteroids (38%), and 34 (12%) had taken corticosteroids for 6 months or longer. Corticosteroids and bowel resection were not associated with fracture risk.

- **Conclusions**: In this population-based cohort of patients with UC, fracture risk was not significantly increased based on the data collected.

### Prempro [^1176fxqK]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The WHIMS estrogen-alone ancillary study of WHI enrolled 2,947 predominantly healthy hysterectomized postmenopausal women aged 65 to 79 years and older (45 percent were 65 to 69 years of age; 36 percent were 70 to 74 years of age; 19 percent were 75 years of age and older) to evaluate the effects of daily CE (0.625 mg) alone on the incidence of probable dementia (primary outcome) compared to placebo.

After an average follow-up of 5.2 years, the relative risk of probable dementia for CE alone versus placebo was 1.49 (95 percent CI, 0.83–2.66). The absolute risk of probable dementia for CE alone versus placebo was 37 versus 25 cases per 10,000 women-years. Probable dementia, as defined in this study, included AD, VaD, and mixed types (having features of both AD and VaD). The most common classification of probable dementia in both the treatment group and the placebo group was AD. Since the ancillary study was conducted in women aged 65 to 79 years, it is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

When data from the two populations were pooled as planned in the WHIMS protocol, the reported overall relative risk for probable dementia was 1.76 (95 percent CI, 1.19–2.60). Differences between groups became apparent in the first year of treatment. It is unknown whether these findings apply to younger postmenopausal women.

### Meaning attribution to intimate partner violence by counselors who support women with intimate partner violence experiences in Greece [^111YcCVT]. Journal of Interpersonal Violence (2021). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on intimate partner violence:

- **Definition**: Intimate partner violence is defined as any form of aggression or harmful behavior within a romantic relationship. This can include physical, sexual, or psychological harm, as well as controlling behaviors by a current or former partner.

- **Pathophysiology**: The pathophysiology of intimate partner violence is complex and multifaceted, involving an interplay of individual, relational, and societal factors. Substance abuse, mental health issues, and societal norms can also contribute to the occurrence of intimate partner violence.

- **Epidemiology**: Intimate partner violence is a significant global issue and is estimated to affect nearly 1 in 3 women worldwide within their lifetime.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for intimate partner violence include individual factors such as a history of violent behavior, substance misuse, and the presence of specific personality disorders. Relationship-related factors encompass marital discord, dominance and control dynamics within the relationship, and financial stress. Societal factors include societal norms endorsing male authority over female behavior, rigid gender role distinctions, and the existence of community groups that legitimize male violence.

- **Disease course**: It can manifest in various forms, including physical, sexual, and emotional abuse. Physical abuse often results in injuries, with musculoskeletal injuries being the second most common manifestation. These injuries can range from minor bruises and cuts to severe fractures and burns.

### Humira [^1139Gp9j]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The safety and efficacy of Humira were assessed in adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis, defined by a Mayo score of 6 to 12 on a 12-point scale, including an endoscopy subscore of 2 to 3 on a scale of 0 to 3. This assessment occurred despite current or prior treatment with immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids, azathioprine, or 6-MP. The evaluation was conducted through two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies, namely Studies UC-I and UC-II.

Both studies included TNF-blocker naïve patients, with Study UC-II also accommodating patients who had lost response to or were intolerant of TNF-blockers. Notably, 40% of patients in Study UC-II had previously used another TNF-blocker. Concomitant stable doses of aminosalicylates and immunosuppressants were allowed in these studies. At baseline, patients in Studies UC-I and II were receiving aminosalicylates (69%), corticosteroids (59%), and/or azathioprine or 6-MP (37%). In both studies, 92% of patients received at least one of these medications.

The induction of clinical remission, defined as a Mayo score of ≤ 2 with no individual subscores > 1, was evaluated at Week 8 in both studies. Additionally, clinical remission at Week 52 and sustained clinical remission, defined as clinical remission at both Weeks 8 and 52, were specifically evaluated in Study UC-II.

### Metabolic bone disease in patients diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease from Spain [^117KZEf1]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2019). Low credibility.

A total of 1619 consecutive inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, comprising 1152 from Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón (HGUGM) and 467 from Hospital General Universitario de Ciudad Real (HGUCR), attended between 2002 and 2014, were evaluated. Six hundred twelve eligible patients with risk factors for metabolic bone disease (MBD) and at least one dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) were finally included in the study. Among these patients, 43.1% were male, with a mean (SD) age of 44.9 (14.7) years. Crohn's disease (CD) was diagnosed in 359 (58.6%) patients, ulcerative colitis (UC) in 238 (38.9%), and indeterminate colitis (IC) in 15 (2.4%). The mean evolution time from diagnosis was 9.7 years.

- **Clinical characteristics and treatments**:
	- The clinical characteristics, as well as previous and active treatments of patients at the moment of basal DXA, are summarized in the study. Patients diagnosed with CD were significantly younger [42.1 (13.9) versus 48.6 (15), p < 0.001] and had a significantly higher rate of active smoking (34.3% versus 15.6%, p < 0.001), immunomodulator use (49.7% versus 37.8%, p = 0.011), biologic treatment (27.9% versus 14.7%, p < 0.001), hospital admissions (51.4% versus 38.6%, p = 0.026), and previous surgery (42.1% versus 9.7%, p < 0.001) than those diagnosed with UC. A higher proportion of menopausal women was found among UC patients compared with CD patients (24.6% versus 16%, p = 0.004).

- **Medication before DXA**:
	- A total of 439 patients (71.7%) received at least one tapered dosage of corticosteroids before DXA, with a mean (SD) cumulative dose of 4021.5 (2979) mg of prednisone or equivalent. Additionally, 143 patients received calcium and vitamin D treatment at least three months before the first DXA, and 19 patients received bisphosphonates.

### Mesalamine [^115GGq7w]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Pregnancy risk summary**: Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association between mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental outcomes with the administration of oral mesalamine during organogenesis to pregnant rats and rabbits at doses 1.7 and 5.4 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (see Data).

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. Adverse outcomes in pregnancy occur regardless of the health of the mother or the use of medications. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations**

- **Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk**: Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.

- **Data**

- **Human Data**: Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine during early pregnancy (first trimester) and throughout pregnancy have not reliably informed an association between mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.

### Hormonal replacement therapy after menopause is protective of disease activity in women with inflammatory bowel disease [^115UNkhe]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

The nature of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) following menopause has not been previously studied. The aim of this study was to characterize the effect of menopause on disease activity and identify possible modifiers of disease activity.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective study of women followed at the University of Chicago IBD Clinic. Disease activity was assessed using clinical scoring systems during the pre- and postmenstrual periods of subjects. Variables of interest included history of smoking, use of oral contraceptives (OCP) prior to onset of menopause, and use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

- **Results**: Sixty-five women were included, 20 with ulcerative colitis and 45 with Crohn's disease. The median age of menopause was similar to historical controls. Twenty-three patients (35%) experienced active symptoms in the premenopausal time period, and 25 patients (38%) had disease indices consistent with a flare within the first 2 years after menopause (P > 0.05). There was no relation between those who had a pre- versus postmenstrual flare as a group (P > 0.05). However, there was a significant protective effect on disease activity with postmenopausal HRT use (hazard ratio [HR] 0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04–0.72). There was also a dose-response effect noted with an HR with longer duration of use (0.20, 0.07–0.65).

- **Conclusions**: The likelihood of having a flare postmenopause is not different from having it premenopause. HRT, however, may provide a protective effect for disease activity in the postmenopausal period.

- **Pregnancy: Risk summary**: Published data from meta-analyses, cohort studies, and case series on the use of mesalamine, the active moiety of balsalazide, during pregnancy have not reliably informed an association with mesalamine and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). There are adverse effects on maternal and fetal outcomes associated with ulcerative colitis in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). In animal reproduction studies, there were no adverse developmental effects observed after oral administration of balsalazide disodium in pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2.4 and 4.7 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD).

- **Background risk**: The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

- **Clinical considerations: Disease-associated maternal and embryo/fetal risk**: Published data suggest that increased disease activity is associated with the risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with ulcerative colitis. Adverse pregnancy outcomes include preterm delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation), low birth weight (less than 2,500 g) infants, and small for gestational age at birth.

### Bone health-across a woman's lifespan [^111bMsST]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Low credibility.

There is a lack of international consensus regarding appropriate diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis in premenopausal women. The International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) and the European Calcified Tissue Society together recommend the diagnosis of osteoporosis in premenopausal women with vertebral and/or multiple fragility fractures with low aBMD, defined by the IOF as a Z‐score ≤ ‐2 prior to 20 years of age, and a T‐score < ‐2.5 in older premenopausal women who have attained peak bone mass. The IOF also recognizes aBMD T‐score < ‐2.5 at the spine or hip in a premenopausal woman with an underlying chronic disease affecting bone metabolism as consistent with osteoporosis. The IOF recommends use of T‐scores in premenopausal women to maintain consistency with the World Health Organisation criteria for postmenopausal osteoporosis but acknowledges the recommendations by the International Society of Clinical Densitometry to report Z‐scores rather than T‐scores in premenopausal women. For Z‐scores, a comparison to average age‐matched and sex‐matched BMD, where a score ≤ ‐2 is classified as 'below the expected range for age', is particularly relevant when assessing younger adults as factors other than osteoporosis may also contribute to low bone density, such as low peak bone mass and osteomalacia due to an underlying chronic disease or other factors described above. For clarity and to maintain consistency with much of the published literature, we have used the term osteoporosis in premenopausal women presenting with fracture (regardless of bone density criteria).
