## Question

74-year-old woman with difficulty swallowing and weight loss

A 74-year-old woman presents with progressive dysphagia and unintentional weight loss. She has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke, smoking, and alcohol consumption.

 Physical examination reveals a large ulcerated lesion in the left posterior oropharynx, as well as enlarged supraclavicular and anterior cervical lymph nodes.

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about a 74-year-old woman with progressive dysphagia, unintentional weight loss, a large ulcerated lesion in the left posterior oropharynx, and enlarged supraclavicular and anterior cervical lymph nodes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pretest probability and red flags that push malignancy to the top of the differential. Then, I should verify the immediate diagnostic steps, including tissue diagnosis and imaging. Next, I will consider staging and prognostic implications, especially HPV status. After that, I need to outline evidence-based treatment pathways and follow-up. Finally, I should double-check pitfalls, special scenarios, and how to counsel the patient about prognosis and next steps.

> Let me first confirm the red flags and pretest probability. Progressive dysphagia with weight loss in an older adult is a high-risk symptom complex for serious organic disease, and the presence of a large, ulcerated oropharyngeal lesion with firm, enlarged cervical and supraclavicular nodes further elevates suspicion for squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, particularly given her smoking and alcohol history, which are classic risk factors for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma [^d5d3d72d] [^f9d87a2e] [^4d7634e4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify the most likely diagnosis and the differential. The leading diagnosis is oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, given the anatomic location, ulceration, and nodal disease. However, I need to keep lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and less common entities in mind, especially if the histology or imaging diverges from typical HNSCC patterns, so I should plan for comprehensive tissue diagnosis and targeted imaging before committing to a treatment pathway [^b94ca82e] [^3b5d165f] [^3b20bdca].

> Next, I should review the immediate diagnostic steps. I need to ensure tissue is obtained urgently. Fine-needle aspiration of the largest accessible neck node is preferred over open biopsy to preserve oncologic integrity, and if FNA is non-diagnostic or there is necrosis, image-guided core needle biopsy can be considered. Concurrently, I should obtain a direct examination of the oropharynx with biopsy of the primary lesion to establish a tissue diagnosis and enable HPV testing, which will guide staging and prognosis [^a6125d36] [^3bd94b04] [^b71db663].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging strategy before treatment planning. Contrast-enhanced CT of the head and neck is essential to define the extent of the primary tumor and nodal disease, and chest imaging with CT or PET-CT is indicated to assess for distant metastases. MRI can be added for soft tissue delineation, and PET-CT is particularly useful for staging and for identifying occult primaries or distant disease, which can alter management decisions [^65e72039] [^b832eb1b] [^d0f2c59c].

> I will now examine staging and prognostic implications. I should confirm TNM staging using the 8th edition AJCC, which separates HPV-positive from HPV-negative oropharyngeal cancers because HPV-positive disease has distinct biology and better outcomes. HPV status is typically inferred from p16 immunohistochemistry, with confirmatory HPV-specific testing when needed, and this distinction will directly influence treatment intensity and counseling about prognosis [^e95f64c3] [^735a1c15] [^a32bdca1].

> Let me think about treatment pathways. For HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC, de-intensified regimens are often appropriate given favorable biology, whereas HPV-negative disease generally receives standard-intensity therapy. Definitive options include transoral robotic surgery with risk-adapted adjuvant therapy or primary chemoradiation, with adjuvant chemoradiation indicated for adverse pathologic features such as positive margins or extranodal extension. I should confirm that multidisciplinary planning includes dental and speech pathology input to optimize function [^d61a2ddd] [^b04aaecc] [^263f735d].

> But wait, what if the primary site is not obvious on exam or imaging. In that scenario, I should consider an examination under anesthesia with directed biopsies of the oropharynx, nasopharynx, and hypopharynx, and consider tonsillectomies if the tonsillar fossae are suspicious, because occult primaries in the oropharynx are not rare and can be identified with careful endoscopic evaluation and selective tissue sampling [^fab0145c] [^7f3ba3e9].

> I should double-check nodal management principles. For clinically node-positive disease, neck dissection or definitive neck irradiation is indicated, and bilateral neck treatment is often considered for midline or posterior oropharyngeal primaries given the risk of contralateral spread. Postoperative radiotherapy with or without concurrent cisplatin is recommended based on pathologic risk features, and timing within 6–7 weeks of surgery is important to maintain local control [^384ddee1] [^27c200bb] [^b04aaecc].

> Next, I should review follow-up and surveillance. After definitive therapy, clinical examination every 2–3 months in the first year is standard, with imaging typically including a PET-CT around 3 months post-treatment to assess response and guide the need for neck dissection in node-positive patients. Long-term surveillance balances early detection of recurrence with avoidance of unnecessary imaging, and persistent or rising plasma cell-free HPV DNA may signal recurrence, though routine clinical use awaits validation [^07ac6f44] [^63d5c000] [^646f264c].

> Hold on, I should verify prognostic counseling. HPV-positive oropharyngeal SCC has significantly better survival than HPV-negative disease, with 5-year overall survival often exceeding 80–90% in appropriately selected patients, whereas HPV-negative disease carries substantially lower survival and may warrant more aggressive therapy. I need to ensure the patient understands that stage, nodal burden, and adverse features still modulate risk even within HPV-positive cohorts [^e95f64c3] [^194d09c2] [^ad3a5739].

> Let me reconsider potential pitfalls and special scenarios. If FNA shows lymphoma rather than SCC, management shifts to systemic therapy rather than surgery-first strategies, and if there is necrotic nodal material, core biopsy improves diagnostic yield. If imaging suggests a cystic node, I should not assume benign disease, as cystic metastases from oropharyngeal primaries are well described and require the same oncologic workup and treatment planning [^3b5d165f] [^5d307374].

> Finally, I need to ensure supportive care is addressed up front. Given dysphagia and weight loss, early nutrition evaluation, swallowing therapy, and dental optimization are critical to maintain function through treatment. I should also counsel on smoking cessation and alcohol moderation to reduce treatment toxicity and second primary risk, and coordinate care within a multidisciplinary head and neck tumor board to align on sequencing and goals of care.

The most likely diagnosis is **oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma** (OPSCC) given the patient's age, smoking and alcohol history, and the presence of a large, ulcerated oropharyngeal lesion with cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Progressive dysphagia and weight loss are classic red flags for malignancy [^d5d3d72d]. Immediate workup should include **contrast-enhanced CT/MRI of the head and neck**, chest imaging, and **fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the neck mass** with HPV testing and p16 immunohistochemistry [^b832eb1b] [^3bd94b04] [^735a1c15]. Direct visualization and biopsy of the oropharyngeal lesion are essential for definitive diagnosis and staging [^b71db663]. Early multidisciplinary management is critical given the high likelihood of advanced disease and the favorable prognosis of HPV-associated OPSCC [^e95f64c3].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for a large, ulcerated oropharyngeal lesion with cervical and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy includes:

- **Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)**: Most common malignancy of the oropharynx, strongly associated with tobacco and alcohol use [^b94ca82e].

- **Human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated oropharyngeal cancer**: Increasingly prevalent, often presenting with cystic lymph node metastases and better prognosis than HPV-negative disease [^e95f64c3].

- **Lymphoma**: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can present with oropharyngeal involvement and generalized lymphadenopathy [^3b5d165f].

- **Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)**: Less likely given the oropharyngeal location, but should be considered if there is posterior pharyngeal wall involvement or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) positivity [^3b20bdca].

- **Infectious etiologies**: Tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, or deep fungal infections can mimic malignancy with ulcerative lesions and lymphadenopathy [^f7f37911] [^cbf8f535].

Given the clinical presentation and risk factors, **OPSCC is the most likely diagnosis**, with HPV-associated disease a strong consideration due to the cystic nature of cervical nodes and the patient's age [^e95f64c3].

---

## Diagnostic workup

A comprehensive diagnostic workup is essential to confirm the diagnosis, stage the disease, and guide management:

| **Diagnostic modality** | **Indication** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Contrast-enhanced CT/MRI of head and neck | Essential | Evaluate primary tumor extent, nodal disease, and vascular involvement [^65e72039] [^cbbbb167] |
| Chest CT or PET-CT | Essential | Assess for distant metastases and synchronous primaries [^6589bb25] [^65e72039] |
| Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of neck mass | Essential | Obtain tissue diagnosis, HPV testing, and p16 immunohistochemistry [^a6125d36] [^735a1c15] |
| Direct visualization (flexible nasopharyngolaryngoscopy) | Essential | Identify primary tumor site and guide biopsy [^47d28668] |
| Biopsy of oropharyngeal lesion | Essential | Confirm histology and HPV status [^b71db663] [^a6211bca] |
| Laboratory tests (CBC, renal/hepatic function, HIV) | Recommended | Assess baseline organ function and identify comorbidities [^notfound] |

---

## Management

Management of OPSCC is **multidisciplinary**, involving head and neck surgery, radiation oncology, medical oncology, and supportive care:

- **Early-stage disease (T1–T2, N0–N1)**: Single-modality treatment with either surgical resection (transoral robotic surgery) or definitive radiotherapy [^notfound].

- **Locally advanced disease (T3–T4 or N2–N3)**: Combined modality treatment with surgery followed by adjuvant radiotherapy ± chemotherapy, or definitive chemoradiation [^b04aaecc].

- **HPV-positive disease**: Consideration of de-intensified treatment protocols due to favorable prognosis and reduced toxicity [^notfound].

- **Palliative care**: Essential for symptom control, nutritional support, and psychosocial counseling.

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with **HPV status**, stage, and treatment response. HPV-positive OPSCC has significantly better 5-year survival rates (approximately 85–90%) compared to HPV-negative disease (approximately 40–60%). Early detection and aggressive multimodal therapy improve outcomes [^e95f64c3].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The patient's presentation is most consistent with **oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma**, likely HPV-associated. Immediate diagnostic workup, including imaging, FNA with HPV testing, and biopsy, is essential. Early multidisciplinary management is critical for optimal outcomes. Given the favorable prognosis of HPV-positive OPSCC, the patient should be counseled accordingly and enrolled in a comprehensive care plan.

An 18-year-old woman presented with progressive oesophageal dysphagia, weight loss and night sweats over a 6-month period. Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a diffuse luminal narrowing with normal mucosa, whose biopsies were inconclusive. A cervical and thoracic CT scan showed a thickening of the upper oesophagus, densification of the mediastinal fat, several adenopathies and a 4.3×2.4cm mass with infiltrative appearance and heterogeneous enhancement in right cervical paravertebral location. Positron emission tomography-CT showed marked increased fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in supradiaphragmatic lymph nodes, pleuropulmonary tissue, paraspinal musculature and bone marrow. Imaging-guided and surgical incisional biopsies of the paravertebral mass were inconclusive. During hospitalisation, she developed right cervicobrachial paraesthesia. Only excisional biopsy of the mass allowed the diagnosis of high-grade B-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified, Ann Arbor stage IV-B. The patient underwent chemotherapy with R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone), followed by R-EPOCH (rituximab, etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin hydrochloride). Follow-up at 12 months revealed complete response.

An otherwise healthy 29-year-old woman presented with a complaint of odynophagia of several months' duration. On examination, she was found to have a broadly based, yellow, exophytic lesion on the right lateral pharyngeal wall. Findings on biopsy were consistent with amyloidosis. The patient underwent tonsillectomy with resection of the oropharyngeal lesion. Final pathology established a diagnosis of nodular non-AL-type amyloidosis. Localized amyloidosis of the oropharynx is exceptionally rare. Additionally, most cases of localized amyloidosis are of the AL type, not the AA (i.e., non-AL) type seen in this patient.

Dysphagia is commonly attributed to disorders arising from dysfunction of the oesophageal mucosa or oesophageal motility. Mediastinal structures causing compression of the oesophagus remain a rare presenting cause of dysphagia. We report a case of a woman presenting with dysphagia to solid foods and associated symptoms of weight loss. Traditional evaluation for dysphagia was unrevealing until cross-sectional imaging suggested a mediastinal obstructive process. The finding of a mediastinal granuloma, distinct from mediastinal fibrosis, as the aetiology of dysphagia is a rare finding, with specific treatment implications. The patient was treated with itraconazole antifungal therapy with an improvement in her symptoms.

Case

A 35-year-old woman with a history of mixed connective tissue disease, Raynaud's phenomenon, arthritis, progressive interstitial lung disease resulted in respiratory compromise that required a double lung transplant. One year following her transplant, she was referred to the gastroenterology service with a 2-week history of worsening odynophagia and dysphagia.

Her symptoms were predominantly caused by solids with the need to over-chew or to drink large quantities of liquids to push food down the oesophagus. She lost 4 kg. She reported occasional nausea and regurgitation of food and pills, but no vomiting. There were no other gastrointestinal symptoms. She reported no fever or night sweats.

Her immunosuppressive medications included prednisone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate.

She had no allergies. There was no history of smoking, excessive alcohol consumption or recreational drug use.

There was no family history of malignancies.

Physical examination did not reveal any skin rashes or lymphadenopathy. Abdominal examination was normal.

We report an unusual case of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), presenting initially as a retropharyngeal collection. We discuss the investigation, diagnosis and management of NPC and furthermore review the literature of NPC, emphasising the varied presentation. A 44-year-old Caucasian male ex-smoker presented with a 10-day history of a painless left-sided neck lump; progressive dysphagia and unintentional weight loss. Examination demonstrated a large left posterior pharyngeal swelling with soft palatal effacement, confirmed on nasoendoscopy. A CT scan revealed a fluid collection in the retropharyngeal space, which partially occluded the nasopharynx, and numerous satellite lesions were identified along with cervical lymphadenopathy. The suspected abscess was drained in theatre and nasopharyngeal biopsies were taken. These revealed Epstein-Barr virus-positive NPC. Staging investigations revealed a T4N2M0l carcinoma. Treatment consisted of radical chemoradiation therapy with curative intent. NPC is known for its varied and late presentation, and is an important condition to be aware of when considering a differential diagnosis of pharyngeal masses.

Case report

A 62-year-old cachectic woman with a 40-year smoking history, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, and gastroesophageal reflux disease presented to dermatology clinic with a 3-month history of painful oral erosions and ulcerations affecting her gingiva, tongue, and oral mucosa. The patient initially developed white stuck-on lesions that became progressively more painful over 1 to 2 months, leading to erosions. Since the onset of the erosions, she had increasingly limited her oral intake, and at the time of the visit could only tolerate thick liquids. Additionally, the patient reported developing a pruritic rash involving her upper extremities, chest, and back following the same timeframe. She had tried both medium-potency topical steroids and various over-the-counter products without relief. She recently had been fitted for new dentures; however, she was unable to use them due to severe mouth pain. Otherwise, she denied any new occupational or social exposures or medications in the past 6 months. Her review of systems was positive for increased fatigue, weight loss, and a chronic cough.

Examination revealed extensive mucosal erosions and superficial ulcerations involving the tongue, buccal mucosa, hard/soft palate, and posterior oropharynx. In addition, the gingival mucosa demonstrated hypertrophy with a mild cobblestone appearance. Skin examination was notable for scattered erythematosus-to-pink arcuate papules and plaques with mild scale (Fig 1). No regional lymphadenopathy was appreciated on physical examination.

Fig 1
A, Numerous scattered erythematosus-to-pink papules and plaques with mild scale were seen throughout the neck, upper portion of the torso, and bilateral upper extremities. B, The extensive erosions and superficial ulcerations were noted through the oral mucosa, extending into the posterior aspect of the oropharynx.

Extensive serologic and laboratory testing was performed, which revealed the following notable findings: Sodium, 125 mmol/L (reference range, 136–144 mmol/L); antinuclear antibodies (ANA), 1:320 (speckled pattern); SSA52-specific IgG, 44 AU/mL (reference range, 0–40 AU/mL), and SSA60-specific IgG 93 (reference range, 0–40 AU/mL). The following tests were notably negative or within the normal limits: Serum protein electrophoresis, HIV, hepatitis C, herpes simplex virus, Smith autoantibodies, histone autoantibodies, double-stranded DNA antibodies, and lactate dehydrogenase levels.

### A rare cause of dysphagia due to esophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis: a case report and review of literature [^0446d6d6]. BMC Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 62-year-old female presented with nausea, vomiting, melena, and left lower extremity pain. Her medical history was significant for peripheral vascular disease, liver cirrhosis, chronic pancreatitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). She had a 25 pack-year smoking history, and a prior history of chronic alcohol use. Physical exam revealed a thin, frail, and malnourished woman in overall poor health. Upon initial questioning, she endorsed dysphagia with recurrent gagging, regurgitation of solid food, and unintentional weight loss for over 5 years. She denied any pain with mastication, or odynophagia, but for the last 2 years, she had mostly been restricted to a pureed diet as a result of her symptoms. Additionally, her family history was significant for colon cancer. The initial laboratory exams exhibited an elevated aspartate aminotransferase (71 u/L), alanine aminotransferase (122 u/L), alkaline phosphatase (356 u/L), and a low hemoglobin (5.6 g/dL). EGD and colonoscopy were planned for workup of her anemia, melena, and dysphagia. Initial EGD using GIF HQ 190 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) displayed severe stenosis in the upper portion of the esophagus due to a stricture measuring 3 mm in diameter (Fig. 1). The esophageal stricture was subsequently dilated using a 5.5 cm long, 8–10 mm CRE Wireguided Ballon Dilatation Catheter (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) to 8 mm. However, significant narrowing distal to the stenosis was discovered and it was noted that the stricture was longer than 5.5 cm, therefore, the endoscope could not be advanced to measure the stricture length. At this point, the EGD was aborted and barium esophagram was ordered to determine the extent of the stricture. The esophagram displayed stenosis measuring 7 cm in length along with numerous small collections of contrast in the upper portion of the esophageal submucosa, consistent with EIP findings (Fig. 2). Additionally, colonoscopy performed during the initial workup was negative for a source of bleeding, therefore, her profound anemia was likely secondary to a combination of her poor oral intake, cirrhosis and an open, weeping ulcer on the foot. A repeat EGD was performed for subsequent dilatation with a Savary-Gilliard dilator (Cook Medical, Bloomfield, IN), 24 French (Fr) and 27 Fr dilation was completed without complications (Figs. 3 and 4). Post dilation stenosis was measured in the upper third of the esophagus from 17 cm to 24 cm from incisors (Fig. 5 a, b). A total of two sessions of dilatation therapy were performed during her hospitalization and were tolerated well. She was sent home on a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and within 4 weeks switched to a Histamine-2 (H₂) receptor antagonist due to persistent hypomagnesemia. Three weeks after dilatation, on follow-up examination, she reported significant improvement in her dysphagia and was tolerating a full regular diet for the first time in 2 years. A repeat endoscopy was not indicated at follow-up examination as she reported no dysphagia or related issues. The patient was contacted 2 years later and reported no recurrence of dysphagia while tolerating a full solid and liquid diet.

### A patient presenting with generalised lympadenopathy – sarcoidosis, lymphoma or tuberculosis? [^d55c8871]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Sarcoidosis, lymphoma and tuberculosis can often present with similar clinical features - for example, lymphadenopathy, fever, malaise, weight loss, respiratory symptoms, hypercalcaemia - making the establishment of the diagnosis difficult. The authors present a case of a 62-year-old woman with an established diagnosis of sarcoidosis affecting the lymph nodes, who subsequently developed high-grade T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; the patient was also treated for active tuberculosis at the same time. This case highlights that these conditions can co-exist and that the occurrence of new and rapidly progressive symptoms in patients with an established diagnosis should alert clinicians to vigilantly search for another possible diagnosis.

### Severe immune mucositis and esophagitis in metastatic squamous carcinoma of the larynx associated with pembrolizumab [^e9d1b0e2]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Case presentation

A 69-year-old caucasian male with a history of cubital neuropathy and mild hypoacusia was diagnosed with T4N2M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx invading the thyroid and hyoid cartilages as well as the base of the tongue. He underwent total glosso-laryngectomy, tracheostomy and cervical lymphadenectomy. Treatment was pursued with adjuvant therapy including cisplatin 100 mg/m² IV q 3 weeks for 3 cycles and concurrent radiotherapy (66Gy). Recurrence with multiple pulmonary nodular lesions occurred within six months after the end of adjuvant therapy. Three months later the patient initiated therapy with pembrolizumab 200 mg IV q 3 weeks within a clinical trial. During treatment, the patient developed an asymptomatic primary hypothyroidism (TSH = 6.87 mUI/L normal value between (0.30–5.50), T3 = 4.1 pmol/L (3.5–6.0) and T4 = 9.3 pmol/L (10.0–23.0)). Serum antithyroid peroxidase antibodies were not requested at the time of diagnosis. Because he had a normal baseline thyroid function, a diagnosis of hypothyroidism secondary to pembrolizumab was made and levothyroxine 50 mcg per day was initiated. The patient did not develop other immune related toxicity to pembrolizumab.

After 14 cycles, complete metastatic disease regression was documented in the right inferior pulmonary lobe, hilar, anterior mediastinal and pretracheal lymph nodes and in the right upper lobe micronodules and a left pulmonary micronodule was stable. At a follow-up appointment before cycle 15th, the patient experienced dysphagia. The physical examination demonstrated only small ulcers of the oral cavity. A treatment with sucralfate and magic mouthwash was given together with a 7-day course of valacyclovir based on a suspicion of herpetic involvement in a patient with a positive HSV-2 serology. Two weeks later, the patient was admitted to the hospital with a history of progressive dysphagia. He complained of oropharyngeal ulcers limiting swallowing that evolved to dysphagia to liquids and solids in the last 5 days as well as weight loss of 6 kg. The physical examination showed multiple painful oral cavity and oropharyngeal ulcers with diffuse erythema without any sign of oral thrush, any lacy white plaques (Wickham's striae) or reticular white plaques (Fig. 1).

### The current state of biological and clinical implications of human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal cancer [^8de7a921]. Seminars in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

In the effort to control human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal cancer, the head and neck oncology community has devoted much effort to understanding its disease biology and clinical behavior, and refining strategies to address early diagnosis and optimal management for the affected population. This review identifies articles published up to March 2017 on tumor biology and clinical implications of human papillomavirus-related oropharyngeal cancer, and summarizes the findings in some key areas. These include potential screening strategies, possible anatomical features responsible for early lymph node involvement and its implication for staging, biological mechanisms to explain superior outcomes compared to traditional nonviral-related mucosal cancers, re-appreciation of traditional prognostic factors (eg, hypoxia, extranodal extension, and smoking), and current efforts to optimize management for this patient population. The review reflects the global effort to mitigate the influence of this burgeoning disease.

CASE 2

A 28-year-old man presented with hypopigmented lesions on the face existing since 2 years. The lesion became scaly after a year (Figure 2A). He also reported difficulty swallowing, odynophagia, and feeling a mass during swallowing, which progressively worsened. Two weeks before the presentation, he started to have gum bleeding, high-grade intermittent fever, loss of appetite, and unquantified significant weight loss.

Figure 2.
Patient with visceral leishmaniasis showing (A) hypopigmented facial lesions, (B) palatal erythema and swelling; (C) microscopic image of Leishman–Donovan body from esophageal biopsy.

On physical examination, his vital signs were stable. The soft palate and pharynx were diffusely swollen and erythematous (Figure 2B). There was bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy (1 cm × 1 cm). There was an enlarged spleen (6 cm below the left costal margin) and liver (2 cm below the right costal margin). There were multiple small, macular, patchy hypopigmented lesions on the face (Figure 2A). The complete blood count and renal and liver function tests were in the normal range. The recombinant K39 antigen (rK39) rapid diagnostic test was positive. The HIV test was negative. Amastigotes were detected by microscopy from the spleen aspirate, skin slit, and endoscopic biopsy from the esophagus (Figure 2C). Treatment was started with sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin combination therapy for 30 days. As the palatal lesion and dysphagia had not resolved by day 30, sodium stibogluconate was continued for another month. At end of the 2-month treatment, the patient was asymptomatic and no parasites were detected in the spleen. The patient came for 3- and 6-month posttreatment follow-ups, and no reappearance of the skin and/or palatal lesions were observed.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: head and neck cancers, version 2.2025 [^3bd94b04]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Head and neck cancers — special considerations for suspected HPV-associated metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) to the neck: Often, the patient's first presenting sign of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is a neck mass. Cross-sectional imaging should be performed to facilitate identification of the primary site, followed by direct examination and confirmatory biopsies. EUA and confirmatory biopsies for patients with suspected OPSCC should be performed before beginning therapy; lingual tonsillectomy may be considered if biopsies and palatine tonsils are negative for tumor, whereas bilateral palatine and lingual tonsillectomies are ill-advised as they may lead to swallowing morbidity. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies of the neck mass will usually establish the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma, and immunostaining for p16 can support the diagnosis of HPV-associated OPSCC in the presence of an oropharyngeal primary tumor; if there is any uncertainty, a core biopsy under image guidance can be performed. Rarely is an open excisional biopsy of the suspected metastatic node necessary for definitive diagnosis, and the surgeon should be prepared to perform a neck dissection at the time of open biopsy if frozen section confirms squamous cell carcinoma. In select occult primary cases with p16-positive nodal metastasis, confirmation with HPV ISH/PCR testing is recommended. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Alarm symptoms and identification of non-cancer diagnoses in primary care: cohort study [^dda73bbe]. BMJ (2009). Excellent credibility.

The predictive value of dysphagia for a serious organic lesion in the oesophagus has recently been called into question, not least because dysphagia is a common symptom in gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. A recent systematic review of 83 studies identified wide variation in the sensitivity and specificity of several alarm symptoms for upper gastrointestinal malignancies, and the recently published Montreal consensus guidelines on gastro-oesophageal reflux diseasehave suggested that only progressive dysphagia should be regarded as an alarm symptom, pointing out that dysphagia often improves with anti-secretory treatment in many reflux patients. Our data, however, do not entirely support this view. The diagnostic rates for cancer and oesophageal stricture at 90 days were 4.4% and 2.9%, respectively, in men and 1.8% and 1.7% in women, and at three years were 5.9% and 4.5%, respectively, in men and 2.5% and 2.7% in women. The highest detection rates were found in older men and women. Corresponding figures for a diagnosis of oesophagitis in men were 7.1% at 90 days and 14.7% at three years, suggesting that dysphagia should be taken seriously as a warning of an organic oesophageal lesion, particularly in older patients. The importance of hiatus hernia as a diagnosis is uncertain. At three years, between one in three and one in five patients presenting with dysphagia received a diagnosis of gastrointestinal disorders, including gastritis, gastric ulcer, and duodenal ulcer, adding further weight to the importance of dysphagia as a warning sign for important upper gastrointestinal pathology.

Case report

Patient 1 is a 79-year-old White woman with an established diagnosis of clinically amyopathic DM with antitranscription intermediary factor 1-gamma (anti-TIF1-γ) antibodies and moderate skin disease for 4 years. She presented to the clinic with numerous purpuric macules on the scalp and frontal hairline with no scale and minimal erythema, most prominently on the frontal and bilateral parietal scalp (Fig 1). The patient had stopped taking methotrexate for 1 year prior to the appearance of the lesions. The lesions were mildly pruritic and fixed over time. These macules persisted for 3 years after resolving rapidly following the therapy with an investigational agent that was thought to interfere with interferon signaling.

Patient 2 is a 77-year-old White woman who was admitted for progressive dysphagia, oral ulcers, and cutaneous ulcers, despite being on azathioprine and prednisone treatment, with a recent diagnosis of DM. She presented with muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase level with evidence of myositis on magnetic resonance imaging and was found to have antibodies against TIF1-γ. She was diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. She was noted to have macular ecchymotic and purpuric papules and plaques on the hairline and lateral aspect of the face (Fig 2) along with other classic cutaneous findings of DM. The lesions persisted for 12 weeks until the patient ultimately passed away because of the complications of her cancer.

Patient 3 is a 54-year-old White woman with an established diagnosis of classic DM for 4 years. She had a stable mild skin disease that was being maintained on mycophenolate mofetil treatment, and she was found to have anti-TIF1-γ antibodies. While continuing this medication regimen, she noted the new appearance of purpuric macules that were clustered into a well-demarcated patch at the left angle of the jaw (Fig 3) in the setting of her chronic Gottron papules, mechanic hands, and Holster sign. The lesions remained fixed and eventually resolved after 6 months.

Clinical manifestations — HIV-infected children with AIDS most often present with progressive disseminated histoplasmosis (PDH), which is fatal if untreated, with prolonged fever and failure to thrive as uniform presenting complaints; reported signs and symptoms in children with PDH complicating AIDS are similar to those seen in PDH in otherwise normal infants and in infections in patients with other primary or acquired immunodeficiencies, including splenomegaly, cough, respiratory distress, hepatomegaly, septic appearance, generalized lymphadenopathy, interstitial pneumonitis, cytopenia(s), coagulopathy, oropharyngeal/gastrointestinal ulcerations, and erythematous nodular/ulcerative cutaneous lesions. In HIV-uninfected children, acute pulmonary manifestations are common and chronic pulmonary infections have not been described, airway obstruction from mediastinal lymphadenopathy is more common in children because of greater airway pliability, meningitis often accompanies progressive disseminated infection in infancy, subacute meningitis and parenchymal lesions characteristic of central nervous system disease in adults are unusual in children, and isolated pulmonary granulomas from past infection are common incidental findings in chest radiographs of asymptomatic persons who have resided in histoplasmosis-endemic regions.

Identification of Primary Tumor Site

History and Clinical Examination

The diagnostic algorithm for patients presenting with a cervical lymph node mass is driven by 2 objectives: (1) determine the histology of the nodal mass and (2) identify the primary tumor site. Thus, screening begins with a comprehensive history, noting for symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, hoarseness, otalgia, nasal obstruction, and epistaxis; the history of tobacco/alcohol use; sexual history, in particular of multiple sexual partners and the practice of oral sex, and of previous malignancy. As an example, a young man with no history of tobacco or heavy alcohol use, who presents with a high-risk HPV positive, unknown primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in an anterior level II/III cervical lymph node will likely have its primary squamous cell carcinoma hidden in the oropharynx, particularly in the palatine or lingual tonsils.

The history is typically followed by a complete physical examination of the head and neck, looking and feeling for mucosal abnormalities and skin lesions, and a flexible fiberoptic endoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract (nasopharyngolaryngoscopy).

Flexible endoscopy with narrow band imaging can complement the in-office fiberoptic exam, since it can better distinguish malignant lesions from normal mucosa by selecting for wavelengths of light that augment visualization of the microvasculature. Davaris et al demonstrated that narrow band imaging has a better sensitivity (93.3% vs. 77.0%, P < .05) and accuracy (96.3% vs. 92%, P = 0.001) in the identification of laryngeal malignancies when compared to flexible endoscopy with traditional white-light endoscopy. Narrow band imaging has also been shown to identify the primary tumor site in cases of unknown primary head and neck squamous cell carcinoma where the standard diagnostic workup was ineffective with an overall detection rate of 35% (99% CI, 0.18–0.53), a sensitivity of 83% (99% CI, 0.54–0.95), and specificity 88% (99% CI, 0.55–0.97). Furthermore, narrow band imaging endoscopy can also be performed transorally, in-office, and may complement the transnasal approach on the search of the unknown primary head and neck cancer. Ebisumoto et al reported a higher detection rate of oropharyngeal tumors with the combined approach, since the transnasal examination does not always provide sufficient visualization of the oropharynx.

NCCN Head and Neck Cancers — occult primary cervical node workup: Patients with a biopsy-proven carcinoma of a cervical lymph node require a thorough history and physical examination documenting cervical lymph node levels, and require dedicated imaging of the head and neck with contrast-enhanced CT; an FDG-PET/CT may reveal a primary site not visible on CT. When a needle biopsy shows squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or anaplastic/undifferentiated epithelial cancer without a primary site, high-risk HPV and EBV testing are recommended for squamous cell or undifferentiated histology, and p16+ unknown primary disease should only be considered HPV-positive with HPV-specific testing; patients with EBV- or HPV-related cervical adenopathy are staged according to nasopharyngeal and HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer classifications. Open biopsy should not be performed unless prepared for definitive surgical management that may entail a neck dissection, and core biopsy may be obtained when necrotic nodes are non-diagnostic.

### An unusual presentation of NK / T-cell lymphoma, nasal-type in the United States [^6bf01b0c]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

NK/T-cell lymphoma (NKCL), nasal-type is rare in the United States, representing only 1.5% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Classically, patients initially present with nasal obstruction (70%), caused by invasion of the localized lesion into the sinuses and nasal cavities. Initial presentation with persistent sore throat and odynophagia due to oropharyngeal tumor extension is rare, and thus, is often overlooked as viral or bacterial pharyngitis. By studying a case of NKTCL nasal type, we emphasize the need to apply high clinical suspicion for NKTCL, nasal type for early diagnosis and improved survival.

Methods

A case report of a rare presentation of NKTCL, nasal-type is discussed. A literature review is provided to define clinical signs crucial for early diagnosis, appropriate work-up, and expedient treatment of this aggressive, rapidly progressive malignancy.

Results

In the present case, a 25year-old healthy male presented with a 2-week history of sore throat and odynophagia. On exam, the patient had an ulcerative lesion of the soft palate, an enlarged uvula, and tonsillar exudate with tender submandibular lymphadenopathy. After the patient failed to respond to antibiotic therapy for presumptive pharyngitis, a biopsy of the oropharyngeal tissue was completed, which identified necrotizing sialometaplasia. High clinical suspicion led to repeat deep-tissue biopsy, where a final diagnosis of NKTCL, nasal type was made. The patient then began definitive treatment with chemotherapy and radiation.

Conclusions

High clinical suspicion is key to early diagnosis and improved survival of NKTCL, nasal-type. Otolaryngologists who encounter prolonged, complicated cases of pharyngitis or necrotizing sialometaplasia should consider a diagnosis of NKTCL, nasal-type, in order to prevent rapid disease progression.

We describe the case of a 35-year-old man who presented with a 4 x 4-cm ulcerated swelling over the hard palate that had progressed over 6 months. The lesion was associated with recurrent bleeding and occasional pain. Based on the lesion's clinical appearance and other characteristics (i.e., the slow progression, ulceration, and lack of regional lymphadenopathy), a provisional diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma was made, even though pyogenic granulomas of such size are rare. The mass was excised via a transoral route with a 0.5-cm margin of healthy mucosa, and the base was curetted. Histopathologic examination of the excised specimen confirmed the diagnosis. We discuss the etiopathogenesis of this entity and the various treatment options, and we review the relevant literature.

Cancer of the oropharynx — anatomy, nodal propensity, and staging distinctions are summarized: The oropharynx includes the base of the tongue, tonsils, soft palate, and pharyngeal wall, and the oropharynx is extremely rich in lymphatics; depending on the subsite involved, 15% to 75% of patients present with lymph node involvement. Oropharyngeal cancer that is p16-positive (ie, HPV-mediated) is a different disease than p16-negative cancer, and to take into account these differences, separate staging criteria were published for p16-negative and p16-positive oropharyngeal cancer in the 8th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual; in 2018, the Panel created separate algorithms for p16-positive (HPV-mediated) oropharyngeal cancer.

Head and neck cancers are relatively less common tumors, but with complex anatomic and physiologic relationships to the structures from which they arise. Multimodal management is required for advanced stage disease, while single modality treatment is usually sufficient for early lesions. Treatment paradigms have shifted toward more functional preservation of speech and swallowing, when possible. Increased use of radiation, systemic/targeted therapies and function-preserving surgical approaches have allowed for organ preservation without compromising oncologic outcomes in properly selected patients.

### Case of new-onset scleromyxoedema-scleroedema spectrum disorder in a patient with CLL [^0d9f9028]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Scleromyxoedema, a mimic of systemic sclerosis (SSc), is a rare progressive fibromucinous disease clinically characterised by symmetrical progressive skin thickening on the extremities and face. While scleromyxoedema has been described in patients with neoplasms, none has been described in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Here, we present a patient whose new-onset scleromyxoedema likely coincided with his CLL relapse.

A 72-year-old man with a history of CLL in remission for 2 years was admitted for a 3-month history of skin thickening, concerning for SSc. Patient's skin thickening started on his extremities and rapidly progressed to his face and trunk within 2 months, limiting his chest expansion and causing dyspnoea. He also had subjective fever, dysphagia and unintentional weight loss. He denies having Raynaud's phenomenon, puffy hands, arthralgia, sicca, cough or bowel movement changes.

Patient's CLL was diagnosed 6 years prior to the admission via flow cytometry (aberrant CD5, CD19, partially decreased CD20, decreased CD22, negative CD23, positive CD38, CD43, CD79b, CD200, kappa and negative lambda). Serum electrophoresis with immunofixation (SPEP with IFE) was not done at the time. When patient developed lymphadenopathy 2 years later, he was treated with ibrutinib and venetoclax, which drove his cancer into remission 2 years afterwards.

Patient's physical exam showed diffuse skin thickening around his glabella, cheeks, neck, upper back, trunk, bilateral proximal arms and thighs, and dorsal hands. He had no skin thickening in his fingers or ears, no digital pits or ulcers, and no lung crackles. Nailfold capillaroscopy showed no abnormal capillary loops.

### Gradually progressive dysphagia, reflux, weight loss,… [^d31083de]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

A 52-year-old man presented with dysphagia to solids and liquids that had been worsening gradually over the previous two years. He reported a choking sensation with gagging while eating, but drinking water helped wash the food down. He had unintentional weight loss of 100 lb. He also had a dry cough. He had no history of caustic ingestions. Before quitting 10 years earlier, the patient was a 40-pack-year smoker and drank alcohol heavily. The patient had no improvement with a trial of histamine H₂ blockers and proton pump inhibitors. On physical examination, he was obese but had normoactive bowel sounds and no oral lesions. The abdominal examination was normal. A barium swallow test was performed as part of the workup. Question Discussion The answer is A: esophageal achalasia, the inability of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax. People with this condition also have a lack of esophageal peristalsis.

Achalasia results from inflammation and degeneration of neurons in the esophageal wall. Although the cause is unknown, there is an association with an inflammatory attack on esophageal neurons in response to a viral infection such as herpes zoster, measles, or herpes simplex virus 1. 1, 2 There is a possible genetic predisposition to HLA-DQ. 2 Achalasia has an annual incidence of 1. 6 cases per 100, 000 individuals. 3 Men and women are affected equally. It has an insidious onset and is usually diagnosed between 25 and 60 years of age. 2 Patients present with dysphagia to solids and liquids, as well as regurgitation of undigested foods or saliva. 4 Patients may present with chest pain, weight loss, and reflux not relieved with acid reducers. Because the food is regurgitated from the esophagus, it is bland, unlike the sour taste that occurs with reflux.

Secondary achalasia has been associated with Chagas disease, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, neurofibromatosis, and eosinophilic esophagitis.
5. Esophageal manometry with findings of incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter and absent peristalsis of the distal two-thirds of the esophagus is diagnostic for esophageal achalasia. 3 Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is needed to exclude malignancy at late or end-stage achalasia. A barium swallow demonstrates the "bird-beak" appearance caused by the persistently contracted lower esophageal sphincter, as seen in Figure 1. Patients can progress to megaesophagus. Patients with esophageal achalasia have a slightly increased risk of cancer, but endoscopic surveillance is not recommended.
4. Esophageal adenocarcinoma commonly arises in the lower half of the esophagus.

Barrett esophagus, a condition characterized by metaplastic columnar epithelium that takes over the squamous epithelium in the distal esophagus as a result of gastroesophageal reflux, can lead to the development of adenocarcinoma. Esophageal cancer is more likely to present as a mechanical obstruction rather than dysphagia to solids. Ingestion of caustic substances can cause injury to the upper gastrointestinal tract, sometimes leading to esophageal stricture. Common alkali-containing agents are bleaches, drain openers, toilet cleaners, and dish detergents. Acid-containing agents include antirust compounds, swimming pool cleaners, and vinegar. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy is important for diagnosis and to detail the extent of injury. Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux disease include heartburn, regurgitation, and dysphagia. Patients have daily episodes of symptomatic reflux, including a sour taste, nighttime coughing, and hoarseness. Symptoms usually improve with antireflux measures.

### What is the prognostic impact of FDG PET in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma treated with concomitant chemo-radiotherapy? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^813e3af5]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Head and neck cancer is the sixth most common malignant tumour, with increasing incidence worldwide. In over 95% of cases, the disease arises from the epithelial layer of the mucosa lining the upper aerodigestive tract. Due to the absence of anatomical barriers, the abundant lymphatic drainage of the neck and the usually infiltrative pattern of growth of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), in about 60% of patients the diagnosis is made at an advanced locoregional stage. In order to maximize the likelihood of disease cure, multimodality treatment is usually needed. Therapeutic management is often challenging: both primary radical surgery and concurrent chemoradiotherapy are burdened with a high rate of posttreatment complications, acute and long-term toxicities and a marked detrimental effect on quality of life. Notwithstanding the refinement of treatment strategies that has taken place in last 20 years, the prognosis of HNSCC remains severe, with a cumulative 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of 45–55% in patients with locally advanced disease. The prevalent pattern of failure in the overall population is locoregional: about 50% of first events of relapse occur at the primary tumour site and/or in the neck, in the vast majority (about 90%) within the first 2 years after treatment.

Taking into account that the patient's outlook can be substantially influenced by clinical factors with large variability existing among the different subsites of disease, a series of common features contribute to the severe prognosis of locally advanced HNSCC; these include the suboptimal efficacy of the standard "one size fits all" multimodal approach, the large proportion of frail patients who are noncompliant with intensive therapy, and the absence of biomarkers. In this regard, the only notable exception is the human papillomavirus (HPV). In the last 15 years, a major epidemiological shift has taken place in western countries due to the rising incidence of HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer, reducing the dominance of the classical phenotype of HNSCC resulting from alcohol and tobacco-induced field cancerization. A positive HPV status was recognized as an independent favourable prognostic factor in a series of correlative prospective studies and in an unplanned secondary analysis of the randomized phase 3 RTOG 0129 trial. Overall, HPV positivity is associated with a reduction in the risk of death and disease progression of about 60%.

Head and neck cancers — operative mucosal evaluation and biopsy strategy for occult primary are delineated. A thorough operative examination of at-risk mucosal sites is an important component in the workup of a patient with an occult primary, especially in scenarios where CT or PET imaging do not reveal the primary site, with directed biopsies of areas of mucosal abnormalities suspicious for the primary site. Randomly directed biopsies of normal-appearing mucosa in potential primary sites have a low yield and seldom disclose a primary cancer. Many primary cancers are identified after tonsillectomy; however, the therapeutic benefit of this surgery is uncertain because, when patients have been treated without tonsillectomy, only a few develop a clinically significant primary tumor.

Head and neck cancers — prognostic impact of stage at diagnosis is emphasized, with small primary tumors typically defining early stages and higher TNM stages linked to worse outcomes. Stage at diagnosis predicts survival rates and guides care of patients with H&N cancers. In general, stage I or II disease defines a relatively small primary tumor without regional nodal involvement amongst HPV-unrelated cancers. More advanced TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) stages are associated with worse survival.
