## Question

THE BABY HAS 9 WEEKS

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what "9 weeks" means for a baby and what the key developmental and care implications are at this age. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether "9 weeks" refers to gestational age in utero or postnatal age. Then, I should verify the developmental milestones and normal ranges for a 9-week-old infant. Next, I will review feeding, sleep, and safety guidance. After that, I should consider red flags and when to seek care. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, practical summary with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the interpretation, because "9 weeks" is ambiguous in pregnancy contexts. If this is gestational age, 9 weeks' gestation is still in the first trimester and the embryo is transitioning to a fetus, whereas if this is postnatal age, we are discussing a 9-week-old infant and should focus on neonatal development and care milestones rather than prenatal development, so I need to clarify which the user means before proceeding [^90d8268d] [^e36361de].

> Wait, let me verify the developmental milestones for a 9-week-old infant. By about 2 months, most babies show social smiles, track faces, lift their head and chest during tummy time, bring hands to midline, and make cooing sounds; by 9 weeks, many are beginning to bat at objects and may briefly hold a rattle, though motor control remains limited and variability is expected, so I should emphasize ranges rather than rigid cutoffs [^873232b7] [^f2e79cbd].

> I need to check feeding expectations next. At 9 weeks, infants typically feed every 2–3 hours, totaling 8–12 feeds per 24 hours if breastfed, with formula-fed infants often taking larger volumes less frequently; growth spurts around 6–8 weeks can temporarily increase feeding frequency, so I should reassure caregivers that this is normal and not a sign of inadequate milk supply [^notfound].

> Hold on, I should verify sleep patterns. A 9-week-old usually sleeps 14–17 hours per 24 hours, often in 2–4 hour stretches at night with longer wake periods during the day; establishing routines and distinguishing day from night helps consolidate sleep, though many still need night feeds at this age [^notfound].

> Next, I should review safety and caregiving basics. Tummy time while awake supports neck and shoulder strength, but infants should always be placed on their back to sleep in a bare crib or bassinet to reduce SIDS risk; I should confirm that caregivers know not to shake the baby and to have a plan for managing crying, including safe space and brief breaks when needed [^873232b7].

> I will now examine red flags that warrant prompt evaluation. Let me think about thresholds: fewer than 6 wet diapers per day, persistent poor feeding, lethargy or extreme irritability, temperature of 100.4°F or higher in a baby under 3 months, difficulty breathing, or failure to gain weight appropriately should prompt urgent pediatric contact; I should double-check that these align with standard newborn guidance and emphasize the 100.4°F rule for infants under 90 days [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the phrase meant 9 weeks' gestation rather than 9 weeks postnatal? If so, I should pivot to first-trimester pregnancy counseling: confirm dating with early ultrasound, review prenatal vitamins and folate, discuss symptom management, and screen for risk factors; I should confirm that the first trimester extends to 13 weeks 6 days and that early dating ultrasound improves accuracy of gestational age assignment [^90d8268d].

> Let me reconsider and synthesize. Given the phrasing "the baby has 9 weeks", the more natural interpretation is a 9-week-old infant, so the key messages are: expect social smiles and early motor progress, feed on demand with frequent feeds, support safe sleep and routines, and watch for red flags such as fever, poor intake, or lethargy; if the user truly meant 9 weeks' gestation, I should confirm dating and initiate standard first-trimester prenatal care and counseling, but I will default to the infant interpretation here unless clarified otherwise [^873232b7] [^f2e79cbd] [^90d8268d].

At 9 weeks, a baby is in the **early fetal stage** (embryo to fetus transition) [^e36361de] and is about 2.3 cm long, with all major organs forming and the heart fully beating. The mother should have **early prenatal care** to confirm dating, screen for risks, and receive counseling on nutrition, supplements, and lifestyle [^notfound]. If "9 weeks" refers to a 9-week-old infant, expect rapid growth, early social smiles, and head control; follow routine pediatric visits, feeding every 2–3 hours, and safe sleep on the back [^873232b7].

## Gestational age: 9 weeks of pregnancy

### Fetal development at 9 weeks

- **Size and appearance**: The embryo-fetus is ~2.3 cm (0.9 in) and weighs ~2 g; limbs, fingers, and toes are forming, and the head is large relative to the body [^notfound].
- **Organ development**: Major organs (heart, brain, lungs, liver, kidneys) are forming; the heart is fully beating and may be visible on ultrasound.
- **Facial features**: Eyes, ears, nose, and mouth are developing; the embryo-fetus begins to look more human.
- **Movement**: Small, jerky movements begin but are not yet felt by the mother.

---

### Maternal changes and symptoms at 9 weeks

Common symptoms include **nausea and vomiting (morning sickness)**, breast tenderness and enlargement, fatigue, frequent urination, and mood swings. These reflect hormonal changes and the growing uterus.

---

### Prenatal care at 9 weeks

- **Confirm pregnancy and dating**: Use last menstrual period and early ultrasound to establish gestational age and due date [^90d8268d].
- **Screening tests**: Offer first-trimester screening for chromosomal abnormalities (NT scan, NIPT) and discuss options [^notfound].
- **Counseling**: Provide guidance on nutrition, folic acid, avoiding alcohol/tobacco, and managing symptoms [^notfound].
- **Ultrasound**: Consider early ultrasound to confirm viability, dating, and number of fetuses [^notfound].

---

## Infant age: 9 weeks old

### Developmental milestones at 9 weeks

- **Physical growth**: Rapid weight gain (~150–200 g/week); length increases ~2.5 cm/month.
- **Motor skills**: Holds head briefly during tummy time; pushes up on arms; hands are mostly fisted.
- **Sensory development**: Tracks objects with eyes; responds to faces and voices; startles at loud noises.
- **Social development**: Early social smiling; coos and makes sounds; recognizes caregivers.

---

### Feeding and sleep patterns

Feeding typically occurs every 2–3 hours (breast or formula), totaling 8–12 feeds per day. Sleep averages 14–17 hours per day, often in 2–4 hour stretches, with longer night sleep emerging.

---

### Recommended pediatric care at 9 weeks

Schedule a **routine check-up** to monitor growth, development, and immunizations. Continue vitamin D supplementation for breastfed infants, and reinforce safe sleep (back to sleep), tummy time, and car seat safety [^notfound].

---

## Potential health concerns at 9 weeks

### Pregnancy (9 weeks gestation)

Key concerns include **miscarriage risk** (highest in the first trimester), ectopic pregnancy, and hyperemesis gravidarum. Early prenatal care and symptom management are essential [^notfound].

---

### Infant (9 weeks old)

Watch for **growth concerns** (poor weight gain), feeding difficulties, reflux, colic, and infections (respiratory, ear, or gastrointestinal). Seek care for fever, lethargy, poor feeding, or dehydration [^notfound].

---

## Parental guidance and support

- **Education**: Provide resources on infant care, feeding, and development.
- **Support**: Encourage parental self-care, sleep strategies, and stress management.
- **Warning signs**: Teach when to seek medical attention for the infant or during pregnancy [^notfound].

---

At 9 weeks, whether referring to gestational age or infant age, the focus is on **early development**, routine care, and parent support to ensure healthy growth and detect any concerns early.

### Obstetric care consensus no. 8: interpregnancy care [^a1c66870]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Interventions to increase optimally spaced pregnancies — family planning counseling and contraception: Family planning counseling should begin during prenatal care with a conversation about the woman's interest in future childbearing. In the United States, 45% of pregnancies are unplanned, and one in three women become pregnant before the recommended 18-month interpregnancy interval. Contraceptive access and patient and health care provider knowledge are important enablers of adequate birth spacing, and counseling can include questions such as "Would you like to become pregnant in the next year?" or "When would you like to become pregnant again?" The counseling should include a discussion about birth spacing and its role in providing sufficient time to optimize health before the next pregnancy, and this optimization can improve outcomes for the subsequent pregnancy as well as across the woman's lifespan. Counseling should include a discussion of all contraceptive options.

### Prepregnancy counseling: committee opinion no. 762 [^bd3e9689]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). High credibility.

Prepregnancy counseling — infertility evaluation and ovulation timing — states that an ovulatory woman younger than 35 years without a clearly identifiable risk factor for infertility should be expeditiously evaluated if not pregnant after 12 months of unprotected intercourse, whereas a woman who is 35 years and older should be evaluated after 6 months, with strong consideration for evaluation and treatment upon presentation for anovulatory women or those with a clearly identifiable risk factor. Referral to a fertility specialist for males and females may be considered at any point if the infertility etiology, indicated treatment, or attempted treatment failures exceeds the expertise of the obstetrician–gynecologist. Monthly ovulation is likely with regular and predictable menses with no greater than 2–3-day variance within a range of 25–35 days; cycles every 26–28 days are likely ovulatory, whereas cycles of 25, 34, 26, then 35 days are likely not ovulatory. Patients desiring pregnancy should be counseled that the fertile window is intercourse in the 3–4 days before ovulation and that intercourse every 1–2 days yields the highest pregnancy rates, and although patients may inquire about ovulation predictor kits or electronic apps, these tools vary in quality and data on usefulness are limited.

### "I can guess the month… but beyond that, I can' T tell" an exploratory qualitative study of health care provider perspectives on gestational age estimation in rajasthan, India [^87567c91]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

On probing, all intrapartum care providers reported the use of corticosteroid drugs (dexamethasone) in cases of immanent pre-term birth. When asked how they identified instances of pre-term labour, they mentioned using some or all of the following, depending on what information was available: the pregnant woman's telling them that she is only seven or 8 months pregnant but experiencing labour pain, the LMP and EDD written on the client's chart, the size of her abdomen, and any ultrasound reports provided.

They will see the Mamta Card, LMP, EDD and the ultrasound report. They will ask the patient how many months pregnant she is. After checking all this they will know [if it is a case of pre-term labour]. (IP04, F, staff nurse)

When the patient is in labour and the EDD and fundal height are noted to be less, then we get to know about it [preterm labour]. Every woman gets to know when it has only been 8 months or 7 months. (IP01, M, MO)

Interviewer: How would you discover that it is a preterm birth?

R: Either by the report or by looking at her stomach as the stomach will be very small as compared to those of full term pregnancies. Also by checking the LMP, EDD and ultrasound reports, we can tell.

I: What documents do you check for their EDD?

R: Mamta card and ultrasound report. And the woman also tells that she is so and so months pregnant or that her EDD was that of a future date but she is having the pain now.

I: Is there any other way to find out?

R: The woman will be considerably weaker, she will be anemic. (IP04, F, staff nurse)

### Obstetric care consensus no. 8: interpregnancy care [^5de2c5fe]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

Interventions to increase optimally spaced pregnancies — family planning counseling and contraceptive guidance should begin during prenatal care and address disparities and patient-centered decision-making. Providing guidance to women and their families about the benefits of intervals longer than 6 months between pregnancies is emphasized, and women of lower socioeconomic status and women of color appear to be at risk of the shortest interpregnancy intervals. In the United States, 45% of pregnancies are unplanned, and one in three women become pregnant before the recommended 18-month interpregnancy interval. Counseling should begin during prenatal care with a conversation about the woman's interest in future childbearing and can start by asking, "Would you like to become pregnant in the next year?" or, for women in the immediate postpartum period, "When would you like to become pregnant again?" The counseling should include a discussion about birth spacing and its role in providing sufficient time to optimize health before the next pregnancy, and this optimization can improve outcomes for the subsequent pregnancy as well as across the woman's lifespan. Counseling should include a discussion of all contraceptive options (including implants, intrauterine devices, hormonal methods, barrier methods, lactational amenorrhea, and natural family planning). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use and U.S. Selected Practice Recommendations for Contraceptive Use can be used to facilitate evidence-based contraception counseling to meet an individual patient's family planning and pregnancy spacing needs. Counseling should use a shared decision-making approach so that the woman can make an autonomous and informed decision; health care providers also should ask what methods women have found to be effective and acceptable in the past, and be aware that family planning counseling may be perceived differently by women who historically have been marginalized and who have experienced coercive counseling and social policies.

Prepregnancy counseling — infertility evaluation timing states that an ovulatory woman who is younger than 35 years who desires pregnancy and who does not have a clearly identifiable risk factor for infertility should be expeditiously evaluated if she has not become pregnant after 12 months of unprotected intercourse, and a woman who is 36 years and older should be evaluated after 6 months. For anovulatory women and those with a clearly identifiable risk factor for infertility, strong consideration should be given to evaluation and treatment upon presentation.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2017–2018 [^b9d9c762]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Influenza vaccination in pregnancy — pregnant women are of special concern because they are at an increased risk for complications from influenza; any licensed, recommended, and age-appropriate trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated vaccine may be used, including recombinant inactivated vaccines (RIVs); however, experience with the use of RIVs in pregnant women 18 years and older is limited, because RIVs have been available only since the 2013–2014 influenza season; substantial data indicate that IIV does not cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman, although data on the safety of influenza vaccination in the early first trimester are limited; vaccination of pregnant women also provides protection for their infants, potentially for as long as 6 months, through the transplacental transfer of antibodies; one study documented infant risk reductions of 70% for laboratory-confirmed influenza and 81% for influenza hospitalizations in the first 6 months of life; and pregnant women may receive an influenza vaccine at any time during pregnancy.

### COVID-19 vaccination considerations for obstetric-gynecologic care [^c30cb106]. ACOG (2020). High credibility.

Maternal COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy — Pregnant women have historically been at an increased risk of severe disease, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and maternal death from COVID-19 infections; infants aged less than 6 months are at increased risk for severe COVID-19 disease, are not yet eligible for COVID-19 vaccination, and depend on transplacental transfer of maternal antibodies for protection; they continue to be hospitalized at higher rates than all age groups except adults 75 years and older, and COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy reduces the rate of symptomatic and severe COVID-19 resulting in hospitalization in the infant in the first 6 months of life; during the 2023–2024 respiratory virus season, mothers of less than 5% of infants hospitalized for COVID-19 were vaccinated during pregnancy; updated COVID-19 vaccines are particularly effective at reducing morbidity from COVID-19 complications in pregnant patients and their infants.

### ACOG committee opinion no. 762: prepregnancy counseling [^5c1109d8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion No. 762 — immunizations in prepregnancy counseling advises that women of reproductive age should have their immunization status assessed annually for Tdap, measles–mumps–rubella, hepatitis B, and varicella, and that all patients should receive an annual influenza vaccination. Adult women who have never received a dose of Tdap or whose Tdap vaccination status is unknown should receive a single dose, and Tdap vaccine should be given to all women during each pregnancy between 27–36 weeks regardless of prepregnancy immunization history. Human papillomavirus vaccination (HPV) and cervical cancer screening should be performed in accordance with current guidelines; HPV vaccination currently is not recommended during pregnancy but should not be avoided or delayed because a woman may want to become pregnant or may be actively trying to become pregnant, and if the HPV vaccine series is started and a patient then becomes pregnant, completion of the vaccine series should be delayed until that pregnancy is completed. Vaccinations for rubella and varicella should be given at least 28 days before pregnancy or in the postpartum period if not previously given; because two doses of the varicella vaccine are recommended and the CDC recommends that women not become pregnant for 1 month after being vaccinated, a woman who desires pregnancy should begin vaccination 2 months before attempting pregnancy. Some advanced-reproductive-age patients may wish to reproduce, and those age 50 years and older should also be vaccinated against herpes zoster.

### Influenza in pregnancy: prevention and treatment aug 2025 update [^d47432d0]. ACOG (2025). High credibility.

Influenza in pregnancy — vaccination timing and recommendations — The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly reinforces the recommendation that individuals who are or will be pregnant during influenza season receive the seasonally updated influenza vaccine at any time during pregnancy. Ideally, influenza vaccination should be given before the onset of influenza circulation in the community, but vaccination at any time during the influenza season is recommended to ensure protection during the period that virus is circulating in the community. In the United States, the influenza season typically occurs from September through April. Pregnant individuals who are in the third trimester as respiratory illness season begins should receive that season's influenza vaccine as soon as vaccines are available (usually August to September) to optimize protection for themselves and for their newborns, who will be delivered during influenza season. Inactivated influenza vaccines can be given to all pregnant individuals during any trimester of gestation, and pregnant individuals should be vaccinated even if they received an influenza vaccine during a previous pregnancy or in the previous year's influenza season. Because circulating influenza virus strains can change from season to season and antibody-based immunity decreases over time, annual vaccination is necessary to ensure optimal immunity with each influenza season.

### Post-COVID-19 condition in pregnant and postpartum women: a long-term follow-up, observational prospective study [^0b131a9a]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Post-COVID-19 condition has recently been defined as new or persistent common COVID-19 symptoms occurring three months after disease onset. The pathology of the disease is unclear, but immune and vascular factors seem to play a significant role. The incidence, severity, and implications of the disease after COVID-19 infection in pregnancy have not been established. We aimed to study the incidence and main risk factors for post-COVID-19 condition in an obstetric population and their implications for maternal and perinatal morbimortality.

Methods

This is a prospective observational cohort study undertaken including women during pregnancy or at admission for labour with acute COVID-19 infection from March 9th, 2020 to June 11th, 2022. The inclusion criteria were confirmed acute COVID-19 infection during the recruitment period, a lack of significant language barrier and consent for follow-up. Patients were clinically followed-up by telephone via semi structured questionnaires. The exclusion criteria were loss to follow-up, spontaneous miscarriage, and legal termination of pregnancy. Patients were classified into groups according to the severity of symptoms at onset. We included patients from the first six first waves of the pandemic according to national epidemiological data in Spain. We studied the incidence of post-COVID-19 condition and their main demographic, clinical and obstetric risk factors.

Findings

A total of 409 pregnant women were recruited at acute diagnosis, and 286 were followed-up. The mean time to follow-up was 92 weeks (standard deviation ± 28 weeks; median 100 weeks (Interquartile range: 76; 112)). A total of 140 patients had at least one post-COVID-19 symptom at least three months after acute infection. Neurological (60%) and cutaneous (55%) manifestations were the most frequent findings. The following profiles were identified as presenting a higher risk of post-COVID-19 condition: migrant women born in countries with lower Human Development Index; multiparous women; women with COVID-19 during pregnancy, mainly during the first and third trimesters, and in the first and second waves of the pandemic; women who had a higher number of symptoms; women who had a higher incidence of moderate and severe symptoms; women who required hospitalisation due to COVID-19 complications; and women who were not vaccinated before disease onset. We did not find any significant difference in perinatal results, such as gestational week at delivery, birthweight, the need for neonatal care or 5-min Apgar score, and newborns benefited from a high rate of breastfeeding at discharge. Women who were infected during successive waves of the pandemic had a significant and constant decrease in the risk of post-COVID-19 condition comparing to estimated risk in the first wave (OR: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.92). Symptoms tended to resolve over time heterogeneously. Symptoms of myalgia and arthralgia took longer to resolve (mean of 60 weeks and 54 weeks, respectively). In a small but significant proportion of patients, neurological and psycho-emotional symptoms tended to become chronic after 90 weeks.

Interpretation

At least 34.2% of obstetric patients from our cohort with acute COVID-19 infection presented post-COVID-19 condition symptoms. Demographic and acute disease characteristics as well as specific pregnancy-related risk factors were identified. This is the first study to assess post-COVID-19 condition in pregnant women. Further analysis on the biological pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 is needed to explain the characteristics of the disease.

### One-year follow-up of 18 women who infected COVID-19 while pregnant [^8e547c21]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Data about the sequelae of women who infected COVID-19 while pregnant are scarce. We aimed to describe the prevalence of symptoms, pulmonary functions, and radiological changes at a follow-up of 12 months in 18 pregnant women who developed COVID-19 at different gestational ages. Our results showed that most women who infected COVID-19 while pregnant experienced a progressive improvement of their symptoms within 12 months, however, some still had little COVID-related symptoms but without a reduced quality of life. All their 18 newborns were growing up healthy.

### Vaccination of pregnant women against COVID-19 [^74943e63]. NeoReviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Pregnant women are at increased risk for severe morbidity and mortality following infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), leading some countries to recommend vaccination of pregnant women against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These recommendations are based on studies conducted early in the pandemic, and thus, the pregnant women in these studies most likely did not have pre-existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2 at the time of infection. The susceptibility of pregnant women and their infants to SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of infection may be attenuated as the pandemic progresses and an increasing number of women will have pre-existing immunity (following natural infection or vaccination prior to pregnancy) during pregnancy. The reactogenicity, immunogenicity and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines administered in pregnancy may also be affected by the pre-existing immunity of pregnant women. Maternal vaccine trials should be evaluated in the context of their timing in the pandemic and interpreted based on the pre-existing immunity of pregnant women.

### International consensus guidance for management of myasthenia gravis: executive summary [^ea35df97]. Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for myasthenia gravis, more specifically with respect to pregnant patients, MGFA 2016 guidelines recommend to consider reassuring the majority of patients that they will remain stable throughout pregnancy, provided that their myasthenia is under good control before pregnancy; and if worsening occurs, it may be more likely during the first few months after delivery.

### Trastuzumab (Herceptin) [^aeb5ce2e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy Pharmacovigilance Program

There is a pregnancy pharmacovigilance program for Herceptin. If Herceptin is administered during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving Herceptin or within 7 months following the last dose of Herceptin, health care providers and patients should immediately report Herceptin exposure to Genentech at 1-888-835-2555.

Risk Summary

Herceptin can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of Herceptin during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Data]. Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if Herceptin is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of Herceptin [see Clinical Considerations].

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Monitor women who received Herceptin during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care.

### Prepregnancy counseling: committee opinion no. 762 [^6a745d01]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). High credibility.

Prepregnancy counseling — immunizations: Women of reproductive age should have their immunization status assessed annually for Tdap, measles–mumps–rubella, hepatitis B, and varicella, and all patients should receive an annual influenza vaccination; those who are or will be pregnant during influenza season will have additional benefits. Adult women who have never received a dose of Tdap or whose Tdap vaccination status is unknown should receive a single dose, and Tdap vaccine should be given to all women during each pregnancy between 27–36 weeks regardless of prepregnancy immunization history. HPV vaccination currently is not recommended during pregnancy, and if the HPV vaccine series is started and a patient then becomes pregnant, completion should be delayed until that pregnancy is completed; HPV and cervical cancer screening should be performed in accordance with current guidelines. Vaccinations for rubella and varicella should be given at least 28 days before pregnancy or in the postpartum period if not previously given. Because two doses of the varicella vaccine are recommended, and the CDC recommends that women not become pregnant for 1 month after being vaccinated, a woman who desires pregnancy should begin vaccination 2 months before attempting pregnancy. Those age 50 years and older should also be vaccinated against herpes zoster, and the need for other immunizations should be assessed during a prepregnancy visit by reviewing health, lifestyle, and occupational risks and administering required doses as indicated.

### Prevention of herpes zoster: recommendations of the advisory committee on immunization practices (ACIP) [^bcb44b78]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2008). Medium credibility.

Herpes zoster vaccine — pregnancy considerations and registry reporting include that zoster vaccine is not recommended for use in pregnant women, and women should avoid becoming pregnant for 4 weeks following zoster vaccination; having a pregnant household member is not a contraindication. If a pregnant woman is vaccinated or becomes pregnant within 1 month of vaccination, she should be counseled about potential effects on the fetus, and in most circumstances the decision to terminate a pregnancy should not be based on whether zoster vaccine was administered during pregnancy.

### Pregnancy intention, changes in pregnancy intention, and pregnancy incidence among female nurses in north America [^8b07732b]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Importance

Pregnancy intention assessment is a key element of preconception and contraceptive care. The association between a single screening question and the incidence of pregnancy is unknown.

Objective

To prospectively evaluate the dynamics of pregnancy intention and pregnancy incidence.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This prospective cohort study (the Nurses' Health Study 3) was conducted from June 1, 2010, to April 1, 2022, in 18 376 premenopausal, nonpregnant female nurses aged 19 to 44 years.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Pregnancy intention and pregnancy status were assessed at baseline and approximately every 3 to 6 months thereafter. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate the association between pregnancy intention and pregnancy incidence.

Results

A total of 18 376 premenopausal, nonpregnant women (mean [SD] age, 32.4 [6.5] years) participated in the study. At baseline, 1008 women (5.5%) were trying to conceive, 2452 (13.3%) were contemplating pregnancy within 1 year, and the remaining 14 916 (81.2%) were neither trying to conceive nor thought they would be pregnant within 1 year. A total of 1314 pregnancies were documented within 12 months of pregnancy intention assessment. The cumulative incidence of pregnancy was 38.8% in women actively trying to conceive (median [IQR] time to pregnancy, 3.3 [1.5–6.7] months), 27.6% in women contemplating pregnancy (median [IQR] time to pregnancy, 6.7 [4.2–9.3] months), and 1.7% in women neither trying to conceive nor contemplating pregnancy (median [IQR] time to pregnancy, 7.8 [5.2–10.5] months) among those who became pregnant. Women who were actively trying to conceive were 23.1 times (95% CI, 19.5–27.4 times) and women who were contemplating pregnancy were 13.0 times (95% CI, 11.1–15.2 times) more likely to conceive within 12 months than women who were neither attempting nor contemplating pregnancy. Among women contemplating pregnancy at baseline who did not get pregnant during follow up, 18.8% were actively trying and 27.6% were not trying by 12 months. Conversely, only 4.9% of women neither trying to conceive nor contemplating pregnancy within 1 year at baseline changed pregnancy intention during follow up.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cohort study of reproductive-aged nurses in North America, pregnancy intention was highly fluid among women who were contemplating pregnancy but relatively stable among women trying to conceive and women who were neither trying to conceive nor contemplating pregnancy. Pregnancy intention was strongly associated with pregnancy incidence, but the median time to pregnancy points to a relatively short time window to initiate preconception care.

Pregnancy and breastfeeding — treatment for tuberculosis is initiated whenever the probability of maternal disease is moderate to high because of the risk of untreated tuberculosis to a pregnant woman and her fetus, and although antituberculosis drugs cross the placenta, they do not appear to have teratogenic effects in humans; regarding pyrazinamide (PZA), We suggest that clinicians evaluate the risks and benefits of prescribing PZA on a case-by-case basis, and Certainly, PZA should be used when MDR-TB is presumed until the drug susceptibility testing results are known; if PZA is excluded from the regimen, a minimum of 9 months of INH, RIF, and EMB is used for most pregnant women with drug-susceptible tuberculosis. Breastfeeding is encouraged for women who are deemed noninfectious and are being treated with first-line agents, but drugs in breast milk should not be considered to serve as effective treatment for active tuberculosis or latent tuberculosis infection in a nursing infant; whenever INH is given to a pregnant or nursing woman, supplementary pyridoxine, 25–50 mg/day, is prescribed, and According to the AAP, supplementary pyridoxine (1–2 mg/kg/day) is also prescribed to exclusively breastfed infants, even those not receiving INH.

### Perceptions of pregnant women of reasons for late initiation of antenatal care: a qualitative interview study [^357c3160]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Misconception of the ideal booking time

Some women said that because the purpose of initiating antenatal care was to diagnose any problems that the baby may be having, the ideal booking time is after the first trimester when the baby is properly formed.

I know that it is normal [the ideal time] to come for antenatal clinic as from four or five months… at that time you can be able to know better how the baby is faring. (P13, married, age range 23–27, parity 2)

Many women did not have correct information on the ideal booking time due to misinformation from family members, or inadequate health education during clinics.

As I was growing up, my mother used to teach me all those things, that when a woman is pregnant, she needs to go for clinic from 4 to 5 months of pregnancy so that the nurses can know if the baby is doing fine (P2, married, age range 23–27, parity 1)

[The nurses] in the health talk [education] when I came here last time when I was pregnant [at five months] did not tell us that a pregnant woman should start clinic when she is just one, two or three months pregnant. I have not heard this before, it is very new to me. (P12, married, age range 23–27, parity 1)

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^08557807]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Pregnancy at age 35 years or older — epidemiology and risk overview — Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2020 data demonstrate a continued upward trend in the mean age of pregnant individuals in the United States, with nearly 19% of all pregnancies and 11% of all first pregnancies in women aged 35 years and older; the mean age at first birth in 2020 was 27.1 years compared with 21.4 years in 1970. Observational studies demonstrate that pregnancy in older individuals is associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes — for both the pregnant patient and the fetus — that might differ from those in a younger pregnant population, even in healthy individuals with no other comorbidities. Several studies suggest that advancing age at the time of pregnancy is associated with greater disparities in severe maternal morbidity and mortality. This document seeks to provide evidence-based clinical recommendations for minimizing adverse outcomes associated with pregnancy with anticipated delivery at an advanced maternal age and focuses on care for those with anticipated delivery at age 35 years or older within routine pregnancy care.

### Characteristics of women of reproductive age with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by pregnancy status-United States, January 22-June 7, 2020 [^f67b2f30]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

The findings in this report suggest that among adolescents and women aged 15–44 years with COVID-19, pregnancy is associated with increased risk for ICU admission and receipt of mechanical ventilation, but it is not associated with increased risk for mortality. This report also highlights the need for more complete data to fully understand the risk for severe illness resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women. Further, collection of longitudinal data for pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, including information about pregnancy outcomes, is needed to understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on maternal and neonatal outcomes. To address these data gaps, CDC, in collaboration with health departments, has initiated COVID-19 pregnancy surveillance to report pregnancy-related information and outcomes among pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. CDC will continue to provide updates on COVID-19 cases in pregnant women. Although additional data are needed to further understand these observed elevated risks, pregnant women should be made aware of their potential risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Pregnant women and their families should take measures to ensure their health and prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Specific actions pregnant women can take include not skipping prenatal care appointments, limiting interactions with other people as much as possible, taking precautions to prevent getting COVID-19 when interacting with others, having at least a 30-day supply of medicines, and talking to their health care provider about how to stay healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic. §§ To reduce severe outcomes from COVID-19 among pregnant women, measures to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection should be emphasized, and potential barriers to the ability to adhere to these measures need to be addressed.

### Obstetric care consensus # 11, pregnancy at age 35 years or older [^b4a41b59]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from 2020 demonstrate the continued upward trend in the mean age of pregnant individuals in the United States. Observational studies demonstrate that pregnancy in older individuals is associated with increased risks of adverse pregnancy outcomes-for both the pregnant patient and the fetus-that might differ from those found in younger pregnant populations, even in healthy individuals with no other comorbidities. There are several studies that suggest that advancing age at the time of pregnancy is associated with greater disparities in severe maternal morbidity and mortality. This document seeks to provide evidence-based clinical recommendations for minimizing adverse outcomes associated with pregnancy with anticipated delivery at an advanced maternal age. The importance and benefits of accessible health care from prepregnancy through postpartum care for all pregnant individuals cannot be overstated.

The second trimester fetal anatomic survey has continued to evolve over the past 27 years. This review will summarize the changes in the anatomic survey that have occurred and provide recommendations that serve to improve compliance with the components of the survey. In order to provide clarity and direction, the goals and limitations of the second trimester fetal anatomic survey should be defined. The visualization rate of specific fetal anatomic structures can be increased by specifying acceptable, alternative views. A single follow-up examination within 2–4 weeks of a fetal anatomic survey or before 22 weeks' gestation should be offered when specific components of the fetal anatomic survey cannot be visualized. The fetal anomalies that the anatomic survey seeks to identify should be defined along with an acceptable detection rate.

### Clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant and recently pregnant people [^587b98e4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was described in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. By March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization had declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic.

Despite the potential increased risks of COVID-19 for pregnant patients and their newborns, there remain significant gaps in knowledge on the clinical course of disease and the overall prognosis in this population. To date, studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy have primarily focused on hospitalized patients. Currently, there are limited data on longitudinal changes in symptoms over time and total duration of disease among the pregnant outpatient population, which includes the majority of patients with COVID-19. Data on clinical evolution are critical to guide and inform counseling and risk stratification for pregnant patients with COVID-19.

To evaluate the clinical course and disease outcomes of a nationally representative sample of pregnant patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, we launched PRIORITY (Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY) on March 22, 2020. PRIORITY is an ongoing prospective registry of pregnant and recently pregnant patients across the United States who are persons under investigation or have a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 test result. Participants are queried serially after enrollment about their test results and clinical symptoms. The objective of this analysis was to describe the clinical presentation of symptomatic pregnant people with SARS-CoV-2 infection over time.

### Vital signs: alcohol-exposed pregnancies – United States, 2011–2013 [^37f02d74]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol is a teratogen.* Prenatal alcohol exposure is associated with a range of adverse reproductive outcomes and can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs) characterized by lifelong physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities. FASDs are completely preventable if a woman does not drink alcohol while pregnant.

Methods

CDC analyzed data from the 2011–2013 National Survey of Family Growth to generate U.S. prevalence estimates of risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy for 4,303 nonpregnant, nonsterile women aged 15–44 years, by selected demographic and behavioral factors. A woman was considered at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy during the past month if she had sex with a male, drank any alcohol, and did not (and her partner did not with her) use contraception in the past month; was not sterile; and had a partner (or partners) not known to be sterile.

Results

The weighted prevalence of alcohol-exposed pregnancy risk among U.S. women aged 15–44 years was 7.3%. During a 1-month period, approximately 3.3 million women in the United States were at risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy.

Conclusions and Implications For Public Health Practice

Alcohol use in pregnancy is associated with low birthweight, preterm birth, birth defects, and developmental disabilities. Women of reproductive age should be informed of the risks of alcohol use during pregnancy, and contraception should be recommended, as appropriate, for women who do not want to become pregnant. Women wanting a pregnancy should be advised to stop drinking at the same time contraception is discontinued. Health care providers should advise women not to drink at all if they are pregnant or there is any chance they might be pregnant. Alcohol misuse screening and behavioral counseling (also known as alcohol screening and brief intervention) is recommended for all adults in primary care, including reproductive-aged and pregnant women, as an evidenced-based approach to reducing alcohol consumption among persons who consume alcohol in excess of the recommended guidelines.

### Effects of family conversation on health care practices in Ethiopia: a propensity score matched analysis [^8a747148]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Description of the family conversation

The Family Conversation is an informal meeting between a health worker and several household and community members who potentially play a role in the decision making around a pregnant woman and/or her newborn. The conversation was designed to engage close family members and relatives of the pregnant woman (such as her husband, her mother, mother in-law, elder sisters) who are expected to support her during pregnancy, labor, delivery and the postpartum period. It creates an opportunity to discuss issues such as birth preparedness and essential newborn practices with all these family members together. The conversation consists of two parts: an early visit when a woman is 4–6 months pregnant and a later visit when she is around 8–9 months pregnant. For the first visit, once a pregnant woman has been identified by the WDA or a HEW, a convenient moment is sought to get the family together. In the meeting, the HEW or WDA member, and sometimes both HEWs and WDA members together, provide education on favorable key actions by the household during pregnancy and in the first months of the newborn's life to minimize risks to mother and child. An important topic that is addressed in the meeting is the benefit of continued antenatal care for both mother and child. Families are encouraged to engage in antenatal care, including at least one visit taking place at the health center, and are talked through the appropriate timing of antenatal care. Other topics discussed during this meeting include the importance of good nutrition, the need to start saving money for the delivery, knowledge about danger signs during pregnancy and how to act if an emergency occurs. The HEW or WDA member discusses potential barriers to care with the families and they try to determine solutions jointly to overcome these barriers. The pregnant woman is given a family health guide as a reference booklet: this guide contains illustrated educational material around antenatal care, birth preparedness, delivery, postnatal care, danger signs, and early newborn care.

### "Is she pregnant with jesus? " exploring sociocultural obstacles to following medical advice in the context of stillbirth prevention in Nigeria [^7c52385b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Family attitudes to pregnancy health

Health workers highlighted that some families did not prioritise women's health in pregnancy, and made no efforts to minimise stress and maximise nutrition. In a setting where a woman was expected to do hard chores while pregnant, it might be difficult for the woman to advocate for her own needs and follow medical advice.

"In the morning, they [woman and her husband] will eat garri [granulated cassava]. After garri, they will go to the farm. When they come back, even without taking a bath, they will ask the woman to go and cook. With that stress in pregnancy, no good meal, financial problems in the family… it can lead to [stillbirth]." (CHW01).

Relatives who had been pregnant themselves were reported to maintain this cultural attitude by specifically objecting to any preferential treatment for another pregnant woman.

"But when the family, if all they know is to pass comments like 'She should go and cut up firewood, is she pregnant with Jesus? When I was pregnant, I was climbing things, I was climbing heights, so she should do chores'. (HHW09).

Families as maternity decision makers

In families where health decisions are not considered to be an individual matter, pregnant women are expected to defer to their husband, mother or mother-in-law. If another family member is the controlling decision maker, they may enforce traditional practices against a woman's will, such as avoiding any antenatal check-ups in the first half of pregnancy.

"Then she [pregnant woman] will be dying in silence o, because she is under the control of the mother-in-law or the relatives of the husband. So they won't allow her to go to the hospital. They will say it's too early. They will wait until six months or seven months… In the process, no routine drug o, no good diet o, no exercise o, nothing! No health education, so all those things affect them." (CHW01).

### Differences in pregnancy and perinatal outcomes among symptomatic versus asymptomatic COVID-19-infected pregnant women: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^aa5d8d68]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Due to previously noted maternal and neonatal complications with SARs and MERS; the concern of increased risk of maternal and fetal complications with COVID-19 has been high and since the start of the pandemic, multiple studies have focused on the clinical features and outcomes of pregnant women with COVID-19. New data on pregnant women affected by COVID-19 is emerging with each passing day, but it is imperative to evaluate the differences in the risk factors, management, and pregnancy and perinatal outcomes between pregnant women having laboratory-confirmed coronavirus with varying clinical presentation. Therefore, this systematic review aims to assess the difference, if any, in the risk factors (co-morbidities and ethnicity), management, and pregnancy and perinatal outcomes between symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 confirmed pregnant women. This shall enable healthcare professionals to plan out management for any obstetric patient affected by COVID-19 infection and take timely decisions.

### COVID-19 infection in pregnant women: review of maternal and fetal outcomes [^a8f4d822]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Pregnant women, their fetuses, and newborns are likely to represent a high-risk population during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Literature on the outcomes of COVID-19 infections during pregnancy is slowly building up. The aim of the present review was to gather evidence from relevant articles published in English from January to August 2020 in Medline and Google Scholar. The review revealed that pregnant women who become COVID-19-positive are usually either asymptomatic or mild-to-moderately symptomatic, similar to non-pregnant women. Pneumonia is one of the most common outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19. However, it cannot be conclusively said that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the risk of maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications. Pregnant women with COVID-19 with co-morbidities have increased risks of complications: there are regional variations in the rates of adverse outcomes reported. Though uncommon, the review shows that vertical transmission is possible. Additionally, the third trimester seems to be the most vulnerable period of infection. This aspect needs to be researched further to activate surveillance programs at the end of second trimester. Overall, it is necessary to monitor pregnant women before and after delivery, and their infants, during this pandemic.

-27 years old, primiparous, 10 weeks pregnant

Another woman (28 weeks pregnant at her first ANC) said she believed: "most complications are due to failure to begin antenatal care early." Another woman said she wished she had attended ANC earlier to:

"Learn the baby's condition and what is missing in the uterus to help it grow. They have told us that there are tablets they give to us at the beginning of pregnancy to nourish where the baby will be attached in the uterus, but I didn't get them."

-24 years old, nulliparous, 30 weeks pregnant

However, a few women believed that early ANC initiation was not necessary unless a woman was experiencing complications. Indeed, a few women said the only reason they had initiated ANC early in this pregnancy was because of physical symptoms that concerned them (e.g. stomach pain, headaches, or suspected infection). One study participant (28 weeks pregnant at first ANC) said she had been hospitalized for complications: "When they discharged me, the doctor wrote on my card, 'start antenatal'

Most study participants started ANC in their second trimester or later. Yet, when asked about their beliefs on the ideal timing to start ANC, many said they believed it should happen as soon as a woman finds out she is pregnant. Several women said women should come when they are 2–3 months pregnant. Others said the first ANC should happen at 4–5 months pregnant. Several women also rationalized that early ANC initiation would allow them to meet the expected 8 visits during the pregnancy. However, there were also examples of women who thought ANC could start at any time during pregnancy. One woman said:

"Women come at 4 or even 6 months. So, it depends on what the mother prefers. Some mothers prefer 2, 3 or even 7 months."

### Weight loss prior to pregnancy and subsequent gestational weight gain: prepare, a randomized clinical trial [^cea3e71d]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Women with elevated body mass index are encouraged to lose weight before pregnancy, but no trials have tested the effects of prepregnancy weight loss on health outcomes.

Objective

This study aimed to determine whether prepregnancy weight loss reduces gestational weight gain and improves pregnancy outcomes.

Study Design

Pragmatic randomized clinical trial was conducted between May 2015 and October 2019 at Kaiser Permanente Northwest, an integrated health system. Data collection was blind to condition assignment. Eligible participants were women aged 18 to 40 years with a body mass index of ≥ 27 kg/m 2 who were planning pregnancy within 2 years. Recruitment contacts were sent to 27,665 health system members who met age and body mass index criteria; 329 women attended screening visits, and 326 were randomized. They were randomized to either a behavioral weight loss intervention or usual care control. The intervention consisted of health coaching phone sessions weekly for 6 months and then monthly for 18 months or until end of pregnancy. We used logistic regression to examine the a priori primary hypothesis that participants in the intervention would be less likely to exceed National Academy of Medicine guidelines for gestational weight gain during each trimester and overall. Secondary and exploratory outcomes included absolute weight gain before and during pregnancy and perinatal and newborn outcomes.

Results

Of the 326 participants, 169 had singleton pregnancies lasting ≥ 14 weeks (analytical cohort: intervention, 89; control, 80). At baseline, mean age was 31.3 ± 3.5 years, and body mass index was 34.8 ± 5.8 kg/m 2. Participants in the intervention group lost more weight before pregnancy than those in the control group (-0.25 ± 0.51 vs -0.03 ± 0.21 kg/wk; P < .001). However, participants in the intervention group gained more weight than those in the control group in the second trimester (0.42 ± 0.26 vs 0.33 ± 0.28 kg/wk; P = 0.04) and third trimester (0.56 ± 0.37 vs 0.43 ± 0.33 kg/wk; P = 0.02) and overall (13.2 ± 8.20 vs 10.3 ± 7.41 kg; P = 0.03). Nevertheless, arms did not differ in rates of exceeding gestational weight gain guidelines at any time point. Spontaneous pregnancy loss was less common in the intervention arm than in the control arm (8 [4.9%] vs 19 [11.8%]; odds ratio, 0.39 [0.16–0.92]), but we found no other differences in the secondary or exploratory outcomes.

Conclusion

Participation in the prepregnancy weight loss intervention had no effect on women's likelihood of exceeding gestational weight gain guidelines. Although the intervention group successfully lost weight before conception, the intervention group was associated with greater weight gain in late pregnancy. To effectively reduce weight throughout pregnancy and improve maternal and child outcomes, prepregnancy weight loss interventions may need to be combined with intensive weight management that continues throughout delivery.

### Characteristics of women of reproductive age with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection by pregnancy status-United States, January 22-June 7, 2020 [^c440f5c0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

As of June 16, 2020, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in 2,104,346 cases and 116,140 deaths in the United States.* During pregnancy, women experience immunologic and physiologic changes that could increase their risk for more severe illness from respiratory infections (1,2). To date, data to assess the prevalence and severity of COVID-19 among pregnant U.S. women and determine whether signs and symptoms differ among pregnant and nonpregnant women are limited. During January 22-June 7, as part of COVID-19 surveillance, CDC received reports of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15–44 years) who had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Data on pregnancy status were available for 91,412 (28.0%) women with laboratory-confirmed infections; among these, 8,207 (9.0%) were pregnant. Symptomatic pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID-19 reported similar frequencies of cough (> 50%) and shortness of breath (30%), but pregnant women less frequently reported headache, muscle aches, fever, chills, and diarrhea. Chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease were more commonly reported among pregnant women than among nonpregnant women. Among women with COVID-19, approximately one third (31.5%) of pregnant women were reported to have been hospitalized compared with 5.8% of nonpregnant women. After adjusting for age, presence of underlying medical conditions, and race/ethnicity, pregnant women were significantly more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) (aRR = 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.2–1.8) and receive mechanical ventilation (aRR = 1.7, 95% CI = 1.2–2.4). Sixteen (0.2%) COVID-19-related deaths were reported among pregnant women aged 15–44 years, and 208 (0.2%) such deaths were reported among nonpregnant women (aRR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.5–1.5). These findings suggest that among women of reproductive age with COVID-19, pregnant women are more likely to be hospitalized and at increased risk for ICU admission and receipt of mechanical ventilation compared with nonpregnant women, but their risk for death is similar. To reduce occurrence of severe illness from COVID-19, pregnant women should be counseled about the potential risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and measures to prevent infection with SARS-CoV-2 should be emphasized for pregnant women and their families.

### Occupational radiation protection of pregnant or potentially pregnant workers in IR: a joint guideline of the Society of Interventional Radiology and the cardiovascular and interventional radiological society of Europe [^8db44fef]. Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2015). Medium credibility.

Regulatory requirements and other guidance — pregnant interventional radiology workers: After pregnancy declaration, the ICRP and the European Commission recommend that working conditions should ensure that the equivalent dose to the unborn child is ALARA and unlikely to exceed 1 mSv during at least the remainder of the pregnancy. In the United States, the NCRP recommends a monthly equivalent dose limit of 0.5 mSv to the embryo or fetus once the pregnancy is known, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance is 5 mSv during the entire gestation period, and the NRC has a regulatory limit of 5 mSv during the entire pregnancy of a declared pregnant woman. The NCRP does not currently believe that specific controls are required for occupationally exposed women who are not known to be pregnant, and in the United States workers who do not wish to declare their pregnancy are not required to do so. If worker activities indicate potential exposure of more than 1 mSv (annual effective dose), the occupational radiation protection program is required to have a fetal assessment program.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^ab551a6a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Pregnancy at age 35 years or older — timing of delivery in advanced maternal age: The rate of stillbirth at 39 weeks of gestation in women aged 40 years and older is nearly the same as that of women aged 25 to 29 years at > 41 weeks of gestation; therefore, delivery in well-dated pregnancies at ≥ 39 weeks of gestation for individuals aged 40 years and older should be considered. In the absence of additional maternal or fetal comorbidities, the evidence for elevated stillbirth risk in individuals aged 35 to 39 years is not sufficient to support a clear recommendation regarding timing of delivery beyond routine practice.

### Clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant and recently pregnant people [^e7c49189]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

It has been suspected that pregnant patients have a different clinical presentation of and morbidity from COVID-19 compared with the nonpregnant population. We demonstrate that the presenting symptoms in this primarily outpatient cohort of pregnant patients differ from those in nonpregnant populations, with a lower prevalence of fever and higher rates of fatigue, body aches, and headaches. Pregnancy also confers a prolonged course of disease for patients with COVID-19, where 25% of patients have persistent symptoms 8 weeks or more after disease onset.

### The clinical course of COVID in pregnancy [^006036ae]. Seminars in Perinatology (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses unique challenges to the medical community as the optimal treatment has not been determined and is often at the discretion of institutional guidelines. Pregnancy has previously been described as a high-risk state in the context of infectious diseases, given a particular susceptibility to pathogens and adverse outcomes. Although ongoing studies have provided insight on the course of this disease in the adult population, the implications of COVID-19 on pregnancy remains an understudied area. The objective of this study is to review the literature and describe clinical presentations among pregnant women afflicted with COVID-19.

### Management of early pregnancy loss [^7abd5efc]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on early pregnancy:

- **Definition**: Early pregnancy is a normal physiological event for a woman with a mean gestation period < 15 weeks (range of 6 to 24 weeks).
- **Pathophysiology**: Early pregnancy is a result of conception either naturally or following medical intervention.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of early pregnancy include nausea, vomiting, back pain, pelvic girdle pain, pelvic cavity pain, vulvar itching, varicose veins, pruritus, leg cramp, exhaustion, frequent coughs and colds, migraines, constipation, hemorrhoids, depression, anxiety, and vaginal bleeding. Vaginal bleeding may lead to spontaneous abortion.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: In the US, mortality associated with legal induced abortion is < 1 per 100,000 procedures.

### Integrating human-centred design into the development of an intervention to improve the mental wellbeing of young women in the perinatal period: the catalyst project [^6d327cc7]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

Although several (39%) were happy about their pregnancy and felt emotionally and materially supported, a sub-set of young women, particularly those with unplanned pregnancies, had mixed or negative feelings towards the pregnancy and the impact it would have on their lives and that of their children.

Well, I was not excited because the pregnancy was not planned. It was something that happened… Young woman, 3 months pregnant.

[I] think about how I'm going to give birth. If everything it's going to be okay or not. Young woman, 9 months pregnant.

How am I going to take care of the baby if I'm not working. Young woman, 5 months pregnant.

There is significant tension between continuing education and finding employment to support the household. A third of young women remained in school during and/or after pregnancy. This included mothers across the age range (e.g. 16–24 years). Six participants identified their pregnancy as the reason they left school. This was due to increased travel distances after moving in with their partner, fatigue, and perceived stigma associated with pregnancy at a young age. Five young mothers expressed a wish to return to school following their pregnancy. However, those in school and those who wished to return identified the need to work, lack of time, lack of childcare, and school fees as challenges to returning to school.

My concern is after I give birth, I don't know who the baby will be with when I go to school. Young woman, 9 months pregnant.

I don't know, if the second child accepts formula I will go back to school. I stopped studying because this one didn't accept formula… I couldn't leave him [at home] and go to school. Young woman, 4 months pregnant.

Four family members of young women highlighted the need for them to remain in or return to school. These families viewed education as the path to financial independence and part of their responsibility in supporting her through pregnancy and motherhood. A young women's decision to leave school may be viewed as a failure by her family and create a barrier to support. In all four families, the young women did not leave their homes to move in with her partner.

### Effects of breastfeeding education interventions during pregnancy on breastfeeding practices in rural south Ethiopia: a protocol for cluster randomized controlled trial [^e7e5b00c]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Population, intervention, control and outcome (PICO)

Population

Null-parous pregnant women who are in between the end of their first trimester and the early second trimester (< 16 weeks) of pregnancy, who have not given birth before (nullipara), who will give consent, and who have resided in the area for at least six months will be included. This is to allow at least five months to change behavior after the initial intervention. Women with a previous history of stillbirth will be excluded. Pregnant women whose mother-in-law died or was unavailable will be excluded. Pregnant women who have already received breastfeeding practice education interventions from previous trials, if any, will be excluded to avoid cumulative effects. During the study follow-up, in case participants experience adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes such as abortion and stillbirth, they will not be followed-up any more. Most of the time, women in their first trimester do not know whether they are pregnant, especially rural women. Thus, to confirm their pregnancy, we will do a pregnancy test using urine samples (HCG test). Before doing the pregnancy test, we will ask the women for the following information: when did a woman observe her last menstrual period; whether a woman is currently using any contraceptive method; if she has been tested and confirmed pregnant; and whether a woman feels that she is pregnant. Based on this information, we do register women for sampling. After sampling, we do a pregnancy test to confirm pregnancy. In case a woman or women are not pregnant, we substitute them from the registration and test them as well. We preferred these pregnancy testing procedures to minimize cost, as testing all potential women for pregnancy is not feasible. Once eligible pregnant women are identified, baseline data collection and interventions will be started.

### Tailored prenatal care delivery for pregnant individuals: ACOG clinical consensus no. 8 [^091e5487]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). High credibility.

ACOG Clinical Consensus — prenatal visit frequency and monitoring: Obstetrician–gynecologists and other maternity care professionals may tailor the visit frequency and monitoring schedule as determined by the medical and social needs of the pregnant individual. Prenatal care traditionally has been delivered using a visit schedule of 12–14 in-person visits, and three systematic reviews have demonstrated equivalent maternal and neonatal outcomes and an overall positive care experience with targeted visit schedules using 6–10 visits for average-risk individuals without medical or pregnancy complications. Though routine measurement of key parameters is traditional, in the absence of evidence, it is reasonable to continue routine measurement of these parameters at the same frequency as most in-person prenatal care visits for individuals not at increased risk of complications. No routine antenatal measurement of fetal well-being has demonstrated benefit for stillbirth prevention, and outside of select maternal or fetal conditions or specific indications for antenatal testing, there is no additional utility in checking fetal heart rate if the patient can confirm fetal movement. Individuals with chronic hypertension or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy may benefit from more-frequent blood pressure measurements. Fundal height is the primary screening tool for assessing fetal growth and should be completed with routine in-person visits after 24 weeks of gestation; if fundal height measurement is not feasible or there are other indications for ultrasonographic assessment of growth, ultrasonograms may replace routine fundal height measurement.

### Fetal size in the second trimester is associated with the duration of pregnancy, small fetuses having longer pregnancies [^29a3302b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2008). Low credibility.

Conclusion

To accommodate biological variation in fetal growth, customized and conditional models have been developed to individualize growth assessment. We believe that by accepting a greater biological variation of pregnancy duration than is imposed by the current ultrasound dating method, our clinical assessments may be founded on sounder biological principles.

### Trastuzumab and hyaluronidase-oysk (Herceptin hylecta) [^571ce6dd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Pregnancy Pharmacovigilance Program

There is a pregnancy pharmacovigilance program for HERCEPTIN HYLECTA. If HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is administered during pregnancy, or if a patient becomes pregnant while receiving HERCEPTIN HYLECTA or within 7 months following the last dose of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA, health care providers and patients should immediately report HERCEPTIN HYLECTA exposure to Genentech at 1-888-835-2555.

Risk Summary

HERCEPTIN HYLECTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. In post-marketing reports and published literature, use of trastuzumab during pregnancy resulted in cases of oligohydramnios and of oligohydramnios sequence, manifesting as pulmonary hypoplasia, skeletal abnormalities, and neonatal death [see Data]. Apprise the patient of the potential risks to a fetus. There are clinical considerations if HERCEPTIN HYLECTA is used in a pregnant woman or if a patient becomes pregnant within 7 months following the last dose of HERCEPTIN HYLECTA [see Clinical Considerations].

The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions

Monitor women who received HERCEPTIN HYLECTA during pregnancy or within 7 months prior to conception for oligohydramnios. If oligohydramnios occurs, perform fetal/neonatal testing that is appropriate for gestational age and consistent with community standards of care.

### Characteristics and maternal and birth outcomes of hospitalized pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-COVID-NET, 13 States, March 1-August 22, 2020 [^8b439b77]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

On September 16, 2020, this report was posted online as an MMWR Early Release.

Pregnant women might be at increased risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) collects data on hospitalized pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19; to date, such data have been limited. During March 1–August 22, 2020, approximately one in four hospitalized women aged 15–49 years with COVID-19 was pregnant. Among 598 hospitalized pregnant women with COVID-19, 54.5% were asymptomatic at admission. Among 272 pregnant women with COVID-19 who were symptomatic at hospital admission, 16.2% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 8.5% required invasive mechanical ventilation. During COVID-19–associated hospitalizations, 448 of 458 (97.8%) completed pregnancies resulted in a live birth and 10 (2.2%) resulted in a pregnancy loss. Testing policies based on the presence of symptoms might miss COVID-19 infections during pregnancy. Surveillance of pregnant women with COVID-19, including those with asymptomatic infections, is important to understand the short- and long-term consequences of COVID-19 for mothers and newborns. Identifying COVID-19 in women during birth hospitalizations is important to guide preventive measures to protect pregnant women, parents, newborns, other patients, and hospital personnel. Pregnant women and health care providers should be made aware of the potential risks for severe COVID-19 illness, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and ways to prevent infection.

### Clinical manifestations, risk factors, and maternal and perinatal outcomes of coronavirus disease 2019 in pregnancy: living systematic review and meta-analysis [^4d117b9e]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Study selection

Two reviewers independently selected studies using a two stage process: they first screened the titles and abstracts of studies and then assessed the full text of the selected studies in detail for eligibility. A total of 28 reviewers contributed to study selection. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (ST or JA). We excluded studies if the duplicated data for all outcomes of interest were published elsewhere, as reported by the study authors, or when the characteristics of the women or neonates matched the setting, characteristics, and duration of another study from the same geographical location. If there was an overlap of data or suspicion of duplicates of participants in studies, we included studies based on their study design (prioritising comparative cohorts), and sample size (larger study prioritised).

We defined women as having confirmed covid-19 if they had laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms. Women with a diagnosis based only on clinical or radiological findings were defined as having suspected covid-19. The recently pregnant group comprised women in the postpartum and post-abortion period. We included studies that compared covid-19 rates, clinical manifestations (symptoms, laboratory and radiological results), risk factors, and associated mortality and morbidity between pregnant and recently pregnant and non-pregnant women of reproductive age, and those that compared maternal and perinatal outcomes in pregnant women with and without covid-19. In studies comparing maternal and perinatal outcomes of pregnant women with covid-19 to those without, we classified the comparative controls as being historical if the cohort of pregnant women without covid-19 gave birth before December 2019. Studies on non-comparative cohorts with a minimum of 10 participants were included if they reported on the rates and clinical manifestations of covid-19 and relevant outcomes in pregnant and recently pregnant women. We defined cohort studies as those that sampled participants on the basis of exposure, followed-up participants over time, and ascertained the outcomes. The PROSPERO protocol provides a full list of the risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes evaluated.

Introduction

Vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 are highly effective in preventing COVID-19 illness. Research has found that COVID-19 is associated with adverse events in pregnancy, and recommendations therefore include offering SARS-CoV-2 vaccines to pregnant and lactating individuals, despite their lack of inclusion in initial clinical trials. To date, limited data on vaccine and pregnancy outcomes exist for SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in pregnancy and lactation. The objective of this study was to investigate experiences of pregnant and lactating individuals after receiving COVID-19 vaccines.

### Making birthing safe for Pakistan women: a cluster randomized trial [^cc41efec]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

The National Program for Family Planning and Primary Health Care (NP FP&PHC) has deployed a network of LHWs for delivering basic primary health care, with particular focus on reproductive health care through community outreach. Each LHW provides services to a 1000 population, and is paid a monthly stipend by the Programme. The LHWs, in catchment population of a health facility, are linked to the respective facility for regular material replenishment and technical supervision/support through the facility. In addition, each cluster of 20–30 lady health workers also receives field support from the respective lady health supervisor.

The LHWs are responsible for identifying and registering all pregnant women in their catchment population and encourage them to visit the nearest health facility for antenatal and postnatal care. In case the pregnant woman is unable to go to the health center every month, she is encouraged for at least 4 antenatal check ups during the pregnancy i.e. first visit during first 4 months, the second visit during 6 th and 7 th month and third and fourth visits during 9 th month of pregnancy. They also carry out the gate keeping role for the safe birthing services, by counseling, referring and facilitating their access to safe birthing services. However, the review of current arrangements shows that their enabling of pregnant woman is limited to information provision about service availability, with minimal work on actual "decision" and "action". This inadequacy in gate keeping role is mainly because the lady health workers lack the guidelines, tools and communication materials to cover all three dimensions of woman enabling i.e. information, decision, and action.

The proposed research will address this woman enabling gap by developing feasible and replicable guidelines and materials for the LHWs to provide each pregnant woman: a) adequate information about safe birthing and EmONC services, b) an opportunity for her to influence the selection of safer services to avail (i.e. from where, when and how), and c) an opportunity for her to get the agreed birthing and EmONC services planned/arranged in-advance for her well-being.

### Effects of breastfeeding education interventions during pregnancy on breastfeeding practices in rural south Ethiopia: a protocol for cluster randomized controlled trial [^1c9e5127]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Breast milk is the primary source of nutrition for newborns, containing both macro- and micronutrients. However, breastfeeding practices vary from setting to setting and have an effect on a newborn's growth and development. Ethiopian women frequently demonstrate poor breastfeeding practices due to cultural norms and limited access to health information. Null-parous pregnant women have no previous experience of breastfeeding, so they can easily be influenced by others, such as their mother-in-law, who are influential people in the family. Evidence from interventional studies regarding whether involving influential people like mothers-in-law in breastfeeding education interventions in addition to educating pregnant women alone improves breastfeeding practices or not is limited in the study areas. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of breastfeeding education interventions on breastfeeding practices in rural South Ethiopia.

Methods

A community-based, three-arm, parallel, cluster randomized controlled trial design will be conducted among 510 pregnant women who will be enrolled between the end of the first trimester and the early second trimester (< 16 weeks) of their pregnancy. The three arms are: pregnant woman alone, pregnant woman with her mother-in-law (paired), and pregnant woman in control arm (routine care). The study includes 51 non-adjacent clusters (kebeles) for the three arms. This helps minimize information contamination. We implement a simple randomization technique to allocate interventions and control clusters. Interventions will be given at home in eight phases: six times during pregnancy (monthly starting from the 4th month up to the 9th month), and two times after delivery (within one week and the last week of the 3rd month). The outcomes are pre-lacteal feeding, colostrum feeding, early initiation of breastfeeding, and exclusive breastfeeding.

Discussion

Recruitment is ongoing, and the final trial is expected to be completed on May 20, 2025. The trial results will have implications for the future involvement of influential family members, such as mothers-in-law, in breastfeeding education, which may improve good breastfeeding practices to enhance child health and survival.

### Severe maternal morbidity and mortality of pregnant patients with COVID-19 infection during the early pandemic period in the US [^aff6ea18]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

From the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in mid-March, 2020, through mid-February 2023, nearly 103 million cases and 1.1 million deaths were reported in the United States. Increasing evidence suggests that pregnant patients with COVID-19 infection are at high risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes.

Several studies have examined outcomes before and during the pandemic periods. National-level data comparing pregnancy outcomes with and without COVID-19-infection are limited but are clinically compelling. The objective of this study was to examine the patient characteristics and maternal outcomes associated with COVID-19 infection among pregnant patients at delivery during the early pandemic period in the United States.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^7f7fcf5d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Pregnancy at age 35 years or older — Given increased rates of multiple gestations for pregnant individuals with anticipated delivery at age 35 years or older, we suggest a first-trimester ultrasonogram. (GRADE 2C) The incidence of multifetal gestation increases with advancing age at the time of pregnancy, with twin births rising from 17 per 1,000 births in individuals younger than age 20 years to a high of 51.1 per 1,000 births in individuals aged 40–54 years, and a retrospective Belgium cohort (N = 41,618) reporting 2.8% at 25–34 years, 4.5% at 35–39 years, 5.5% at 40–44 years, and 10.9% at 45 years and older; the optimal time for determination of the number of fetuses is the first trimester and chorionicity in the late first or early second trimester.

### Increasing support for smoking cessation during pregnancy and postpartum: results of a randomized controlled pilot study [^2084c411]. Preventive Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Objectives

We examined the feasibility and effectiveness of an intervention to mobilize women in the social networks of pregnant smokers to support smoking cessation.

Methods

This study was conducted in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Columbus, Ohio, from 2005 through 2007. Pregnant smokers (n = 82) identified a woman in their social network to help them quit smoking. The resulting dyads were randomized to either intervention (n = 54) or control (n = 28) conditions. Supporters of intervention subjects received monthly contacts from a counselor about providing effective support; supporters in the control condition were not contacted. Interviews with subjects and supporters were conducted at baseline, end of pregnancy and 3 months postpartum.

Results

Compared with control subjects, intervention group subjects reported that their supporters had provided support behaviors more frequently and were more committed to helping them quit. There was a non-significant trend for more validated quits in the intervention group at the end of pregnancy: 13.0% vs. 3.6% among the controls. Quit rates decreased to 9.3% in the intervention group and 0% in the control group at 3 months postpartum.

Conclusions

Increasing the frequency and quality of support from a woman in the smoker's social network is a promising prenatal smoking cessation strategy.

### Your baby by two months… [^873232b7]. CDC (2024). Medium credibility.

What most babies do by this age: Social/Emotional Milestones
- Calms down when spoken to or picked up
- Looks at your face
- Seems happy to see you when you walk up to her
- Smiles when you talk to or smile at her Language/Communication Milestones.
- Respond positively to your baby. Act excited, smile, and talk to him when he makes sounds. This teaches him to take turns "talking" back and forth in conversation.
- Talk, read, and sing to your baby to help her develop and understand language.
- Spend time cuddling and holding your baby. This will help him feel safe and cared for. You will not spoil your baby by holding or responding to him.
- Lay your baby on his tummy when he is awake and put toys at eye level in front of him. This will help him practice lifting his head up. Do not leave your baby alone. If he seems sleepy, place him on his back in a safe sleep area.
- Look for signs your baby is full, such as closing her mouth or turning her head away from the breast/bottle. If your baby is not hungry, it's ok to stop feeding.
- Do not shake your baby or allow anyone else to — ever. You can damage his brain or even cause his death. Put your baby in a safe place and walk away if you're getting upset when he is crying. Check on him every 5–10 minutes. Infant crying is often worse in the first few months of life, but it gets better.
- Have routines for sleeping and feeding. This will help your baby begin to learn what to expect.
- Hold a rattle off to one side of your baby's head, shake it, and see if your baby looks for the noise.
- Practice staying calm when your baby is upset by talking softly, holding, rocking, or singing to her. This will help her calm down and lessen her stress and fears.
- Copy your baby's sounds and see how long your baby "talks" by making sounds back and forth with you.
- Place a baby-safe mirror near your baby so she can look at herself. She will begin to develop a sense of who she is.
- Look at pictures with bright colors or faces with your baby and talk about them.

### Sacituzumab govitecan (Trodelvy) [^3b2b8ad9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action, TRODELVY can cause teratogenicity and/or embryo-fetal lethality when administered to a pregnant woman. TRODELVY contains a genotoxic component, SN-38, and targets rapidly dividing cells [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) and Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. Advise pregnant women and females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRODELVY and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise male patients with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with TRODELVY and for 3 months after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.3)].

### Characteristics and maternal and birth outcomes of hospitalized pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-COVID-NET, 13 States, March 1-August 22, 2020 [^1f6721f2]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2020). Medium credibility.

Pregnant women might be at increased risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (1,2). The COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) (3) collects data on hospitalized pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19; to date, such data have been limited. During March 1-August 22, 2020, approximately one in four hospitalized women aged 15–49 years with COVID-19 was pregnant. Among 598 hospitalized pregnant women with COVID-19, 54.5% were asymptomatic at admission. Among 272 pregnant women with COVID-19 who were symptomatic at hospital admission, 16.2% were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU), and 8.5% required invasive mechanical ventilation. During COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, 448 of 458 (97.8%) completed pregnancies resulted in a live birth and 10 (2.2%) resulted in a pregnancy loss. Testing policies based on the presence of symptoms might miss COVID-19 infections during pregnancy. Surveillance of pregnant women with COVID-19, including those with asymptomatic infections, is important to understand the short- and long-term consequences of COVID-19 for mothers and newborns. Identifying COVID-19 in women during birth hospitalizations is important to guide preventive measures to protect pregnant women, parents, newborns, other patients, and hospital personnel. Pregnant women and health care providers should be made aware of the potential risks for severe COVID-19 illness, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and ways to prevent infection.

### Analysis of vaccine reactions after COVID-19 vaccine booster doses among pregnant and lactating individuals [^0f82ec2e]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

COVID-19 vaccine boosters or third doses are recommended for adolescents and adults who completed their initial COVID-19 vaccine course more than 5 months prior. Minimal data are available on COVID-19 vaccine booster or third dose reactogenicity among pregnant and lactating individuals.

Objective

To describe the reactions to the booster or third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine experiences among pregnant and lactating individuals.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Beginning in October 2021, a follow-up Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) survey regarding a COVID-19 vaccine booster or third dose was sent to 17 504 participants in an ongoing online prospective cohort study on COVID-19 vaccines among pregnant and lactating individuals. A convenience sample of adults enrolled in the online prospective study who were pregnant, lactating, or neither pregnant nor lactating at the time of their booster or third dose was eligible for this follow-up survey; 17 014 (97.2%) completed the follow-up survey.

Exposure

Receipt of a booster or third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Self-reported vaccine reactions less than 24 hours after the dose.

Results

As of April 4, 2022, 17 014 eligible participants (mean [SD] age, 33.3 [3.5] years) responded to the booster or third dose survey; of these, 2009 (11.8%) were pregnant at the time of their booster or third dose, 10 279 (60.4%) were lactating, and 4726 (27.8%) were neither pregnant nor lactating. After a COVID-19 booster or third dose, most individuals (14 074 of 17 005 [82.8%]) reported a local reaction, and 11 542 of 17 005 (67.9%) reported at least 1 systemic symptom. Compared with individuals who were neither pregnant nor lactating, pregnant participants were more likely to report any local reaction to a COVID-19 booster or third dose (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0–1.4; P = 0.01) but less likely to report any systemic reaction (aOR, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.6–0.8; P < .001). Most pregnant (1961 of 2009 [97.6%]) and lactating (9866 of 10 277 [96.0%]) individuals reported no obstetric or lactation concerns after vaccination.

Conclusions and Relevance

This study suggests that COVID-19 vaccine boosters or third doses were well tolerated among pregnant and lactating individuals. Data to evaluate tolerability of boosters or additional doses among pregnant and lactating individuals will be important as they are considered for these populations.

### RETIRED: determination of gestational age by ultrasound [^0efd60d0]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for early pregnancy, more specifically with respect to imaging follow-up, SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend to consider follow-up of interval growth 2 to 3 weeks following the ultrasound. Confirmation of an accurate due date is difficult when the assignment of gestational age is based on a third-trimester ultrasound.

### Use of pregnancy ultrasound before the 19th week scan: an analytical study based on the icelandic childbirth and health cohort [^e7ad7a8f]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Why do women attend ultrasound scans in the early phases of pregnancy?

Several studies have shown that visualization of a living, thriving foetus might represent the most prominent motivation for attending an ultrasound scan, in addition to confirming and dating the pregnancy. Since the scan as such has strong appeal to many people, it can be hard to disentangle its biomedical purposes from the human wish to simply 'see' the foetus. Scanning technology might thereby contribute substantially to shaping the culture surrounding even low-risk pregnancies.

### Perceived causes of adverse pregnancy outcomes and remedies adopted by kalenjin women in rural Kenya [^4052e50a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Some respondents felt that fetching water from an open well is risky; a woman might lose her balance and fall into the well. Collecting water from the well is discouraged in the first 4 months of pregnancy, because at this stage, pregnancy is still considered immature hence fragile and easy to abort. Thus, such activity can be undertaken after a pregnancy is 5 months or more. A pregnant woman may also carry a light load (10 kg or less) that she can easily lift without being assisted.

Sometimes there are women when giving birth, legs of the baby come out first instead of the head or those who experience severe cramps during menses. Such a woman should not assist you in lifting the load to your head or back when you are pregnant. You will also give birth like her or have an abortion.

A pregnant woman is also advised to abstain from having sexual intercourse, as reported by 24% of the respondents. However, the period of abstinence varied; to some, abstinence should begin the moment you realise you are pregnant, to others from 6 months onwards. The semen is believed to make the baby dirty, because it sticks on the baby's skin and scalp, creating a white substance. Thus, the baby must be washed with herbs for several days to clear it off. The "semen" is also believed to be dangerous for the foetus because it is thought to block the nasal passages and this could make breathing difficult and subsequently cause death. It is also thought that the "semen" can be swallowed by the foetus and remain stuck in the chest, causing a wheezing chest. The condition is believed to be more dangerous if the baby is a boy because males are considered less active in the uterus and cannot wash it off into the amniotic fluid. A woman who did not abstain from sex will be detected during birth because "she will be messy with semen" and nobody will be willing to assist her delivery, including the midwife. Instead, they will use plastic bags as gloves in assisting delivery, and the woman and her husband will be abused and ostracised.

### Clinical presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnant and recently pregnant people [^01c1a420]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To describe the clinical presentation, symptomology, and disease course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in pregnancy.

Methods

The PRIORITY (Pregnancy CoRonavIrus Outcomes RegIsTrY) study is an ongoing nationwide prospective cohort study of people in the United States who are pregnant or up to 6 weeks postpregnancy with known or suspected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. We analyzed the clinical presentation and disease course of COVID-19 in participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and reported symptoms at the time of testing.

Results

Of 991 participants enrolled from March 22, 2020, until July 10, 2020, 736 had symptoms of COVID-19 at the time of testing; 594 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and 142 tested negative in this symptomatic group. Mean age was 31.3 years (SD 5.1), and 37% will nulliparous. Ninety-five percent were outpatients. Participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-infection were a geographically diverse cohort: 34% from the Northeast, 25% from the West, 21% from the South, and 18% from the Midwest. Thirty-one percent of study participants were Latina, and 9% were Black. The average gestational age at enrollment was 24.1 weeks, and 13% of participants were enrolled after pregnancy. The most prevalent first symptoms in the cohort of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection were cough (20%), sore throat (16%), body aches (12%), and fever (12%). Median time to symptom resolution was 37 days (95% CI 35–39). One quarter (25%) of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection had persistent symptoms 8 or more weeks after symptom onset.

Conclusion

COVID-19 has a prolonged and nonspecific disease course during pregnancy and in the 6 weeks after pregnancy.

### The international glossary on infertility and fertility care, 2017 [^e36361de]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Medium credibility.

International Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care, 2017 — Consensus definitions for assisted reproductive technology (ART) and pregnancy terms are provided. Fetus is defined as the stages of development of an organism from eight completed weeks of fertilization (equivalent to 10 weeks of gestational age) until the end of pregnancy. Full-term birth is defined as a birth that takes place between 37 and 42 completed weeks of gestational age. Gestational age in ART is calculated by adding two weeks (14 days) to the number of completed weeks since fertilization, and for frozen-thawed embryo transfer (FET) cycles an estimated date of fertilization is computed by subtracting the combined number of days an embryo was in culture pre-cryopreservation and post-thaw/-warm, from the transfer date of the FET cycle. High-order multiple births are the complete expulsion or extraction from their mother of three or more fetuses, after 22 completed weeks of gestational age, and high-order multiple gestation is a pregnancy with three or more embryos or fetuses. Haploidy is the condition in which a cell has one set of each of the 23 single chromosomes, and mature human gametes are haploid, each having 23 single chromosomes. Heterotopic pregnancy is concurrent pregnancy involving at least one embryo implanted in the uterine cavity and at least one implanted outside of the uterine cavity. Implantation is the attachment and subsequent penetration by a zona-free blastocyst into the endometrium (or, in ectopic pregnancy, into tissue outside the uterine cavity), and this process starts 5 to 7 days after fertilization of the oocyte. Implantation rate is the number of gestational sacs observed divided by the number of embryos transferred (usually expressed as a percentage, %). A Freeze-all cycle is an ART cycle in which, after oocyte aspiration, all oocytes and/or embryos are cryopreserved and no oocytes and/or embryos are transferred to a woman in that cycle.

### Pregnancy at age 35 years or older: ACOG obstetric care consensus no. 11 [^01800038]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Pregnancy at age 35 years or older — stillbirth risk and antenatal fetal surveillance: For ongoing pregnancies 37 to 41 weeks of gestation, the risk of stillbirth was 1 in 382 for women aged 35 to 39 years and 1 in 267 for women 40 years and older; the cumulative risk of stillbirth per 1000 pregnancies through 41 weeks was 6.2 in those younger than aged 35 years, 7.9 in those aged 35 to 39 years, and 12.8 in those aged 40 years and older, and by 41 weeks the risk ratio (RR) for stillbirth was higher for those aged ≥ 40 years compared with those younger than age 35 years. Stillbirth risk for women aged older than 40 years begins to increase at 34 weeks of gestation, with the greatest rise in risk occurring at ≥ 39 weeks of gestation. On the basis of data and existing studies, it is reasonable to initiate antenatal fetal surveillance between 32 and 36 weeks of gestation, although there are no data on which to base recommendations regarding the timing and frequency of antenatal surveillance. Available data support offering antenatal fetal surveillance for pregnant individuals with anticipated delivery at the age of older than 40 years; however, for individuals aged 35 to 39 years, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine antenatal fetal surveillance in the absence of other risk factors for stillbirth, and whether to offer surveillance should be individualized.

### Influence of exercise mode on pregnancy outcomes: ENHANCED by mom project [^b0db3ec0]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The extent of the benefits of exercise training during pregnancy on maternal, fetal, and neonatal health outcomes has not been sufficiently addressed. While aerobic exercise training has been determined as safe and efficacious throughout pregnancy, the effects of other training modes on fetal health and development as well as any continued benefits for the neonate, especially with regards to cardiovascular development and function, is largely unknown. In the ENHANCED by Mom study we aim to determine the effects of different modes of exercise training (aerobic, circuit, and resistance) throughout pregnancy on childhood health by controlling individual exercise programs and assessing the effects of each on fetal and neonatal health adaptations.

Methods/Design

ENHANCED by mom is a cross sectional comparison study utilizing 3 intervention groups in comparison to a control group. Participants will complete three 5 min warmup + 45 min sessions weekly from 16 weeks to 36 weeks gestation of aerobic, resistance, or circuit training, in comparison to non-exercising controls. Maternal physical measurements will occur every 4 weeks throughout the intervention period. Fetal morphometric and heart measurements will occur at 34 weeks gestation. Neonatal measurements will be acquired at birth and at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months.

Discussion

A better understanding on the effects of exercise training during pregnancy on fetal and neonatal health could have a profound impact on the prevention and development of chronic diseases such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 6 family travel [^72d033b1]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Pregnant travelers — malaria risk and prophylaxis: Malaria, caused by Plasmodium spp. parasites transmitted by mosquitoes, can be much more serious in pregnant than in non-pregnant women and is associated with high risks of illness and death for both mother and fetus. Pregnant women should avoid or delay travel to malaria-endemic areas if possible because no prophylactic regimen provides complete protection; if travel is unavoidable, the pregnant woman should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites and use an effective prophylactic regimen. Chloroquine is the drug of choice for pregnant travelers going to destinations with chloroquine-sensitive Plasmodium spp., and mefloquine is the drug of choice for pregnant travelers going to destinations with chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium spp. Doxycycline is contraindicated because of teratogenic effects on the fetus after the fourth month of pregnancy. Primaquine and tafenoquine are contraindicated in pregnancy because the infant cannot be tested for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, putting the infant at risk for hemolytic anemia. Atovaquone-proguanil is not recommended because of lack of safety data.

### Sociocultural determinants of nomadic women's utilization of assisted childbirth in gossi, Mali: a qualitative study [^152a60ac]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

During pregnancy

For many participants, pregnancy is a normal, even unavoidable process. All eyes in the community are turned toward married women waiting for pregnancy: "Pregnancy is a normal phenomenon for us women. All women are supposed to get pregnant. " (Aicha, 22).

According to them, the femininity of women and their status as wives are confirmed only through their ability to get pregnant. But beyond that, the fact of not being able to get pregnant could even create problems within the couple: " Pregnancies are part of our life as a woman even if they make us tired. Married woman are expected to give birth. The opposite would be very frowned upon and could even be problematic. " (Ami, 38).

Paradoxically, the participants affirm that their pregnancy is often hidden, especially during the first months, because they feel ashamed of having gotten pregnant insofar as this implies the performance of a sexual act, which is a taboo topic of conversation, even with one's husband:

Even if I am pregnant, I cannot talk to people; it is a source of shame otherwise. They must understand by themselves. I do not tell my husband because I do not know what he may think. I do not know if he is aware of what happened to me; we do not talk about it. (Lalla, 20)

Several participants admit that the neighbors can imagine that a woman is pregnant when she shows some signs, but this will only be confirmed when there is a change in the parturient's body (visible belly). Typical subterfuge includes keeping the pregnancy secret for several months, which can delay recourse to maternal care.

Once considered pregnant, the woman is viewed as fragile and vulnerable. As such, she receives special attention and measures including the use of healthcare facilities to protect her and enable completion of pregnancy: " Once she becomes pregnant, a woman is considered a fragile human being. People pay close attention to her so that the pregnancy will succeed. If we feel that she needs something, we must give it to her very quickly; otherwise she risks aborting. " (Mariama, 33).

### Exploring antenatal education content for couples in blantyre, Malawi [^3c11c14b]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2018). Low credibility.

Description of pregnancy

A few participants felt that couples should be taught about pregnancy including the changes which occur when one is pregnant. Furthermore, the participants had the view that with education, men will become knowledgeable and understanding about pregnancy issues. This would lead to men providing the needed support to their spouses as summarized in the quotes below:

"They need also to know what happens to the woman when she's pregnant psychologically. This woman she should be okay because if they don't know the physiology of pregnancy, the process of pregnancy, it will be difficult for the men to support their wives". Key Informant No 6 (KI No 6).

"I would love to know what happens during pregnancy… so I want that topic that when a woman gets pregnant…" Focus group male (FGM) Mpemba p4.

Care of a pregnant woman

Most of the participants mentioned care of a pregnant woman as an important factor. The participants expressed that caring for a pregnant woman as a topic was core because it would yield a healthy baby. They went into detail with nutrition and a few participants mentioned rest and emotional care as depicted in the quotes below:

"First we need to have information on the nutritional requirements for the pregnant woman because a healthy baby will come from a mother who is well fed". Couple (Husband) p 10 "I heard that they [pregnant women] require rest and should not do hard work, they should be made happy… so that after nine months we have a better outcome". FGM, South Lunzu (SL) p5.

"Men should be taught how they can take care of pregnant women". FGF, Mpemba p3.
