## Question

Management of osteoporotic fractures

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of osteoporotic fractures. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why osteoporotic fractures matter. Then, I should verify the immediate priorities after a fracture, including stabilization and pain control. Next, I will review how to assess fracture risk and when to start pharmacotherapy. After that, I need to check first-line and second-line drug choices, sequencing, and duration, including drug holidays. I will then examine special populations such as men and very high-risk patients. I should also consider nonpharmacologic measures, including falls prevention and exercise. Finally, I will address surgical decision-making for vertebral compression fractures and close with a concise, actionable algorithm and key takeaways, ensuring each step aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and burden of disease, because I need to ensure we are framing this correctly before proposing management steps. Osteoporotic fractures are common, underrecognized, and carry high morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 9 million occurring annually worldwide and a 1-year mortality after hip fracture around 23–33%, underscoring the urgency of secondary fracture prevention and the existence of a substantial osteoporosis care gap after a first fracture [^111Qi7YL] [^1146zkPD].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about treatment before stabilization. I should confirm that the immediate priorities after a fragility fracture are accurate diagnosis, pain control, and stabilization of the injured site, with early mobilization to mitigate complications of immobility; for vertebral compression fractures, most are stable and managed conservatively, though a subset may require intervention if pain is refractory or deformity progresses, so I need to keep both pathways in mind [^113FHvaY].

> Next, I should review how to assess fracture risk, because treatment decisions hinge on this. I need to check that we integrate clinical risk factors with BMD and, when appropriate, FRAX to estimate absolute fracture risk; thresholds commonly used in the U.S. include treating postmenopausal women with T-score ≤ −2.5, those with prior hip or vertebral fracture, or those with T-score between −1.0 and −2.5 with FRAX 10-year major osteoporotic fracture risk ≥ 20% or hip fracture risk ≥ 3%, and I should remember that many guidelines still overemphasize BMD rather than fracture risk, which I must correct in my own practice [^113r3Juw] [^116aJnmH].

> I will now examine when to initiate pharmacotherapy, and I should double-check that recent fracture status changes the calculus. Any patient with a recent fragility fracture is at very high near-term risk of a second fracture, so I should initiate treatment without delay, ideally within weeks to a few months after the incident fracture, aligning with Endocrine Society and AACE/ACE guidance to treat high-risk patients, especially after a recent fracture [^111tyf1K] [^115tDq76].

> Let me think about first-line therapy selection, and I should confirm the hierarchy across major guidelines. Bisphosphonates remain first-line for most patients because of robust fracture risk reduction and favorable safety profiles; ACP 2024 recommends alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronate as initial therapy, while ACOG 2022 also supports bisphosphonates as initial therapy, and the Endocrine Society includes bisphosphonates among effective options with acceptable risk–benefit, so I should default to an oral bisphosphonate when feasible [^115beCmp] [^116wYaJN] [^111GQpXR].

> Wait, let me verify the role of denosumab, because I recall conflicting preferences. ACOG 2022 allows denosumab as initial therapy, particularly for patients who prefer 6-month subcutaneous dosing or have adherence challenges with oral therapy, whereas ACP 2024 positions denosumab as a second-line alternative when bisphosphonates are contraindicated or not tolerated. I should reconcile this by individualizing to patient preference, adherence, renal function, and oral tolerance while acknowledging both are acceptable depending on guideline perspective [^111aHAUU] [^113wcNwD].

> I need to ensure I address very high-risk patients correctly, and here anabolic therapy becomes pivotal. For severe osteoporosis, multiple or recent vertebral fractures, or T-score around −3.0 or lower, teriparatide or abaloparatide for up to 2 years, or romosozumab for 1 year, provide greater gains in bone strength. Importantly, anabolics should be followed by an antiresorptive to consolidate gains, with ACP 2024 and Endocrine Society endorsing sequential strategies such as romosozumab then alendronate or teriparatide then a bisphosphonate, and I should screen for cardiovascular risk before romosozumab due to its boxed warning [^117MPHX2] [^115PpiBe] [^113ZwZEi] [^115mvWot].

> Next, I should review treatment duration and drug holidays, and I need to check the reassessment intervals. For oral bisphosphonates, reassess after about 5 years and consider a drug holiday if risk is low to moderate; for IV bisphosphonates, reassess after 3 years; denosumab requires continuous therapy or transition to an antiresorptive to avoid rebound bone loss; teriparatide and abaloparatide are limited to 2 years and romosozumab to 1 year, followed by antiresorptive maintenance; I should confirm that high-risk patients may continue oral therapy up to 10 years or IV therapy up to 6 years without a holiday [^112CcBBp] [^112HVa9W].

> But wait, what if the patient is a man or has secondary osteoporosis features. I should confirm that men with osteoporosis should generally be treated similarly to women, with bisphosphonates as first-line and denosumab as an alternative when oral therapy is unsuitable; recent guidance emphasizes closing the evidence gap for men while applying the same risk-based principles and absolute risk thresholds where validated [^113EJSQQ] [^1113cd3n] [^114uJc9f].

> I will now examine nonpharmacologic measures, because medication alone is insufficient. I need to ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, weight-bearing and resistance exercise, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol, and comprehensive falls risk assessment with interventions; structured exercise and multidisciplinary falls programs reduce falls and can improve BMD, and fracture liaison services improve implementation of secondary prevention, so I should embed these into routine care [^111GQpXR] [^115t7BHn] [^116gdBFD] [^115qLxvS].

> Hold on, I should verify the approach to osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures specifically, since management nuances matter. Most acute OVCFs improve with medical management over 3–12 months, with about one-third having persistent pain beyond 6 months; bracing may be considered though evidence is limited, and strict immobilization is not recommended; augmentation with vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty can be considered for severe, refractory pain after 4–6 weeks of conservative care, but high-quality evidence shows no consistent advantage over medical therapy for new fractures or complications, so I should reserve augmentation for carefully selected patients after shared decision-making [^111husnn] [^116P19H5] [^111zd8PV] [^111WRRWp].

> Let me reconsider the surgical decision pathway for other osteoporotic fractures, because implant choice and technique influence outcomes. Poor bone quality and comminution increase risks of fixation failure, so I should favor techniques and implants designed for osteoporotic bone, minimize soft tissue disruption, and coordinate perioperative medical optimization; early mobilization remains critical to reduce complications, and I should integrate secondary prevention measures during the surgical episode [^113fMuwd] [^112wgfMn].

> I should double-check that my algorithm is coherent and actionable. In practice, after a fragility fracture, stabilize and control pain, assess fracture risk with BMD and FRAX, initiate pharmacotherapy promptly in high-risk patients, choose bisphosphonates first-line for most, escalate to an anabolic then antiresorptive sequence for very high-risk patients, continue therapy with planned reassessment and drug holidays when appropriate, implement nonpharmacologic measures including falls prevention and exercise, and for OVCFs favor medical management with selective augmentation only for refractory cases, all aligned with ACP 2024, Endocrine Society, and ACOG guidance [^115beCmp] [^111GQpXR] [^116wYaJN].

> Finally, I need to ensure we close the osteoporosis care gap, because system-level failures drive poor outcomes. Fracture liaison services and systematic secondary prevention programs markedly improve evaluation and treatment initiation after fractures, and I should advocate for these pathways locally while educating patients that any low-trauma fracture is a sentinel event warranting comprehensive osteoporosis management to prevent the next fracture [^115qLxvS] [^1146zkPD].

Osteoporotic fractures require a **multidisciplinary approach** that combines acute fracture care with aggressive osteoporosis management to prevent recurrence [^11555kLD]. Immediate priorities are **pain control**, stabilization, and early mobilization; most vertebral fractures are managed nonoperatively, while hip fractures generally need surgery within 48 hours [^115ar4P1]. Pharmacologic therapy should start **promptly** — bisphosphonates or denosumab for most, with teriparatide, abaloparatide, or romosozumab for very high-risk patients — and be maintained with calcium/vitamin D, fall prevention, and lifestyle measures [^115beCmp] [^115PpiBe] [^113ZwZEi]. Vertebral augmentation is reserved for refractory pain or progressive deformity, and all patients should have a **fracture liaison service** to ensure secondary prevention [^113FHvaY] [^115qLxvS].

---

## Initial assessment and diagnostic evaluation

- **Clinical history and examination**: Document fracture history, falls, medications, and comorbidities; assess pain, function, and neurovascular status [^116ZQLhe].

- **Imaging**: Obtain plain radiographs for all suspected fractures; use MRI for occult or complex vertebral fractures, and CT for surgical planning [^116xFEJ5].

- **Bone mineral density (BMD) testing**: Perform dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to confirm osteoporosis and guide therapy [^113r3Juw].

- **Laboratory evaluation**: Check calcium, phosphate, vitamin D, renal function, liver function, and thyroid function; consider secondary causes if indicated [^notfound].

---

## Acute management and pain control

- **Pain management**: Use acetaminophen as first-line; consider NSAIDs cautiously; opioids for severe pain with close monitoring [^notfound].

- **Bracing**: Consider bracing for vertebral fractures to reduce pain and improve mobility, though evidence is limited [^116P19H5].

- **Early mobilization**: Encourage movement as soon as feasible to prevent complications of immobilization [^notfound].

---

## Surgical management

Surgical management **depends on fracture type and severity**: vertebral fractures are usually nonoperative, while hip fractures generally require surgery within 48 hours to reduce morbidity and mortality [^115vWn4K]. Indications for surgery include hip fractures, unstable vertebral fractures with neurologic compromise, and refractory vertebral pain or progressive deformity [^113FHvaY]. Procedures commonly used are internal fixation, arthroplasty, and percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty for select vertebral cases [^113qq29U].

---

## Pharmacological management of osteoporosis

### First-line pharmacologic therapy

First-line therapy includes **bisphosphonates** (alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid) for most patients to reduce vertebral, hip, and nonvertebral fractures [^115beCmp]. Denosumab is an alternative for patients with contraindications to or intolerance of bisphosphonates [^113wcNwD].

---

### Second-line and advanced therapies

- **Teriparatide and abaloparatide**: For very high-risk patients (e.g. multiple vertebral fractures, T-score ≤ -3.0) [^115PpiBe].

- **Romosozumab**: For very high-risk patients without cardiovascular risk; use for 12 months followed by antiresorptive therapy [^115Czqh9] [^114bAgJW].

- **Sequential therapy**: Follow anabolic agents with antiresorptives to maintain gains [^112HVa9W].

---

### Duration and monitoring

Duration and monitoring include a **5-year initial course** for bisphosphonates, with reassessment and consideration of a drug holiday [^112CcBBp]. DXA monitoring should be repeated every 1–2 years to assess response and guide therapy adjustments [^notfound].

---

## Non-pharmacological interventions

Non-pharmacological interventions should include **calcium (1000–1200 mg/day) and vitamin D (800–1000 IU/day)** to support bone health [^notfound]. Weight-bearing and resistance exercise programs improve strength, balance, and bone density [^115t7BHn]. Comprehensive fall-risk assessment and multifactorial interventions reduce falls and fractures [^116gdBFD].

---

## Management of specific fracture types

### Vertebral compression fractures

Most vertebral compression fractures are managed with **medical therapy, analgesia, bracing, and physical therapy** [^113FHvaY]. Vertebral augmentation (**vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty**) is reserved for refractory pain or progressive deformity [^113FHvaY].

---

### Hip fractures

Hip fractures generally require **surgery within 48 hours** to reduce morbidity and mortality [^notfound]. Postoperative rehabilitation emphasizes early mobilization and osteoporosis therapy to prevent recurrence [^11555kLD].

---

### Distal radius fractures

Distal radius fractures are typically managed with **immobilization** or surgical fixation, followed by osteoporosis therapy [^111tyf1K].

---

## Secondary fracture prevention and follow-up

Secondary fracture prevention relies on **fracture liaison services** to coordinate evaluation, treatment, and follow-up [^115qLxvS]. Patient education should cover adherence, lifestyle, and fall prevention. Long-term monitoring includes regular follow-up, BMD testing, and therapy adjustment [^112CcBBp].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

Emerging directions include ongoing trials of **novel anabolic and antiresorptive agents** and development of personalized treatment based on genetics, comorbidities, and fracture risk [^113mgmFo]. Digital health tools may improve adherence and outcomes through digital monitoring and telemedicine.

---

Effective management of osteoporotic fractures requires **coordinated acute care**, aggressive osteoporosis treatment, and structured secondary prevention to reduce recurrence and improve outcomes [^1146zkPD].

### Diagnosis and management of vertebral fractures in elderly adults [^115ar4P1]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

We reviewed the epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of vertebral fractures due to osteoporosis in the elderly. Vertebral fractures are underdiagnosed despite their high prevalence in both men and women. Clinical consequences of vertebral fractures include increased risk of future vertebral and hip fracture, acute and chronic back pain, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Patients with vertebral fractures have functional impairment and increased mortality similar to those with hip fractures. Asymptomatic fractures identified on radiograph also affect quality of life and mortality. A vertebral fracture is a clinical marker for a subsequent fracture and should trigger assessment and diagnosis of osteoporosis. The care of patients with vertebral fractures includes pain management, rehabilitation, and prevention of further fractures. There is evidence from randomized controlled trials that pharmacologic therapy can reduce the risk of future fractures by 40% to 50%. Vertebroplasty may be effective in the control of pain and in obtaining stability of the spine.

### Vertebral augmentation for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: what is the current evidence pro and con? [^111WRRWp]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures can be quite challenging to treat, especially since they often occur in older adults and can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The standard treatment for these fractures has been medical management, as many of these patients are not candidates for open surgery. Vertebral augmentation procedures have emerged as another treatment option. Though initially accepted by clinicians, the benefit of these procedures has been questioned by several clinical trials. Safety concerns related to adjacent level fractures and cement extravasation have also been raised. We review these controversies in the context of the current literature.

### Evidence-based guideline for the management of osteoporosis in men [^1113cd3n]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Historically, osteoporosis has been viewed as a disease of women, with research, trials of interventions and guidelines predominantly focused as such. It is apparent, however, that this condition causes a substantial health burden in men also, and that its assessment and management must ultimately be addressed across both sexes. In this article, an international multidisciplinary working group of the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases presents GRADE-assessed recommendations for the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of osteoporosis in men. The recommendations are based on a comprehensive review of the latest research related to diagnostic and screening approaches for osteoporosis and its associated high fracture risk in men, covering disease burden, appropriate interpretation of bone densitometry (including the use of a female reference database for densitometric diagnosis in men) and absolute fracture risk, thresholds for treatment, and interventions that can be used therapeutically and their health economic evaluation. Future work should specifically address the efficacy of anti-osteoporosis medications, including denosumab and bone-forming therapies.

What is the effect (including cost effectiveness and safety) of non-pharmacological treatments provided by non-physician HPs in adults at high risk of primary osteoporotic fracture?

One systematic review, three meta-analysesand three primary studiescontributed evidence about exercise interventions. Two RCTs explored falls prevention programmesand two systematic reviewsand one RCTinvestigated nutrient supplementation. One systematic review explored patient education strategies(table 4).

Exercise

Evidence from seven publications was synthesised to investigate the effect of exercise on risk of falling, BMD, incidence rate of fracturesand falls. Available evidence from one meta-analysissuggests that multimodal exercise can reduce risk of falling in participants at high risk of primary osteoporotic fracture compared with a control group, through improvements in mobility (SMD = −0.56, 95% CI −0.81 to 0.32) and balance (SMD = 0.5, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.74). Likewise, regular multimodal exercise incorporating weight-bearing aerobic exercise and resistance training undertaken for ≥ 1 year appears to confer positive benefits on BMD, unlike whole-body vibrationand low impact mind-body conditioning exercise.

Two primary studies, one randomised and one non-randomised, reported fewer fractures in women with low bone mass undertaking regular long-term multimodal exercise at least twice a week compared with a control group. Korpelainen et al stated a fracture IRR of 0.68 (95% CI 0.34 to 1.32) following analysis of 7-year data collected from a national hospital discharge register and hospital records, while Kemmler et al reported a rate ratio of 0.42 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.86) drawing on data gathered via questionnaires and interviews. The effect of exercise on falls incidence was variable. In one study, the number of fallers increased following a 12-month multimodal exercise intervention, although the mechanism for this is unclear.

### Adverse skeletal effects of drugs-beyond glucocorticoids [^114BNJVL]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoporotic fractures are an important public health problem with significant individual and societal costs. In addition to the major risk factors for osteoporotic fracture, low bone mineral density (BMD), age, low body weight and history of fracture or falls, some drugs are now considered to be important secondary risk factor for bone loss and fracture, particularly amongst predisposed individuals. Currently available data are often generated from small observational clinical studies, making risk assessment and development of management guidelines difficult. In many cases, the exposed population has a low baseline risk for fracture and additional assessment and treatment may not be necessary. In this review, we focus on drugs other than glucocorticoids identified as potentially causing adverse skeletal effects, summarizing the existing evidence from preclinical and clinical studies, and suggest recommendations for patient management.

### Osteoporosis: common questions and answers [^112fHFeJ]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis affects 10.2% of adults older than 50 years and is expected to increase to 13.6% by 2030. Osteoporotic fractures, specifically hip fractures, significantly affect morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. Screening for osteoporosis with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry should be considered for all women 65 years and older or women who are postmenopausal with clinical risk factors. The Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation recommends screening men 70 years and older and men with clinical risk factors; however, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force did not find sufficient evidence to support routine screening in men. Osteoporosis can be diagnosed by a T-score of -2.5 or less or the presence of a fragility fracture. All patients with osteoporosis should be counseled on weight-bearing exercise, smoking cessation, moderation of alcohol intake, and calcium and vita-min D supplementation. Treatment of osteoporosis is influenced by the patient's fracture risk, the effectiveness of fracture risk reduction, and medication safety. Patients at high risk of fracture should consider treatment with antiresorptive therapy, including bisphosphonates and denosumab. Anabolic agents such as teriparatide, abaloparatide, and romosozumab should be considered for patients at very high risk or with previous vertebral fractures.

### Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis: position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114Cje7W]. Menopause (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) established a goal to create an evidence-based position statement regarding the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this document. A MEDLINE search was conducted. Clinicians and researchers acknowledged to be experts in the field of osteoporosis were enlisted to review the evidence. The NAMS Board of Trustees reviewed and approved the final document.

Results

Osteoporosis, which has its highest rate of occurrence in postmenopausal women, increases the risk for fractures, including hip and spine fractures. These injuries are often associated with particularly high morbidity and mortality. Given the health implications of osteoporotic fractures, the primary goal of osteoporosis therapy is to prevent fractures by slowing or preventing bone loss, maintaining bone strength, and minimizing or eliminating factors that may contribute to falls. The evaluation of postmenopausal women for osteoporosis risk requires the recording of a medical history, a physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Major risk factors for osteoporosis are age, genetics, lifestyle (especially nutrition), and menopausal status. Management focuses first on nonpharmacologic measures, such as a balanced diet including adequate calcium and vitamin D intakes, appropriate exercise, smoking cessation, avoidance of excessive alcohol intake, and fall prevention. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, FDA-approved options are estrogens (prevention only), bisphosphonates and selective estrogen-receptor modulators (prevention and treatment), and calcitonin (treatment only).

Conclusions

Management of postmenopausal osteoporosis involves identifying the potential risk for osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture, followed by measures that focus on reducing modifiable risk factors through lifestyle changes and, if indicated, pharmacologic therapy.

### Management principles of osteoporotic fractures [^114ZN5kU]. Injury (2016). Low credibility.

Osteoporotic fractures are difficult to manage. They pose a number of difficulties to the surgeon arising from the underlying poor bone stock compromising the intention to achieve optimum fixation. Moreover, the frail elderly patients present with a variety of medical co-morbidities increasing the risk of developing perioperative complications. Despite these recognized challenges, there are currently a number of improving technologies and strategies at the surgeon's disposal to provide more confidence with fracture fixation and maximize the chance of success.

### Prevention and management of osteoporotic fractures by non-physician health professionals: a systematic literature review to inform EULAR points to consider [^113MinA9]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

By 2040, an estimated 319 million adults aged 50 years or more worldwide will be at high risk of osteoporotic fracture. While Asian populations will carry much of this burden, other nationalities, including European, will see risk rise. The morbidity, mortality and cost associated with osteoporotic fractures, and the availability of effective pharmacological treatments for prevention and management, highlight the importance of identification and treatment of 'high-risk' individuals. Yet, current healthcare provision is insufficient and many people at high risk of osteoporotic fracture are neither identified nor receive treatment.

Alongside pharmacological agents, non-pharmacological interventions, such as exercise, fall prevention measures and adequate intake of key nutrients, are important in the prevention and management of osteoporosis. Two previous systematic reviews reported some evidence that interventions delivered by dietitians, nurses, physiotherapists and pharmacists, working alone or in multidisciplinary teams, can positively influence health-related outcomes for people with, or at risk of osteoporosis, including quality of life (QoL), calcium intake, medication compliance and bone mineral density (BMD) testing.

Yet, despite evidence for the effectiveness of interventions provided by non-physician health professionals (HPs), implementation may be suboptimal in many countries. Arguably, there is scope for greater involvement of non-physician HPs in primary and secondary fracture prevention. Recent recommendations by the EULAR and European Federation of National Associations of Orthopaedics and Traumatology are available to guide physicians in the management of patients 50 years and older with a recent fragility fracture and prevention of subsequent fractures, and updated European guidance exists to streamline healthcare for diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. However, international recommendations for non-physician HPs are lacking.

To address this gap, a commissioned taskforce has developed the first EULAR points to consider for non-physician HPs in the prevention and management of fragility fractures in adults 50 years or older. A systematic literature review (SLR) was undertaken to inform the development of these points to consider.

### Surgical treatment of osteoporotic fractures: an update on the principles of management [^113fMuwd]. Injury (2017). Low credibility.

The treatment of osteoporotic fractures continues to challenge orthopedic surgeon. The fragility of the underlying bone in conjunction with the need for specific implants led to the development of explicit surgical techniques in order to minimize implant failure related complications, morbidity and mortality. From the patient's perspective, the existence of frailty, dementia and other medical related co-morbidities induce a complex situation necessitating high vigilance during the perioperative and post-operative period. This update reviews current principles and techniques essential to successful surgical treatment of these injuries.

### Treat-to-target for osteoporosis: is now the time? [^111VUTnZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

Current clinical practice guidelines identify patients at high risk for fracture who are likely to benefit from pharmacological therapy and suggest ways to monitor for effectiveness of therapy. However, there is no clear guidance on when fracture risk has been reduced to an acceptably low level. As a consequence, some patients at low risk for fracture may be treated for longer than necessary, whereas others at high risk for fracture may have treatment stopped when they might benefit from continuation of the same treatment or a change to a more potent therapeutic agent. The objective of this statement is to describe the potential clinical utility of developing a "treat-to-target" strategy for the management of patients with osteoporosis.

Participants

We recommend that a task force of clinicians, clinical investigators, and other stakeholders in the care of osteoporosis explore the options, review the evidence, and identify additional areas for investigation to establish osteoporosis treatment targets.

Evidence

Data from large, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled registration trials for currently available osteoporosis therapies should be analyzed for commonalities of correlations between easily measured endpoints and fracture risk.

Consensus Process

Osteoporosis experts, professional organizations, and patient care advocates should be involved in the process of developing consensus on easily measurable osteoporosis treatment targets that are supported by the best available evidence and likely to be accepted by clinicians and patients in the care of osteoporosis.

Conclusions

A treat-to-target strategy for osteoporosis offers the potential of improving osteoporosis care by reducing the burden of osteoporotic fractures and limiting adverse effects of therapy.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^113r3Juw]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). High credibility.

United States pharmacologic treatment thresholds — postmenopausal osteoporosis — use T-score and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) criteria: pharmacological therapy is recommended for postmenopausal women with hip or vertebral fractures; those with T-scores of −2.5 or less in the femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine; and those with T-scores of −1 to −2.5 and a 10-year probability of ≥ 20% for major osteoporotic fractures or ≥ 3% for hip fractures based on the US-adapted FRAX tool. Across countries, guideline approaches vary; currently there are 52 national guidelines in 36 countries, and of the 52 guidelines, 30 include the FRAX-based 10-year absolute fracture risk in their treatment threshold.

### Practical management of fracture risk among peri-and postmenopausal women [^113pBtNu]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). Medium credibility.

Fractures and their consequences are the clinically important manifestation of osteoporosis; preventing fractures is the primary goal of management. Effective management is achievable given present knowledge and tools but is seldom prescribed. This review will cover the individual and social burden of fracture, essential information about fracture risk and its estimation, an approach to patient care emphasizing specific information to elicit and therapeutic strategies to pursue, and existing gaps in knowledge and important questions for future research.

### Prevention of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly [^112Fwk8Z]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a common and preventable disorder of the older adult skeleton that predisposes an individual to an increased risk of fracture, a major cause of disability in older adults. Most patients with osteoporosis have an identifiable cause of bone loss. Factors contributing to osteoporotic fractures are more often associated with disordered neuromuscular function affecting postural stability than disordered skeletal integrity. Effective pharmacologic agents are available for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Prevention of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly, particularly nonvertebral fractures, presents unique challenges. Fracture prevention requires identification and management of disorders that contribute to falls, the prevention of falls, and reduction of the impact force of falls. Thus, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological strategies need to be employed. The presence of multiple co-morbidities further complicates management of osteoporosis in the elderly population.

### Prevention and management of osteoporotic fractures by non-physician health professionals: a systematic literature review to inform EULAR points to consider [^11555kLD]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To perform a systematic literature review (SLR) about the effect of non-pharmacological interventions delivered by non-physician health professionals to prevent and manage osteoporotic fractures.

Methods

Eight clinical questions based on two criteria guided the SLR: (1) adults ≥ 50 years at high risk of osteoporotic fracture and (2) interventions delivered by non-physician health professionals to prevent and manage osteoporotic fractures. Interventions focused on diagnostic procedures to identify risk of falling, therapeutic approaches and implementation strategies. Outcomes included fractures, falls, risk of falling and change in bone mineral density. Systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials were preferentially selected. Data were synthesised using a qualitative descriptive approach.

Results

Of 15917 records, 43 articles were included. Studies were clinically and methodologically diverse. We identified sufficient evidence that structured exercise, incorporating progressive resistance training delivered to people who had undergone hip fracture surgery, and multicomponent exercise, delivered to people at risk of primary fracture, reduced risk of falling. The effectiveness of multidisciplinary fracture liaison services in reducing refracture rate was confirmed. There was insufficient evidence found to support the effectiveness of nutrients and falls prevention programmes in this patient population.

Conclusion

Despite study heterogeneity, our SLR showed beneficial effects of some interventions delivered by non-physician health professionals and the positive impact of multidisciplinary team working and patient educational approaches to prevent and manage osteoporotic fractures. These results informed a EULAR taskforce that developed points to consider for non-physician health professionals to prevent and manage osteoporotic fractures.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: the 2021 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111JKrBo]. Menopause (2021). High credibility.

Evaluating patients for and with osteoporosis — background: osteoporosis is the most common bone disorder affecting humans and is characterized by compromised bone strength that predisposes to increased risk of fracture, most importantly of the spine and hip; serious fractures occur most commonly in older postmenopausal women and are often life-altering events, whereas wrist fractures in young postmenopausal women are important warning signs. The bone loss that results in osteoporosis is most marked during the menopause transition and early menopause. Persons with osteoporosis and high risk of fracture can be readily identified; both general and pharmacologic management strategies are available to slow or prevent bone loss and to reduce fracture risk, and skeletal health assessment should be a part of the routine evaluation of all postmenopausal women.

### The good and the bad about the 2017 American College of Physicians osteoporosis guidelines [^116GXSDb]. Clinical Therapeutics (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose

The American College of Physicians (ACP) published a set of guidelines on how to prevent fractures in men and women with low bone density or osteoporosis. As the population ages, the overall risk of fractures increases, thus burdening the health care system. These guidelines review current evidence for osteoporosis management, providing an update to the previous 2008 ACP's guidelines.

Methods

The ACP put forth 6 recommendations addressing the complexities in osteoporosis management based on evidence available through October 2016 with a focus on bisphosphonates, calcium, vitamin D, and estrogen. Evidence was graded according to recommended strength by using the ACP standard methods.

Findings

The ACP recommends anti-osteoporosis therapy with 1 of 3 bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, or zoledronic acid) or denosumab in patients with osteoporosis, while excluding anabolic therapies, and recommends against raloxifene. Although bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment, anabolic therapy and raloxifene may be used in specific situations. Pharmacologic therapy is recommended for 5 years, oversimplifying length of therapy and failing to promote an individualized patient-centered care approach. Moreover, abrupt discontinuation of denosumab is associated with a decline in bone mineral density (BMD), which must be addressed. Routine monitoring of BMD by dual x-ray absorptiometry is not endorsed during treatment, which leads to underrecognition of management issues. Pharmacologic treatment with bisphosphonates for male osteoporosis is recommended, although therapies such as denosumab and teriparatide are excluded. Finally, the ACP recommends treatment for women aged ≥ 65 years at high risk for fracture with osteopenia after a discussion of patient preferences, fracture risk profile, and medications.

Implications

Osteoporosis management is complex. The 2017 ACP guidelines address challenges faced by clinicians but oversimplify more complex issues. These are among a number of guidelines that are available for osteoporosis management, which may be used in combination with other sources to assist clinicians with diagnostic and management strategies.

### Dilemmas in the management of osteoporosis [^1149SRZt]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2015). Low credibility.

Fragility fracture is the clinically apparent and relevant outcome in osteoporosis. Osteoporotic fragility fractures occur most commonly in the vertebrae, hip and wrist, and are associated with substantial disability, pain and reduced quality of life. It is estimated that more than 2 million women have osteoporosis in England and Wales. In the UK, there are over 300,000 fractures each year, causing severe pain and disability to individuals at an estimated annual cost to the NHS of over £1.73 billion. As a result of increased bone loss after the menopause in women, and age-related bone loss in both women and men, the prevalence of osteoporosis increases markedly with age, from 2% at 50 years to more than 25% at 80 years in women. Despite the development of a number of guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis, management of the condition is not straightforward. Here we provide a reminder of some specific dilemmas facing generalists in regards to the management of osteoporosis, including diagnosis and investigation for reversible secondary causes; the effectiveness and duration of pharmacological management with oral bisphosphonates; and the role of calcium and vitamin D.

Osteoporosis is a common systemic skeletal disorder resulting in bone fragility and increased fracture risk. However, management of osteoporosis and fracture prevention strategies are often not addressed by primary care clinicians, even in older patients with recent fractures. Evidence-based screening strategies will improve identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from drug treatment to prevent fracture. In addition, careful consideration of when pharmacotherapy should be started and choice of medication and duration of treatment will maximize the benefits of fracture prevention while minimizing potential harms of long-term drug exposure.

NASS Clinical Guidelines — osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCF) managed without augmentation or surgery — state there is fair evidence to suggest that significant pain improvement will occur, with time course to improvement variable from 3 months to 1 year (Grade of Recommendation: B). In a prospective observational study, adults with OVCF treated medically improve by 6 months and are off of analgesics by 2 weeks, with mean visual analog scale (VAS) pain improved from 6.28 at onset to 3.0 at 6 months and 2.36 at 12 months; other studies report pain levels continue to improve to 12 months and improvement in pain to one year. Additional studies show adults will gradually improve until 3 months and achieve significant improvement on average by 15 days, and have improvement of significant back pain at 6 months; in some studies, the time may be overstated due to the interval of follow-up and the time to improvement may vary due to different medical therapies.

### Approach to the patient with bone fracture: making the first fracture the last [^115qLxvS]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The global burden of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures will increase significantly as we enter a rapidly aging population. Osteoporotic fractures lead to increased morbidity, mortality, and risk of subsequent fractures if left untreated. However, studies have shown that the majority of patients who suffer an osteoporotic fracture are not investigated or treated for osteoporosis, leading to an inexcusable "osteoporosis care gap". Systematic and coordinated models of care in secondary fracture prevention known as fracture liaison services (FLS) have been established to streamline and improve the care of patients with osteoporotic fractures, and employ core principles of identification, investigation, and initiation of treatment. Our approach to the multifaceted care of secondary fracture prevention at a hospital-based FLS is illustrated through several case vignettes.

### Osteoporosis in crisis: It's time to focus on fracture [^1125WQiv]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2017). Low credibility.

A crisis in osteoporosis treatment exists; the majority of those who sustain fracture do not receive treatment to reduce future fracture risk. This crisis presents an opportunity to focus the field from osteoporosis to fracture, the outcome of consequence. Proposed here is a change in focus suggesting that 1) attempts to define the level of trauma leading to fracture are counterproductive and that all fractures in older adults merit consideration of evaluation and 2) bone loss is not the entire problem but rather part of a broader syndrome including osteoporosis, sarcopenia, and other factors leading to fracture. With this approach, all fractures in older adults should be evaluated for potential lifestyle, non-pharmacological, and pharmacological interventions that could be implemented to reduce the risk of fracture recurrence. © 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^114w1C29]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass in adults — this ACP guideline presents a focused update on clinical recommendations for pharmacologic treatments to prevent fractures in adults, based on the best available evidence of the benefits and harms of treatments and consideration of patient values, preferences, and costs. The population is adults (premenopausal and postmenopausal females and males) with low bone mass or primary osteoporosis as diagnosed in primary studies, and baseline risk assessment considers diagnosis of osteoporosis, history of osteoporotic fractures (clinical or incidental), multiple risk factors for fractures, or failure or intolerability of osteoporosis medications rather than scores from available tools. The recommendations are based on biological sex assigned at birth because most studies reported sex rather than gender and the majority enrolled only older females. Evaluated therapies include an analogue of human parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) (abaloparatide), bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate, risedronate, zoledronate), a receptor activator of nuclear factor κB (RANK) ligand inhibitor (denosumab), recombinant human parathyroid hormone (recombinant PTH) (teriparatide), a sclerostin inhibitor (romosozumab), and selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) (bazedoxifene, raloxifene), with focus on effectiveness and harms of active drugs compared with placebo or bisphosphonates. The intended audience is all clinicians, and management of secondary osteoporosis in people with cancer and other serious illnesses is outside the scope. The Clinical Guidelines Committee developed this guideline according to ACP's guideline development process, used Evidence-to-Decision tables, and graded recommendations using the GRADE approach; it is planning to maintain this topic as a living guideline with quarterly literature surveillance and periodic updating, and may retire living status if it is no longer a priority, if conclusions are unlikely to change with new evidence, or if new evidence is unlikely to emerge. The guideline is based on an accompanying systematic review and network meta-analysis completed by the ACP Center for Evidence Reviews, and the accompanying review and Supplement Appendixes provide appraised evidence of benefits and harms of evaluated pharmacologic interventions.

### Osteoporotic vertebral fractures [^113qq29U]. Neurosurgical Focus (2001). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a significant public health problem. Vertebral fractures are the most common fracture in patients with osteoporosis, occurring in approximately 750,000 cases each year. The fractures may cause acute or chronic pain, reduce the quality of life, and shorten life expectancy. Several medications are available that reduce the risk of fracture. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty (balloon-inflated expansion of collapsed vertebrae followed by injection of bone cement) may reduce or relieve pain in selected patients. Although surgery is rarely necessary for the management of osteoporotic vertebral fractures, it may be indicated for other reasons. No studies have been conducted to determine if the outcome of spinal fusion is different in patients with osteoporosis and, if it is, whether management of the patient's osteoporosis will improve the outcome.

### Prevention and management of osteoporotic fractures by non-physician health professionals: a systematic literature review to inform EULAR points to consider [^111irJuK]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

A SLR for each of eight clinical questions (table 2), formulated and consensually agreed by the taskforce, was undertaken by a research fellow (NW) with guidance from the taskforce convenors (EH, JA) and a methodologist (TAS). The methods for each SLR, including the research question and inclusion/exclusion criteria, were agreed on and documented within a joint taskforce meeting. The taskforce comprised 2 patient research partners, 1 dietitian, 1 geriatrician and 1 nurse, 3 occupational therapists, 2 orthopaedic surgeons, 4 physiotherapists, 1 specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation and 5 rheumatologists, drawn from 10 European countries.

Table 2
Clinical questions

The conduct of the review was informed by Cochrane principles. A Participants, Interventions, Comparisons, Outcomes and Study design approachwas adopted for each question followed by a systematic search across international electronic databases (Medline/PubMed, Embase and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) for relevant literature published between January 2007 and October 2017 (online supplementary file 1). Searches were based on two critieria: (1) adults ≥ 50 years of age at high risk of primary or secondary osteoporotic fracture and (2) interventions delivered by non-physician HPs to prevent and manage osteoporotic fractures. Interventions included diagnostic procedures to identify risk of falling, therapeutic approaches (eg, structured exercise, education, falls prevention programmes) and implementation strategies. Key outcomes were fractures and falls (where the accepted definition of a fall was an unexpected event in which the participants come to rest on the ground, floor or lower level). High risk of falling and change in BMD were included as surrogate end points. Fractures in adults age ≥ 50 years were assumed to be fragility fractures unless at the ankle, hands and feet, skull and face, or as a result of high-intensity trauma.

Study selection

Following removal of duplicates, two review authors (NW and EH) independently selected eligible studies and achieved consensus on which articles to include. Publications investigating interventions commonly undertaken by non-physician HPs were included even if the professional group delivering the intervention was not specifically stated or non-physician HPs were not sole providers. Articles were excluded if published in languages other than English. Systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were preferentially selected, although (quasi) randomised and non-randomised studies were included. Systematic reviews with sufficient quality were considered to cover the time until their search ended. Studies with small sample sizes (< 50 participants) were excluded.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Data, including research design, population characteristics, interventions and outcomes were extracted by the research fellow from all selected articles describing diagnostic procedures, therapeutic approaches and implementation strategies. Systematic reviews were evaluated using AMSTAR 2 — A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews, while risk of bias (RoB) judgements about primary studies followed a domain-based assessment as recommended by the Cochrane collaboration. We characterised a 'partial Yes' response in a critical domain of AMSTAR 2 as a non-critical weakness. Risk of performance bias was considered unclear in studies in which blinding of participants and/or personnel was not feasible. Evidence was classified in accordance with the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based-Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence, but upgraded or downgraded in response to methodological strengths and weaknesses.

Data synthesis

Evidence about the effect of interventions was synthesised descriptively and rated using four categories: sufficient; some; insufficient; and insufficient evidence to determine, as described by Ryan et al (see online supplementary file 1, table 1). Studies describing mixed populations (participants with and without osteoporotic fracture) were allocated based on the proportion of participants with fracture, that is, if > 50% of the population had at least one fragility fracture, the study was allocated to question 2; if ≤ 50%, the study was allocated to question 3. If more than one published article reported data from a single cohort, the most up-to-date publication was included in the analysis.

### Osteoporosis management in the era of COVID-19 [^117XDgAg]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is a chronic condition that reflects reduced bone strength and an associated increased risk for fracture. As a chronic condition, osteoporosis generally requires sustained medical intervention(s) to limit the risks for additional bone loss, compromise of skeletal integrity, and fracture occurrence. Further complicating this issue is the fact that the abrupt cessation of some therapies can be associated with an increased risk for harm. It is in this context that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruption to the provision of health care globally, including near universal requirements for social distancing. In this Perspective, we provide evidence, where available, regarding the general care of patients with osteoporosis in the COVID-19 era and provide clinical recommendations based primarily on expert opinion when data are absent. Particular emphasis is placed on the transition from parenteral osteoporosis therapies. It is hoped that these recommendations can be used to safely guide care for patients with osteoporosis until a return to routine clinical care standards is available. © 2020 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society* clinical practice guideline [^111GQpXR]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective is to formulate clinical practice guidelines for the pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Conclusions

Evidence from clinical trials and insights from clinical experience with pharmacologic therapies for osteoporosis were critically evaluated in formulating this guideline for the management of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Patient preferences, data on adherence and persistence, and risks and benefits from the patient and provider perspectives were also considered in writing committee deliberations. A consensus by the Writing Committee members was achieved for four management principles: (i) The risk of future fractures in postmenopausal women should be determined using country-specific assessment tools to guide decision-making. (ii) Patient preferences should be incorporated into treatment planning. (iii) Nutritional and lifestyle interventions and fall prevention should accompany all pharmacologic regimens to reduce fracture risk. (iv) Multiple pharmacologic therapies are capable of reducing fracture rates in postmenopausal women at risk with acceptable risk-benefit and safety profiles.

### ACP updates clinical recommendations on treatment of… [^113ej4HD]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Kenny Lin, MD, MPH Posted on January 9, 2023 The American College of Physicians has updated its 2017 clinical practice guideline on treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults. The previous version, which was endorsed by the American Academy of Family Physicians, recommended treating women with osteoporosis for five years with alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid, or denosumab to reduce the risk of hip fractures and vertebral fractures. It also suggested that men with clinically recognized osteoporosis be offered bisphosphonates to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures. Treating older women with low bone mass at high risk for fracture was deemed to be optional based on patient preferences and medication benefits, harms, and costs. The publication of additional studies on existing therapies and the availability of new therapies such as abaloparatide prompted this guideline update.

An independent evidence review team performed a systematic review and network meta-analysis of osteoporosis treatments that analyzed 34 randomized controlled trials and 36 observational studies. The review confirmed the effectiveness of bisphosphonates and denosumab in reducing hip, vertebral, and other clinical fractures. In older postmenopausal females at very high fracture risk, abaloparatide, teriparatide, and sequential romosozumab, then alendronate, appeared to be more effective at reducing clinical fractures over 24 months than bisphosphonates. In the updated guideline, the ACP now recommends that clinicians preferentially use bisphosphonates as first-line therapy in women and men with osteoporosis, with the exception of women at very high risk of fracture. In this group, either romosozumab or teriparatide can be used, followed by a bisphosphonate.

Denosumab is endorsed as a second-line therapy for adults with contraindications to or who experience adverse effects from bisphosphonates. Similar to the 2017 guideline, the ACP suggests an individualized approach to prescribing bisphosphonates in women older than 65 years with low bone mass. Rather than revisiting the recommendations in a specific time frame, the ACP plans to perform quarterly literature surveillance and maintain this topic as a living guideline that will be updated periodically when new evidence becomes available.

### Use of osteobiologics in the management of osteoporotic fractures [^114UYK8q]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2011). Low credibility.

Osteoporotic fractures present a number of significant challenges for surgical management, including high degrees of fracture comminution, poor implant fixation secondary to inferior bone quality, and compromised capacity for fracture healing. Osteobiologics are materials/agents that can promote fracture healing and enhance fracture stability. Given the challenges presented by osteoporotic fractures, they seem ideally suited to potentially benefit from the application of osteobiologics. Despite this, limited clinical investigation into the use of osteobiologics in the management of osteoporotic fractures has been performed. This article reviews a select number of osteobiologic products and the evidence for their use in osteoporotic fractures.

### Osteoporosis treatment: updated guidelines from ACOG… [^112RR2VL]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- Bisphosphonates, for up to five years orally or three years intravenously, are first-line therapy for osteoporosis.
- Denosumab injections every six months improve bone density more quickly than bisphosphonates, although bone density improvements fade within months after discontinuation unless bisphosphonates are started.
- Parathyroid hormone analog therapy for up to two years dramatically improves bone density and reduces fractures but requires subsequent bisphosphonate use to maintain benefit.
- One year of treatment with romosozumab, a sclerostin-binding analog, followed by one year of alendronate reduces fracture risk more than two years of alendronate therapy alone. Indications for Medical Treatment Medication is recommended for women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who have any of the following: T-score of −2.

5 or less for hip, lumbar spine, femoral neck, or distal third of radius History of fragility fracture, including incidental or asymptomatic vertebral fracture T-score between −1. 0 and −2. 5 and increased risk of fracture based on results from a clinical risk assessment tool, such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool. Anabolic Agents Anabolic agents restore lost bone structure in advanced osteoporosis and can be considered in patients with a very high risk of fracture. They should be followed by an antiresorptive agent to preserve bone density improvements. PARATHYROID HORMONE ANALOGS In patients with very high risk of fracture due to a history of severe or multiple vertebral fractures, a T-score of −3 or lower, or multiple risk factors, the parathyroid hormone analogs teriparatide and abaloparatide are highly effective.

Parathyroid hormone analogs can also be used in patients whose symptoms do not respond to antiresorptive therapy. Unlike antiresorptive agents, they can restore bone mass that is already lost in patients with advanced osteoporosis. Treatment duration should be limited to two years because of a possible risk of osteosarcoma. Although teriparatide and abaloparatide improve bone density and reduce vertebral and nonvertebral fracture, abaloparatide increases bone density more than teriparatide and more effectively reduces new vertebral fracture.

### Community based intervention to optimize osteoporosis management: randomized controlled trial [^112iDYyo]. BMC Geriatrics (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Osteoporosis, a chronic condition characterized by low bone mass, microarchitectural deterioration of bone and increased risk of fracture, is a significant public health concern. It affects over 200 million people worldwide, an estimated 10 million people in the US, 4 million people in the UK and 1.4 million people in Canada. Fragility fractures are the clinical consequence of osteoporosis. While vertebral fractures can cause back pain, loss of height and disability, hip fractures have a more significant impact on quality of life leading to loss of function, and admission to long-term care. It is estimated that 1 in 5 people who suffer a hip fracture will die during the first year and less than one third gain their pre-fracture level of function. Moreover, the economic impact of this condition is considerable, with the total acute care cost of osteoporosis estimated to be over $1.3 billion per year in Canada, $20 billion in the US and over €30 billion in Europe. Given that the proportion of people aged 65 and older is increasing, this will likely lead to an even more significant burden of disease.

A substantial body of evidence supports the use of various interventions for the detection and treatment of osteoporosis in high risk patients, and the prevention of related fractures including therapy with calcium, vitamin D, and drugs that decrease bone resorption or increase bone formation. For example, bisphosphonates reduce the risk of future osteoporosis-related fracture by 40 to 60% with fracture reduction apparent within a year of starting treatment.

Despite the incorporation of this evidence from randomized trials into clinical practice guidelines, these interventions are considerably underutilized. A systematic review found that the proportion of individuals with a fragility fracture who received a diagnostic test for osteoporosis or a diagnosis from a physician ranged from 1.7% to 50%. Furthermore, rates of osteoporosis treatment among elderly patients with a fracture of the wrist, hip or vertebrae are less than 10 to 20% in the year following fracture.

These care gaps highlight the finding that additional effort is needed to ensure that appropriate knowledge translation is achieved to optimize management of osteoporosis in patients at risk of fragility fractures. This study was designed to help fill this knowledge to practice gap. The primary objective of this study was to determine if a multicomponent, community-based strategy could optimize the evidence-based management of people at risk for osteoporosis-related fractures.

### Management recommendations for osteoporosis in clinical guidelines [^116aJnmH]. Clinical Endocrinology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Numerous guidelines advise about management of osteoporosis, but little research has been conducted on their recommendations. We analysed recommendations on management of bone health in clinical guidelines.

Design

We surveyed recommendations on assessment, treatment and monitoring of bone health in 78 clinical guidelines (22 primary focus osteoporosis, 56 primary focus not osteoporosis) lodged at the Agency for Health Research and Quality National Guidelines Clearinghouse between 1/1/2009 and 12/31/2014.

Measurements

Governance of guidelines; discussion of fracture risk in the target population; recommendations for assessment, treatment and monitoring of bone health.

Results

Only 14% of guidelines discussed fracture risk in the target population. When guidelines discussed assessment, 98% recommended bone mineral density (BMD) measurement but only 27% recommended estimation of fracture risk. When guidelines discussed treatment, 63–71% recommended calcium and/or vitamin D, while < 12% recommended avoiding low body weight or smoking cessation. When guidelines discussed intervention, 53% did so on the basis of BMD measurement, and only 27% on the basis of estimated fracture risk. When guidelines discussed monitoring, > 90% recommended BMD measurements, and only 3% recommended estimation of fracture risk. About 65% of guidelines that suggested a BMD monitoring interval recommended one of ≤ 3 years. Compared to guidelines with a primary focus on osteoporosis, guidelines whose primary focus was not osteoporosis were less likely to discuss fracture risk in the target population (2% vs 45%), recommend estimation of fracture risk (11% vs 55%) and recommend intervention on the basis of estimated fracture risk (10% vs 67%) (all P < 0.005).

Conclusions

Our findings highlight a strong focus in clinical guidelines on BMD, a surrogate measure, rather than fracture risk, the clinically important outcome, particularly when bone health is not the primary focus. Addressing this issue might facilitate more rational use of resources and improve patient care.

### ACR appropriateness criteria management of vertebral compression fractures [^116xFEJ5]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

This is an updated review of management of vertebral compression fracture for both benign osteoporotic and malignant causes. Vertebral compression fracture radiologic imaging evaluation is discussed. A literature review is provided of current indications for vertebral augmentation with percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty as well as medical management. Limitations and potential benefits of these procedures are discussed. Variant tables describing various clinical situations are also provided to assist in determining appropriate use of these treatments for patient care. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every 3 years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures by the panel. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to formulate recommendations for imaging or treatment.

### Recommendations for measurement of bone mineral density and identifying persons to be treated for osteoporosis [^111S7VTX]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines exist for the diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women. These guidelines present a uniform set of recommendations. Unfortunately, studies have shown a low rate of screening and treatment, particularly in high-risk groups, such as patients who have experienced a fracture. It is hoped that quality improvement projects, such as that being conducted by the American Medical Association in conjunction with numerous specialty societies, will lead to an improvement in physician practices in this area that will result in a reduction in morbidity and mortality from osteoporotic fractures.

### Long-term treatment strategies for postmenopausal osteoporosis [^117T3XHx]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Osteoporosis guidelines do not usually provide specific recommendations regarding what medication is most appropriate for individual patients. Generic oral bisphosphonates are often considered first-line treatment for osteoporosis, but treatment duration is limited, based on potential long-term safety concerns, and there is no consensus about what to do after 5 years. There are no recommendations concerning long-term management of osteoporosis over 30 or more years of postmenopausal life.

Recent Findings

This review attempts to specify medication choices and provide the best clinical management strategies for women at different stages of life and with different underlying disease severity. Because there is no evidence that considers the entire postmenopausal lifespan, much of the discussion here will be based on expert opinion. The review considers a role for estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators, oral and intravenous bisphosphonates, denosumab and the anabolic agents, teriparatide and abaloparatide.

Summary

Optimal sequential monotherapy, over an average of 30 postmenopausal years, should be able to minimize exposure to pharmacology while maximizing benefits on bone strength and minimizing imminent and long-term risk of fracture.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: an endocrine society guideline update [^115mvWot]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The objective is to provide an update of the 2019 Pharmacological Management of Osteoporosis in Postmenopausal Women: An Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline for the pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women using romosozumab.

Conclusions

We reviewed findings from the meta-analysis and primary clinical trials assessing the efficacy of romosozumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting sclerostin, for the prevention of fractures and concluded that this agent can be considered a treatment option for postmenopausal women at very high risk for osteoporotic fracture. The romosozumab label has a boxed warning, recommending careful consideration by the treating clinician as to cardiovascular risk profile in the individual woman who might receive this agent, since clinical trial data from an active comparator study show an imbalance in serious cardiovascular adverse events between romosozumab and alendronate.

### Diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis: what orthopaedic surgeons need to know [^111Qi7YL]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis, often called a silent disease, is a systemic condition of bone as a result of loss of bone mass and deterioration of its microarchitecture. The result is weakened bone, leading to an increased risk of fragility fractures. An estimated 9 million osteoporotic fractures occur every year worldwide. However, the true incidence of osteoporotic fractures is unknown because many are undetected. Astoundingly, this epidemic equates to an osteoporotic fracture every 3 seconds. Orthopaedic surgeons need to not only treat these fractures but also understand the underlying pathogenesis and risk factors to help prevent them. The management of osteoporosis is a critical part of musculoskeletal care. We must be familiar with the tools to assess osteoporosis and the treatments available, including risks and benefits. This review article is intended to deliver a review of the vast literature and provide the orthopaedic surgeon with the essential information necessary to manage the current osteoporosis epidemic.

Assessment of fracture risk

Osteoporotic fractures are associated with high morbidity, mortality and cost to society in terms of the use of health and social services. Both bone fragility and propensity to fall are important determinants of fracture risk. International consensus advises that fracture prevention should include identification of older adults at high falls risk, interventions to reduce that risk, identifying those with bone fragility (including osteoporosis) and instituting measures to reduce fracture risk (both pharmacological and non-pharmacological).
Adults with low trauma fractures and those with osteoporosis should have a falls risk assessment. Fracture liaison services, which identify people with recent fractures, are now in place in many areas and their remit should include identification of those at high falls risk in addition to investigating for osteoporosis.
Conversely, those identified as having a moderate to high falls risk should have a bone health assessment using local protocols. In this regard, fracture risk assessment tools such FRAX, Garvan and QFracture can be employed to identify older adults at high fracture risk, and bone densitometry can be used to confirm osteoporosis. International consensus osteoporosis management guidelines are in place to guide treatment.
Individuals aged 60 years and over with pre-existing comorbidities and increased risk of fractures should be assessed regularly for modifiable falls risk factors in LMIC. Furthermore, in individuals with fractures or increased risk of fractures within LMIC, falls risk assessments should be incorporated into their management strategies.

Synthesised evidence for the effect of interventions to enhance adherence to and/or persistence with antiosteoporosis medicines included one systematic review (14 662 participants), one prospective cohort studyand one cluster RCT(table 5). Available evidence suggests that simplification of antiosteoporosis medication dosing regimens, incorporating less frequent dosing, electronic prescriptions and osteoporosis management services provided by pharmacists, which incorporate counselling and/or monitoring of prescription redemption, may favourably affect medication adherence and lower discontinuation rates, although the amount of literature identified is limited. The effectiveness of educational interventions appears unclear.

### Approach to the patient with bone fracture: making the first fracture the last [^1146zkPD]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is characterized by loss of bone mass and deterioration in skeletal microarchitecture, leading to weakness of the skeleton and increased susceptibility of fragility, or osteoporotic fractures. An estimated 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men older than 50 years will experience an osteoporotic fracture in their remaining lifetime. The personal and economic burden of fragility fractures is considerable, with subsequent disability, pain, loss of independence, and increased mortality in affected patients. Currently, an estimated 200 million people worldwide suffer from osteoporosis; with a rapidly aging population, the prevalence of osteoporosis and fragility fractures will continue to increase, profoundly affecting national health care systems.

Any osteoporotic fracture significantly increases the risk of subsequent fractures. Numerous studies have shown that the risk of subsequent fracture is highest in the first 1 to 2 years following an initial fracture, and then gradually decline over time. Mortality has also shown to be significantly higher than in the general population after most fractures, with the exception of radius fractures. Hip fractures are particularly associated with high mortality, with 1-year mortality rates ranging between 23% and 33%.

Unfortunately osteoporosis, even when diagnosed, often does not draw the same level of clinical urgency as other health conditions despite the known deleterious consequences on mortality and morbidity. Less than 20% of patients who experience an osteoporotic fracture are initiated on appropriate pharmacotherapy post fracture, in studies from the United States, Canada, Denmark, and Australia. In an Australian primary care setting, the rate of osteoporosis treatment in those with radiologically confirmed vertebral fractures was even lower, at 3.8%, even though vertebral fractures confer the highest risk of refracture. Undiagnosed and untreated, up to 75% of such patients will sustain secondary fractures.

The undertreatment of osteoporosis persists despite widely available pharmacotherapy proven to be cost-effective and reduce the risk of subsequent fractures. The decision to investigate or treat patients for osteoporosis remains inconsistent and nonsystematic, with a previous study noting that lack of knowledge about for whom and when to intervene remains a substantial barrier to effective osteoporosis management. Low rates of appropriate treatment initiation following an osteoporotic fracture therefore constitute a considerable "osteoporosis care gap".

### Prevention and management of osteoporotic fractures by non-physician health professionals: a systematic literature review to inform EULAR points to consider [^115z5pun]. RMD Open (2020). Medium credibility.

What is the effect of strategies undertaken by non-physician HPs to implement recommendations for the prevention and management of osteoporotic fracture by potential stakeholders?

Five primary studies in various care settings contributed to the evidence synthesis about the effect of strategies to implement recommendations by stakeholders to prevent and manage osteoporotic fracture (table 5). These were grouped into three categories: (1) strategies to increase implementation of recommendations; (2) multidisciplinary team care and (3) interventions to enhance adherence to antiosteoporosis medicines.

Table 5
Characteristics of intervention studies and their main findings: implementation strategies to increase implementation of recommendations; multidisciplinary team (MDT) care; interventions to enhance adherence to antiosteoporosis medicines

Strategies to increase implementation of recommendations consisted of two or more components, these included: education and dissemination of educational materials, fall and fracture risk assessment, feedback through audit and evaluation, and a computer-aided decision support system. The three cluster RCTswere appraised as having unclear risk of other bias with respect to criteria particular to cluster trials, for example, baseline imbalances and loss of clusters.
Multisiciplinary teamcare was defined as care provided by two or more different care practitioners working together as/or supported by a multidisciplinary team. Selected publications focused on orthogeriatric inpatient care, fracture liaison services (FLS)and care pathways for people following hip fracture.
Interventions to enhance adherence to antiosteoporosis medicines was supported by evidence that suggests vitamin D and/or calcium prescribing by stakeholders may be increased in people at risk of fracture following implementation of multicomponent interventions by non-physicians, such as nurses, pharmacists and multiprofessional teams. Cox et al reported that supplements were 1.64 times more likely to be prescribed to care home residents in the intervention group (n = 3315) over the control group (n = 2322) (IRR 1.64, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.18; p < 0.01), while Kennedy et al stated an absolute improvement of approximately 15% in vitamin D and 7% in calcium prescribing for residents in long-term care following a 12-month multimodal education and quality improvement intervention. In one randomised study set in the community, treatment with calcium and vitamin D reportedly increased by 34% and 13%, respectively, although this study was at high risk of detection bias due to unblinded outcome assessors. One non-randomised studyshowed that a pharmacist-implemented clinical decision support system increased coprescription of vitamin D with a bisphosphonate by 29% compared with a historical control group. However, the effect of strategies on prescription of antiosteoporosis medicines was inconclusive, with 50% of studies reporting benefit. There was no statistically significant difference between intervention and control groups in fractures and falls.

Which diagnostic procedures, undertaken by non-physician HPs, are recommended in the assessment of risk of falling in adults at high risk of primary or secondary osteoporotic fracture?

Evidence about diagnostic procedures to assess risk of falls was extracted from one narrative review. The Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths and Injuries algorithm incorporates a stepped approach to falls risk screening, assessment and intervention, and is recommended for use. Key initial screening questions help to identify people who have fallen in the past year, feel unsteady or are fearful of falling. Responses guide further assessment. Subsequent screening, if required, includes the Timed Up and Go Test, with the Four-Stage Balance Test, the Five-Times Sit-to-Stand Testand other components of a multifactorial risk assessment if indicated. Recommended components include: a detailed falls history; medicines consumption and environmental and social factors associated with risk of falling; footwear and home hazards; evaluation of bodily systems, for example, via blood pressure monitoring; Fracture Risk Assessment Tool; and assessment of cognition and mental health. Although multiple tools are available to support the assessment of constituent factors associated with risk of falls, no specific tool is recommended, thereby reflecting the need for an individually tailored assessment.

What is the effect (including cost effectiveness and safety) of non-pharmacological treatments provided by non-physician HPs after osteoporotic fracture?

The evidence for this question clustered around (1) exercise, (2) nutrients including vitamin D plus calcium and oral nutritional supplements, (3) orthoses and (4) fall prevention programmes (table 3).

### Screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^116rcbRG]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

US Preventive Services Task Force osteoporosis screening — recommendations and net benefit: The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years or older and recommends screening in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years who are at increased risk for an osteoporotic fracture as estimated by clinical risk assessment; it concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening in men. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes with moderate certainty that screening for osteoporosis to prevent osteoporotic fractures in women 65 years or older has moderate net benefit and concludes with moderate certainty that screening in postmenopausal women younger than 65 years at increased risk has moderate net benefit, while the evidence is insufficient and the balance of benefits and harms for screening to prevent osteoporotic fractures in men cannot be determined. To achieve the benefit of screening to reduce morbidity and mortality from fractures, women found to have osteoporosis should be further evaluated, counseled, and, if appropriate, receive evidence-based management.

Methods

We aimed to identify and appraise the up-to date scientific literature about the effect of non-pharmacological interventions delivered by non-physician HPs to prevent and manage osteoporotic fracture in high-risk adults, age 50 years or more. High risk of osteoporotic fracture was categorised using BMD values for low bone mass (osteopenia) and osteoporosis specified by WHO, and/or short-term probability of fracture. The definition we used for high-risk adults is detailed in table 1.

Table 1
Definitions used by the taskforce to identify studies that included individuals at high risk of osteoporotic fracture

The aim of this SLR was to inform an international EULAR taskforce on a broad range of issues related to non-physician HPs' interventions. Non-physician HPs deliver different interventions in different countries. Therefore, we focused our review on interventions that could potentially be delivered by non-physician HPs, independent of whether a study was led by a non-physician HP or not.

### Osteoporotic thoracolumbar fractures-how are they different?-classification and treatment algorithm [^113FHvaY]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2017). Low credibility.

Osteoporotic vertebral fractures constitute at least 50% of the osteoporotic fractures that happen worldwide. Occurrence of osteoporotic fractures make the elderly patient susceptible for further fractures and increases the morbidity due to kyphosis and pain; the mortality risk is also increased in these patients. Most fractures occur in the thoracic and thoracolumbar region and are often stable. Different descriptive and prognostic classification systems have been described, but none are universally accepted. Radiographs, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are useful in imaging the fracture and evaluating the bone density. In acute stages, the fractures are well treated with conservative measures including short bed rest, analgesics, bracing, and exercises. Although most fractures heal well, up to 30% of fractures can develop painful nonunion, progressive kyphosis, and neurological deficit. For patients who develop severe pain not responding to nonoperative measures and painful nonunion, percutaneous cement augmentation procedures including vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty have been suggested. For fractures with severe collapse and that lead to neurological deficit and increasing kyphosis, instrumented stabilization is advised. Prevention and management of osteoporosis is the key element in the management of osteoporotic fractures in the elderly. Guidelines for essential adequate dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D, and antiosteoporotic medications have been described.

Osteoporosis is an epidemic in the developed world. Fracture is a major burden associated with osteoporosis. Surgical management is recommended for particular anatomical areas, whilst other fracture patterns have a less defined and controversial role for surgery. This review aims to highlight increase in the global burden of osteoporosis and subsequent fragility fractures. As health and life expectancy improves, osteoporotic fracture fixation will constitute a significant physical and economic burden. The surgical management of osteoporotic fractures involves awareness on all levels from government to the individual, from primary prevention of fracture to surgical aftercare in the community.

### Do we need bone mineral density to estimate osteoporotic fracture risk? A 10-year prospective multicentre validation study [^112g538s]. RMD Open (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Osteoporotic fractures currently represent an enormous social and economic burden worldwide, which will tend to increase persistently due to the progressive ageing of the population and other societal changes, unless effective preventive measures are taken.

For cost-effectiveness purposes, preventive strategies should be based on the absolute risk of osteoporotic fractures in the individual patient. FRAX®is the most widely used tool to estimate osteoporotic fracture probabilities, and it has been incorporated in a large number of guidelines for the prevention and management of osteoporosis.FRAX® estimates are based on a set of easily assessable clinical risk factors, with or without consideration of femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD), making it a feasible tool, even in technically deprived environments.

Given the differences in the incidence of major osteoporotic (MOP) fractures between countries, FRAX® should be validated in national cohorts to optimise its predictive value in each country. A recent systematic reviewdemonstrated that this has not always been done and that most validation studies have significant bias, especially recruitment bias regarding the target population, and missing data on clinical risk factors. Few of these studies worldwide have been conducted in the general population.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of FRAX® in predicting the 10-year probability of osteoporotic fractures using data from three prospective cohorts from the general population. We also investigated the value of adding BMD to the clinical parameters of FRAX®.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116ZQLhe]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2006 regarding the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Methods

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document. A panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of metabolic bone diseases and/or women's health was enlisted to review the 2006 NAMS position statement, compile supporting statements, and reach consensus on recommendations. The panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Osteoporosis, which is especially prevalent among older postmenopausal women, increases the risk of fractures. Hip and spine fractures are associated with particularly high morbidity and mortality in this population. Given the health implications of osteoporotic fractures, the primary goal of osteoporosis therapy is to prevent fractures, which is accomplished by slowing or stopping bone loss, maintaining bone strength, and minimizing or eliminating factors that may contribute to fractures. The evaluation of postmenopausal women for osteoporosis risk requires a medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Major risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis (as defined by bone mineral density) include advanced age, genetics, lifestyle factors (such as low calcium and vitamin D intake, smoking), thinness, and menopause status. The most common risk factors for osteoporotic fracture are advanced age, low bone mineral density, and previous fracture as an adult. Management focuses first on nonpharmacologic measures, such as a balanced diet, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, adequate exercise, smoking cessation, avoidance of excessive alcohol intake, and fall prevention. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, government-approved options are bisphosphonates, selective estrogen-receptor modulators, parathyroid hormone, estrogens, and calcitonin.

Conclusions

Management strategies for postmenopausal women involve identifying those at risk for fracture, followed by instituting measures that focus on reducing modifiable risk factors through dietary and lifestyle changes and, if indicated, pharmacologic therapy.

Diminished bone mass and frequent comminution make fixation difficult. Advancements in implant design and fixation techniques have served to address these challenges and when properly applied, can improve overall outcome. The purpose of this review is to describe fixation challenges of common osteoporotic fractures and provide options for successful treatment.

### Osteoporotic hip and spine fractures: a current review [^112zU8JK]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2014). Low credibility.

Hip and spine fractures represent just a portion of the burden of osteoporosis; however, these fractures require treatment and often represent a major change in lifestyle for the patient and their family. The orthopedic surgeon plays a crucial role, not only in the treatment of these injuries but also providing guidance in prevention of future osteoporotic fractures. This review provides a brief epidemiology of the fractures, details the surgical techniques, and outlines the current treatment guidelines for orthopedic surgeons.

### Postmenopausal osteoporosis: a review of latest guidelines [^113mgmFo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

Osteoporosis is characterized by increased bone turnover and reduced bone mass, leading to skeletal fragility and heightened fracture risk. It is a growing public health concern with expectations for a continued significant rise of fractures by 50% in 2030. Diagnosis is typically based on body mineral density with a T-score of -2.5 or lower indicating osteoporosis. Treatment duration varies, and is determined by careful monitoring of fracture risk and timing for potential drug holidays. Emerging therapies and ongoing research continue to evolve the landscape of osteoporosis management, aiming to reduce fracture risk and improve patient outcomes.

### Conservative care for patients with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures [^111uP1Jx]. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

As the aging population grows, vertebral compression fractures are becoming an important source of pain and dysfunction. Management can be complex, because care may require multiple treatment modalities and the treatment plan must be tailored to the individual's pain, functional limitations, and goals. Treatment options usually involve a combination of medications, bracing, and physical therapy. This article reviews current recommendations for managing vertebral compression fractures. Indications, complications, and treatment options, including vertebral augmentation, are discussed.

### What are the preferred first… [^112CcBBp]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

EVIDENCE SUMMARY The decision to treat is determined based on fracture risk assessment. Clinical practice guidelines from the Endocrine Society, the AACE/ACE, and the Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation support the use of pharmacologic treatment for patients with a previous hip or vertebral fracture; patients with a T-score of −2. 5 or less at the femoral neck, total hip, or lumbar spine; or patients with a T-score between −1 and −2. 5 and a 10-year risk of at least 20% for major osteoporotic fracture or at least 3% for hip fracture based on the FRAX tool. How Long Should Patients Receive Treatment for Osteoporosis. Patients receiving oral or intravenous bisphosphonates should be reassessed after five years and three years of therapy, respectively, to determine if a drug holiday is appropriate. Patients at high fracture risk may continue oral therapy for up to 10 years or up to six years for intravenous therapy.

Denosumab therapy should be reevaluated at five and 10 years. Teriparatide, abaloparatide, and romosozumab should be continued for two years, 18 months, and one year, respectively, followed by the usual course of antiresorptive therapy. Several organizations recommend that patients consider a drug holiday after five years of oral therapy or three years of intravenous therapy. 4, 14, 25 A drug holiday is defined as a period of up to five years when patients are receiving no therapy. 4, 14, 25 For patients who are at high risk of fracture, oral bisphosphonates can be considered for up to 10 years, intravenous bisphosphonates for up to six years, or alternative therapy. Anabolic agents have optimal durations to maximize effectiveness and decrease risks. Both parathyroid hormone analogues, teriparatide and abaloparatide, are approved for up to two years; however, clinical trials demonstrating improvements in BMD and fracture risk with abaloparatide lasted only 18 months.

26 Romosozumab is approved for one year of therapy because prolonged therapy provided limited additional benefit. Because of the rapid loss of BMD after discontinuation of anabolic agents, antiresorptive therapy should be initiated following therapy completion. 4, 14, 15.

### An evaluation of treatment patterns for osteoporosis and outcomes after a fragility fracture in a real-world setting [^117G9EJo]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2023). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

An osteoporosis-related fracture is a sentinel event, and appropriate disease management is critical to reduce the risk of subsequent fractures. In addition to the primary prevention measures recommended by the United States Preventive Services Taskforce, bone mineral density (BMD) assessment after a fracture is recommended by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guidelines, the National Bone Health and Osteoporosis Foundation, formerly known as the National Osteoporosis Foundation (for all patients ≥ 50 years of age), and the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (for patients 65–85 years of age). Those with a history of fracture, particularly those with a recent fracture (within 12 months) and/or multiple fractures, are considered to be at very high risk for subsequent fractures, as are patients with concomitant comorbidities or medications associated with bone loss.

After evaluation and osteoporosis diagnosis, disease progression and outcomes are affected by the frequency of treatment initiation and treatment persistence. Previous studies have shown that most women ≥ 50 years of age with a new osteoporosis-related fracture do not undergo evaluation for osteoporosis or initiate treatment after their incident fracture. In addition, fracture incidence, which was previously declining in the United States, is no longer declining and may be on the rise. Although previous studies have focused on specific populations of patients from a single payer, this observational study provides an evaluation of osteoporosis management in a geographically diverse population with data aggregated across multiple payers, using both commercial and Medicare claims. It is uncertain to what extent recurrent fractures contribute to the overall increased burden of disease. Furthermore, the rate of secondary fracture in subgroups of patients at very high risk for fractures is yet to be determined. The objectives of this study were to evaluate osteoporosis management, including BMD assessment and initiation of osteoporosis medications in the year after index fracture and to assess secondary fracture rates overall and in a subpopulation of high-risk patients.

### Approach to the patient with bone fracture: making the first fracture the last [^115PyTEj]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

The global burden of osteoporosis and osteoporotic fractures will increase significantly as we enter a rapidly aging population. Osteoporotic fractures lead to increased morbidity, mortality, and risk of subsequent fractures if left untreated. However, studies have shown that the majority of patients who suffer an osteoporotic fracture are not investigated or treated for osteoporosis, leading to an inexcusable "osteoporosis care gap". Systematic and coordinated models of care in secondary fracture prevention known as fracture liaison services (FLS) have been established to streamline and improve the care of patients with osteoporotic fractures, and employ core principles of identification, investigation, and initiation of treatment. Our approach to the multifaceted care of secondary fracture prevention at a hospital-based FLS is illustrated through several case vignettes.

### Management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: 2006 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111JdZ7G]. Menopause (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2002 regarding the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document. A panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of metabolic bone diseases and/or women's health were enlisted to review the 2002 NAMS position statement, compile supporting statements, and reach consensus on recommendations. The panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees.

Results

Osteoporosis, whose prevalence is especially high among elderly postmenopausal women, increases the risk of fractures. Hip and spine fractures are associated with particularly high morbidity and mortality in this population. Given the health implications of osteoporotic fractures, the primary goal of osteoporosis therapy is to prevent fractures, which is accomplished by slowing or stopping bone loss, maintaining bone strength, and minimizing or eliminating factors that may contribute to fractures. The evaluation of postmenopausal women for osteoporosis risk requires a medical history, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Major risk factors for postmenopausal osteoporosis (as defined by bone mineral density) include advanced age, genetics, lifestyle factors (such as low calcium and vitamin D intake, smoking), thinness, and menopause status. The most common risk factors for osteoporotic fracture are advanced age, low bone mineral density, and previous fracture as an adult. Management focuses first on nonpharmacologic measures, such as a balanced diet, adequate calcium and vitamin D intake, adequate exercise, smoking cessation, avoidance of excessive alcohol intake, and fall prevention. If pharmacologic therapy is indicated, government-approved options are bisphosphonates, a selective estrogen-receptor modulator, parathyroid hormone, estrogens, and calcitonin.

Conclusions

Management strategies for postmenopausal women involve identifying those at risk of low bone density and fracture, followed by instituting measures that focus on reducing modifiable risk factors through lifestyle changes and, if indicated, pharmacologic therapy.

### A guide to improving the care of patients with fragility fractures, edition 2 [^111woa19]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Over the past 4 decades, much has been learned about the pathophysiology and treatment of osteoporosis, the prevention of fragility fractures, and the perioperative management of patients who have these debilitating injuries. However, the volume of published literature on this topic is staggering and far too voluminous for any clinician to review and synthesize by him or herself. This manuscript thoroughly summarizes the latest research on fragility fractures and provides the reader with valuable strategies to optimize the prevention and management of these devastating injuries. The information contained in this article will prove invaluable to any health care provider or health system administrator who is involved in the prevention and management of fragility hip fractures. As providers begin to gain a better understanding of the principles espoused in this article, it is our hope that they will be able to use this information to optimize the care they provide for elderly patients who are at risk of or who have osteoporotic fractures.
