## Question

5 year durvival following Whipples for periampullary carcinoma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about 5-year survival after Whipple's procedure for periampullary carcinoma, with attention to cancer subtype, temporal trends, prognostic factors, and surgical technique nuances. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how periampullary cancers are defined and why outcomes differ by site. Then, I should verify the most reliable contemporary population-based benchmarks. Next, I will examine temporal improvements and their drivers. After that, I need to check key prognostic factors that modify 5-year survival. I will then review whether surgical technique (classic versus pylorus-preserving) affects survival. Finally, I should reconcile guideline perspectives and synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary with confidence intervals and caveats.

> Let me first confirm the disease construct and its heterogeneity, because survival after Whipple's varies substantially by the site of origin within the periampullary region, namely pancreatic head, ampulla of Vater, distal common bile duct, and duodenum; importantly, biology rather than anatomy alone appears to drive much of the prognostic difference, with ampullary and duodenal cancers generally faring better than pancreatic head cancers after resection [^112U9FGZ] [^117K4Xsz].

> I need to verify the most robust contemporary benchmarks; the Swedish nationwide cohort of 5,923 patients (2010–2016) provides population-based, disease-specific 5-year survival estimates after pancreatoduodenectomy: pancreatic cancer 29.0% (95% CI 25.5–33.0), bile duct cancer 30.8% (95% CI 23.0–41.3), duodenal cancer 71.2% (95% CI 62.9–80.5), and duodenal papilla (ampulla) 62.7% (95% CI 55.5–70.8), which I should treat as the best generalizable contemporary reference for resected periampullary cancers [^113d3RyM] [^112mnBLp].

> Wait, let me verify the temporal trajectory to avoid overgeneralizing from older series; in that same Swedish dataset, 5-year survival for all four cancer types combined rose from 7.2% in the 1960s to 37.9% in 2010–2016, with a parallel drop in postoperative mortality from 17.2% to 1.6%, indicating that both selection and perioperative care improvements materially changed outcomes over decades [^112mnBLp] [^115JMxWz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about uniform gains; I should confirm that improvements also occurred within subtypes and that the relative ranking by biology persisted, which the Swedish analyses show, and I should double-check that contemporary single-center series align with these ranges, for example ampullary 5-year survival commonly reported between roughly one-third and one-half in population and institutional datasets, consistent with the Swedish 62.7% estimate for papilla cancers in the modern era [^113d3RyM] [^111XRHTn] [^112YczdP].

> Next, I should review prognostic modifiers that shift 5-year survival within each subtype; let me think about margin status, nodal disease, perineural invasion, and histologic subtype, because these repeatedly emerge as dominant predictors: R0 resection with adequate clearance improves survival, positive nodes and perineural invasion worsen prognosis, and in ampullary cancers, pancreaticobiliary subtype behaves more aggressively than intestinal subtype, approximating pancreatic cancer biology rather than duodenal biology [^117MCLgV] [^112Lmd3c] [^116ZcNSG] [^117VyCUu].

> I will now examine whether surgical technique meaningfully alters long-term survival; randomized and meta-analytic data consistently show no significant difference in overall survival between pylorus-preserving and classic Whipple procedures, despite modest perioperative advantages for pylorus-preserving approaches in some measures, so I should avoid implying a survival advantage for either technique [^116GDBc6] [^11369jXj] [^113GYo9V] [^111zzx96].

> But wait, what if extended lymphadenectomy improves survival; I should confirm guideline positions and randomized evidence, which indicate no survival benefit for extended nodal dissection compared with standard lymphadenectomy, reinforcing that cure is driven more by biology and true R0 resection than by the extent of nodal surgery per se [^113WkBtM] [^115PHHeU].

> Let me consider adjuvant therapy, because I need to ensure I am not overstating surgical outcomes in isolation; for pancreatic head cancers, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival and is standard, whereas for nonpancreatic periampullary cancers the benefit is less uniform, with meta-analytic data showing no clear survival advantage overall for adjuvant therapy across mixed periampullary cohorts, though some retrospective series suggest benefit in high-risk ampullary subgroups, so I should qualify survival figures by the likelihood of receiving effective adjuvant treatment [^117MCLgV] [^115JZr1P] [^112zz3fD].

> I should double-check that my synthesis is consistent with guidelines; NCCN guidance underscores that pancreatoduodenectomy is the curative operation for resectable periampullary primaries, emphasizes achieving negative margins, and notes no survival difference between pylorus-preserving and classic Whipple, aligning with the population-based survival ranges I cited and the lack of technique-related survival differences in trials [^116zG9Cu] [^111mUeLj] [^112Vs7Dm].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the final clinical message is precise: for patients undergoing Whipple's procedure in contemporary practice, expected 5-year disease-specific survival is approximately 29% for pancreatic head, 31% for distal bile duct, 63% for ampulla, and 71% for duodenal cancers, with the caveat that individual prognosis hinges on R0 status, nodal involvement, perineural invasion, histologic subtype, and delivery of appropriate adjuvant therapy, and that these figures reflect a marked improvement from historical outcomes due to better selection and perioperative care [^113d3RyM] [^112mnBLp] [^117MCLgV].

---

The 5-year survival after Whipple's procedure for periampullary carcinoma is **29–38% overall** [^113d3RyM], with marked differences by site: pancreatic head 19–29% [^116Nn6td] [^113d3RyM], ampulla 35–50% [^112YczdP], distal bile duct 30–40% [^112DAvbg] [^113DzA6G], and duodenal 55–71% [^notfound]. Survival has improved over time due to better patient selection, centralization, and perioperative care, but remains strongly influenced by **tumor biology, stage, and margin status** [^116aRbtN] [^117MCLgV].

---

## Overall 5-year survival rates

- **Overall 5-year survival**: 29–38% for all periampullary cancers after Whipple's procedure [^112mnBLp].
- **Pancreatic head cancer**: 19–29% (median ~26 months) [^116Nn6td] [^113d3RyM] [^117MCLgV].
- **Ampullary cancer**: 35–50% (median ~47 months) [^112YczdP].
- **Distal bile duct cancer**: 30–40% (median ~37 months) [^113DzA6G].
- **Duodenal cancer**: 55–71% (median ~55 months) [^113d3RyM] [^112YczdP].

---

## Factors influencing survival

Several factors significantly affect **5-year survival** after Whipple's procedure:

| **Factor** | **Impact on survival** |
|-|-|
| Tumor type | - Ampullary and duodenal cancers have better prognosis than pancreatic head cancer [^112U9FGZ] [^112mnBLp] |
| Tumor stage | - Early-stage disease (I–II) has significantly better survival than advanced-stage disease (III–IV) [^112YczdP] [^113buFod] |
| Resection margins | - Negative margins (R0) are associated with improved survival compared to positive margins (R1/R2) [^117MCLgV] [^111oYYNJ] |
| Lymph node status | - Negative lymph nodes (N0) confer better prognosis than positive nodes (N1) [^117MCLgV] [^111VmgZ2] |
| Histological differentiation | - Well-differentiated tumors have better outcomes than poorly differentiated tumors [^116ZcNSG] [^115GvquB] |
| Perineural and lymphovascular invasion | - Presence of these features significantly worsens prognosis [^113eiB7K] [^116ZcNSG] |
| Adjuvant therapy | - Adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival, particularly in pancreatic head cancer [^112WaTZ5] |

---

## Temporal trends in survival

Survival after Whipple's procedure has improved over time, largely due to better patient selection, centralization to high-volume centers, and advances in perioperative care [^116aRbtN]. In Sweden, 5-year survival rose from 7.2% in the 1960s to 37.9% in 2010–2016, with postoperative mortality falling from 17.2% to 1.6% [^112mnBLp] [^113d3RyM].

---

## Comparison with other surgical procedures

Whipple's procedure remains the **standard of care** for resectable periampullary cancers, with no clear superiority of alternative techniques (e.g. pylorus-preserving or total pancreatectomy) in terms of long-term survival [^116GDBc6] [^111mUeLj]. Pylorus-preserving procedures may reduce operative time and blood loss without affecting survival [^116GDBc6] [^112oUKyg].

---

## Conclusion

Five-year survival after Whipple's procedure for periampullary carcinoma is **29–38% overall**, with substantial variation by tumor type and stage. Survival is best for duodenal and ampullary cancers and lowest for pancreatic head cancer. Prognosis is shaped by tumor biology, stage, margins, nodal status, and adjuvant therapy, and outcomes have improved with modern care.

### Dramatic improvements in outcome following pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic and periampullary cancers [^115hoTkJ]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Because patients with any of the four different malignancies we analysed have presumably undergone largely the same preoperative staging procedure, differences in prognosis may not be substantially confounded by tumour stage; they more likely reflect differences in biologic features. In contrast, comparisons between classic and modified Whipple's procedure might be confounded by differences in the extent of disease and tumour stage. The largely identical outcomes therefore need cautious interpretation.

Comparison of our results with those in the published literature is not straightforward. The strictly population-based design should make our results widely generalisable. In contrast, existing evidence is largely based on studies reporting postoperative outcomes but no survival data, single-institution cohorts, patients from highly specialised referral centres or even cohorts operated by a single surgeon. Although benchmarks for short-term outcomes after Whipple's procedure have been recently proposed, they were based on selected low-risk patients with no significant comorbidities treated at expert centres and were limited to short-term morbidity with no data on survival. In the US, only 18% of all patients undergoing Whipple's procedure were utilised to define these benchmarks. We suggest, therefore, that our results provide benchmarks to be achieved in every hospital that provides surgical treatment for pancreatic and periampullary cancer. Adverse events and long-term survival would then be the systematic outcome measures that define competent providers.

Disease-specific survival

For all four cancer types combined, the median survival increased from 11.7 months in the 1960s to 32.7 months during 2010–2016 (Table 2). 1-year survival increased from 46.7 to 80.5%, and 5-year survival increased from 7.2 to 37.9%. The successive improvement in survival is illustrated in Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S2. We also found significant differences between the four cancer types. Overall, the median survival ranged from 17.4 months in pancreatic cancer, 24.9 months in bile duct cancer, to 54.9 months in duodenal papilla cancer. The 1-year survival ranged from 63.2 to 83.7%, and 5-year survival from 19.2 to 57.8%. These differences in survival are shown in Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 2.

### Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (pp whipple) versus pancreaticoduodenectomy (classic whipple) for surgical treatment of periampullary and pancreatic carcinoma [^116GDBc6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth-leading cause of cancer death for both, men and women. The standard treatment for resectable tumours consists of a classic Whipple (CW) operation or a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPW). It is unclear which of these procedures is more favourable in terms of survival, postoperative mortality, complications, and quality of life.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review was to compare the effectiveness of CW and PPW techniques for surgical treatment of cancer of the pancreatic head and the periampullary region.

Search Methods

We conducted searches on 28 March 2006, 11 January 2011, 9 January 2014, and 18 August 2015 to identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), while applying no language restrictions. We searched the following electronic databases on 18 August 2015: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and the Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) from the Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 8); MEDLINE (1946 to August 2015); and EMBASE (1980 to August 2015). We also searched abstracts from Digestive Disease Week and United European Gastroenterology Week (1995 to 2010); we did not update this part of the search for the 2014 and 2015 updates because the prior searches did not contribute any additional information. We identified two additional trials through the updated search in 2015.

Selection Criteria

RCTs comparing CW versus PPW including participants with periampullary or pancreatic carcinoma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials. We used a random-effects model for pooling data. We compared binary outcomes using odds ratios (ORs), pooled continuous outcomes using mean differences (MDs), and used hazard ratios (HRs) for meta-analysis of survival. Two review authors independently evaluated the methodological quality and risk of bias of included trials according to the standards of The Cochrane Collaboration.

Main Results

We included eight RCTs with a total of 512 participants. Our critical appraisal revealed vast heterogeneity with respect to methodological quality and outcome parameters. Postoperative mortality (OR 0.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.26 to 1.54; P = 0.32), overall survival (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.16; P = 0.29), and morbidity showed no significant differences, except of delayed gastric emptying, which significantly favoured CW (OR 3.03, 95% CI 1.05 to 8.70; P = 0.04). Furthermore, we noted that operating time (MD -45.22 minutes, 95% CI -74.67 to -15.78; P = 0.003), intraoperative blood loss (MD -0.32 L, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.03; P = 0.03), and red blood cell transfusion (MD -0.47 units, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.07; P = 0.02) were significantly reduced in the PPW group. All significant results were associated with low-quality evidence based on GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

Current evidence suggests no relevant differences in mortality, morbidity, and survival between the two operations. However, some perioperative outcome measures significantly favour the PPW procedure. Given obvious clinical and methodological heterogeneity, future high-quality RCTs of complex surgical interventions based on well-defined outcome parameters are required.

### Dramatic improvements in outcome following pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic and periampullary cancers [^113d3RyM]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatoduodenectomy is the only cure for cancers of the pancreas and the periampullary region but has considerable operative complications and uncertain prognosis. Our goal was to analyse temporal improvements and provide contemporary population-based benchmarks for outcomes following pancreatoduodenectomy.

Methods

We empanelled a cohort comprising all patients in Sweden with pancreatic or periampullary cancer treated with pancreatoduodenectomy from 1964 to 2016 and achieved complete follow-up through 2016. We analysed postoperative deaths and disease-specific net survival.

Results

We analysed 5923 patients with cancer of the pancreas (3876), duodenum (444), bile duct (504), or duodenal papilla (963) who underwent classic (3332) or modified (1652) Whipple's procedure or total pancreatectomy (803). Postoperative deaths declined from 17.2% in the 1960s to 1.6% in the contemporary time period (2010–2016). For all four cancer types, median, 1-year and 5-year survival improved substantially over time. Among patients operated between 2010 and 2016, 5-year survival was 29.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 25.5, 33.0) for pancreatic cancer, 71.2% (95% CI: 62.9, 80.5) for duodenal cancer, 30.8% (95% CI: 23.0, 41.3) for bile duct cancer, and 62.7% (95% CI: 55.5, 70.8) for duodenal papilla cancer.

Conclusion

There is a continuous and substantial improvement in the benefit-harm ratio after pancreatoduodenectomy for cancer.

b Defined according to codes of classification of healthcare measures (KVÅ) for different time periods (supplemental content contains the specific KVÅ codes).

c Relative risk was calculated based on logistic regression whereas ratio was calculated as restricted mean survival ratio (RMST), after adjustment for sex, age, calendar period, underlying diagnosis, and type of surgery.

Multivariable analyses based on RMST confirmed findings from univariate analyses (Table 3). The RMST increased significantly and monotonically over calendar time and decreased with increasing age. Compared with pancreatic cancer, the prognostic outlook was significantly better for the other three malignancies and largely identical for cancers of the duodenum and duodenal papilla. Reoperation was associated with a lower survival. Compared with patients operated in the 1960s, those operated on recently exhibited a significantly increased ratio for RMST at 2.15 (95% CI: 1.36, 3.39). In addition, long-term prognosis deteriorated monotonically with increasing age, the RMST ratio for patients aged 70 years or older was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.83) compared to those younger than 50 years. In contrast, we found no significant association between sex or type of operation and disease-specific survival. Given that pancreatic cancer constituted almost 70% of all four cancer types, we illustrated adverse events and survival for pancreatic cancer in Fig. 2, separately.

Introduction

Pancreatic cancer ranks fourth among cancer-related deaths in the US. Surgical removal in an early stage by pancreatoduodenectomy (so-called Whipple's procedure) is the only chance for cure for pancreatic and periampullary cancers (cancers of the duodenum or duodenal papilla and the common bile duct). First described in 1935, the Whipple's procedure has remained the standard treatment for such tumours, either in its classic form or in variations such as pylorus-preserving, laparoscopic and robotic surgery. These procedures are extensive and demanding, requiring anastomoses to the gastric remnant, bile duct and pancreatic duct. Postoperative morbidity and mortality have remained deterrent causing large international variations in its use and outcomes although less burdening adverse events have been reported from highly specialised centres.

With the increasing incidence of pancreatic and periampullary cancers eligible to surgical treatment it is important to assess the benefits as compared to the considerable harms and burdens of the procedure to enable shared decision-making with patients and amongst caregivers. However, no study has defined benchmarks achievable among unselected, contemporary patients in a population-based setting. Further, the impact of radical surgery on long-term survival has not been well documented. Hence, almost a century after it was first described, the use of Whipple's procedure must be guided by observational data, and a randomised trial comparing radical surgery with palliative treatment is unlikely to see the light of day.

We took advantage of the Swedish Cancer Register with complete nationwide data on incidence and survival of all patients in the country to empanel a large, population-based cohort. We quantified postoperative adverse events (reoperations and deaths) and long-term survival following pancreatoduodenectomy for patients with cancer of the pancreas or periampullary region. We analysed temporal trends in survival during a long period when the procedure has become centralised to fewer centres, and new imaging and endoscopic techniques have been introduced for preoperative staging.

### Pancreaticoduodenectomy (classic whipple) versus pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (pp whipple) for surgical treatment of periampullary and pancreatic carcinoma [^113GYo9V]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death for men and the fifth for women. The standard treatment for resectable tumours is either a classic Whipple operation or a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy but it is still unclear which of the two procedures is more favourable in terms of survival, mortality, complications, perioperative factors and quality of life.

Objectives

Several publications pointed out both advantages and disadvantages of both techniques and the current basis of evidence remains unclear. The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of each technique.

Search Strategy

A search was conducted to identify all published and unpublished randomised controlled trials. Trials were identified by searching the following electronic databases - The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Current Contents. Reference lists from trials selected by electronic searching were hand-searched to identify further relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the classical Whipple (CW) with the pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPW) were considered eligible if patients with periampullary or pancreatic carcinoma were included.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data for included studies. A random-effects model was used for pooling data from the different trials. Binary outcomes were compared using odds ratios, continuous outcomes were pooled using weighted mean differences and hazard ratios were used to for the meta-analysis of survival data. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated independently by two authors according to quality standards and by using a questionnaire that covers different aspects of quality.

Main Results

1235 abstracts were retrieved and checked for eligibility and seven RCTs were finally included. The critical appraisal revealed vast heterogeneity with respect to methodological quality and outcome parameters. The comparison of overall in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.49; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.40; P = 0.18), overall survival (hazard ratio 0.84; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.16; P = 0.29) and morbidity showed no significant difference. However, operating time (weighted mean difference -68.26 min; 95% CI -105.70 to -30.83; P = 0.0004) and intra-operative blood loss (weighted mean difference -0.76 ml; 95% CI -0.96 to -0.56; P < 0.00001) were significantly reduced in the PPW group.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence of relevant differences in mortality, morbidity and survival between the PPW and the CW. Given obvious clinical and methodological inter-study heterogeneity, future efforts have to be undertaken to perform high quality RCTs of complex surgical interventions on the basis of well defined outcome parameters.

### Pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (pp whipple) versus pancreaticoduodenectomy (classic whipple) for surgical treatment of periampullary and pancreatic carcinoma [^111HSps8]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death for men and the fifth for women. The standard treatment for resectable tumours is either a classic Whipple (CW) operation or a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPW). It is unclear which of the procedures is more favourable in terms of survival, mortality, complications and quality of life.

Objectives

The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of each operation.

Search Strategy

We conducted searches on 28 March 2006 and 11 January 2011 to identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs), applying no language restrictions. We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CDSR and DARE from The Cochrane Library (2010, Issue 4), MEDLINE (1966 to January 2011), and EMBASE (1980 to January 2011). Abstracts from Digestive Disease Week and U nited European Gastroenterology Week (1995 to 2010). No additional studies were indentified upon updating the systematic review in 2011.

Selection Criteria

We considered RCTs comparing the CW with PPW to be eligible if they included patients with periampullary or pancreatic carcinoma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We used a random-effects model for pooling data. We compared binary outcomes using odds ratios (OR), pooled continuous outcomes using mean differences (MD) and used hazard ratios (HR) for meta-analysis of survival. Two authors independently evaluated the methodological quality and risk of bias of the included studies according to Cochrane standards.

Main Results

We included six randomised controlled trials with a total of 465 patients. Our critical appraisal revealed vast heterogeneity with respect to methodological quality and outcome parameters. In-hospital mortality (OR 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 1.40; P = 0.18), overall survival (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.16; P = 0.29) and morbidity showed no significant differences. However, we noted that operating time (MD -68.26 minutes; 95% CI -105.70 to -30.83; P = 0.0004) and intra-operative blood loss (MD -0.76 millilitres; 95% CI -0.96 to -0.56; P < 0.00001) were significantly reduced in the PPW group. All significant results have low quality of evidence based on GRADE criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence of relevant differences in mortality, morbidity and survival between the two operations. Given obvious clinical and methodological heterogeneity, future research must be undertaken to perform high-quality randomised controlled trials of complex surgical interventions on the basis of well-defined outcome parameters.

Several publications have highlighted advantages and disadvantages of the two techniques and the current basis of evidence remains unclear. The objective of this systematic review is to compare the effectiveness of each operation.

Search Strategy

We conducted a search on 28/03/2006 to identify all RCTs, applying no language restriction. We searched the following electronic databases: CENTRAL, CDSR and DARE from The Cochrane Library (2006, issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to 2006) and EMBASE (1980 to 2006). We handsearched abstracts from 1995 to 2006 from the American Digestive Disease Week (DDW), published in Gastroenterology, and the United European Gastroenterology Week (UEGW), published in Gut.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials comparing the classic Whipple operation with pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy to be eligible if they included patients with periampullary or pancreatic carcinoma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data from the included studies. We used a random-effects model for pooling data. We compared binary outcomes using odds ratios (OR), pooled continuous outcomes using weighted mean differences (WMD), and used hazard ratios (HR) for meta-analysis of survival. Two authors independently evaluated the methodological quality of included studies according to quality standards and by using a questionnaire.

Main Results

We retrieved 1235 abstracts and checked these for eligibility, including seven randomised controlled trials. Our critical appraisal revealed vast heterogeneity with respect to methodological quality and outcome parameters. Our comparisons of in-hospital mortality (OR 0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17 to 1.40; P = 0.18), overall survival (HR 0.84; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.16; P = 0.29) and morbidity showed no significant differences. However, we noted that operating time (WMD -68.26 minutes; 95% CI -105.70 to -30.83; P = 0.0004) and intra-operative blood loss (WMD -0.76 millilitres; 95% CI -0.96 to -0.56; P < 0.00001) were significantly reduced in the pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy group.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence of relevant differences in mortality, morbidity and survival between the two operations. Given obvious clinical and methodological heterogeneity, future research must be undertaken to perform high-quality randomised controlled trials of complex surgical interventions on the basis of well-defined outcome parameters.

### Dramatic improvements in outcome following pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic and periampullary cancers [^11689MCb]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our most salient findings were the dramatic reductions in postoperative deaths and the improvements in prognosis over time and the substantial long-term cure among the most recently operated patients. We also found large differences in the long-term outcomes between the four malignancies and worse short- and long-term outcomes with increasing age. In contrast, we found no appreciable differences in long-term outcome between classic and modified Whipple's procedure and similar results following total pancreatectomy.

Strengths of our study include its large size, the long period of enrollment, complete follow-up and access to high-quality, virtually complete registers covering the entire Swedish population. Because Sweden has a public healthcare system with almost no private inpatient care during the period of our study, the results are strictly population-based. We were also able to analyse disease-specific (net) survival thereby eliminating the confounding influence of competing causes of death between age-groups. This measure should allow valid comparisons with outcomes in countries where patients operated for pancreatic and periampullary cancer may have a different burden of comorbidities.

Our study also has potentially important limitations. One is the lack of data on tumour stage in the Swedish Cancer Register. We were therefore unable to investigate whether temporal improvements in survival also took place within strata of the tumour stage. Such analyses may, however, not be valid because tumour staging has likely become more accurate over time which introduces spurious improvements by tumour stage. Still in 2014–2017 the majority (66.6%) of operated patients had locally advanced (T3) tumours and 70.6% had positive regional lymph nodes. We further lacked information on adjuvant radiation- and chemotherapy which may modestly improve overall survival. However, in 2010–2017 only 3.4% of Swedish patients received preoperative chemotherapy. Nevertheless, the median survival among Swedish patients with pancreatic cancer operated between 2010 and 2016 was 26.7 months (Table 2) compared with 20 to 22 months in randomised trials of adjuvant treatment.

To date, these relevant therapeutic improvements have, however, not been reflected in surgical guidelines. Therefore, we reevaluated the surgical outcome of PTP versus standard pancreatic head resection in patients with periampullary cancers and evaluated postoperative morbidity and oncological outcome in patients undergoing PTP and PPPD/Whipple with a special focus on adjuvant treatment. Last, we analyzed the outcomes of all patients who underwent RCP secondary to pancreatic head resection for periampullary cancer within the study period.

This study primarily compared oncological overall und progression-free survival for patients who underwent PPPD/Whipple and PTP. Based on these results, a second goal was to provide a basis for evidence-based discussion of total pancreatectomy as a surgical treatment approach in patients with periampullary malignancies to define individualized surgical treatment approaches that consider patients' varying risks of complications following partial pancreatic resection.

### Periampullary cancers: are there differences? [^112U9FGZ]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Our review supports the clinical impression that periampullary cancers vary in outcome after resection. Overall survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy is greatest for patients with ampullary and duodenal cancers, intermediate for patients with bile duct cancer, and least for patients with pancreatic cancer. Moreover, survival for each tumor stage is greater for nonpancreatic periampullary cancers than for pancreatic cancers. Invasion of the pancreas by nonpancreatic periampullary cancers is a major factor adversely affecting survival. Recent data suggest that inherent differences in tumor biology rather than embryologic, anatomic, or histologic factors probably account for these differences in survival. Finally, although pancreaticoduodenectomy remains the procedure of choice for resectable periampullary cancers, further increases in survival will likely evolve through more effective neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapies rather than modifications in the surgical approach.

### Dramatic improvements in outcome following pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic and periampullary cancers [^116dBMZS]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

We conclude that pancreatoduodenectomy deserve to be part of standard management for cancer of the pancreas and periampullary region. Further, that optimal preoperative staging may entail that an even larger proportion of operated patients achieve long-term cure. Finally, although data-rich registries are now established in the US and Europe, randomised trials are needed to clarify if the different surgical techniques influence the risk of postoperative complications, quality of life, or long-term survival.

### More is more? Total pancreatectomy for periampullary cancer as an alternative in patients with high-risk pancreatic anastomosis: a propensity score-matched analysis [^115R3BUC]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Recent studies have reported that PTP can be performed with acceptable morbidity (approximately 22.5–48.0%) and mortality (approximately 3.3–6.0%), which is comparable to our findings. While the overall complication rate of PTP was high in our study (83%), most of these complications were minor (CDC I or II, 51%). Similar to our findings, Reddy et al. have reported minor complications in 59% of the cases in their large, single-center experience. Compared with patients undergoing standard pancreatic head resection, our study identified both hospital and ICU stay were significantly longer in patients undergoing PTP, an explanation for which could be the need for treatment and management of the exocrine and endocrine insufficiency after surgery. In contrast to the findings of Passeri et al.similar proportions of patients undergoing PTP and PPPD/Whipple who had an indication for adjuvant therapy received adjuvant treatment. In line with the results for pancreatic adenocarcinoma reported by Reddy et al.our study demonstrated equivalent overall survival and progression-free survival following PTP and PPPD/Whipple.

### More is more? Total pancreatectomy for periampullary cancer as an alternative in patients with high-risk pancreatic anastomosis: a propensity score-matched analysis [^1171Uu7S]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates that PTP may provide similar oncological outcomes to standard pancreatic head resection with regard to overall and progression-free survival. In particular, the completion of indicated adjuvant therapy did not significantly differ between patients undergoing PTP and PPPD/Whipple. Because RCP as a last-resort treatment option in patients with severe POPF, in turn, is associated with adverse short-term and long-term outcomes, PTP should be considered a viable treatment option in patients with periampullary cancers who, according to available risk stratification systems, are likely to suffer from POPF. With regard to recent advances in the management of both endocrine and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, our findings encourage future studies of the quality of life after partial and total pancreatic resection as well as studies of the preoperative identification of patients at high risk of developing postpancreatectomy complications.

### Dramatic improvements in outcome following pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic and periampullary cancers [^116aRbtN]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

We lacked detailed information about surgical techniques. Pylorus-preserving operation, described already in the 1940s, could not be distinguished from classical Whipple's procedure, nor the various strategies to create continuity to the small intestine from the gastric remnant, bile duct and pancreatic duct. Unfortunately, surgical details are lacking also in emerging registries of pancreatic surgery in the US and Europe. Finally, pancreatoduodenectomy has been gradually centralised to a limited number of centres in Sweden reaching six (in a population of about 10 million) in 2017. Although we were interested in analysing whether causal associations — as has been proposed for pancreatoduodenectomy and other surgical procedures — exist between volume and cancer outcomes the relevant information could not be retrieved from register data.

We consider the interpretation of our findings rather straightforward. Hence, increasing specialisation and centralisation to a few high-volume centres has drastically reduced risk of postoperative death. That the surgical procedure has become more curative in recent years than in the past seems unlikely. More plausibly, preoperative imaging techniques and endoscopic examination with high sensitivity have allowed patients with potentially curable cancer to be more reliably identified preoperatively. In particular imaging allows identification of distant metastases and tumours that are unresectable due to involvement of the superior mesenteric artery or coeliac axis. Because we found no evidence that temporal improvement in survival has leveled (Supplementary Fig. S2) we might expect even better prospects for cure among contemporary and future patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy. As soon as record linkage data beyond 2016 becomes available, updated analyses are justified.

### Randomized clinical trial of pylorus-preserving duodenopancreatectomy versus classical whipple resection-long term results [^111zzx96]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

It is not known whether pylorus-preserving duodenopancreatectomy is as effective as the classical Whipple procedure in the resection of pancreatic and periampullary tumours. A prospective randomized trial was undertaken to compare the results of the two procedures.

Methods

Clinical data, histological findings, short-term results, survival and quality of life of all patients having surgery for suspected pancreatic or periampullary cancer between June 1996 and September 2001 were analysed.

Results

Two hundred and fourteen patients were randomized to undergo either a standard or a pylorus-preserving Whipple resection. After exclusion of 84 patients on the basis of intraoperative findings, 130 patients (66 standard Whipple operation and 64 pylorus-preserving resection) were entered into the trial. Of these, 110 patients with proven adenocarcinoma (57 standard Whipple and 53 pylorus-preserving resection) were analysed for long-term survival and quality of life. There was no difference in perioperative morbidity. Long-term survival, quality of life and weight gain were identical after a median follow-up of 63.1 (range 4–93) months. At 6 months, capacity to work was better after the pylorus-preserving procedure (77 versus 56 per cent; P = 0.019).

Conclusion

Both procedures were equally effective for the treatment of pancreatic and periampullary cancer. Pylorus-preserving Whipple resection offers some minor advantages in the early postoperative period, but not in the long term.

### Dramatic improvements in outcome following pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic and periampullary cancers [^113rzNkz]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Survival deteriorated with increasing age. Median survival decreased from 24.1 months among patients younger than 50 years to 19.9 months among those who were 70 years or older (Table 2). Corresponding 1-year survival decreased from 72.0 to 67.0% and 5-year survival from 33.9 to 25.5%.

Because results in patients operated most recently may be decisive for contemporary management, we calculated the median and 5-year survival among patients operated between 2010 and 2016. The 5-year survival ranged from 29.0% in patients with pancreatic cancer to 71.2% in those with duodenal cancer (Table 2). We also plotted annual hazards to illustrate how excess deaths from the underlying malignancy evolved during follow-up (Supplementary Fig. S3), which demonstrated that, in all categories, the hazard peaked about one year after operation and approached zero within five years as an indicator of cure.

Comparison of adverse events and disease-specific survival

In the multivariable analysis (Table 3), we found a 95% reduction in postoperative mortality from the 1960s to the most recent period. The risk of reoperation and postoperative mortality was more than 40% higher in men than in women. Whilst the risk of reoperation was largely unrelated to age, the risk of postoperative mortality increased markedly with age and was more than sevenfold higher in patients who were 70 years or older compared with those who were less than 50 years. Patients who underwent reoperation experienced a threefold increased risk of postoperative mortality (Table 3).

### Two thousand consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomies [^116Nn6td]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The first successful local resection of a periampullary tumor was performed by Halsted in 1898. Kausch performed the first regional resection in 1909, and the operation was popularized by Whipple in 1935. The operation was infrequently performed until the 1980s and 1990s.

Study Design

Two thousand consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomies performed by 1 surgeon (JLC) from the 1960s to the 2000s were retrospectively reviewed from a prospectively maintained database. The first 1,000 were performed over a period of 34 years, the second 1,000 over a period of 9 years.

Results

The most common indication throughout was adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas (PDAC, 46%). Benign intraductal papillary mutinous neoplasm (IPMN) increased from 1% (1990s) to 8% (2000s) (p = 0.002). Age range was 13 years to 103 years. Mean age increased from 59 years (1980s) to 66 (2000s) (p = 0.001), as did those older than 80 (3% to 12%, p = 0.002). Thirty-day mortality was 1.4%; hospital mortality was 1.7%. Delayed gastric emptying (23%), pancreatic fistulas (16%), and wound infections (11%), were the most frequent morbidity, and have not decreased. The median number of blood transfusions decreased from 2 (1980s) to 0 (1990s and 2000s) (p = 0.004). Length of stay decreased from 21 days (1980s) to 13 (1990s) days to 10 days (2000s) (p = 0.002). Five-year survival for PDAC increased from 19% (1990s) to 24% (2000s) (p = 0.02), and 5-year survival for node-negative, margin-negative PDAC patients was 39%.

Conclusions

The volume of pancreatic pathology has attracted 22 basic and clinical scientists to Hopkins, which has $28.5 million of direct support and more than $30 million in endowments, to support research in pancreatic cancer. The volume of clinical material has also supported the training of many young surgeons, 15 of whom have become department chairmen, and more than 20 have become division chiefs.

### Surgical therapy for pancreatic and periampullary cancer [^117AMkNL]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Surgery is the key component of treatment for pancreatic and periampullary cancers. Pancreatectomy is complex, and there are numerous perioperative and intraoperative factors that are important for achieving optimal outcomes. This article focuses specifically on key aspects of the surgical management of periampullary and pancreatic cancers.

### Dramatic improvements in outcome following pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic and periampullary cancers [^112KDfWu]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

We focused on a primary diagnosis of four specific types of cancer: pancreatic cancer, duodenal cancer, bile duct cancer, and duodenal papilla cancer. Individuals with a diagnosis of other diseases or secondary cancers, as well as individuals with no underlying diagnosis as an indication for the procedures, were excluded. Because pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours exhibit significantly different clinical characteristics than the predominant pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas, we also excluded these patients from our study. We further excluded individuals with a death record but with a missing date of death, thus precluding survival analysis. We followed the remaining individuals from the date of surgery until death, emigration, or end of follow-up (December 31, 2016), whichever came first. A detailed description of the stepwise definition of our analytic cohort is provided in Supplementary Fig. S1.

Surgical procedures and underlying diagnoses

The sixth edition of the Classification of Operations was used in the Patient Register from 1963 until 1996, employing a four-digit procedure coding system. We accordingly used the codes 5512, 5513, and 5516 to identify classic Whipple's procedure, modified Whipple's procedure, and total pancreatectomy, respectively, before 1997. The Classification of Surgical Measures and Medical Measures with a dual code structure has been used in the Patient Register since 1997. Accordingly, we used the codes JLC30, JLC40, and JLC20 to identify the above three procedures, since 1997 onward. We could, however, not identify pylorus-preserving procedures, which accounted for 23.3% of the procedures during 2010–2017. For further details, please refer to Supplementary Table S1. Details on the ICD codes used to identify the different cancer types are shown in Supplementary Table S2.

Outcomes

We analysed death with pancreatic cancer, duodenal cancer, bile duct cancer, or duodenal papilla cancer as the underlying cause as the primary outcome of interest, according to the Causes of Death Register, during the follow-up. Patients with other causes of death were censored at the date of death. We also studied reoperation, defined as any abdominal surgery performed after pancreaticoduodenectomy during the same hospitalisation, and postoperative mortality, as death within 30 days after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Detailed information on codes used to identify disease-specific deaths is provided in Supplementary Table S2.

### Dramatic improvements in outcome following pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic and periampullary cancers [^115s1sFD]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study population

Commencing in the 1960s, the National Board of Health and Welfare in Sweden established the Swedish National Patient Register and initiated the systematic acquisition of all inpatient care data within the public healthcare infrastructure of the country. Registration began in defined regions of Sweden (and was therefore strictly population-based) and gradually expanded, culminating in complete coverage by 1987. This comprehensive database encompasses complete data on patients (e.g. sex, age) and their medical data (e.g. diagnoses, surgical procedures, and dates of admission, discharge, and procedures). The coding of surgical procedures followed the Classification of Operations-sixth edition before 1997 and has since 1997 followed the Classification of Care Measures. Concurrently, the diagnoses in this register have followed, at various periods, the Swedish redivisions of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes (from the 7th revision to the 10th revision).

The Swedish Cancer Register has since its establishment in 1958 covered the entire Swedish population. This register includes information on the specific diagnoses, coded by ICD, and the date of diagnosis. Furthermore, the Swedish Causes of Death Register has been meticulously amassing data since 1952, recording causes as well as date of death for the entire Swedish population, where the causes of death are also coded by ICD. The Migration Register provides information about dates of immigration and emigration since 1947. The Swedish national registration number, uniquely assigned to each resident, serves as the cornerstone for cross-linking data across diverse registers.

In this study, we obtained information on sex, date of birth, surgical procedures, and discharge diagnoses from the Patient Register, date of emigration from the Migration Register, and cancer diagnosis from both the Patient Register and the Cancer Register. Our study included all individuals older than 18 years in Sweden who underwent a classic Whipple's procedure, a modified Whipple's procedure, or a total pancreatectomy between January 1964 and December 2016. No linked register data were available from 2017 and onwards.

### Survival after resection of ampullary carcinoma: a national population-based study [^111XRHTn]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Ampullary cancer is the second most common periampullary cancer, with a resection and survival rate more favorable than that for pancreatic cancer. However, most reports have been conducted at single institutions with small sample sizes, and results may not reflect the practices and outcomes in the community. Our objective was to complete a population-based analysis of patients undergoing resection for ampullary carcinoma and compare it with outcomes in the published literature.

Methods

Patients diagnosed with ampullary cancer reported in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (1988–2003) were collected. Primary outcome was survival (5-year), and secondary outcome was stage at presentation. Comparisons were made with outcomes reported in the literature (resection rate, perioperative mortality, and 5-year survival).

Results

Of the 3292 ampullary cancer patients, 1301 (40%) underwent resection. Thirty-seven percent presented with stage I tumors. Perioperative mortality (30 day) was 7.6% after resection, and 5-year survival was 36.8%. Few patients died if they survived at least 5 years. The cancer registry data showed less early stage disease, higher perioperative mortality, and lower 5-year survival compared with published reports.

Conclusions

This is the largest population-based analysis of ampullary carcinoma. Resection rates and survival at the national level are lower, in general, compared with cancer center reports, which may have implications for regionalizing these procedures. Many patients surviving at least 5 years seem to be cured by surgical resection.

### Factors associated with aborted whipple procedures for periampullary carcinoma: a multicenter case-control study by the SAR pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma disease focus panel [^115oux18]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND. A number of patients with periampullary carcinoma deemed resectable on preoperative CT have their curative-intent surgery aborted on the basis of intraoperative findings. OBJECTIVE. This study sought to identify imaging and clinical factors associated with aborted curative-intent Whipple procedures for periampullary adenocarcinoma. METHODS. Ten U.S. Canadian, and French institutions contributed data to this retrospective case-control study of 360 adults (220 men, 140 women; mean age, 68.6 ± 8.4 [SD] years) with periampullary adenocarcinoma who underwent curative-intent Whipple procedures between January 2016 and December 2022. A total of 180 patients for whom the procedure was aborted (case group) were matched by sex and 5-year age blocks with 180 patients for whom the procedure was completed (control group). Covariates included cancer type, tumor size and resectability on CT, CT reconstruction slice thickness including by phase, number of phases, multiplanar imaging, reconstruction at the workstation, possible metastases reported, structured versus unstructured report, reporting radiologist's experience, hepatic steatosis, preoperative liver MRI, endoscopic ultrasound, ERCP, multidisciplinary review, neoadjuvant therapy and response, and serum CA 19–9 and CEA levels. Logistic regression was performed with ORs and 95% CIs. RESULTS. Whipple procedures were most frequently aborted because of metastases (67.2% [121/180]), followed by locally unresectable disease (27.8% [50/180]). Serum CA 19–9 levels of 37 U/mL or more were associated with aborted Whipple procedures with an OR of 3.75 (95% CI, 1.22–12.77) that increased to 5.47 (95% CI, 1.80–18.62) when a cutoff of 200 U/mL was applied. CT slice thickness ranged from 0.5 mm to 5 mm. CT examinations that used only slice thicknesses of 2.5 mm or more were independently associated with aborted Whipple procedures (OR = 4.28 [95% CI, 1.37–15.00]), including when assessing only pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. No other variables showed statistically significant association. CONCLUSION. Elevated serum CA 19–9 levels and preoperative CT using only slice thicknesses of 2.5 mm or more were associated with aborted curative-intent Whipple procedures. Many other imaging and clinical factors did not show an association. CLINICAL IMPACT. If curative-intent surgery is planned in patients with periampullary carcinoma, preoperative CT should be performed using reconstructions smaller than 2.5 mm to reduce the likelihood of incorrect staging.

### A systematic review and meta-analysis of pylorus-preserving versus classical pancreaticoduodenectomy for surgical treatment of periampullary and pancreatic carcinoma [^112oUKyg]. Annals of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Comparison of effectiveness between the pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy ("pylorus-preserving Whipple" [PPW]) and the classic Whipple (CW) procedure.

Methods

A systematic literature search (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Biosis, Science Citation Index, Ovid Journals) was performed to identify all eligible articles. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PPW versus CW for periampullary and pancreatic carcinoma were eligible for inclusion. The methodologic quality of included studies was evaluated independently by 2 authors. Quantitative data on perioperative parameters (blood loss, transfusion, operation time, and length of hospital stay), mortality, morbidity, and survival were extracted from included studies for meta-analysis. Pooled estimates of overall treatment effect were calculated using a random effects model.

Results

In total, 1235 abstracts were retrieved and checked for eligibility and 6 RCTs finally included. The critical appraisal revealed vast heterogeneity with respect to methodologic quality and outcome parameters. The comparison of overall in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.17 to 1.40; P = 0.18), morbidity (odds ratio 0.89; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.62; P = 0.69), and survival (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.52 to 1.07; P = 0.11) showed no significant difference. However, operating time (weighted mean difference, -68.26 minutes; 95% CI, -105.70 to -30.83; P = 0.0004), and intraoperative blood loss (weighted mean difference, -766 mL; 95% CI, -965.26 to -566.74; P = 0.00001) were significantly reduced in the PPW group.

Conclusion

Hence, in the absence of relevant differences in mortality, morbidity, and survival, the PPW seems to be as effective as the CW. Given obvious clinical and methodological interstudy heterogeneity, efforts should be intensified in the future to perform high quality RCTs of complex surgical interventions on the basis of well defined outcome parameters.

### Curative resection is the single most important factor determining outcome in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma [^111oYYNJ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Mortality rates associated with pancreatic resection for cancer have steadily decreased with time, but improvements in long-term survival are less clear. This prospective study evaluated risk factors for survival after resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

Methods

Data from 366 consecutive patients recorded prospectively between November 1993 and September 2001 were analysed using univariate and multivariate models.

Results

Fifty-eight patients (15.8 per cent) underwent surgical exploration only, 97 patients (26.5 per cent) underwent palliative bypass surgery and 211 patients (57.7 per cent) resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Stage I disease was present in 9.0 per cent, stage II in 18.0 per cent, stage III in 68.7 per cent and stage IV in 4.3 per cent of patients who underwent resection. Resection was curative (R0) in 75.8 per cent of patients. Procedures included pylorus-preserving Whipple resection (41.2 per cent), classical Whipple resection (37.0 per cent), left pancreatic resection (13.7 per cent) and total pancreatectomy (8.1 per cent). The in-hospital mortality and cumulative morbidity rates were 2.8 and 44.1 per cent respectively. The overall actuarial 5-year survival rate was 19.8 per cent after resection. Survival was better after curative resection (R0) (24.2 per cent) and in lymph-node negative patients (31.6 per cent). A Cox proportional hazards survival analysis indicated that curative resection was the most powerful independent predictor of long-term survival.

Conclusion

Resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma can be performed safely. The overall survival rate is determined by the radicality of resection. Patients deemed fit for surgery who have no radiological signs of distant metastasis should undergo surgical exploration. Resection should follow if there is a reasonable likelihood that an R0 resection can be obtained.

### More is more? Total pancreatectomy for periampullary cancer as an alternative in patients with high-risk pancreatic anastomosis: a propensity score-matched analysis [^112iiLwT]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Postpancreatectomy morbidity remains significant even in high-volume centers and frequently results in delay or suspension of indicated adjuvant oncological treatment. This study investigated the short-term and long-term outcome after primary total pancreatectomy (PTP) and pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) or Whipple procedure, with a special focus on administration of adjuvant therapy and oncological survival.

Methods

Patients who underwent PTP or PPPD/Whipple for periampullary cancer between January 2008 and December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity score-matched analysis was performed to compare perioperative and oncological outcomes. Correspondingly, cases of rescue completion pancreatectomy (RCP) were analyzed.

Results

In total, 41 PTP and 343 PPPD/Whipple procedures were performed for periampullary cancer. After propensity score matching, morbidity (Clavien-Dindo classification (CDC) ≥ IIIa, 31.7% vs. 24.4%; p = 0.62) and mortality rates (7.3% vs. 2.4%, p = 0.36) were similar in PTP and PPPD/Whipple. Frequency of adjuvant treatment administration (76.5% vs. 78.4%; p = 0.87), overall survival (513 vs. 652 days; p = 0.47), and progression-free survival (456 vs. 454 days; p = 0.95) did not significantly differ. In turn, after RCP, morbidity (CDC ≥ IIIa, 85%) and mortality (40%) were high, and overall survival was poor (median 104 days). Indicated adjuvant therapy was not administered in 77%.

Conclusions

In periampullary cancers, PTP may provide surgical and oncological treatment outcomes comparable with pancreatic head resections and might save patients from RCP. Especially in selected cases with high-risk pancreatic anastomosis or preoperatively impaired glucose tolerance, PTP may provide a safe treatment alternative to pancreatic head resection.

### Minimally invasive pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary disease: a comprehensive review of literature and meta-analysis of outcomes compared with open surgery [^113BzWas]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

As for postoperative recovery, the pooled data demonstrates mixed outcomes with less time spent in ICU and less usage of analgesic in MIPD group than OPD group, while only moderate earlier time to oral intake in the MIPD group without significant difference, indicating MIPD likely enhanced the recovery of intestinal function. Reduced use of analgesic drugs, shortened time of abdominal cavity exposure, and earlier postoperative activities are considered to be the main reasons for earlier gastrointestinal recovery from MIPD.

As the removal of a sufficient amount of lymph nodes can enhance the accuracy of staging and regional disease control, appropriate lymphadenectomy is one of the most crucial steps in radical pancreatic surgery. The mean or median number of retrieved lymph nodes ranged from 6 to 32 observed in systematic review studies and the quantitative meta-analysis showed no significant difference between MIPD and OPD groups. It is well-documented that only about 20% eligibility rate for surgery among patients with pancreatic cancer when diagnosed. It has also been suggested that even patients who are eligible for surgery preoperatively cannot be offered potentially curative resection mainly due to vascular invasion. Because few reports have compared long-term survival outcomes with other methods, a meta-analysis of long-term oncologic results comparing MIPD versus OPD could not be done due to limited data. Because of most surgeons performed their initial minimally invasive Whipple procedures in patients with resectable small ampullary, distal bile duct or duodenal adenocarcinoma, and the prognosis of periampullary tumors with different pathological types is very different. Therefore, the oncological efficiency of MIPD should ideally be assessed in a randomized controlled trial.

Our researches have some limitations as below: (1) No RCTs were included: All the evidence was derived from observational studies with either concurrent or historical controls, and the use of some historical control groups that may be inadequately matched to the intervention group and because of poor or selective outcome reporting. (2) Selection bias: Most hospitals are still in the learning curve now and during that phase only the most ideal patients are selected. (3) Clinical heterogeneity: The variety of postoperative management, discharge criteria and application of fast track protocol et al. will lead to clinical heterogeneity and a sequence of biases. (4) Lacking long-term outcomes: large studies on the long-term outcomes, such as oncological efficiency, especially for long-term survival and quality of life (QOL) are scarce.

### Pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy versus standard whipple procedure: a prospective, randomized, multicenter analysis of 170 patients with pancreatic and periampullary tumors [^1117RiVK]. Annals of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

A prospective randomized multicenter study was performed to assess whether the results of pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) equal those of the standard Whipple (SW) operation, especially with respect to duration of surgery, blood loss, hospital stay, delayed gastric emptying (DGE), and survival.

Summary Background Data

PPPD has been associated with a higher incidence of delayed gastric emptying, resulting in a prolonged period of postoperative nasogastric suctioning. Another criticism of the pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy for patients with a malignancy is the radicalness of the resection. On the other hand, PPPD might be associated with a shorter operation time and less blood loss.

Methods

A prospective randomized multicenter study was performed in a nonselected series of 170 consecutive patients. All patients with suspicion of pancreatic or periampullary tumor were included and randomized for a SW or a PPPD resection. Data concerning patients' demographics, intraoperative and histologic findings, as well as postoperative mortality, morbidity, and follow-up up to 115 months after discharge, were analyzed.

Results

There were no significant differences noted in age, sex distribution, tumor localization, and staging. There were no differences in median blood loss and duration of operation between the 2 techniques. DGE was observed equally in the 2 groups. There was only a marginal difference in postoperative weight loss in favor of the standard Whipple procedure. Overall operative mortality was 5.3%. Tumor positive resection margins were found for 12 patients of the SW group and 19 patients of the PPPD group (P < 0.23). Long-term follow-up showed no significant statistical differences in survival between the 2 groups (P < 0.90).

Conclusions

The SW and PPPD operations were associated with comparable operation time, blood loss, hospital stay, mortality, morbidity, and incidence of DGE. The overall long-term and disease-free survival was comparable in both groups. Both surgical procedures are equally effective for the treatment of pancreatic and periampullary carcinoma.

### Computed tomography after radical pancreaticoduodenectomy (whipple's procedure) [^117TFLwU]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Whipple's procedure (radical pancreaticoduodenectomy) is currently the only curative option for patients with periampullary malignancy. The surgery is highly complex and involves multiple anastomoses. Complications are common and can lead to significant postoperative morbidity. Early detection and treatment of complications is vital, and high-quality multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is currently the best method of investigation. This review outlines the surgical technique and illustrates the range of normal postoperative appearances together with the common complications.

### Pancreatic cancer: diagnosis and management [^111eP7st]. American Family Physician (2006). Low credibility.

Although only 32,000 new cases of adenocarcinoma of the pancreas occur in the United States each year, it is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in this country. The overall five-year survival rate is 4 percent, and localized, resectable disease has only a 17 percent survival rate. Risk factors include smoking, certain familial cancer syndromes, and familial chronic pancreatitis. The link between risk of pancreatic cancer and other factors (e.g., diabetes, obesity) is less clear. Most patients present with obstructive jaundice caused by compression of the bile duct in the head of the pancreas. Epigastric or back pain, vague abdominal symptoms, and weight loss also are characteristic of pancreatic cancer. More than one half of cases have distant metastasis at diagnosis. Computed tomography is the most useful diagnostic and staging tool. Ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography may provide additional information. The majority of tumors are not surgically resectable because of metastasis and invasion of the major vessels posterior to the pancreas. Resectable tumors are treated with the Whipple procedure or the pylorus-preserving Whipple procedure. Adjuvant fluorouracil-based chemotherapy may prolong survival. For nonresectable tumors, chemotherapy with gemcitabine prolongs survival. Other agents are being studied. Radiation combined with chemotherapy has slowed progression in locally advanced cancers. Throughout the illness and during end-of-life care, patients need comprehensive symptom control.

### Dramatic improvements in outcome following pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatic and periampullary cancers [^115JMxWz]. British Journal of Cancer (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient characteristics

Our study cohort consisted of 5787 individuals who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy for one of the four cancer types from 1964 to 2016 in Sweden. Of these, 3876 had pancreatic cancer, 444 had duodenal cancer, 504 had cancer in the common bile duct, and 963 had cancer of the duodenal papilla. The mean age was 65.1 years, and 47% of patients were women. The total number of procedures increased from 29 in the 1960s to 1801 during 2010–2016. Classic Whipple's procedure accounted for 3332 of the procedures, while 1652 patients were operated using the modified Whipple's procedure and 803 with total pancreatectomy (Table 1).

a Defined according to ICD-7 to ICD-10 codes for different time periods (supplemental content contains the specific ICD codes).

b Defined according to codes of classification of healthcare measures (KVÅ) for different time periods (supplemental content contains the specific KVÅ codes).

Adverse events

Data on reoperation has only been available since 1990. The proportion of patients undergoing any reoperation was in the range of 5 to 10% during all time periods after 1990. We found no obvious difference between calendar periods for the four cancer types or surgical procedures. In contrast, postoperative mortality decreased monotonically and drastically from 17.2% in the 1960s to 1.6% during the most recent time period with no appreciable difference between the four cancer types and the three surgical procedures but an increasing trend with higher age at pancreatoduodenectomy (Table 1).

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^115PHHeU]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — extended lymphadenectomy with pancreatoduodenectomy shows no survival benefit and is not routine. Randomized trials reported that "overall median survival did not differ between the two groups at 1, 3, and 5 years", and systematic reviews/meta-analyses "support the conclusion that the extended procedure does not have any impact on survival". A review "inferred that patients undergoing extended lymphadenectomy may have increased rates of postoperative diarrhea compared to patients undergoing the standard resection". Accordingly, "No survival advantage has been found when performing a regional lymphadenectomy in addition to the standard pancreatoduodenectomy", and "outside of a clinical trial, a regional lymphadenectomy should not be considered as a routine part of the Whipple procedure", though "consideration can be given to sampling of the aortocaval and common hepatic artery nodes", with an exception that "might be in the situation of an otherwise R0 resection with clinically positive adenopathy outside the standard field of dissection".

### Meta-analysis of adjuvant therapy following curative surgery for periampullary adenocarcinoma [^115JZr1P]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Periampullary cancers are uncommon malignancies, often amenable to surgery. Several studies have suggested a role for adjuvant chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy in improving survival of patients with periampullary cancers, with variable results. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the survival benefit of adjuvant therapy for periampullary cancers.

Methods

A systematic review was undertaken of literature published between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2015 to elicit and analyse the pooled overall survival associated with the use of either adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy versus observation in the treatment of surgically resected periampullary cancer. Included articles were also screened for information regarding stage, prognostic factors and toxicity-related events.

Results

A total of 704 titles were screened, of which 93 full-text articles were retrieved. Fourteen full-text articles were included in the study, six of which were RCTs. A total of 1671 patients (904 in the control group and 767 who received adjuvant therapy) were included. The median 5-year overall survival rate was 37.5 per cent in the control group, compared with 40.0 per cent in the adjuvant group (hazard ratio 1.08, 95 per cent c.i. 0.91 to 1.28; P = 0.067). In 32.2 per cent of patients who had adjuvant therapy, one or more WHO grade 3 or 4 toxicity-related events were noted. Advanced T category was associated worse survival (regression coefficient -0.14, P = 0.040), whereas nodal status and grade of differentiation were not.

Conclusion

This systematic review found no associated survival benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of periampullary cancer.

### The pylorus: take it or leave it? Systematic review and meta-analysis of pylorus-preserving versus standard whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic or periampullary cancer [^114CQuqs]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Our objective was to determine the relative effects of pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) and standard Whipple pancreaticoduodenectomy (SWPD) in patients with pancreatic or periampullary cancer.

Methods

We searched seven bibliographic databases, conference proceedings, and reference lists of articles and textbooks, and we contacted experts in the field of hepatobiliary surgery. We included published and unpublished randomized controlled trials. We evaluated the methodological quality of trials and, in duplicate, extracted data regarding operative, perioperative, and long-term outcomes. We contacted all authors and asked them to provide additional information regarding the trials. We pooled results from the studies by using a random-effects model, evaluated the degree of heterogeneity, and explored potential explanations for heterogeneity.

Results

Six trials that included a total of 574 patients met eligibility criteria. In the pooled analysis, PPPD was 72 minutes faster (P < .001, 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 53–92), with 284 mL less blood loss (P < .001, 95% CI, 176–391) and .66 fewer units of blood transfused (P = 0.002, 95% CI, .25–1.16). Other perioperative and long-term outcomes did not statistically differ, although the confidence intervals include important differences.

Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence suggests PPPD is a faster procedure with less blood loss compared with SWPD. Large absolute differences in other key outcomes are unlikely; excluding relatively small differences will, however, require larger, methodologically stronger trials.

### Treatment of pancreatic cancer: challenge of the facts [^111FdTyf]. World Journal of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is associated with the worst survival of any form of gastrointestinal malignancy. In spite of the progress in surgical treatment, resulting in increasing resection rates and a decrease in treatment-related morbidity and mortality, the true figures of cure are even today below 3%. The dissemination of pancreatic cancer behind the local tissue compartments restricts the short-term (< 3 years) and long-term outcome for patients who have undergone resection. By histological evaluation, less than 15% of the patients undergoing R(0) resection have a pN(0) status, more than 60% suffer from lymph angiosis carcinomatosa, and more than 50% suffer extrapancreatic nerve plexus infiltration. Hematoxylin and eosin-negative lymph nodes were found to be cancer positive when reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR) or immunostaining was applied to the HE-negative lymph nodes. Cancer of the uncinate process has a very poor prognosis because there are no early symptoms; vessel wall involvement occurs early and frequently; a high association of liver metastasis exists as well. Surgery offers a low success rate, but it provides the only chance of cure. Ductal pancreatic cancer is diagnosed in more than 95% of the cases in an advanced stage; potentially curative resection can be performed only in about 10%-15% of these patients. Major contributions of surgery to improved treatment results are the reduction of surgical morbidity — e.g., early postoperative local and systemic complications — and a decrease of hospital mortality below 3%-5%. In most recently published prospective trials, R(0) resection has been reported to result in an increase in short-term survival beyond that recorded for patients with residual tumor. However, R(0) resection fails to improve long-term survival. In many published R(0) series, standard tissue resection of pancreatic head cancer with the Kausch-Whipple procedure failed to include remote cancer cell-positive tissues in the operative specimen; e.g. N(2)-lymph nodes, nerve plexus, and perivascular extrapancreatic and retropancreatic tissues were not excised. Cancer recurrence after so-called R(0) resection with curative intent is frequently the consequence of cancer left behind. Thus, long-term survival (> 5 years) is observed in a very small group of patients, contradicting the published 5-year actuarial survival rates of 20%-45% for resected patients. The assessment of clinical benefit from surgical or medical cancer treatment should therefore be based on several end points, not only on actuarial survival. Publication of actuarial survival figures must include the number of observed (actual) survivals, the definition of the subset of patients followed after resection, and the total number of patients in the study group; anything less is misleading. In reporting pancreatic cancer treatment trial results after oncological resections, more convincing primary end points to evaluate treatment efficacy are median survival (in months), actual survival at 1–5 years, and progression-free survival (in months). In series with multimodality treatment, clinical benefit response as well as quality of life measurements using the EORTC Quality of Life index C30 (QLQ-C30) are of importance in evaluating survival data. Adjuvant treatment improves survival after oncological resection; however, the short-term and long-term benefit after adjuvant chemotherapy in R(0) as well as in R(1)-(2) resected patients has not yet been underscored by data from controlled clinical trials. The survival benefit (median survival time) of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy has been demonstrated to be 6–10 months. Therefore, after oncological resection of pancreatic cancer each patient should be offered adjuvant treatment. A neoadjuvant treatment protocol for pancreatic cancer, however, has not been established.

Duodenum — pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple): Should be considered for all duodenal malignancies, particularly if arising in the second portion of the duodenum or invading any portion of the ampulla or pancreas. Pylorus preservation is acceptable in the absence of a hereditary condition, and minimally invasive procedures should be used only by experienced surgeons. Margins should be considered for frozen section at the time of resection if there are concerns about the margins, and if margins < 5 mm, the surgeon should consider re-excision of involved margin.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPPD) has not shown significant differences in mortality, morbidity, or survival compared with classic Whipple, though some perioperative measures favor PPPD; despite the need for more high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs), PPPD is presented as an acceptable alternative to antrectomy. A systematic review including eight RCTs with 512 patients reported no significant differences in mortality, morbidity, and survival but better operating time, intraoperative blood loss, and red blood cell transfusion for PPPD.

### Type IV collagen is a tumour stroma-derived biomarker for pancreas cancer [^113JeFFp]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Pancreas cancer is still one of the most feared malignancies with a poor prognosis. The overall median survival is 3–5 months, and the 5-year survival rate is only 3%. This is due to unspecific and diffuse symptoms, leading to late diagnosis of the disease. Currently, the only known curative treatment is surgical removal of a tumour at a local stage, and the procedure most often used to treat cancerous tumours in the head of the pancreas is pancreatico–duodenectomy (Whipple's procedure). In Whipple's procedure the distal half of the stomach (optional), the gall bladder, the distal portion of the common bile duct, the head of the pancreas, duodenum, proximal jejunum and regional lymph nodes are all removed. Although the results in surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer have improved over the last decades, long-term survival occurs in only 10–20% of patients. In fact, many patients diagnosed with a local operable tumour turn out to suffer from spread disease. Taken together, this indicates that there is a great need for new biomarkers to assist in obtaining an early and accurate diagnosis, classify patients correctly as having local (operable) or spread (non-operable) disease. A good biomarker would also aid in evaluating treatment effects, predicting prognosis and monitoring patients after treatment for early detection of disease relapse.

### Intraoperative transfusion: is it a real prognostic factor of periampullary cancer following pancreatoduodenectomy? [^112DAvbg]. World Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the prognostic significance of transfusion following pancreatoduodenectomy for periampullary cancers. We analyzed 357 periampullary cancers from 1985 to 1997 (ampullary cancer 130 cases, distal bile duct cancer 141 cases, pancreatic head cancer 86 cases). A total of 215 (60%) of the 357 patients have received intraoperative transfusion. The 5-year survival rate of 130 ampullary cancer patients was 59%; altogether, 76 patients (58%) underwent intraoperative transfusion. The 5-year survival rate of patients without intraoperative transfusion was 79%, whereas that of patients with a transfusion was 47% (p = 0.029). Following multivariate analysis, intraoperative transfusion was found to be an independent poor prognostic factor for those with ampullary cancer (relative risk 2.174). Among those with common bile duct cancer, the overall 5-year survival rate was 33%, and the 5-year survival rates for patients with (n = 87) or without (n = 54) transfusion were 25% and 38%, respectively, which did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.0717). For those with pancreatic head cancer, the overall 5-year survival rate was 16%, and there was no survival difference between transfused (n = 52) and untransfused (n = 34) patients. In the present study the reason was not clear, although intraoperative transfusion was an independent significant prognostic factor for ampullary cancer. Careful dissection to minimize intraoperative bleeding is mandatory during pancreatoduodenectomy for ampullary cancer.

Ampullary adenocarcinoma — incidence and survival: Ampullary adenocarcinoma accounts for 0.2% of gastrointestinal malignancies and 6% of all periampullary cancers, with 5-year overall survival (OS) between 35% and 50%. AJCC 7th Edition stage-specific 5-year OS is 64% (stage I), 27% (stage II), and 17% (stage III + IV). In a single-institution review of 2564 periampullary cancers, median survival for ampullary cancer was 47 months versus 19, 23, and 54 months for pancreatic, biliary, and duodenal cancer, respectively, and ampullary tumors generally have a more favorable outcome compared to other periampullary malignancies.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^116zG9Cu]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — principles of surgical technique emphasize that careful intraoperative staging should rule out peritoneal, liver, and distant lymph node metastases, and resection of the primary tumor should only be done in the absence of distant disease; a pancreatic protocol CT is critical for preoperative planning. Consider frozen section analysis of the pancreatic neck and bile duct and assess approximately 5 mm from the transection margin; if tumor is within 5 mm of margins, consider further excision to ensure at least 5 mm of clearance. Procedure selection is based on tumor location, with pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) for head and uncinate lesions and distal pancreatectomy with en-bloc splenectomy for body and tail lesions. Surgery should be done expeditiously and efficiently, optimizing quality of life and cost, and the surgical procedure is based on the location of the primary tumor and relationship to blood vessels.

Periampullary Tumors

The concordance between pre- and postoperative diagnosis of benign periampullary tumor was 61.3%. In the final histopathology, 12 of 31 patients exhibited T1 cancer in association with villous or tubulovillous adenoma. Villous or tubulovillous adenomas are the most common benign lesion, bearing a significant malignant potential. In this series of 31 periampullary tumors, 38.7% displayed advanced cancer in the final histopathologic examination, most of them T1 stage cancer. All patients were preoperatively managed by endoscopic surveillance programs including endoscopic resection procedures. The patients were finally referred for surgical treatment. Histopathological assessment of biopsy material revealed carcinoma in small adenomas of the papilla in more than 20% and in large villous adenomas in up to 60%. Except for 5 patients, who exhibited a benign peripapillary common bile duct lesion, 26 patients had a DPPHRt with segment resection of the peripapillary tumor-bearing segment of the duodenum and resection of the CBD. Of note, final histopathology in five additional patients revealed carcinoid tumor of the papilla (four patients) or the peripapillary duodenum (one patient). These patients are listed in the group of PNETs according to international guidelines (Table 5). The in-hospital mortality was 0% for 31 patients with PAT. DPPHRt with segment resection of the peripapillary duodenum and CBD is recommended for peripapillary and ampullary adenomas, which have histologically severe dysplasia or are associated with T1 carcinoma. Dissection of N1 and N 2 lymph nodes around the pancreatic head was performed in association with DPPHR for tumor staging without extension of the surgical procedure. Local tumor recurrence after DPPHRt+sd was not observed in the long-term follow-up, except for one patient who succumbed to liver metastization following resection of advanced cancer of the papilla. Applying total DPPHR for patients with advanced papillary/ampullary cancer, notably for patients with distal CBD cancer, is an inadequate surgical treatment. Whipple resection is recommended.

Pancreaticoduodenectomy: the Whipple procedure

The evolution of pancreaticoduodenectomy

The surgical treatment of periampullary tumours began at the end of the nineteenth century when two pioneers first operated on this type of cancer. In February 1898, Dr. William Steward Halsted of Baltimore, Maryland, performed the first successful resection of a periampullary tumour with reanastomosis of the pancreatic and bile ducts. The patient was discharged from the hosptial but died from jaundice secondary to cancer recurrence a few months later.

The first successful regional resection of the pancreatic head with pancreaticoduodenostomy was performed by Dr. Walther Kausch in Germany in 1909. Dr. Allen Oldfather Whipple from New York published three cases in 1935 and popularised the modern standard techniques for pancreaticoduodenectomy, which later became known as the Whipple procedure (figure 1). By 1963, Dr. Whipple had performed 37 pancreaticoduodenectomies. It was nonetheless around this time that the Whipple procedure was nearly abandoned because of a high in-hospital mortality of more than 25%. The high in-hospital mortality was thought to be related to several factors including the lack of experience of the low volume surgeons, the lack of well-established systems to address the postoperative complications such as sepsis and haemorrhage, and imprecise patient selection in the absence of advanced radiographic imaging.

Ampullary adenocarcinoma — Whipple technique dissection principles: The goals of surgical extirpation of carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater focus on the achievement of an R0 resection, as a margin-positive specimen is associated with poor long-term survival, and achievement of a margin-negative dissection must focus on meticulous perivascular dissection, recognition of the need for vascular resection and/or reconstruction, and the potential need for extra-pancreatic organ resection. Medial dissection is best achieved by complete mobilization of the PV and SMV from the uncinate process, and skeletalization of the lateral, posterior, and anterior borders of the SMA down to the level of the adventitia will maximize uncinate yield and radial margin.

RESULTS

Baseline Patient Characteristics and Short-term Outcomes After PD

During the study period, 3953 PDs were performed and 120 patients (3%) underwent postoperative CPLP. Specific details regarding the entire cohort of 3953 patients have been published recently. The median age of the 120 CPLP patients was 68 years (IQR, 61–74 years) and most patients were men [n = 83 (69%)]. The median body mass index was 27 kg/m 2 (IQR, 24–30 kg/m 2) and the vast majority of patients were classified American Society of Anesthesiologists II and III (97%) before PD. The most common indication for PD was pancreatic adenocarcinoma [n = 43 (36%)], followed by intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm [n = 15 (12%)], distal cholangiocarcinoma [n = 13 (11%)], periampullary carcinoma [n = 12 (10%)], chronic pancreatitis [n = 11 (9%)], serous and mucinous cystic neoplasms [n = 9 (8%)], and neuroendocrine tumors [n = 7 (6%)]. Regarding the underlying diagnosis for PD, patients with distal cholangiocarcinoma had the highest rate of CPLP (18.6%) followed by serous and mucinous cystic neoplasms (7.7%), other indications (6.4%), neuroendocrine tumors (3.8%), and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (3.5%). Of the 1901 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, 43 had to undergo CPLP (2.3%). Seventy-three patients (61%) underwent pylorus-preserving PD, 32 (27%) pylorus-resecting PD, and 15 (12%) a classic Whipple procedure. Fourteen patients (12%) had venous, 16 (13%) multivisceral, and 2 (2%) arterial resections along with PD. The median operation time of PD was 358 minutes (IQR, 310–434 minutes) and the median blood loss 1000 mL (IQR, 800–1600 mL). Detailed patient characteristics are shown in Table 1.

### Radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy procedure for adenocarcinoma of the body and tail of the pancreas: ability to obtain negative tangential margins [^1141WftC]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Positive resection margins and low lymph node counts are common in resections of cancers of the body and tail of the pancreas. In 2003, we described a novel approach for resection of the pancreas called radical antegrade modular pancreatosplenectomy (RAMPS), which was directed toward these problems. We now present results of treatment of patients with adenocarcinoma using RAMPS with particular reference to the ability of this procedure to obtain negative tangential margin rates.

Study Design

Data from 23 patients treated with RAMPS procedure were collected in a prospective database. Data from the operative notes, pathology reports, and postoperative data were entered into the database.

Results

Mean (± SD) operative time was 6.3 (± 1.8) hours. Fifteen patients had anterior RAMPS procedure and eight posterior RAMPS procedure. There were no postoperative (30 days) or hospital deaths. Eighteen postoperative complications developed in 12 of 23 (52%) patients. Mean tumor size was 5.1 cm. Invasion outside the pancreatic capsule was identified in 78% of patients. Median number of nodes was 15. Ninety-one percent had negative tangential margins, which is the main finding of the study. Median survival was 21 months. The 5-year overall survival is 26%, but followup is still short.

Conclusions

RAMPS procedure can achieve negative tangential margins in a high percent of patients with resectable carcinoma of the body and tail of the pancreas. Median and overall survival rates are quite satisfactory for this tumor and are similar to rates reported for the Whipple procedure.

### Ampullary adenocarcinoma, version 1.2023, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114Kpnka]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2023). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines — ampullary adenocarcinoma surgical approach outcomes show that in a study comparing pancreatoduodenectomy with ampullectomy there was no difference in 5-year overall survival (OS) (65.6% vs. 64.6%), but pancreatoduodenectomy resulted in longer disease-free survival (DFS) (median ~85 vs. 40 months — estimated from Kaplan-Meier curves; p = 0.025), with three deaths with pancreatoduodenectomy versus no deaths with ampullectomy; overall, ampullectomy seems to result in lower morbidity and mortality but is associated with a higher recurrence rate.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114Myf8X]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) — Technical considerations and venous involvement findings note that division of the retroperitoneal tissues between the uncinate process and SMA with a stapler or a clamp and cut technique may leave up to 43% of the soft tissue in situ and increase the risk of an R1 resection. Liberal use of partial or complete vein resection when vein infiltration is suspected has been studied; on evaluation of excised vein specimens, only 60% to 70% had histologic evidence of frank tumor involvement, and R0 resections were still not obtainable in 10% to 30% of patients. If an R0 resection is obtained with vein excision, longevity appears similar to those with R0 resections without venous involvement, with no significant increase in morbidity and mortality, and these data support an aggressive approach to partial or complete vein excision if tumor infiltration is suspected.

### Distal bile duct cancer: radical (R0 > 1 mm) resection achieves favorable survival [^113DzA6G]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the largest European single-center study investigating thesurgical and oncological outcomes ofpatients undergoingsurgery for DBC. Despite the generally poor prognosis of DBC, a median OS of 36.8 months was achieved, with 5- and 10-year survival rates of 40.3% and 30.5%, respectively. In patients with "true" R0 resection and tumor-free margins > 1 mm, median OS was prolonged to 77.5 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 52.2%. In addition, prognostic factors were identified that can be used to identify patients and subgroups with exceptionally good survival.

Previous studies analyzing outcomes after DBC resection show heterogeneous median survival times ranging between 19 and 42 months. – Three European single-center collectives of 47 to 65 patients, and 2 multicenter collectives of around 200 patients, reported 5- year survival rates between 9% and 39%. A Japanese study of 370 patients with resected DBC from 24 centers found a median OS of 42 months and a 5-year survival rate of 41%. A recent Dutch study compared survival after resection for DBC and for cholangiocarcinoma (CC) of other locations and found the worst survival times for DBC resection (29 months vs 37, 42, and 41 months for intrahepatic CC, perihilar CC, and gallbladder cancer, respectively). The largest single-center study to date, from the United States, included 317 DBC patients with a median OS of 23 months and 27% 5-year survival after resection. Compared with the other tumor types in the overall collective of more than 2500 resected periampullary tumors in that series, the median survival for DBC was superior to that for PDAC (19 months), but clearly inferior to those for ampullary and duodenal cancer (47 and 54 months, respectively). These data illustrate that DBC is the second most aggressive cancer among all periampullary tumor entities. The wide variation in survival times reported for resected DBC in the literature may be explained by relatively long study periods (up to 30 years) and the different times at which the studies were conducted, with considerable interstudy and intrastudy heterogeneity arising from changes in surgical and oncological treatment concepts over time.

### Extended lymph node resection versus standard resection for pancreatic and periampullary adenocarcinoma [^113WkBtM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Pancreatic and periampullary adenocarcinomas account for some of the most aggressive malignancies, and the leading causes of cancer-related mortalities. Partial pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with negative resection margins is the only potentially curative therapy. The high prevalence of lymph node metastases has led to the hypothesis that wider excision with the removal of more lymphatic tissue could result in an improvement of survival, and higher rates of negative resection margins.

Objectives

To compare overall survival following standard (SLA) versus extended lymph lymphadenectomy (ELA) for pancreatic head and periampullary adenocarcinoma. We also compared secondary outcomes, such as morbidity, mortality, and tumour involvement of the resection margins between the two procedures.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PubMed, and Embase from 1973 to September 2020; we applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCT) comparing PD with SLA versus PD with ELA, including participants with pancreatic head and periampullary adenocarcinoma.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened references and extracted data from study reports. We calculated pooled risk ratios (RR) for most binary outcomes except for postoperative mortality, for which we estimated a Peto odds ratio (Peto OR), and mean differences (MD) for continuous outcomes. We used a fixed-effect model in the absence of substantial heterogeneity (I² < 25%), and a random-effects model in cases of substantial heterogeneity (I² > 25%). Two review authors independently assessed risk of bias, and we used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for important outcomes.

Main Results

We included seven studies with 843 participants (421 ELA and 422 SLA). All seven studies included Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival. There was little or no difference in survival between groups (log hazard ratio (log HR) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.06 to 3.31; P = 0.94; seven studies, 843 participants; very low-quality evidence). There was little or no difference in postoperative mortality between the groups (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.20, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.80; seven studies, 843 participants; low-quality evidence). Operating time was probably longer for ELA (mean difference (MD) 50.13 minutes, 95% CI 19.19 to 81.06 minutes; five studies, 670 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There was substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 88%; P < 0.00001). There may have been more blood loss during ELA (MD 137.43 mL, 95% CI 11.55 to 263.30 mL; two studies, 463 participants; very low-quality evidence). There was substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 81%, P = 0.02). There may have been more lymph nodes retrieved during ELA (MD 11.09 nodes, 95% CI 7.16 to 15.02; five studies, 670 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There was substantial heterogeneity between the studies (I² = 81%, P < 0.00001). There was little or no difference in the incidence of positive resection margins between groups (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.13; six studies, 783 participants; very low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

There is no evidence of an impact on survival with extended versus standard lymph node resection. However, the operating time may have been longer and blood loss greater in the extended resection group. In conclusion, current evidence neither supports nor refutes the effect of extended lymph lymphadenectomy in people with adenocarcinoma of the head of the pancreas.

### Surgical outcome after pancreatoduodenectomy for duodenal adenocarcinoma compared with other periampullary cancers: a nationwide audit study [^113h79uG]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Pancreatoduodenectomy for duodenal adenocarcinoma is associated with higher rates of major complications and in-hospital mortality compared with patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy for other periampullary cancers. This finding is relevant when counseling patients with duodenal adenocarcinoma undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy and optimizing postoperative treatment strategies.

### Small bowel adenocarcinoma, version 1.2020, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^112Vs7Dm]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2019). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines Version 3.2025 Small Bowel Adenocarcinoma — surgical management of localized resectable disease: For local (stage I–III) small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA), primary treatment consists of surgical resection with en bloc removal of the regional lymph nodes, and intraoperative staging of the abdomen — particularly including the mesentery, omentum, and peritoneum — should be completed in all cases. Resection type depends on tumor location: segmental resection is often the mainstay, duodenal tumors may require pancreaticoduodenectomy or segmental duodenal resection, and for tumors of the jejunum or ileum segmental resection is the preferred method. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) should be considered for all duodenal cancers, particularly those in the second portion or invading the ampulla or pancreas; minimally invasive approaches may be considered but should only be used by experienced surgeons. Limited segmentectomy may be considered for SBA in the third and fourth segments of the duodenum and on the anti-mesenteric side, though this is controversial due to reports of lower lymph node yields. Evidence includes a retrospective study of 1611 patients with duodenal adenocarcinoma in which radical resection did not improve overall survival (OS) or disease-specific survival versus simple removal after controlling for confounders. A meta-analysis of observational studies including 6438 patients with duodenal cancer reported both segmental resection and pancreaticoduodenectomy allowed adequate lymph node assessment and no difference in OS for distal duodenal primaries; limited resection may also produce more favorable rates of overall morbidity and postoperative pancreatic fistula. Case reports suggest segmentectomy and other limited methods may be considered for first-portion duodenal lesions, particularly for those < 2 cm and on the mesenteric side. NCCN recommends that a goal for all SBA resections should be retrieval of at least 8 regional lymph nodes for evaluation based on prognostic impact and studies showing improved outcomes with higher lymph node counts assessed during surgery.

### Pancreaticoduodenectomy with extended retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy for periampullary adenocarcinoma [^114gTFax]. Surgical Oncology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Surgical resection provides the only chance for long-term survival for patients diagnosed with pancreatic and other associated periampullary adenocarcinomas. In the past, it had been suggested that the performance of an extended lymphadenectomy in association with a pancreaticoduodenal resection might have improved long-term survival for some patients. In response, six prospective trials have been performed and reported addressing this issue. These studies, including a large randomized trial of 280 patients from Johns Hopkins University, indicate that there is no demonstrable survival benefit to extended lymphadenectomy for periampullary cancer.

### Ampullary cancer [^117K4Xsz]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Compared with other periampullary tumors, cancers of the ampulla of Vater are rare. These tumors tend to present earlier than their pancreatic and distal bile duct brethren. In addition to the hypothesis that they are also less biologically aggressive, ampullary cancers tend to have better survival than other types of periampullary cancers. The mortality from this disease remains high, and much can still be learned about ampullary cancers.

### Systemic inflammatory response predicts outcome in patients undergoing resection for ductal adenocarcinoma head of pancreas [^113QdHoP]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Patients

Patients who on the basis of radiological and pathological staging underwent resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the head of pancreas (between 1st January 1993 and 31st July 2001) had pre- and postoperative measurements of C-reactive protein, and postoperative measurements of tumour size were included in the study. Measurement of C-reactive protein was carried out on the day prior to and approximately 1 month following surgery. All patients underwent either a classic Whipple's procedure or a pylorus preserving resection for removal of ductal adenocarcinoma of the head of pancreas. Patients with ampullary, periampullary and duodenal carcinoma were excluded from study as well as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. Patients presenting either with cholangitis or other clinical evidence of infection, especially where the bile culture was positive, were also excluded from study.

All patients were treated in the upper GI surgical unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and survived at least 30 days following surgery. No patient underwent chemotherapy. The study was approved by the local ethical committee.

Methods

Tumours were classified by type, along with pathological staging criteria (size, nodal status, perineural and vascular invasion, and tumour differentiation). Tumour stage was according to the International Union Against Cancer Criteria (IUCC). Tumour size was taken as the largest tumour diameter measured by the pathologist.

Routine laboratory measurements of albumin and bilirubin were carried out. C-reactive protein was measured by Fluorescence Polarisation Immunoassay using an Abbott TDX analyser and Abbott reagents (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA). The coefficient of variation for this method, over the range of measurement, was less than 5% as established by routine quality control procedures. The limit of detection of the assay is a C-reactive protein concentration of less than 5 mg l −1 with the upper limit of normal values being ≤ 10 mg l −1. Based on previous work, a C-reactive protein concentration of greater than 10 mg l −1 was considered to indicate the presence of a systemic inflammatory response.

Statistics

Comparisons between groups of patients were carried out using contingency table analysis (X 2) as appropriate. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox's proportional-hazards model. Deaths up to the end of March 2004 were included in the analysis. Multivariate survival analysis was performed using a stepwise backward procedure to derive a final model of the variables that had a significant independent relationship with survival. To remove a variable from the model, the corresponding P -value had to be greater than 0.10. Analysis was performed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).

### Morbidity and mortality rates following cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy compared with other high-risk surgical oncology procedures [^115E6Dxd]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

While these data address the surgical safety of CRS/HIPEC, they do not provide perspective on the impact of the oncologic survival benefit of CRS/HIPEC in treating peritoneal metastasis, which is equally important in defining the value of this procedure and has been a referral barrier. In patients with colorectal peritoneal metastasis treated with chemotherapy alone, median overall survival ranges from 7.8 to 15.2 months, while in patients treated with CRS/HIPEC, median survival ranges from 22 to 47 months, with 5-year survival of 27% to 54%. The most recent randomized phase 3 trial in colorectal peritoneal metastasis, PRODIGE 7, reported a remarkable 40-month median survival for patients treated with CRS with or without HIPEC and identified the group with modest tumor burden (peritoneal carcinoma index score of 5–15) who may benefit from the addition of 30 minutes of HIPEC with oxaliplatin. In mesothelioma and appendix peritoneal metastasis, CRS/HIPEC has significantly improved 5-year survival from less than 10% to 50% to 90%, and CRS/HIPEC is considered the standard of care for these tumor types. Data continue to emerge that support adding HIPEC to CRS surgery in ovarian cancer, with the largest series (1051 patients) receiving CRS/HIPEC reporting a median survival of 73 months. Also, 2 recent phase 3 randomized clinical trials investigating CRS/HIPEC in recurrent and primary stage III ovarian cancer demonstrated that HIPEC yielded a 2-fold overall survival benefit and 11-month overall survival benefit, respectively. Comparatively, from the perspective of relative oncologic survival benefit for surgical procedures of similar risk, Whipple has a 5-year survival rate of 15% to 25%; hepatectomy for colorectal cancer, 35% to 50%; and esophagectomy, 30% to 60%. Based on these current data, CRS/HIPEC also has an oncologic survival benefit similar to these procedures.

### Combined major hepatectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy for locally advanced biliary carcinoma: long-term results [^112Uzgc2]. World Journal of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

This study aimed to define the role of combined major hepatectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy in the surgical management of biliary carcinoma and to identify potential candidates for this aggressive procedure.

Methods

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 28 patients who underwent a combined major hepatectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy for extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n = 17) or gallbladder carcinoma (n = 11). Major hepatectomy was defined as hemihepatectomy or more extensive hepatectomy. Altogether, 11 patients underwent a Whipple procedure, and 17 had a pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. The median follow-up time was 169 months.

Results

Morbidity and in-hospital mortality were 82% and 21%, respectively. Overall cumulative survival rates after resection were 32% at 2 years and 11% at 5 years (median survival time 9 months). The median survival time was 6 months with a 2-year survival rate of 0% in 11 patients with residual tumor, whereas the median survival time was 26 months with a 5-year survival rate of 18% in 17 patients with no residual tumor (P = 0.0012). Residual tumor status was the only independent prognostic factor of significance (relative risk 4.65; P = 0.003). There were three 5-year survivors (two with diffuse cholangiocarcinoma and one with gallbladder carcinoma with no bile duct involvement) among the patients with no residual tumor.

Conclusions

Combined major hepatectomy and pancreaticoduodenectomy provides survival benefit for some patients with locally advanced biliary carcinoma only if potentially curative (R0) resection is feasible. Patients with diffuse cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder carcinoma with no bile duct involvement are potential candidates for this aggressive procedure.

### Tumors of the ampulla of vater: histopathologic classification and predictors of survival [^116ZcNSG]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The histology and clinical behavior of ampullary tumors vary substantially. We speculated that this might reflect the presence of two kinds of ampullary adenocarcinoma: pancreaticobiliary and intestinal.

Study Design

We analyzed patient demographics, presentation, survival (mean followup 44 months), and tumor histology for 157 consecutive ampullary tumors resected from 1989 to 2006. Histologic features were reviewed by a pathologist blinded to clinical outcomes. Survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier/Cox proportional hazards analysis.

Results

There were 33 benign (32 adenomas and 1 paraganglioma) and 124 malignant (118 adenocarcinomas and 6 neuroendocrine) tumors. One hundred fifteen (73%) patients underwent a Whipple procedure, 32 (20%) a local resection, and 10 (7%) a palliative operation. For adenocarcinomas, survival in univariate models was affected by jaundice, histologic grade, lymphovascular, or perineural invasion, T stage, nodal metastasis, and pancreaticobiliary subtype (p < 0.05). Size of tumor did not predict survival, nor did cribriform/papillary features, dirty necrosis, apical mucin, or nuclear atypia. In multivariate models, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, stage, and pancreaticobiliary subtype predicted survival (p < 0.05). Patients with pancreaticobiliary ampullary adenocarcinomas presented with jaundice more often than those with the intestinal kind (p = 0.01) and had worse survival.

Conclusions

In addition to other factors, tumor type (intestinal versus pancreaticobiliary) had a major effect on survival in patients with ampullary adenocarcinoma. The current concept of ampullary adenocarcinoma as a unique entity, distinct from duodenal and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, might be wrong. Intestinal ampullary adenocarcinomas behaved like their duodenal counterparts, but pancreaticobiliary ones were more aggressive and behaved like pancreatic adenocarcinomas.

### Outcomes in pancreatic cancer surgery [^11135pu7]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

The increase in surgery for pancreatic cancer during the last 3 decades can be correlated with a gradual decline in operative mortality and postoperative complications. Although not all surgeons (nor all hospitals) can have equal outcomes, the definition and tabulation of these outcomes have been difficult. This article asks several pertinent questions: (1) what is the scientific rationale for pancreatic resection? (2) what are the best available results at this time? (3) who should be performing pancreatic resections? The article analyzes results of resection for adenocarcinoma of the exocrine pancreas, and excludes duodenal and ampullary cancers, pancreatic endocrine tumors, and tumors of less malignant potential.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — preoperative biliary drainage aims and outcomes. "The main goals of preoperative biliary drainage are to alleviate the symptoms of pruritus and cholangitis and potentially make surgery less morbid by improving liver function preoperatively". Although "controversial, several studies suggest that pancreatoduodenectomy is associated with higher perioperative mortality when performed in the setting of hyperbilirubinemia". While "Stenting of the biliary system can improve symptoms and liver function, it is not clear whether these changes can decrease the mortality rate associated with the Whipple procedure", and "Several prospective and retrospective studies have not shown decreased mortality in patients with preoperative biliary drainage".

### Development of a prognostic model that predicts survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary cancer [^112qKrSA]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Adenocarcinomas of the ampulla of Vater are relatively rare gastrointestinal malignancies accounting for approximately 0.2% of all neoplasms arising from the gastrointestinal tract. They are, however, the second most frequently encountered tumors among all periampullary neoplasms accounting for 7% to 12.7% of all periampullary neoplasms. Ampullary cancer, unlike pancreatic neoplasms that are most frequently diagnosed in advanced stages, usually presents with symptoms of biliary obstruction early in its development, and therefore higher resectability rates (up to 82.1%) have been reported.

The definition of what constitutes an "ampullary neoplasm" has not been consistent in the literature, and questions have been previously raised with regards to considering ampullary carcinomas as a distinct tumor entity. The term "periampullary tumors" has been previously used to refer to any cancerous lesion arising from the ampulla or its immediate vicinity, and it is amenable to curative resection by means of pancreaticoduodenectomy. Previous reports on "periampullary tumors" have identified several histopathological or preoperative factors (tumor histologic grade, histological subtype, surgical resection margin involvement, preoperative serum bilirubin levels, and lymph node [LN] involvement) as predictors of survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy.– Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that the currently used nodal staging system for ampullary tumors (N0/N1) overestimates survival in subjects with more advanced nodal disease.

Previous reports, with the aforementioned limitations in definitions, have estimated survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary cancer to range from 33% to 61%, making adjuvant therapy relevant in the context of this malignancy. However, despite identifying predictors of survival, the selection criteria for adjuvant therapies along with the survival benefit of such treatments for ampullary cancer are not clear unlike the case of pancreatic cancer where such therapies have an established role in the management algorithm. Identifying patients with high-risk features would be desirable because it would guide clinicians on offering adjuvant therapies.

The aims of this study were (i) to assess the overall survival and identify predictors of survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary cancer in a high-volume hepatopancreatobiliary unit and (ii) to develop a pilot prognostic model that can assist clinicians in selecting patients for adjuvant therapies in the future.

### Development of a prognostic model that predicts survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for ampullary cancer [^116tCNuN]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

Patterns of recurrence after pancreaticoduodenectomy alone for ampullary cancer demonstrate that locoregional failure occurs in up to a third of cases. However, unlike the case of pancreatic cancer, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for ampullary cancer is not clear and major work (European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer 4 trial) is currently underway. To date, findings on survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy are not conclusive due to differing definitions of ampullary or "periampullary" tumors (study design issues/retrospective in nature/small sample size) and are therefore subjected to selection bias.– Currently, patients with aggressive disease features such as metastatic LN, positive resection margins, and poorly differentiated tumors are often considered for adjuvant therapies.– The prognostic model we propose, after adjusting for the chemotherapy regimes that were historically used in our cohort, is based on highly sensitive statistical analysis and seems to have higher sensitivity to the currently used nodal staging classification and is also superior to the substaging system proposed by Kang et al. Hence, we envisage that using the prognostic model, if further validated prospectively, could help clinicians to offer adjuvant therapies to those mostly in need until higher quality evidence is available.

The design of this report is retrospective; hence, bias cannot be completely eliminated from conclusion. In particular, the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy on the survival data we report should be interpreted as it is open to selection bias because the treatment was not offered as part of a standardized protocol in the 11-year study period. Nevertheless, the pilot prognostic model we propose is based on data on a carefully selected patient cohort, and although it requires validation in a larger patient population, it could aid clinicians in patient selection for adjuvant therapies in the future.

### Impact of preoperative biliary drainage on outcomes of pancreaticoduodenectomy in severe hyperbilirubinemia [^117QVRWe]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

We included patients over 18 years who underwent Whipple's procedure for periampullary cancer at Tel Aviv Medical Center from January 2007 to September 2024. Out of 1,450 pancreatic surgeries reviewed, 805 underwent the Whipple procedure, 17 were removed due to non-valid data; 788 met the inclusion criteria, due to missing critical data about preoperative bilirubin level or preoperative PBD status, we removed other 123 records leaving 665 valid cases.

Cholestasis was defined as a total bilirubin level > 2.5mg/dL. Tumors were staged according to the eighth edition of the TNM cancer staging manual of the American Joint Committee on Cancer.

Data collection was performed through our prospectively maintained pancreatic surgery database. All pancreaticoduodenectomies were performed by a dedicated team of 4 fellowship-trained HPB surgeons, each with > 5 years post-fellowship experience from high-volume centers (Mount Sinai, UPMC). Cases were distributed equally (22–28% per surgeon) following standardized protocols to minimize inter-operator variability. Our institution maintains high-volume status (> 40 PDs/year), increasing from 40–50 to 55–70 cases annually during the study period. This database is updated daily and includes comprehensive data from multidisciplinary team meetings with oncologists and gastroenterologists, ensuring optimal interpretation of clinical, radiological, and pathological findings. We systematically collected patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification, and comprehensive laboratory values including total and direct bilirubin, liver function tests, albumin, complete blood count, and coagulation profiles. All laboratory values were obtained within one week before surgery. Radiological staging and tumor characteristics were documented based on preoperative computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. When TNM staging and/or resectability were unclear based on CT scan reports and multidisciplinary meeting discussions, an expert radiologist conducted an additional review.

### Predictors of survival in periampullary cancers following pancreaticoduodenectomy [^112Lmd3c]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Cancers of the ampulla of Vater, distal common bile duct, and pancreas are known to have dismal prognosis. It is often reported that ampullary cancers are less aggressive relative to the other periampullary carcinomas. We sought to evaluate predictors of survival for periampullary cancers following pancreaticoduodenectomy to identify biologic behavior.

Methods

We reviewed the records of all patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary carcinoma between 1992 and 2007 at the Ohio State University Medical Center. Demographics, treatment, and outcome/survival data were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were created and compared by log-rank analysis. Multivariate analysis was undertaken using Cox proportional-hazards method.

Results

346 consecutive periampullary malignancies (249 pancreatic cancers, 79 ampullary carcinomas, 18 extrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas) treated by pancreaticoduodenectomy were identified. Pancreatic cancer histology correlated with the shortest median survival (17.1 months), followed by cholangiocarcinoma (17.9 months) and ampullary carcinoma (44.3 months) (P < 0.001). Potential predictors of decreased survival on univariate analysis included site of origin, preoperative jaundice, microscopic positive margin, nodal metastasis, lymphovascular invasion, neural invasion, and poor differentiation. Only nodal metastasis (median 16.2 versus 29.9 months, P < 0.001) and neural invasion (median 17.7 versus 47.9 months, P < 0.00001) significantly predicted outcome on multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

Although ampullary cancers have the best prognosis overall, when controlled for tumor stage, only presence of neural invasion and nodal metastasis predict poor survival following pancreaticoduodenectomy. Biological behavior remains the most important prognostic indicator in periampullary cancers amenable to resection, regardless of site of origin.

DISCUSSION

The findings we report in this study originate from a carefully selected patient cohort, using strict histopathological criteria. Our findings demonstrate that the currently used nodal staging system (N0/N1) seems to overestimate survival in patients with 3 or more metastatic LNs. Furthermore, on the basis of the findings of a stepwise Cox regression model, using 2 independent predictors of survival (ie, LNR and vascular invasion), we have developed a pilot prognostic model. The validity of the model was strengthened by performing a subanalysis on subjects with 12 or more resected LNs. The model we propose is more sensitive than nodal status in predicting survival as our ROC curves demonstrate.

The 5-year survival rate in our study's population (34.9%) is in keeping with survival figures reported by others, adding to the validity of our patient selection criteria. It has been previously advocated that one of the reasons why ampullary carcinomas should be managed separately to other neoplasms arising in the close proximity of the ampulla was the more favorable survival figures reported after resection of ampullary cancer compared with other "peri-ampullary" neoplasms. Current thinking accepts that an adenoma-dysplasia-carcinoma sequence occurs on either the intestinal or biliary epithelium overlying the ampulla. In our patient population, subjects with ampullary tumors of the PB subtype behaved differently in terms of nodal disease burden and overall survival compared with resections of the intestinal subtype. Analysis of specimens of the PB subgroup revealed more advanced nodal disease compared with the intestinal subgroup as demonstrated by the nodal stage (PB: 34 N2 resections [54.8%] vs intestinal subtype: 9 N2 resections [23%], P = 0.002). Furthermore, the overall 5-year survival rate of 15.6% in the PB subgroup was poor and similar to postresectional survival rates for pancreatic adenocarcinoma reported elsewhere. Differences in tumor behavior, in terms of recurrence or overall survival, between the PB and intestinal subgroups have been previously reported by others. We therefore argue that histological subtype is clinically relevant to patient survival and may predict biological aggressiveness.

### Factors influencing local and distant recurrence following resection of periampullary cancer [^112h4YUQ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Recurrence of periampullary cancer after pancreatoduodenectomy is common. The aim of this study was to investigate patterns of recurrence, incidence, and factors associated with local and distant recurrences.

Methods

This retrospective, single-centre study included consecutive patients with periampullary cancer who underwent resection with curative intent from January 2012 to January 2018. Survival, patterns of recurrence, and factors associated with recurrences were analysed.

Results

Median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival among 398 included patients was 58.4 and 49.5 months respectively. Twenty-three patients (5.8 per cent) developed isolated local recurrences (LR), 50 (12.6 per cent) developed LR along with distant metastasis (DM), and 103 (25.9 per cent) developed isolated DM. Median OS was 40.4 months for patients with isolated LR versus 23 months for those with DM (P < 0.001). Tumour subtype (distal common bile duct (CBD): odds ratio (OR) 6.18, 95 per cent c.i. 2.19 to 17.46) and node-positive status (OR 2.36, 1.26 to 4.43) were independently associated with higher rates of LR. The most common site for isolated LR was along the superior mesenteric artery (12 of 23 patients). Tumour subtype (distal CBD: OR 2.86, 1.09 to 7.52), nodal positivity (OR 2.46, 1.53 to 3.94), and presence of perineural invasion (OR 1.80, 1.02 to 3.18) were independently associated with DM.

Conclusion

Isolated LR is associated with better survival than DM and occurs most commonly along the superior mesenteric artery.

### Therapeutic outcomes of endoscopic papillectomy for ampullary neoplasms: retrospective analysis of a multicenter study [^115778Px]. BMC Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

Pancreaticoduodenectomy or local surgical resection has been considered as a treatment of choice for ampullary neoplasms. However, perioperative mortality occurs in 4–15% and morbidity in up to 50% following surgical resection. Even local resection has a reported morbidity rate of 19–25% with recurrence rate up to 32% at 5 years after surgery. Endoscopic papillectomy (EP) was first reported by Binmoeller et al. in 1993 with the promise of lower morbidity and mortality. Since then, endoscopic papillectomy with curative intent has emerged as an effective alternative to Whipple's procedure for management of uncomplicated ampullary neoplasms.

In a study on a combined 4-center experience in 103 patients with ampullary neoplasms undergoing endoscopic papillectomy, success rate up to 80% of patients, with a 20% recurrence rate and a 10% complication rate were reported (Catalano et al.). Another study reported a success rate of EP of 73%, the complication rate was 15%, and recurrence rate was 15% (Bohnacker et al.). In the current study, the overall success rate of EP was 89.4%, the complication rate was 31.7%, and there was no recurrence after 6 months following successful EP. Differences in the success rate and complications of endoscopic papillectomy in studies may be related to differences in the inclusion criteria for EP and various procedural factors in performing EP among studies.

Close and serial follow-up after endoscopic papillectomy are required for identification of remnant tumors or recurrence. Previous studies reported that all recurrences were found within the first 14 months of papillectomy, with distinguishing a recurrent ampullary lesion from remnant tissue with evidence of a positive biopsy result. Catalano et al. proposed guidelines for performing endoscopic surveillance every 6–12 months after successful EP for at least 2 years. In the current study, 7 cases of remnant tumors were found within 6 months of follow up after initial EP and only 1 case required surgery, and there were no recurrences during long term follow-up after 6 months in 93 cases with endoscopic success. Based on our result, if no clinical evidence of recurrence was found within 6 months of follow up, possibility of recurrence was very low and further follow-up can be individualized.

### Predictors for patterns of failure after pancreaticoduodenectomy in ampullary cancer [^113buFod]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Ampullary cancer has the best prognosis in periampullary malignancy but unpredicted early recurrence after resection is frequent. The current study tried to find the predictors for recurrence to be used as determinative for postoperative adjuvant therapy.

Methods

Information was collected from patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with regional lymphadenectomy for ampullary cancer in high-volume hospitals between January 1989 and April 2005. Recurrence patterns and survival rates were calculated and predictors were identified.

Results

A total of 135 eligible patients were included. The 30-day operative mortality was 3%. Median followup for relapse-free patients was 52 months. Disease recurred in 57 (42%) patients, including 31 liver metastases, 26 locoregional recurrences, 9 peritoneal carcinomatoses, 7 bone metastases, and 6 other sites. Pancreatic invasion (P = 0.04) and tumor size (P = 0.05) were the predictors for locoregional recurrence, while lymph node metastasis was the sole predictor for liver metastasis (P = 0.01). The 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 45.7%; 77.7% for stage I, 28.5% for stage II, and 16.5% for stage III; and 63.7% for node-negative versus 19.1% for node-positive patients. Pancreatic invasion and lymph node involvement were both predictors for survival of patients with ampullary cancer.

Conclusion

Pancreaticoduodenectomy with regional lymphadenectomy is adequate for early-stage ampullary cancer but a dismal outcome can be predicted in patients with lymph node metastasis and pancreatic invasion. Lymph node metastasis and pancreatic invasion can be used to guide individualized, risk-oriented adjuvant therapy.

### Palliative pancreaticoduodenectomy in pancreatic and periampullary adenocarcinomas [^111u6LuS]. Pancreas (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of the study was to clarify the role of a palliative pancreaticoduodenectomy in both pancreatic and periampullary adenocarcinomas.

Methods

Survival outcomes were compared between resections and bypass operations, and between curative (R0) and palliative resections, with a microscopically (R1) and a grossly (R2) positive resection margin.

Results

There were 595 surgical patients, including 207 undergoing bypass operations and 388 undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomies, with 47.4% curative resections (R0) and 17.8% palliative resections (R1 + R2). The overall positive margin rate after a pancreaticoduodenectomy was 27.3% (R1 = 8.0%, R2 = 19.3%). For periampullary adenocarcinomas, there was a significant survival difference between the R0, palliative, and no resection groups. However, there was no significant survival difference between the R0 and palliative resection for pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. Note that the survival outcome after either a curative or a palliative pancreaticoduodenectomy was still better than the survival outcome of a bypass operation.

Conclusions

There was a survival benefit after a pancreaticoduodenectomy regardless of the resection margin or primary origin of the periampullary adenocarcinoma, as compared with a bypass operation. The resection margin after a pancreaticoduodenectomy did not play a role in the survival outcome in pancreatic head adenocarcinoma. Therefore, we recommend that pancreaticoduodenectomies should be attempted whenever possible.

### Distal bile duct cancer: radical (R0 > 1 mm) resection achieves favorable survival [^116LDwgP]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Distal bile duct cancer (distal cholangiocarcinoma, DBC) is a relatively rare tumor entity with a considerably lower incidence in Western than in Asian countries (0.3–0.5 vs 1.5–3.3 per 100,000 inhabitants). – With regard to biological behavior, treatment options, and prognosis, DBC is distinct from intrahepatic and hilar bile duct cancers and from other periampullary malignancies. Irrespective of their histological and anatomical origin, the treatment of choice and sole curative treatment option for periampullary carcinomas is pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). DBC accounts for only 3% to 24% of all periampullary tumors, – with upfront resection rates of around 30%, and 5-year survival rates ranging between 9% and 41%.– However, patient collectives are small (up to 50 patients) in previous studies – predominantly single-center studies from Europe. In the recent literature, different prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) after DBC resection have been analyzed, including patient-related parameters (eg, sex and age), pathological results (eg, resection margin status, tumor grading, and lymph node status), and treatment-related factors (eg, preoperative biliary drainage, perioperative blood transfusion, and postoperative morbid-ity). Evidence for the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy after resection for DBC is sparse, and routine use remains controversial. An unaddressed question is the issue of microscopic resection radicality, which has been shown to be of high relevance in pancreatic cancer [pancreatic ductal adeno carcinoma (PDAC)] resection, where a tumor-free margin of > 1 mm has a strong prognostic impact.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the oncological outcome after DBC surgery and identify prognostic factors for survival, with a special focus on microscopic resection radicality.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^113zowaQ]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — histologic sectioning of a Whipple specimen varies by case and institution, with multiple acceptable techniques. The approach to histologic sectioning of a Whipple specimen is determined by the unique characteristics of the tumor, but also influenced by institutional preferences, expertise, and experience, and there is no one correct way to dissect a Whipple specimen. Options include axial, bi- or multi–valve slicing, and perpendicular slicing; some experts bisect the pancreas along probes placed in the bile and pancreatic ducts and then serially section along each half of the pancreas, and axial slicing provides an overall assessment of the epicenter of tumor.

### Pancreatic surgery [^1169u8nE]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Recent advances have been made in both laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques for diagnosing and treating pancreatic neoplasms. These advances are reviewed. In addition to the traditional methods of pancreatic resection (eg, standard Whipple and pylorus-preserving Whipple), several other techniques have been described and are discussed (eg, median pancreatectomy and extended pancreatectomy). The morbidity and mortality rates of pancreatic operations have diminished, but significant complications still occur (eg, delayed gastric emptying, pancreatic fistula, and biliary strictures). These are discussed. In managing acute and chronic pancreatitis, less invasive and more conservative approaches are being advocated.

### Skeletal muscle quality is associated with worse survival after pancreatoduodenectomy for periampullary, nonpancreatic cancer [^116g9YdN]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2017). Low credibility.

This study had some limitations. We had to exclude a relatively high number of patients due to inadequacy of CT scans. However, the baseline characteristics did not differ significantly between the included and excluded patients (Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, we identified some differences in baseline characteristics, mainly, a lower R1 rate for the patients with a low muscle mass and a higher BMI for the patients with low muscle attenuation than for the other patients. However, we corrected for these and other possible confounders in our analyses. Finally, we included three periampullary cancer types in our cohort. Survival and the incidence of complications may differ between the three types of periampullary tumors (duodenum, papilla, and distal bile duct tumors). However, in the sensitivity analysis, including also the cancer type in the multivariable analyses did not influence survival or the rate of major complications (data not shown).

### Ex vivo resection and intestinal autotransplantation: an international multicenter study [^115q8MqT]. Annals of Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the perioperative and long-term outcomes of ex vivo resection and intestinal auto-transplantation (ERIA) for tumors.

Summary Of Background Data

ERIA could offer effective therapy for tumors considered unresectable by conventional methods. However, there has been limited data of ERIA. To our knowledge, this represents the largest case series of ERIA to date.

Methods

We conducted an international multicenter retrospective data analysis of patients who underwent ERIA with or without Whipple procedure at five institutions between 1999 and 2024. Cases that required liver auto-transplantation were excluded.

Results

A total of 35 patients (25 with Whipple procedures) were analyzed. We classified tumors as highly malignant (n = 16) and benign/low-grade (n = 19). The highly malignant group included 7 pancreatic adenocarcinomas and 5 sarcomas while the low-grade group included 9 desmoid tumors. The median tumor size was 11.1 cm (4.5 to 30.0 cm) and R0 resection was achieved in 85.7%. There was no 90-day mortality. The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survivals were 87.7, 70.3 and 66.2%, respectively. The 1, 3, and 5 year overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) for the highly malignant group were 72.2%, 32.5%, 32.5% and 66.7%, 20.0%, 13.3%, respectively. The 1, 3 and 5 year OS and RFS for the benign to low-grade tumors were 100%, 100%, 92.9% and 100%, 93.3%, 86.7%, respectively.

Conclusions

ERIA can be performed with low perioperative mortality and acceptable outcomes in select patients with otherwise unresectable tumors.

### Presentation, treatment and outcome in patients with ampullary tumours [^115GvquB]. The British Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Ampullary tumours are relatively rare, and few large single-centre reports provide information on their treatment and outcome. The aim of this study was to analyse outcome and determine predictors of survival for patients with ampullary tumours treated in a specialist centre.

Methods

Over an 11-year period, 561 patients were treated for periampullary tumours, 88 of whom had a histologically proven ampullary neoplasm. Prospectively gathered data were analysed to assess predictors of survival.

Results

The overall resection rate was 92 per cent; there were no postoperative deaths. Median survival was 45.8 months for patients with resectable tumours and 8.0 months for those with irresectable disease (P < 0.001). On univariate analysis, age less than 70 years (P = 0.015) and a bilirubin level of 75 micromol/l or less (P = 0.012) favoured long-term survival. Among 70 patients who underwent cancer resection, factors associated with significantly worse long-term survival on univariate analysis included poorly differentiated tumour (P < 0.001), positive nodes (P < 0.001), perineural invasion (P = 0.001) and invasion of the pancreas (P = 0.018). Multivariate analysis identified positive nodes and bilirubin concentration as independent predictors of survival.

Conclusion

An aggressive surgical approach to ampullary tumours is justified by the low proportion of benign lesions, the absence of postoperative mortality and improved long-term survival.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^117MCLgV]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Management of resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma — surgical role, risks, survival, and prognostic factors: Surgical resection is the only potentially curative technique for managing pancreatic cancer, yet > 80% of patients present with disease that is not resectable; in experienced centers studies demonstrated an acceptably low (< 5%) mortality; even under the most optimal clinical trial conditions, the median survival of resected patients following adjuvant therapy ranges from 20.1 to 28.0 months; and negative margin status (ie, R0 resection), tumor DNA content, small tumor size, and absence of lymph node metastases are cited as the strongest prognostic indicators for long-term survival.

### How to approach para-aortic lymph node metastases during exploration for suspected periampullary carcinoma: resection or bypass? [^113SYswj]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

The clinical value of routine PALN sampling has been investigated previously; – however, in these studies, all patients underwent pancreatoduodenectomy without routinely sampling of the PALN. Because of conflicting results and methodological imperfections, strong data to support routine PALN sampling and immediate frozen section analysis are lacking. However, the present study is the first to demonstrate the overall survival results and complication data of patients who underwent resection, as well as from a distinct group of patients in which resection was avoided, followed by palliative surgery.

The literature was recently reviewed in depth by van Rijssen et al. Based on this review, we considered two recent publications of prospectively collected series of routine sampling of PALN, with conflicting results, to shape the current discussion. The first study by Schwarz et al. showed the results of a prospectively collected series with routine sampling of PALNs. In a 10-year period, 111 consecutive patients were included. Schwarz et al. found 12 patients to have involved PALNs after frozen section analysis, and another 5 patients after hematoxylin–eosin staining (11% and 15%, respectively). Median survival was 9.7 versus 28.5 months for positive and negative PALNs (p = 0.012). The second study, published by Nappo et al. included 135 consecutive patients in an 8-year period. Nappo et al. found involved PALNs in 15 (11%) patients. Median survival for PALN-positive patients was inferior to N0 but similar to that of N1 patients (32 vs. 69 vs. 34 months, respectively). In both studies, there was no clinical consequence of positive PALN findings. Both studies, and for that matter all other previous studies on this subject, have compared survival of resected PALN-positive patients with resected PALN-negative patients. We can therefore only conclude, on the basis of the previous studies, that positive PALNs are a marker of poor prognosis. However, the most important clinical question remains unanswered: should we avoid resection if positive PALNs are found, or not?

### Meta-analysis of randomised adjuvant therapy trials for pancreatic cancer [^112WaTZ5]. British Journal of Cancer (2005). Low credibility.

PATIENTS AND METHODS

Data collection

A protocol for the meta-analysis including objectives, inclusion criteria for trials and data analysis was followed. A systematic literature search, using ISI Web of Knowledge, Medline and EMBASE search tools, was carried out as part of a review to identify randomised controlled trials published worldwide. Information regarding ongoing trials was also requested from members of ESPAC group across 11 European countries. Trials were eligible if they randomised patients to adjuvant therapy for resected pancreatic cancer recruiting only patients aged > 18 years with histologically proven ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas and the trial had closed to recruitment. Identified trial groups were contacted for access to their individual patient data and trial protocols.

Meta-analysis of individual patient data provides increased accuracy and as such trial groups were encouraged to supply individual patient data including prognostic information and additional follow-up for survival, where possible. Patient characteristics and baseline histology data were requested including date of birth, sex, date of operation, date of randomisation, tumour type and size, grade of disease, microscopic resection margin status, nodal status, smoking and preoperative diabetes status as well as survival information based on the date last seen alive, date and cause of death and randomised treatment group.

Only patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma were included since the survival rate of other less common types of pancreatic or 'periampullary' cancer such as ampullary carcinoma and intrapancreatic bile duct cancer have much more favourable prognoses. Patients were grouped according to the type of randomised adjuvant treatment (chemoradiation or chemotherapy). The treatments investigated by the individual trials were commonly used regimens that were fairly well tolerated by patients and as such reported no significant detriment to quality of life.

### Surgical outcome after pancreatoduodenectomy for duodenal adenocarcinoma compared with other periampullary cancers: a nationwide audit study [^111e5vPN]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2023). Medium credibility.

Duodenal adenocarcinoma is a rare disease with a rising incidence. Locoregional duodenal and other periampullary cancers are primarily treated by pancreatoduodenectomy and, potentially, adjuvant chemotherapy. – Tumor morphology of duodenal adenocarcinoma demonstrates an intestinal-type differentiation, resembling colorectal cancer, while most other periampullary cancers have a pancreaticobiliary-type differentiation. Better overall survival has been reported for patients with duodenal adenocarcinoma compared with patients with other periampullary cancers.

Mortality after pancreatoduodenectomy has decreased over the last decades. Reported in-hospital mortality rates are < 5% in specialized centers, which is partially due to centralization of the operation, with pancreatoduodenectomy being increasingly performed in high-volume centers, and better management of major complications such as postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) and their sequalae, abdominal sepsis, and post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage (PPH). While mortality rates for pancreatoduodenectomy have decreased considerably, postoperative morbidity rates can still reach up to 67%. –

In surgical series on pancreatoduodenectomy, outcomes for patients with duodenal adenocarcinoma are often combined with other periampullary cancers because of their low incidence. – This results in limited knowledge of postoperative mortality and complication rates after pancreatoduodenectomy for duodenal adenocarcinoma. However, adequate identification of perioperative risk factors is pivotal for clinicians to better select patients with duodenal adenocarcinoma for curative resection and adequately counsel patients. The aim of this multicenter, nationwide audit-based study was to determine the postoperative morbidity and mortality after pancreatoduodenectomy for duodenal adenocarcinoma compared with other periampullary cancers.

### The SMAD4 protein and prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma [^113iPsiY]. Clinical Cancer Research (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

SMAD4 (also called Dpc4) is a tumor suppressor in the TGF-beta signaling pathway that is genetically inactivated in approximately 55% of all pancreatic adenocarcinomas. We investigated whether prognosis after surgical resection for invasive pancreatic adenocarcinoma is influenced by SMAD4 status.

Experimental Design

Using immunohistochemistry, we characterized the SMAD4 protein status of 249 pancreatic adenocarcinomas resected from patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple resection) at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, between 1990 and 1997. The SMAD4 gene status of 56 of 249 (22%) pancreatic carcinomas was also determined. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model assessed the relative risk of mortality associated with SMAD4 status, adjusting for known prognostic variables.

Results

Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas with SMAD4 protein expression had significantly longer survival (unadjusted median survival was 19.2 months as compared with 14.7 months in patients with pancreatic cancers lacking SMAD4 protein expression; P = 0.03). This SMAD4 survival benefit persisted after adjustment for prognostic factors including tumor size, margins, lymph node status, pathological stage, blood loss, and use of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The relative hazard of mortality for cancers lacking SMAD4 after adjusting for other prognostic factors was 1.36 (95% confidence interval, 1.01–1.83; P = 0.04).

Conclusion

Patients undergoing Whipple resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma survive longer if their cancers express SMAD4.

### Imaging of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with emphasis on multidetector CT [^115Mc8g5]. Clinical Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth most frequent cause of cancer-related death. The incidence is increasing and the overall survival has altered little in recent years. Moreover, patients usually present late with inoperable disease and curative resection by standard pancreatico-duodenectomy (Whipple's procedure) is associated with significant morbidity. It should only be attempted in that small group of patients lacking radiological evidence of advanced disease. Despite the recent advances in body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), computed tomography (CT) is the mainstay of staging in most centres and the recent development of multidetector CT machines (MDCT) has raised hope of an improvement in preoperative staging. This review focuses on the CT of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with particular emphasis on examination technique and on those criteria that determine resectability.

### Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, version 2.2021, NCCN clinical practice guidelines in oncology [^114dEZ1s]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2021). High credibility.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma — Whipple specimen orientation, inking, and margin reporting are specified to standardize assessment. Specimen orientation and inking involves both a pathologist and surgeon, and there should be either direct communication between the surgeon and pathologist for proper orientation and margin identification, or the surgeon should identify the important margins with a clearly understood and documented method, with the distal and proximal margins of SMV and SMA and the bile duct margin marked. Variability in the names given to various margins impedes comparison, so definitions and uniformity of nomenclature are critical to accurate reporting; margins defined include the SMA (retroperitoneal/uncinate) margin, posterior surface, SMA groove margin, gastric/enteric margins, pancreatic neck (transection) margin, and the bile duct margin, with additional analysis of the proximal and distal enteric margins and the anterior surface. The anterior surface is not a true margin, but identification and reporting of this surface when positive may portend a risk of local recurrence, and is therefore strongly recommended but not required to be reported in all cases; collectively, these pancreatic tissue surfaces constitute the circumferential transection margin, and designating margins with different colored inks will allow recognition on microscopy.

### Skull metastasis of ampulla of vater adenocarcinoma 5 years after whipple operation: case report and literature review [^117LFf8L]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2009). Low credibility.

Skull metastases can occur with nearly all types of tumor. They frequently are asymptomatic, causing local swelling, which is usually painless and rarely leads to neurological dysfunction. Carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is an uncommon tumor accounting for approximately 0.2% of all gastrointestinal malignancies, with an estimated incidence of less than 6 cases per 1,000,000 population per year. We report about an extremely rare case of a 54-year-old female patient with a right frontal skull metastases of an ampulla of Vater adenocarcinoma 5 years after pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Literature review revealed only one published case of cranial bone metastases of carcinoma of the ampulla of Vater. To the best of our knowledge this is the first case report of skull metastases of ampullary adenocarcinoma after a symptom-free interval of 5 years after R0 resection of the primary tumor, and the second published case that involves the skull.

### ASO author reflections: dilemma of paraaortic lymph node metastases during exploration for suspected periampullary carcinoma [^113BrDns]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2020). Medium credibility.

Past

The decision to perform a pancreatoduodenectomy for suspected periampullary cancer depends on vascular involvement, distant metastases, and lymph node metastases. Lymph node involvement of the paraaortic lymph node (PALN; station 16) corresponds with distant metastases according to the Japanese Pancreas Society Classification of Pancreatic Cancer but not in the current edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual. Also, the International Study Group on Pancreatic Surgery does not include PALN in standard lymphadenectomy for pancreatoduodenectomy. Poor survival after pancreatoduodenectomy with positive PALN has been seen previously, but its prognostic significance has not been established. Some studies have identified patients who might benefit from resection, while others routinely perform a palliative bypass procedure when positive PALNs are found during exploration. The optimal strategy to approach PALN during surgery remains unclear.

### Results of pancreaticoduodenectomy in patients with periampullary adenocarcinoma: perineural growth more important prognostic factor than tumor localization [^113eiB7K]. Annals of Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To study the impact of perineural growth as a prognostic factor in periampullary adenocarcinoma (pancreatic head, ampulla of Vater, distal bile duct, and duodenal carcinoma).

Summary Background Data

Pancreatic head carcinoma is considered to have the worst prognosis of the periampullary carcinomas. Several other prognostic factors for periampullary tumors have been identified, eg, lymph node status, free resection margins, tumor size and differentiation, and vascular invasion. The impact of perineural growth as a prognostic factor in relation to the site of origin of periampullary carcinomas is unknown.

Methods

Data of 205 patients with periampullary carcinomas were retrieved from our prospective database. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed in 121 patients. Their clinicopathological data were reviewed and analyzed in a multivariate analysis.

Results

Perineural growth was present in 49% of the cases (37 of the 51 patients with pancreatic head carcinoma; 7 of the 30 patients with ampulla of Vater carcinoma; 7 of the 19 with distal bile duct carcinoma; and 8 of the 21 with duodenal carcinoma). Overall 5-year survival was 32.6% with a median survival of 20.7 months. Median survival in tumors with perineural growth was 13.1 months compared with 36.0 months in tumors without perineural growth (P < 0.0001) Using multivariate analysis, the following unfavorable prognostic factors were identified: perineural growth (RR = 2.90, 95% CI 1.62–5.22), nonradical resection (RR = 2.28, 95% CI 1.19–4.36), positive lymph nodes (RR = 1.96, 95% CI 1.11–3.45), and angioinvasion (RR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.05–3.06). Portal or superior mesenteric vein reconstruction and tumor localization were not of statistical significance.

Conclusion

Perineural growth is a more important risk factor for survival than the primary site of periampullary carcinomas.

### Prognostic impact of para-aortic lymph node metastasis in resected non-pancreatic periampullary cancers [^116fzn3y]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Results

Patient Cohort, and Operative and Histopathological Characteristics

Overall, 887 patients with suspected or biopsy-proven NPPAC underwent PD in the study period, of whom 153 patients (17.2%) underwent PD with PALN sampling.

The median age of the patients was 56 years (range 32–82 years), with a 60% male predominance. On clinico-radiologic evaluation, the tumors were most commonly epicentered at the ampulla (78.3%), followed by the distal CBD (18.2%) and the duodenum (3.5%). Seven of the 153 resected patients received chemotherapy with neoadjuvant intent. Three patients had suspicious nodal disease on imaging, three had an elevated CA-19.9, and one patient received chemotherapy before presentation at our institute (Table 1).

The baseline clinical, demographic, and operative characteristics are elaborated in Table 1. All patients underwent a PD. Pylorus-preserving PD was performed in 70.6% (101/143) of patients, while 37 underwent a classical Whipple's procedure (25.8%).

Among the 153 patients where PALN sampling or dissection was performed, the decision was prompted by either the presence of radiological indeterminate PALN (n = 31, 3.5%), or an intraoperative suspicion of involved PALN or locally advanced disease (n = 82, 9.24%). In 40 patients (4.5%), sampling was performed at the surgeon's discretion.
