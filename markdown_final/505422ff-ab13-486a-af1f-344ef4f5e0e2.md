## Question

Does low lymph auto indicate infection

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a low lymphocyte count ("low lymph auto") indicates infection. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "low lymph auto" means on a CBC and how lymphopenia is defined. Then, I should verify the strength of evidence linking lymphopenia to infection across clinical contexts. Next, I will examine mechanisms that plausibly connect lymphopenia to infection risk. After that, I need to check important confounders and noninfectious causes of lymphopenia. Finally, I will synthesize a clinically useful, cautious conclusion and outline practical next steps for evaluation and follow-up.

> Let me first confirm the terminology and thresholds. "Low lymph auto" on a CBC typically reflects a low absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and lymphopenia is generally defined as an ALC less than about 1.0–1.5 × 10⁹/L, with "severe" often defined below 0.5 × 10⁹/L; persistent lymphopenia below about 0.76 × 10⁹/L has been linked to worse outcomes in sepsis cohorts, so I should keep those cut points in mind as I interpret any single value [^113H5Veo] [^111t6zFG].

> Now, I should review whether lymphopenia predicts infection or merely reflects it. Multiple studies show that lymphopenia at presentation predicts bacteremia and sepsis severity better than conventional markers like WBC or CRP in emergency settings, and it correlates with higher mortality and secondary infections in sepsis and community-acquired pneumonia cohorts; for example, in CAP, an admission lymphocyte count below about 0.724 × 10⁹/L identifies a high-risk "lymphopenic CAP" phenotype with prolonged time to stability and dysregulated host responses, and in ED cohorts, lymphopenia and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio outperform CRP and WBC for bacteremia prediction [^111TJBNC] [^113MDsUt] [^116WxUfn] [^112s5yLD].

> Wait, let me verify the directionality so I don't overstate causality. Lymphopenia can be both a marker of ongoing infection and a risk factor for subsequent infections. In sepsis, early and persistent lymphopenia tracks with worse outcomes and secondary infections, and in immunocompromised hosts, lower lymphocyte counts are associated with higher serious infection risk, supporting a bidirectional relationship rather than a purely epiphenomenon [^113H5Veo] [^114wMd38] [^11382rki].

> I will now examine mechanisms that make this biologically plausible. Sepsis and severe infections drive lymphocyte apoptosis, impaired proliferation, and redistribution out of the circulation, producing measurable lymphopenia; critically, failure to normalize lymphocyte counts over time is linked to ongoing immunosuppression and adverse outcomes, reinforcing the prognostic value of serial ALC trends in infected patients [^1152VqXb] [^111t6zFG] [^113H5Veo].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — lymphopenia is not specific to infection. I need to check for noninfectious causes that can lower lymphocytes, including corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants, cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, autoimmune disease, malnutrition, stress or trauma, and certain drugs like S1P modulators; importantly, in some contexts such as IBD on thiopurines, mild lymphopenia has not consistently correlated with increased infection risk, so I should always interpret ALC in clinical context and over time [^114WQQA7] [^112FUskC] [^1164RMsx] [^1177aJ6g] [^113H5Veo].

> Next, I should review special populations where lymphopenia is particularly informative. In COVID-19, lymphopenia is a hallmark of severe disease and correlates with mortality. In HIV, CD4 T-cell depletion underlies opportunistic infection risk. In transplant and oncology, low lymphocyte counts flag higher infection vulnerability and guide prophylaxis. And in pediatrics, lymphopenia has been used to help differentiate severe viral infections like pandemic influenza in outbreak settings, though cutoffs vary and must be applied cautiously [^116gPsfC] [^114dGBCj] [^114oqXpk] [^11734qDW].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, clinically useful answer. Yes, a low lymphocyte count can indicate infection, particularly when the value is below about 1.0 × 10⁹/L and especially if it is severe or persistent, because lymphopenia is both a common feature of serious infections and a predictor of worse outcomes; however, it is not specific and must be interpreted alongside the clinical picture, other labs, and trajectory, with attention to noninfectious causes and the patient's baseline immune status [^113H5Veo] [^111TJBNC] [^111t6zFG].

> I should double-check practical next steps. If lymphopenia is present, I would confirm with a repeat CBC to exclude lab artifact, assess for concurrent neutrophilia and calculate the NLR, review medications and comorbidities, and consider targeted infectious workup guided by symptoms; in sepsis or severe viral pneumonia, trending ALC helps risk-stratify, and in immunocompromised hosts, very low counts may prompt infection-prevention measures or prophylaxis; conversely, isolated mild lymphopenia in a stable outpatient may warrant observation and reassessment rather than immediate infection-focused intervention [^111t6zFG] [^116WxUfn] [^114cg4pE] [^11382rki].

Low lymphocyte count (lymphopenia) **can indicate infection**, especially bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, but it is **not specific** and can also result from non-infectious causes such as medications, autoimmune disease, or bone marrow disorders [^113H5Veo]. Lymphopenia is common in sepsis [^113H5Veo], COVID-19 [^1123WG2r], and HIV [^114GsRFV], and is linked to worse outcomes, but it should be interpreted with clinical context and other labs [^115vM1WK] [^117KmLNz]. Persistent or severe lymphopenia (** < 0.5 × 10⁹/L**) increases infection risk and warrants further evaluation [^113H5Veo] [^112FUskC].

---

## Infectious causes of low lymphocyte count

Several **infectious agents** can cause lymphopenia via apoptosis, redistribution, or direct lymphocyte destruction [^1152VqXb]:

- **Sepsis**: Lymphopenia is common in sepsis and correlates with severity and mortality [^113H5Veo] [^111t6zFG].

- **COVID-19**: Lymphopenia is a hallmark of severe COVID-19 and predicts worse outcomes [^116gPsfC] [^113z3i4m].

- **HIV infection**: CD4+ T-cell depletion is characteristic and increases opportunistic infection risk [^112ajxqe] [^114dGBCj].

- **Other viral infections**: Influenza, SARS, and other viruses can cause lymphopenia [^111jNEte] [^11734qDW].

---

## Non-infectious causes of low lymphocyte count

Lymphopenia can also result from **non-infectious conditions**, including:

- **Medications**: Corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and immunosuppressants can cause lymphopenia [^113H5Veo] [^111y7pmG].

- **Autoimmune diseases**: SLE and other autoimmune disorders can cause lymphopenia [^114WQQA7].

- **Bone marrow disorders**: Leukemia, lymphoma, and aplastic anemia can reduce lymphocyte production [^notfound].

- **Nutritional deficiencies**: Malnutrition, especially protein-calorie deficiency, can cause lymphopenia [^113yveLG].

---

## Clinical significance of lymphopenia in infection

Lymphopenia is a **marker of immune suppression** and is associated with:

- **Increased infection risk**: Higher risk of secondary infections and complications [^113H5Veo] [^114wMd38].

- **Severity and prognosis**: Linked to worse outcomes in sepsis, COVID-19, and other infections [^113H5Veo] [^117KmLNz].

- **Immune dysfunction**: Reflects impaired adaptive immunity, reducing pathogen clearance [^112v9bGj] [^113ccwF4].

---

## Diagnostic and prognostic value of lymphocyte count

Lymphocyte count is a **readily available, low-cost biomarker** with diagnostic and prognostic utility:

- **Diagnostic marker**: Helps identify infections, especially sepsis and COVID-19 [^111t6zFG] [^116QEMG2].

- **Prognostic marker**: Predicts severity, complications, and mortality in infections [^113H5Veo] [^117KmLNz].

- **Monitoring tool**: Tracks immune recovery or persistent immunosuppression [^113H5Veo] [^111t6zFG].

---

## Thresholds and clinical guidelines

Common **clinical thresholds** for lymphopenia include:

| **Threshold** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|
| < 1.0 × 10⁹/L | Lymphopenia; increased infection risk |
| < 0.5 × 10⁹/L | Severe lymphopenia; high infection risk, immunosuppression |

---

Persistent lymphopenia (** < 0.76 × 10⁹/L for > 3 days**) is associated with higher mortality in sepsis and warrants close monitoring [^111t6zFG].

---

## Limitations and confounding factors

Lymphocyte count has **limitations**:

- **Non-specific**: Can be low in many conditions, not just infections [^113H5Veo].

- **Variability**: Influenced by age, medications, and comorbidities [^111emYX7] [^114rdiXE] [^111y7pmG].

- **Context-dependent**: Must be interpreted with clinical findings and other labs [^112MjbJ4] [^113Y9xBJ].

---

## Clinical management and follow-up

Management of lymphopenia depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Treat the cause**: Address the infection or underlying condition [^1178pULS].

- **Monitor recovery**: Track lymphocyte recovery to gauge immune reconstitution [^113H5Veo] [^111t6zFG].

- **Prevent infections**: Use prophylaxis and infection-control measures in severe lymphopenia [^114GsRFV].

---

Low lymphocyte count **can indicate infection**, especially in sepsis, COVID-19, and HIV, but it is not specific and can reflect non-infectious causes. Persistent or severe lymphopenia signals higher infection risk and worse outcomes, so results should be interpreted in clinical context with appropriate follow-up [^113H5Veo] [^117KmLNz].

Antiretroviral therapy (ART)–mediated viral suppression — expected CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) count patterns and timing indicate that most people experience recovery of CD4 counts to the normal range (> 500 cells/mm3), but some who started ART at low CD4 counts do not experience recovery to > 500 cells/mm3 despite sustained virologic suppression, and promptly initiating ART in people diagnosed early with HIV provides the best opportunity for maximal CD4 cell recovery.

### Risk of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections in patients with solid malignant tumors treated with curative intent radiation therapy [^113YSYav]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Lymphopenia is not the only culprit of infections but in the absence of other relevant factors that are known to carry an increased risk of infection, such as neutropenia (< 500 cells/µL), it becomes of relevance. In our cohort, very few patients presented with neutropenia grade ≥ 3 (< 1000 cells/µL) at the EoRT or within 2 weeks of infection. Neutrophils are not lowered to significant thresholds by radiation, but they could decrease secondary to myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Rapid proliferation of neutrophils may contribute to their sustained counts, in contrast to lymphocytes. We cannot rule out the possibility that even when counts of neutrophils remain normal, the functionality of neutrophils might be affected due to the underlying cancer or its treatment.

Other factors may play a role in the risk of infections. Most episodes of bloodstream infections in patients with solid tumors occur in nonneutropenic patients and seem health care related. In a study of bloodstream infections among patients with solid tumors, a large proportion of the patients had been hospitalized within the last 3 months of infection. In our study we did not investigate previous hospital admissions but we found infections were most common in the 3 months after the start of radiation therapy, which is the period of time when patients are most in contact with health services receiving radiation therapy combined or not with chemotherapy.

The strengths of this study are the large number of patients with different types of solid tumors, the broad assessment of the burden of infections after radiation therapy separately by type of treatment and cause and presenting infections in different categories.

Limitations to acknowledge are that many patients in the radiation therapy monotherapy group did not have EoRT lymphocyte counts available. We accounted for this by applying inverse probability weights in the multivariable models. Furthermore, among patients treated with radiation therapy monotherapy, breast cancer was the most common diagnosis. These patients receive radiation therapy with different characteristics, with very low volume of the body irradiated with 2 Gy or more, due to the predominance of tangential field techniques used in the department, which may spare the effect of radiation on the lymphocytes. In a sensitivity analysis excluding patients with breast cancer, we still found no association between EoRT lymphopenia and infections.

### CD4 + T lymphocyte counts after autologous transplantation in multiple myeloma: a retrospective study [^112NRfWL]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2007). Low credibility.

The risk for opportunistic infections is correlated with low CD4+ T lymphocyte counts in patients with HIV. We performed a retrospective analysis in 54 patients with multiple myeloma undergoing high-dose melphalan chemotherapy + autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation to better define the value of routine control of CD4+ T lymphocyte counts in this important patient group. In 61% of our patients, CD4+ T lymphocyte counts after recovery from neutropenia were < 200/microl and < 100/microl in 24% (median = 181/microl). Overall survival, progression-free survival, response to antineoplastic therapy and frequency of post-transplant infections were not significantly different when patients with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts < 200/microl and > 200/microl were compared. However, overall survival was significantly shorter in the subgroup of 13 patients with very low CD4+ T lymphocyte counts (< 100/microl) (P = 0.036). In 79.6% of all patients, at least one infection NCI-CTC grade II - IV developed within 100 days post-transplant. Opportunistic infections were rare. This analysis suggests that patients with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts < 100/microl may have a poorer prognosis.

### Prognostic value of lymphocyte count for in-hospital mortality in patients with severe AECOPD [^115d2mzY]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

People have learned that low lymphocyte counts are associated with poor prognosis in numerous acute and chronic diseases such as sepsis, cancer and cardiovascular disease. This phenomenon is often seen in serious MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) infections as well. In the global epidemic of COVID-19 in recent years, researchers have also found that lower lymphocyte count is prevalent in patients. In hospitalized COVID-19 patients, peripheral blood lymphocyte count was reduced, as were the counts of various lymphocyte subgroups. The predictive value of lymphocytes in humans needs to be explored in more studies.

This study population consisted of patients with severe AECOPD, and to our knowledge, this is the first to focus on the predictive role of lymphocytes on poor prognosis in patients with severe AECOPD. We also found that patients with low lymphocyte had significantly longer hospital stay and time on ventilator compared to patients with normal lymphocyte count. Few studies have focused on the relationship between lymphocyte count and these two outcomes. As previously mentioned, among patients with severe AECOPD, a very high percentage of patients with low lymphocytes have respiratory failure (84.6%), which means that these patients are sicker and leads to longer hospital stays and use of ventilators.

Our study also had some limitations. First, our study was a single-center study with a small number of cases, lacking follow-up data on patients. Secondly, many patients failed to complete pulmonary function tests during this hospitalization due to the severity of the disease, and there were no CAT scores, mMRC scores or other indicators to assess the severity of patients, which prevented a more comprehensive prognosis of patients. Finally, interactions between lymphocyte subpopulations may have an impact on lymphocyte counts.

### Low eosinophil and low lymphocyte counts and the incidence of 12 cardiovascular diseases: a CALIBER cohort study [^114rdiXE]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Exposure

The main exposures were eosinophil and lymphocyte counts as recorded in primary care. If a patient had more than one measurement on a given day, the values were aggregated by taking the mean. We analysed eosinophil and lymphocyte counts as categorical variables in order to avoid presuming a particular shape for the association with cardiovascular diseases. There were no clinically obvious cutpoints or consistent definitions of 'normal' lymphocyte or eosinophil counts in the literature. In the absence of a clear rationale for choosing specific cutpoints, we chose to study quintiles; however, the number of decimal places varied between laboratories (units: cells×10 9 /L) and the absolute values of eosinophil counts were small relative to the precision of recording (see online supplementary figure S1). In order to avoid biasing the category allocation by precision, we manually adjusted the eosinophil category boundaries, so that the second decimal place was 5, thus ensuring that any values recorded to two decimal places would end up in the same category if they were recorded to only one decimal place. We derived quintile-based categories for lymphocyte counts by a similar method. All category intervals were closed at the lower bound and open at the upper bound, that is, '0.05 to 0.15' includes 0.05 but not 0.15.

Eosinophil and lymphocyte counts can be affected by many factors such as infections, autoimmune diseases, medication and haematological conditions. We sought to differentiate between a patient's long-term 'stable' leucocyte profile and results obtained when the patient had an 'acute' condition which may alter leucocyte counts. We used other information in the electronic health record to assess whether the patient was clinically 'acute' or 'stable' at the time of the blood test, adapting a set of criteria proposed by the eMERGE consortium(electronic Medical Records and Genomics) for studying genetic determinants of the stable leucocyte counts: in hospital on the date of blood test, vaccination in the previous 7 days, anaemia diagnosis within the previous 30 days, symptoms or diagnosis of infection within the previous 30 days, prior diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome, prior diagnosis of haemoglobinopathy, cancer chemotherapy or granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) within 6 months before index date, or the use of drugs affecting the immune system such as methotrexate or steroids within the previous 3 months. Patients with HIV, splenectomy or on dialysis were excluded from this study, as their leucocyte counts may be difficult to interpret.

Role of lymphopenia in the progression and outcome of sepsis

Association with sepsis progression

Although lymphocyte count reduction, routinely defined as less than 1 to 1.5 × 10⁹/L, is commonly encountered in clinical monitoring, it is seldom utilized as a diagnostic criterion for ICU admissions. However, early studies have underscored its clinical utility in the urgent diagnosis of bacteremia patients and in predicting postoperative sepsis. Statistics indicate that 74% of septic patients experienced a decline in lymphocyte count (below 1.5 × 10⁹/L) within the first 1–2 days, and 56% had not returned to a normal lymphocyte count by days 6–8.

According to a study conducted in China, severe sepsis patients exhibited a lower lymphocyte count (0.8 × 10⁹/L, Q L = 0.50, Q u = 1.12) in comparison to the low-risk group (lymphocyte count of 0.9 × 10⁹/L, Q L = 0.65, Q u = 1.42). Another research highlighted significant disparities in the median lymphocyte counts between sepsis patients, critically ill non-sepsis patients, and healthy control groups, registering at 0.9 × 10⁹/L, 1.1 × 10⁹/L, and 1.8 × 10⁹/L respectively, with the interquartile ranges being 0.6–1.3, 0.7–1.6, and 1.4–2.3 × 10⁹/L. A large-scale European study corroborated that a lymphocyte count < 1.1 × 10⁹/L correlated with a heightened multi-variable adjusted risk ratio of 1.51 (95% CI 1.21–1.89) for sepsis diagnosis, aligning with increased risks of hospital infections and infection-related mortality.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^113H5Veo]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Sepsis, a life-threatening condition that arises when the body's response to infection damages host tissues and organs, imposes a substantial global pathological burden. Recent estimates suggest that sepsis affects nearly 50 million people worldwide each year, leading to high mortality rates and huge healthcare costs. Despite substantial advances in medical science, sepsis continues to represent a significant public health challenge, necessitating innovative strategies to mitigate its global impact.

Lymphopenia, alternatively termed lymphocytopenia, delineates a pathological state characterized by a diminished concentration of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. The etiology of lymphopenia encompasses a range of factors, including infections, autoimmune disorders, pharmacological interventions, and exposure to radiation therapy. The relationship between lymphopenia and sepsis has been extensively studied, and in particular, sepsis-induced lymphopenia is gradually being recognized as an essential factor in the prognosis of sepsis. Sepsis-induced lymphopenia is usually defined as an absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of less than 1,000 cells/µL. Several studies have also provided individualized threshold data, e.g. the persistence with the lymphopenia cut-off value (< 760 cells/µL) > 3 days in non-viral infection-related sepsis indicates a higher 28-day mortality rate, and severe lymphopenia in sepsis was previously defined as an ALC of less than 500/µL. However, despite the significant progress in this field, numerous unresolved issues still require urgent attention (Table 1). In addition, altering myeloid cell numbers during sepsis is a relatively complex and diverse process. This issue has been discussed by others and is beyond the scope of this review.

Table 1
Established knowledge and unanswered questions about sepsis-induced lymphopenia

Notably, sepsis-induced lymphopenia has been associated with worse outcomes, including increased risk of secondary infections, multiple organ failure, and death. Given the widespread role of lymphopenia in sepsis, there is a growing recognition of the potential practical significance of treatments that address lymphopenia. The main controversies and challenges faced by the medical community in addressing these questions include the complexity of the immune response in sepsis, the difficulty of distinguishing cause and effect in observational studies, and the lack of specific treatments. Moreover, the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has further complicated the scenario, resulting in an increased incidence of sepsis cases. This rise is coupled with the pandemic's tendency to cause lymphopenia, which merits additional investigation to unravel the intricate pathophysiological pathways in sepsis.

### Use of total lymphocyte count for monitoring response to antiretroviral therapy [^115xKTwb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

The CD4 cell count has become a key laboratory measurement in the management of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease. In ideal situations, HIV-infected persons are followed up longitudinally with serial CD4 cell counts to determine disease progression, risk for opportunistic infection, and the need for prophylactic or therapeutic intervention. However, the use of the CD4 cell count in resource-limited settings is often not possible because of lack of availability and high cost. Thus, other laboratory markers have been proposed as substitutes for the CD4 cell count. The data regarding the clinical utility of the total lymphocyte count (TLC) as a potential surrogate marker of immune function in patients with HIV disease are examined. The role of the TLC in the initiation of antiretroviral therapy and opportunistic infection prophylaxis, as well as the role of the TLC in monitoring the response to antiretroviral therapy, are also addressed.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^116gPsfC]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

To evaluate lymphopenia as a marker for coronavirus disease severity, we conducted a meta-analysis of 10 studies. Severe illness was associated with lower lymphocyte and higher leukocyte counts. Using these markers for early identification of patients with severe disease may help healthcare providers prioritize the need to obtain therapy.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^116kZkpy]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

CD4 count monitoring — The CD4 count is the most important laboratory indicator of immune function in people with HIV, and low pretreatment CD4 count is the strongest predictor of disease progression and mortality according to findings from clinical trials and cohort studies. CD4 counts are highly variable; a significant change (2 standard deviations) between two tests is approximately a 30% change in the absolute count, or an increase or decrease in CD4 percentage by three percentage points. Monitoring of lymphocyte subsets other than CD4 (e.g. CD8, CD19) is not recommended (BIII) because it has not been proven to be clinically useful and is more expensive than monitoring CD4 count alone.

### Accuracy of routine laboratory tests to predict mortality and deterioration to severe or critical COVID-19 in people with SARS-CoV-2 [^113ctwUk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphocyte count increase

For deterioration (4 studies), cut‐off values ranged from 3.2 to 4.8 x 10 9 cells/L. Sensitivity in all four studies was 0%. The studies did not include any true positive cases at the reported cut‐off value. Specificity ranged from 98% to 100%. The summary estimate of sensitivity was 7% (95% CI 0% to 83%) at a specificity of 99% (identical for Q1, median and Q3).

### Pretransplant lymphocyte count predicts the incidence of infection during the first two years after liver transplantation [^116V1tUG]. Liver Transplantation (2009). Low credibility.

Patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD) show a low absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocyte subpopulations (PBLSs). We investigated if the baseline PBLS could categorize orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) recipients into groups at high or low risk for infection after transplantation. PBLSs were prospectively studied in 63 consecutive patients (42 males; mean age ± standard deviation: 53.5 ± 10.3 years) with ESLD prior to OLT. Thirty-five patients (55.6%) developed a total of 79 infectious episodes during the first 2 years post-OLT. The median total lymphocyte count and PBLS levels [CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, memory (CD45RO+) CD4+ T cells, T cell receptor alphabeta+ and gammadelta+ subsets, and CD19+ B cells] at baseline were significantly lower in patients with an infection compared with those without one (P < 0.05). There was a significant correlation between the risk of development of a post-OLT infection and a baseline total lymphocyte count < 1.00 x 10(3)/microL (P = 0.001), a baseline CD3+ T cell count < 0.75 x 10(3)/microL (P = 0.009), and a baseline CD4+ T cell count < 0.5 x 10(3)/microL (P = 0.008). In the multivariate analysis, this association between the baseline total lymphocyte level and infection remained significant (odds ratio: 10.1; 95% confidence interval: 1.9–39.5). In conclusion, the pre-OLT total lymphocyte count identifies a subset of patients at high risk for infection. PBLS monitoring prior to OLT may offer an opportunity for surveillance, tapering of immunosuppression, and preemptive therapy.

### Early decrease in blood lymphocyte count is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^116C8498]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is the most severe infectious disease outbreak this century, causing millions of infections and deaths worldwide. While the pandemic has primarily abated in many regions, seasonal epidemics and periodic pandemics remain a constant threat and cause significant mortality. Until today, COVID-19 infection can cause many complications, some may deteriorate and even die, especially in high-risk patients. Therefore, early identification of high-risk patients is crucial to ensure prompt and appropriate treatment for COVID-19 patients.

Dysregulation of the immune system is directly linked to disease severity in COVID-19 patients. Immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk for COVID-19-associated mortality due to immunologic deficits that limit the virus's clearance. Zhao et al. reported that neutrophilia, lymphocytopenia, low CD4 + T cells, and decreased C3 could predict the mortality of COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis reported that lymphocyte count reduction correlated with illness severity in COVID-19 patients. Although several studies have investigated the relationship between lymphocyte count and severity in COVID-19 patients, there is still limited information on the dynamic changes in lymphocyte count over time in COVID-19 patients, which is more important for determining patients' conditions. In the present study, we aim to investigate the trends of lymphocyte count during the progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients.

### Prediction of SARS-CoV-2-positivity from million-scale complete blood counts using machine learning [^113UwkUq]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The CBC is a simple and inexpensive exam. It is part of most laboratory routines, so "astute practitioners may use nuances and clues from the CBC in many clinical situations". Liu et al.devised a high accuracy risk assessment tool that can predict the mortality for COVID-19 through CBCs. Li et al.verified that the low count of white blood cells is related to COVID-19 severity by analyzing 12 death cases of COVID-19 and 18 individuals with moderate to severe symptoms, verifying low lymphocyte percentage in most of the cases. Although our dataset had no indicator of severity, we did find a drop in lymphocyte count the closer individuals were to their first positive RT-PCR results, corroborating this finding. Furthermore, we also verified many other analytes that shared a similar pattern. Although more research is needed, we believe that the key analytes indicated by our model might provide possibilities for future research. Literature suggests that there might be existing intrinsic relationships between analytes that might be characteristic of COVID-19. For instance, Nalbant et al.found that the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) might be particularly typical of COVID-19 infection. However, there is a profusion of other possible promising ratios and patterns currently being under-analyzed for the sake of COVID-19 diagnosis. One of the secondary goals of this work is to investigate this hypothesis, and we confirmed that our search algorithm tends to favor ratios over analyte count values.

### Association of lymphopenia with risk of mortality among US adults… [^115sioqb]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

Question Are low lymphocyte levels associated with reduced survival in the general population. Findings In this cohort study of 31 178 participants in the 1999 to 2010 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, lymphopenia was associated with shortened survival independently of clinical variables, and this risk was further heightened when accompanied by abnormal hematologic and/or inflammatory parameters. Meaning Based on these findings, patients with lymphopenia, especially those with other immunohematologic abnormalities, may have excess mortality risk; these patients are readily identifiable because tests of lymphocyte levels often occur during routine medical encounters. Importance Immune dysregulation can increase the risk of infection, malignant neoplasms, and cardiovascular disease, but improved methods are needed to identify and quantify immunologic hazard in the general population.

Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that lymphopenia is associated with reduced survival independently of and additive to traditional risk factors, especially when accompanied by altered erythropoiesis and/or heightened inflammation. Immune risk may be analyzed as a multidimensional entity derived from routine tests, facilitating precision medicine and population health interventions. Depending on the clinical context, immune status is typically viewed through the lens of individual measures of immune status. For instance, C- reactive protein is a marker of generalized inflammation and improves risk stratification in healthy adults. 19, 20 However, immune pathways often affect multiple variables, some of which are measured routinely as part of primary care.

In addition to ALC, Kaplan-Meier estimates show that several other IH biomarkers are individually associated with survival, with RDW and CRP level also exhibiting large survival differences. Spearman correlation coefficients and their associated 95% CIs indicate generally low degrees of correlation among these common IH biomarkers, with ALC being most closely associated with absolute monocyte count. We believe the results presented herein add to the growing body of evidence that immune status is associated with cardiovascular and noncardiovascular disease. Previous observational and prospective trials suggest that participants with overt or subacute inflammatory diseases have elevated risk of atherothrombotic disease, 36, 37 heart failure, 38, 39 malignant disease, 40 and death. 41 Comparatively few studies have evaluated ALC as a prognostic biomarker.

### CD4 cell count: declining value for antiretroviral therapy eligibility [^114ThERv]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) policy for people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has historically been based on clinical indications, such as opportunistic infections and CD4 cell counts. Studies suggest that CD4 counts early in HIV infection do not predict relevant public health outcomes such as disease progression, mortality, and HIV transmission in people living with HIV. CD4 counts also vary widely within individuals and among populations, leading to imprecise measurements and arbitrary ART initiation. To capture the clinical and preventive benefits of treatment, the global HIV response now focuses on increasing HIV diagnosis and ART coverage. CD4 counts for ART initiation were necessary when medications were expensive and had severe side effects, and when the impact of early ART initiation was unclear. However, current evidence suggests that although CD4 counts may still play a role in guiding clinical care to start prophylaxis for opportunistic infections, CD4 counts should cease to be required for ART initiation.

### Lymphocytopenia and neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio predict bacteremia better than conventional infection markers in an emergency care unit [^114FpGRi]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Absolute lymphocytopenia can be used in the prediction of infectious emergency admissions. Moreover, the ratio of neutrophil and lymphocyte counts - referred to as the NLCR - has even higher value in predicting bacteremia. This marker is simple, easily obtained and calculated, easy to integrate in daily practice and without extra costs.

Disbalanced lymphocyte subpopulations are early markers of mortality in our series of 701 SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients, when severe lymphopenia has yet to develop. If available, the study of lymphocyte subsets by flow cytometry is recommended to identify high‐risk COVID‐19 patients at hospital admission.

### The association between lymphopenia and serious infection risk in rheumatoid arthritis [^11382rki]. Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To investigate the relationship between occurrence of serious infection (SI) and lymphocyte counts in patients with RA using data from a single centre.

Methods

We used routinely captured data from a single tertiary rheumatology centre to explore the relationship between lymphopenia and SI risk. Adult RA patients were included over a 5-year follow-up period. Admissions due to confirmed SI were considered. SI rate with 95% confidence intervals was calculated. The association between SI with baseline lymphocyte counts, time-averaged lymphocyte counts throughout all follow-up, and a nadir lymphocyte count was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression. The relationship between lymphopenia over time and SI was analysed using a mixed-effect model of lymphocyte counts prior to SI.

Results

This analysis included 1095 patients with 205 SIs during 2016 person-years of follow-up. The SI rate was 4.61/100 patient-years (95% CI: 3.76, 5.65). Compared with patients with nadir lymphocyte counts > 1.5 × 109 cells/l, nadir lymphopenia < 1 × 109 cells/l was significantly associated with higher SI risk (HR 3.28; 95% CI: 1.59, 6.76), increasing to HR 8.08 (95% CI: 3.74, 17.44) in patients with lymphopenia < 0.5 × 109 cells/l. Lymphocyte counts were observed to be reduced in the 30-day period prior to SI.

Conclusion

Lymphocyte counts below < 1.0 × 109 cells/l were associated with higher SI risk in RA patients; the strongest association between lymphopenia and SI was observed when lymphocyte counts were below < 0.5 × 109 cells/l. Lymphopenia may be used as a measure to stratify patients at risk of SI.

### Comparison of clinical characteristics and peripheral blood tests of COVID-19 and influenza B patients [^113hd3Mh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

We suggest the use of COVID-19 testing in patients with a low to moderate fever and decreased red blood cell and lymphocyte counts, but influenza B testing in patients with a moderate to high fever and a sore throat, cough, and decreased white blood cell and neutrophil counts. Considering that virus antigen testing methods are unavailable in primary care hospitals, the criteria may help differentiate these two diseases and expedite timely referral to a higher-level hospital for relevant pathogenic testing. Nevertheless, given the overlap in clinical and laboratory manifestations, testing for both infections should be done whenever feasible and when both viruses are circulating.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^114JDbo8]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has spread rapidly globally; as of March 29, 2020, ≈670,000 cases had been confirmed worldwide. COVID-19 is typically a pulmonary infection that can range from mild illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure; however, other symptoms such as myalgias and anorexia have been noted. Although many ongoing studies are investigating measurement of proinflammatory cytokines and other biomarkers as a way to prognosticate infection severity, we investigated use of 2 easily obtained predictors: lymphopenia and leukocytosis.

### The neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio as a diagnostic marker for bacteraemia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116WxUfn]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Bacteraemia is a common cause of increased morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients, but its early diagnosis and identification are complicated. The neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) has been suggested as a useful indicator for the diagnosis of bacteraemia. We performed this meta-analysis to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the NLCR for bacteraemia.

Methods

We searched the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for this meta-analysis. We calculated individual and pooled sensitivities and specificities. I 2 statistics and Cochran's Q test were used to evaluate heterogeneity, and the cause of heterogeneity was explored with sensitivity analyses.

Results

In total, 8 of 1086 eligible articles were included in the present meta-analysis. The pooled analyses revealed that the diagnostic accuracy of the NLCR in terms of its bacteraemia sensitivity was 0.723 [95% CI: 0.660, 0.777], and its specificity was 0.596 [95% CI: 0.556, 0.634]. The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.69 [95% CI 0.65–0.73].

Conclusion

The NLCR is an easy-to-collect marker for bacteraemia. However, the NLCR is inadequate, and only a combination of multiple biomarkers will improve its diagnostic accuracy for bacteraemia.

### Lymphocytopenia and neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio predict bacteremia better than conventional infection markers in an emergency care unit [^113MDsUt]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Absolute lymphocytopenia has been reported as a predictor of bacteremia in medical emergencies. Likewise, the neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio (NLCR) has been shown a simple promising method to evaluate systemic inflammation in critically ill patients.

Methods

We retrospectively evaluated the ability of conventional infection markers, lymphocyte count and NLCR to predict bacteremia in adult patients admitted to the Emergency Department with suspected community-acquired bacteremia. The C-reactive protein (CRP) level, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count and NLCR were compared between patients with positive blood cultures (n = 92) and age-matched and gender-matched patients with negative blood cultures (n = 92) obtained upon Emergency Department admission.

Results

Significant differences between patients with positive and negative blood cultures were detected with respect to the CRP level (mean ± standard deviation 176 ± 138 mg/l vs. 116 ± 103 mg/l; P = 0.042), lymphocyte count (0.8 ± 0.5 × 109/l vs. 1.2 ± 0.7 × 109/l; P < 0.0001) and NLCR (20.9 ± 13.3 vs. 13.2 ± 14.1; P < 0.0001) but not regarding WBC count and neutrophil count. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were highest for the NLCR (77.2%, 63.0%, 67.6% and 73.4%, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was highest for the lymphocyte count (0.73; confidence interval: 0.66 to 0.80) and the NLCR (0.73; 0.66 to 0.81).

Conclusions

In an emergency care setting, both lymphocytopenia and NLCR are better predictors of bacteremia than routine parameters like CRP level, WBC count and neutrophil count. Attention to these markers is easy to integrate in daily practice and without extra costs.

### Dimethyl fumarate (tecfidera) [^111y7pmG]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.4 Lymphopenia

TECFIDERA may decrease lymphocyte counts. In the MS placebo controlled trials, mean lymphocyte counts decreased by approximately 30% during the first year of treatment with TECFIDERA and then remained stable. Four weeks after stopping TECFIDERA, mean lymphocyte counts increased but did not return to baseline. Six percent (6%) of TECFIDERA patients and < 1% of placebo patients experienced lymphocyte counts < 0.5x109/L (lower limit of normal 0.91x109/L). The incidence of infections (60% vs 58%) and serious infections (2% vs 2%) was similar in patients treated with TECFIDERA or placebo, respectively. There was no increased incidence of serious infections observed in patients with lymphocyte counts < 0.8x109/L or ≤ 0.5x109/L in controlled trials, although one patient in an extension study developed PML in the setting of prolonged lymphopenia (lymphocyte counts predominantly < 0.5x109/L for 3.5 years) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

In controlled and uncontrolled clinical trials, 2% of patients experienced prolonged, severe lymphopenia, (defined as lymphocyte counts < 0.5 x 109/L for at least six months); in this group of patients, the majority of lymphocyte counts remained < 0.5x109/L with continued therapy. In these patients with prolonged, severe lymphopenia, the median time for lymphocyte counts to return to normal after discontinuing TECFIDERA was 96.0 weeks.

### Lymphocytopenia and neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio predict bacteremia better than conventional infection markers in an emergency care unit [^111KuVwc]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bacteremia is associated with a mortality rate as high as 30%. Early and accurate recognition of bacterial infections is essential for the treatment and prognosis of medical emergency admissions. Traditional infection markers such as the white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil count and C-reactive protein (CRP) level are of limited value in the early detection of community-acquired bacteremia. The search therefore continues for additional infection markers that may facilitate the prediction of bacteremia. Although new markers (for example, procalcitonin and pro-adrenomedullin) are being evaluated, the swift implementation of these markers is hampered by validation, costs and accessibility.

Absolute lymphocytopenia (lymphocyte count < 1.0 × 10 9 /l) in the course of the immune response to systemic infection is a relatively unknown phenomenon to physicians. Nevertheless, recent studies combining traditional infection markers and the lymphocyte count showed the additional value of the latter in predicting bacteremia. Initially, lymphocytopenia has been described in case reports concerning infectious emergencies such as toxic shock syndrome. Later, Zahorec demonstrated in a prospective longitudinal observational study the correlation between the severity of the clinical course and lymphocytopenia in patients treated for severe sepsis and septic shock in an oncologic intensive care unit (ICU). Hawkins and colleagues described persistent B-cell and T-cell lymphocytopenia in a cohort of 21 patients with Gram-positive and gram-negative bacteremia. Also recently, Wyllie and colleagues demonstrated in two studies the clinical usefulness of lymphocytopenia in predicting bacteremia in patients with emergency medical admissions, meriting further investigation into this topic.

### Role of platelet-to-lymphocyte count ratio (PLR), as a prognostic indicator in COVID-19: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115v1kEK]. Journal of Medical Virology (2022). Medium credibility.

Prognostic predictors are of paramount interest for prompt intervention and optimal utilization of the healthcare system in the ongoing context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The platelet-to-lymphocyte count ratio (PLR), has emerged as a potential tool for risk stratification of critically ill patients with sepsis. The current systematic review explores the utility of PLR as a prognostic predictor of COVID-19 patients. We screened the electronic databases until May 15, 2021 after enrolling in PROSPERO (CRD42021220269). Studies evaluating the association between PLR on admission and outcomes in terms of mortality and severity among COVID-19 patients were included. We retrieved 32 studies, with a total of 2768 and 3262 COVID-19 patients for mortality and disease severity outcomes. Deceased and critically ill patients had higher PLR levels on admission in comparison to survivors and non-severe patients (mean differences [MD] = 66.10; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 47.75–84.44; p < 0.00001 and MD = 86.74; 95% CI: 67.7–105.7; p < 0.00001, respectively). A higher level of PLR on admission in COVID-19 patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, the evidence is of low quality and further studies regarding the cut-off value of PLR are the need of the hour.

### The search for a predictor of CD4 cell count continues: total lymphocyte count is not a substitute for CD4 cell count in the management of HIV-infected individuals in a resource-limited setting [^115KCsPq]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Total lymphocyte count (TLC) has been recommended as a substitute for CD4 cell count for the management of HIV-infected individuals living in resource-limited settings. To confirm this, 151 TLCs and CD4 cell counts were obtained from 109 patients who had not yet started treatment and analyzed. CD4 cell counts of < 200 cells/mm3 were found in 42 cases (37.8%) with TLCs of ≥ 1200 cells/mm3. Thus, 1 in 3 individuals would have been deprived of needed treatment. Therefore, in this setting, TLC is not a reliable predictor of CD4 cell count in HIV-infected individuals.

### Early changes within the lymphocyte population are associated with the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in trauma patients [^114qqYNt]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

In contrast, γδ-low T lymphocytes are predominantly tissue-resident and make up < 5% of the circulating T cell population in humans. Their presence in blood, likely reflects migration. They are regarded as cytoprotective, therefore the association between low concentrations of these cells and the development of MODS is novel and may be important. Only one previous study has examined γδ T cells in human trauma patients (n = 7); this reported a fall around 72 h, which was attributed to apoptosis. More recently, a murine study has demonstrated that γδ T cells regulate immune cell infiltration of lung tissue, which may influence acute lung injury. There are large gaps in our understanding of the immediate post-injury cellular immune response and detailed immunological studies at this pivotal time period are required.

Lymphopenia after trauma has been associated with mortality but the association with MODS is a new finding. Although ISS and BD are highlighted in the regression analysis as key risk factors for MODS development, the 48-h lymphocyte count is the strongest predictor of the included variables. In addition, patients with a very low lymphocyte count ≤ 0.5 × 10 9 /L at 48 h have a mortality rate of 45%. This suggests that lymphocyte-related events within the first 48 h are critical to recovery. Lymphopenia is widely attributed to infection-induced apoptosis but this study challenges that assumption as lymphopenia developed within 24 h, several days before the onset of clinical infection. Although not currently considered to be of clinical relevance, this study suggests that lymphocyte count at 48 h could be an early indicator of poor prognosis. The findings strengthen the evidence that lymphopenia may be involved in the pathogenesis of adverse outcome and that restoration of lymphocyte count may be essential to recovery.

### Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia [^112vVCye]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

A severe decrease of CD4 T cells predisposes humans to opportunistic infections. In adults, HIV is certainly the most common cause of CD4 lymphocytopenia, but other causes, such as infections, autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressive therapy, lymphoma and idiopathic forms need to be considered. This review summarizes the current knowledge of the poorly understood syndrome of idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia.

Recent Findings

Little research has tried to systematically dissect this probably heterogeneic syndrome after its initial description in 1992. Numerous cases presenting with opportunistic infections have been reported. Disturbed differentiation of stem cell precursors may contribute to CD4 lymphocytopenia. Because infections and lymphoma may also cause CD4 lymphocytopenia, the distinction between cause and effect may evolve only during follow-up.

Summary

The manifestation of opportunistic infections calls for the evaluation of the immune system for CD4 lymphocytopenia. The differential diagnosis of this condition in adults comprises primarily HIV infection and less often other diseases or drugs. Idiopathic CD4 lymphocytopenia is very rare. The clinical significance of low CD4 cell counts in HIV negative patients still awaits its systematic analysis. Prophylaxis of opportunistic infections is oriented at the recommendations of HIV-infected individuals and causal treatment remains experimental.

### Lymphocytopenia and neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio predict bacteremia better than conventional infection markers in an emergency care unit [^111emYX7]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

In a prospective study, Zahorec observed lymphocytopenia in 89/90 oncological ICU patients following major surgery, sepsis and septic shock. Moreover, there was a correlation between the severity of the clinical course and the extent of lymphocytopenia. Later, Wyllie and colleagues highlighted the clinical usefulness of lymphocytopenia as a diagnostic marker of bacteremia in adult medical emergency admissions. On multivariate analysis, the lymphocyte count was strongly associated with bacteremia. In a follow-up study, Wyllie and colleagues showed that CRP alone performed no better in bacteremia prediction than either a model combining lymphocytopenia and neutrophilia, or lymphocytopenia alone. Extrapolation of these data to the emergency care unit setting is hampered, however, by the fact that in both studies admissions to the ward were included, while admission cultures were defined as those taken in the first 2 days of admission. In our study, we exclusively investigated infection markers and blood cultures obtained during the observation period in the ED. Moreover, we used an age-matched and gender-matched control group since lymphocyte counts may gradually decline as normal adults age. Our observations clearly show that lymphocytopenia performs better in predicting bacteremia in an emergency care setting than either the WBC count, neutrophil count or CRP level, with the PPVs and NPVs of lymphocytopenia outweighing predictive values of standard laboratory parameters. Absolute lymphocyte counts are readily available, making it possible to incorporate this marker in clinical decision-making. In this context, whether lymphocytopenia could add to the performance of well-accepted severity-of-illness scores would be of interest to study.

### Host response changes and their association with mortality in COVID-19 patients with lymphopenia [^1123WG2r]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Lymphopenia in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with increased mortality. Objectives: To explore the association between lymphopenia, host response aberrations, and mortality in patients with lymphopenic COVID-19. Methods: We determined 43 plasma biomarkers reflective of four pathophysiological domains: endothelial cell and coagulation activation, inflammation and organ damage, cytokine release, and chemokine release. We explored if decreased concentrations of lymphocyte-derived proteins in patients with lymphopenia were associated with an increase in mortality. We sought to identify host response phenotypes in patients with lymphopenia by cluster analysis of plasma biomarkers. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 439 general ward patients with COVID-19 were stratified by baseline lymphocyte counts: normal (> 1.0×10 9 /L; n = 167), mild lymphopenia (> 0.5 to ≤ 1.0×10 9 /L; n = 194), and severe lymphopenia (≤ 0.5×10 9 /L; n = 78). Lymphopenia was associated with alterations in each host response domain. Lymphopenia was associated with increased mortality. Moreover, in patients with lymphopenia (n = 272), decreased concentrations of several lymphocyte-derived proteins (e.g. CCL5, IL-4, IL-13, IL-17A) were associated with an increase in mortality (at P < 0.01 or stronger significance levels). A cluster analysis revealed three host response phenotypes in patients with lymphopenia: "hyporesponsive" (23.2%), "hypercytokinemic" (36.4%), and "inflammatory-injurious" (40.4%), with substantially differing mortality rates of 9.5%, 5.1%, and 26.4%, respectively. A 10-biomarker model accurately predicted these host response phenotypes in an external cohort with similar mortality distribution. The inflammatory-injurious phenotype showed a remarkable combination of relatively high inflammation and organ damage markers with high antiinflammatory cytokine levels yet low proinflammatory cytokine levels. Conclusions: Lymphopenia in COVID-19 signifies a heterogenous group of patients with distinct host response features. Specific host responses contribute to lymphopenia-associated mortality in COVID-19, including reduced CCL5 levels.

### Down to a T: the functional importance of lymphopenia in severe COVID-19 [^113z3i4m]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The emergence of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019 has led to a pandemic that has had widespread detrimental effects on populations globally. Ample evidence now supports that immunopathology associated with severe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) relates to a key role for inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor α) and IL-6 that are augmented systemically as part of a "cytokine storm" and can be targeted by immunomodulatory therapies, including dexamethasone and JAK (Janus kinase)-inhibitors.

From the very earliest case series emerging from Wuhan, it became clear that reduced circulating lymphocyte numbers (lymphopenia) was a hallmark feature of severe hospitalized COVID-19 cases. More recently, this abnormality has been shown to correlate with hyperinflammation and adverse disease outcomes, including requirement for invasive ventilation and mortality. Lymphopenia has been recognized for many years to be a feature in a range of severe viral infections, but the mechanisms driving this abnormality, particularly in the context of SARS-COV-2, are poorly understood. Recent studies have elucidated that SARS-CoV-2–associated lymphopenia may be related to a dysregulation of T-cell homeostasis, but the precise mechanism governing this alteration and relationships to disease severity are unknown. A better understanding of these mechanisms is key to facilitating new therapies to target these abnormalities and improve outcomes.

### Analysis of absolute lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19 [^116QEMG2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Symptoms of COVID-19 vary in severity and presentation. When admitting patients to the hospital, it is desirable to isolate patients with COVID-19 from those without the disease. However, reliably identifying patients with COVID-19 in the emergency department before hospital admission is often limited by the speed and availability of testing. Previous studies determined a low lymphocyte count is commonly found in patients with COVID-19. We sought to explore the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients presenting to the emergency department requiring subsequent hospitalization who were found to have COVID-19.

Methods

A retrospective chart review was performed on 312 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who were admitted to the hospital from the emergency department. The absolute lymphocyte count for these patients was used to calculate sensitivities at various cut-off values. The relationships between absolute lymphocyte count and variables, including age, sex, need for intubation, and mortality, were also explored.

Results

Cut-off values for absolute lymphocyte count ranged from 1.1 K/uL to 2.0 K/uL, with sensitivities of 72% and 94%, respectively. Additionally, lower mean absolute lymphocyte counts were identified in males, patients who required intubation, and patients who died.

Conclusion

Knowing the sensitivity of absolute lymphocyte count in patients with COVID-19 may help identify patients who are unlikely to have the disease. Additionally, absolute lymphocyte count can be used as a marker of disease severity in patients with COVID-19.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^1116Pm3M]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

It should be noted that some studies demonstrated no significant correlation between persistent lymphopenia and the incidence of hospital-acquired infections in critically ill patients. Conversely, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte count ratio and the IL-10-to-lymphocyte count ratio offer a more reliable reflection of the severity of sepsis. Additionally, investigations into subpopulations of lymphocytes have furnished valuable insights, wherein specific subsets of T and B lymphocytes displayed variations associated with the gravity of sepsis. For instance, CD3 + T lymphocyte counts manifested a decreasing trend in patients with early clinical deterioration (0.5 × 10⁹/L ± 0.5 versus 0.7 × 10⁹/L ± 0.5, p = 0.06). Although changes in B cells were not as pronounced as those in T cells, there was a significant reduction in CD19 + CD23 + B cells at admission in septic shock patients, followed by a marked augmentation in survivors, implying these cells potentially harbor significant prognostic value.

Impact on mortality

Numerous studies have affirmed a significant correlation between the degree of lymphopenia within 28 days and the incidence of hospital-acquired infections and mortality. There is a link between the failure to normalize lymphocyte levels post-trauma and higher mortality. In parallel, a sustained decline in lymphocyte levels after sepsis diagnosis, mainly due to T-cell reduction, is associated with increased mortality. In septic patients, a notable reduction in γδ T-cell numbers in the intestinal mucosa compared to healthy controls is linked to increased disease severity and higher mortality rates. A recent study revealed that children with severe sepsis and persistent lymphopenia face higher risks of multi-organ dysfunction syndrome or death in pediatric intensive care units, with the lymphopenia persisting as a composite outcome odds ratio of 2.98 (95% CI [1.85–4.02]; p < 0.01). Specific research further delineates that a severe T-cell reduction can only serve as a prognostic marker for immune suppression when accompanied by a high proportion of circulating immature granulocytes, attributable to the enhanced T-cell apoptosis mediated by MDSC present in immature granulocytes.

### Dimethyl fumarate (tecfidera) [^112gmNu4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

In these controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, among patients who did not experience prolonged, severe lymphopenia during treatment, the median times for lymphocyte counts to return to normal after discontinuing TECFIDERA were as follows:

4.3 weeks in patients with mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count ≥ 0.8x109/L) at discontinuation,
10.0 weeks in patients with moderate lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0.5 to < 0.8x109/L) at discontinuation, and
16.7 weeks in patients with severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 0.5x109/L) at discontinuation.

TECFIDERA has not been studied in patients with pre-existing low lymphocyte counts.

Obtain a CBC, including lymphocyte count, before initiating treatment with TECFIDERA, 6 months after starting treatment, and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Consider interruption of TECFIDERA in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.5 x 109/L persisting for more than six months. Given the potential for delayed recovery of lymphocyte counts, continue to obtain lymphocyte counts until their recovery if TECFIDERA is discontinued or interrupted due to lymphopenia. Consider withholding treatment from patients with serious infections until resolution. Decisions about whether or not to restart TECFIDERA should be individualized based on clinical circumstances.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^111t6zFG]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

In a retrospective study that included 77 sepsis and 23 non-sepsis adult patients, the daily lymphocyte count of the patients was calculated until discharge or death. Lymphocytes exhibited a high diagnosis of sepsis with an area under the curve value of 0.971 (95% CI = 0.916–0.994). The diagnostic efficacy of lymphocytes was more significant than other biomarkers, such as white blood cells, neutrophil count, and procalcitonin. The results also showed that the 28-day mortality rate was 39.66% in patients with persistent lymphocyte counts below 0.76 × 10⁹/L, significantly higher than in patients without persistent lymphopenia. ALC is a promising, low-cost, rapid, and readily available biomarker for diagnosing sepsis. High vigilance is required for sepsis when a non-viral infection is suspected and lymphopenia levels are below the optimal threshold (0.76 × 10⁹/L) value. In another single-center retrospective cohort study of 335 adult patients with bacteremia and sepsis, complete blood cell counts were recorded for the first four days following the diagnosis of sepsis. On Day 4, the median ALC was significantly higher in survivors than in nonsurvivors (1.1 × 10³ cells/µl [IQR 0.7, 1.5] vs. 0.7 × 10³ cells/µl [IQR 0.5, 1.0]). ALC was also found to be independently associated with 28-day survival (adjusted OR 0.68 [95% CI 0.51, 0.91]) and 1-year survival (adjusted OR 0.74 [95% CI 0.59, 0.93]). Thus, persistent lymphopenia on the fourth day after sepsis diagnosis predicts early and late mortality and may serve as a biomarker for sepsis-induced immunosuppression.

### Advocating for the recognition of underlying immunosuppression in critical illness [^111QRToi]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Duration, monitoring and managing prolonged immunosuppression in the ICU

Duration of immunosuppression is an essential determinant of the risk of infections in critically ill patients. Several clinical studies have documented that among neutropenic patients, the highest risk of life-threatening infections is seen in those having both a profound (< 500 neutrophils/μl, or even < 100 neutrophils/μl according to the IDSA guidelines) and prolonged (> 7 days) neutropenia. In patients receiving glucocorticosteroids, a meta-analysis from 71 controlled clinical trials has documented that the incidence of infections increases with the daily and cumulative doses received, suggesting that the duration of exposure to these drugs impacts the risk of infectious complications. In the ICU setting, the risk of infection also seems to increase with time, both among patients with overt conditions associated with an immunosuppressive phenotype and in patients with 'injury-associated acquired immunosuppression. This implies that clinicians should consider the type, severity, and duration of immunosuppression when evaluating their patients' infection risk.

Several studies have demonstrated a strong link between immune alterations and an increased risk of infections in ICU patients. Quantitative alterations, such as lymphopenia and decreased CD4 counts, as well as functional impairments in T-cell response, are frequently observed in critically ill patients and have been associated with a heightened susceptibility to opportunistic infections. For instance, research has shown that ICU patients with profound lymphopenia — sometimes reaching levels comparable to advanced stages of HIV/AIDS — are more likely to experience infections caused by opportunistic pathogens, highlighting the impact of immune dysfunction on infection risk. Functional immune testing, including measures of T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, has also been shown to predict the development of infections in critically ill patients. These alterations can impair the patient's ability to mount an adequate immune response, leading to increased vulnerability to both nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that the severity of immune suppression, whether resulting from underlying conditions or acquired during ICU admission, correlates with worse infection outcomes, including longer hospital stays and increased mortality. By incorporating these findings, the argument that understanding immune dysfunction — both quantitative and qualitative — is crucial for managing infection risk in the ICU. This underscores the need for a more precise and dynamic approach to grading immunosuppression in critically ill patients.

### Primary immunodeficiency or not? Making the correct diagnosis [^115jF5Sz]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

Making a correct diagnosis of a primary immunodeficiency disease is crucial for the selection of proper therapy. Although many cases go undiagnosed, there are also many instances of incorrect diagnosis that result in years of inappropriate treatment and failure to implement beneficial treatment. This article summarizes 2 actual cases in which incorrect diagnoses led to recommendations of unwarranted high-risk or costly treatments. Had the physicians chosen tests of immune function rather than relying on immunoglobulin levels or cell counts, they would have arrived at the true diagnoses.

### Ozanimod hydrochloride (Zeposia) [^1164RMsx]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Risk of Infections

ZEPOSIA causes a mean reduction in peripheral blood lymphocyte count to approximately 45% of baseline values because of reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. ZEPOSIA may therefore increase the susceptibility to infections, some serious in nature. Life-threatening and rare fatal infections have occurred in patients receiving ZEPOSIA.

Obtain a recent (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior MS or UC therapy) complete blood count (CBC) including lymphocyte count before initiation of ZEPOSIA.

Delay initiation of ZEPOSIA in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved.

In MS Study 1 and Study 2, the overall rate of infections and rate of serious infections in patients treated with ZEPOSIA were similar to that in patients who received interferon (IFN) beta-1a (35% vs. 34% and 1% vs. 0.8%, respectively). In UC Study 1 and Study 3, the overall rate of infections and rate of serious infections in patients treated with ZEPOSIA were similar to that in patients who received placebo (9.9% vs. 10.7% and 0.8% vs. 0.4%, respectively). In UC Study 2, the overall rate of infections in patients treated with ZEPOSIA was higher than in patients treated with placebo (23% vs. 12%) and the rate of serious infections was similar (0.9% vs. 1.8%).

### Risk factors and predicting nomogram for the clinical deterioration of non-severe community-acquired pneumonia [^115tf2Gh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

LYM ≤ 1.3 × 10 9 /L was discovered to be a risk factor for the clinical deterioration of non-severe CAP in this study, indicating the significance of focusing on patients with low LYM or lymphopenia. Lymphopenia may signify an imbalance in the host's immune response to infection, leading to a relatively immunosuppressive state for patients. Cilloniz et al. reported a specific immunophenotype of CAP, termed lymphopenic (< 724 lymphocytes/mm 3) CAP (L-CAP), characterized by a decrease in CD4 + T lymphocytes, an increased inflammatory response, and a poorer prognosis. However, due to missing data, we were unable to analyze cytokines and lymphocyte subsets in patients. Previous studies have demonstrated that a low lymphocyte count (1–2 × 10 9 /L) is associated with increased short-term and long-term mortality, and lymphopenia has been identified as a risk factor for the severity and poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Serum LDH > 234 U/L was identified as another risk factor for the development of progressive CAP. Previous literature suggested that serum LDH was associated with severity and poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. However, it was reported that LDH may not be useful in determining the severity of CAP, possibly due to medical advances. Furthermore, a D- dimer level > 0.8 mg/L was found to be a risk factor for progressive CAP. The elevation of D-dimer in CAP is not fully understood. A meta-analysis indicated that elevated D-dimer levels were associated with CAP severity, pulmonary embolism (PE) occurrence and mortality.

The study had several limitations. First, it was a single-center retrospective study, and while internal verification was performed, the generalizability of the research findings to other hospitals remains uncertain. The presence of missing data resulted in the exclusion of variables with a significant number of missing values, which may be meaningful for the research results. Secondly, converting a numerical variable into a dichotomous variable through a straightforward transformation hinders the ability to obtain additional information. For example, it was not possible to ascertain the relationship between low body temperature and clinical deterioration or to establish a positive correlation between LDH levels and the risk of clinical deterioration in study. Furthermore, the study only provided a brief summary of imaging manifestations, which may have contributed to the absence of imaging features in the identified risk factors. Finally, the study did not conduct a detailed stratification of the degree of clinical deterioration, making it challenging to identify patients requiring urgent attention.

### Can routine laboratory tests discriminate between severe acute respiratory syndrome and other causes of community-acquired pneumonia? [^112S4QD5]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical presentation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resembles that of other etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia, making diagnosis difficult. Hematological and biochemical abnormalities, particularly lymphopenia, are common in patients with SARS.

Methods

With the use of 2 databases, we compared the ability of the absolute lymphocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, lactate dehydrogenase level, creatine kinase level, alanine aminotransferase level, and serum calcium level at hospital admission to discriminate between cases of SARS and cases of community-acquired pneumonia. The SARS database contained data for 144 patients with SARS from the 2003 Toronto SARS outbreak. The community-acquired pneumonia database contained data for 8044 patients with community-acquired pneumonia from Edmonton, Canada. Patients from the SARS database were matched to patients from the community-acquired pneumonia database according to age, and receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed for each laboratory variable.

Results

The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) demonstrated fair to poor discriminatory ability for all laboratory variables tested except absolute neutrophil count, which had an AUC of 0.80, indicating good discriminatory ability (although there was no cutoff value of the absolute neutrophil count at which reasonable sensitivity or specificity could be obtained). Combinations of any 2 tests did not perform significantly better than did the absolute neutrophil count alone.

Conclusions

Routine laboratory tests, including determination of absolute lymphocyte count, should not be used in the diagnosis of SARS or incorporated into current case definitions of SARS. The role of the absolute neutrophil count in SARS diagnosis is likely limited, but it should be assessed further.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^114SvMrj]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnosis — bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL): For patients with suspected HP who have a compelling exposure history within the appropriate clinical context and a chest HRCT pattern typical for HP, we suggest not routinely using BAL fluid analysis to confirm a diagnosis of HP (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). BAL fluid analysis can narrow the differential diagnosis by excluding competing causes, particularly in nonfibrotic HP (eg, infection), but in patients with a high pretest probability of HP, the BAL cellular differential generally does not significantly alter the post-test probability and as a result adds little additional diagnostic information. In the appropriate clinical context, a history of clinically relevant exposure to a compelling IA with a typical high-resolution CT pattern allows for a confident diagnosis of HP. Lymphocytic alveolitis is not consistently present in patients with fibrotic HP, and BAL fluid lymphocytosis is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of fibrotic HP; however, BAL fluid lymphocytosis may increase diagnostic confidence when the IA is identified and HRCT findings are compatible with HP and should be considered when the exposure history and imaging data are discordant, and may exclude common alternative diagnoses, such as IPF, when the lymphocyte differential count is high (eg, ≥ 40%).

### Why does my patient have leukocytosis? [^113Y9xBJ]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Leukocytosis is one of the most common laboratory abnormalities in medicine, and one of the most frequent reasons for hematologic consultation. Effective evaluation of leukocytosis requires an attentive history, careful physical examination, meticulous review of the complete blood count and peripheral blood smear, judicious application of laboratory and radiologic testing, and thoughtful analysis. Definitive diagnosis may require bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, imaging studies, and specialized molecular tests. The differential diagnosis of leukocytosis includes physiologic responses to a broad range of infectious and inflammatory processes, as well as numerous primary hematologic disorders such as leukemias, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^111cLhuZ]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The Study

We searched 3 major databases — MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) — for clinical studies published December 1, 2019, through March 28, 2020. To broadly identify studies detailing lymphocyte and leukocyte testing among patients with COVID-19, we used the following search criteria: "(COVID-19 OR SARS-CoV-2 OR 2019-NCoV OR HCov-19 OR novel coronavirus) AND (laboratory OR WBC OR lymphocyte)". We prioritized studies that measured lymphocyte and leukocyte counts among patients who had severe or critical cases versus those with mild cases. Severe cases were defined as significant respiratory distress (acute hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission) caused by COVID-19.

Our meta-analysis included articles about studies and clinical trials that met the following 4 inclusion criteria: 1) involved adult, human patients; 2) written in English; 3) reported lymphocyte and leukocyte counts for patients; and 4) compared patients with severe versus mild illness. Our meta-analysis excluded articles about studies with the following 9 characteristics: 1) involved nonhuman subjects; 2) written in a language other than English; 3) were not a clinical trial, such as a review paper or letter; 4) were out of the scope of the study question detailed above; 5) did not provide raw data to perform quantitative meta-analysis; 6) involved pediatric patients; 7) did not have the full article available; 8) were duplicates; and 9) were ongoing or not completed.

McKinlay, M. D. Numerous reports are found in medical literature describing groups of cases which, on account of clinical features and blood cell changes, have been thought to be similar to and often confused with acute leukemia. Naegeli1 mentions cases of sepsis with low total leukocyte counts and relative increase in the lymphocytes, and also acute febrile affections with high absolute lymphocyte counts with atypical forms. It is pointed out that this lymphatic reaction is more confusing where there is also an absolute lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes. Further, with a clinical picture of fever, prostration and enlargement of lymph nodes and spleen, it may be impossible to differentiate these cases from leukemia until recovery occurs.

### Immune cell composition and its impact on prognosis in children with sepsis [^116j57rB]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Increasing evidence indicates that lymphocytopenia, which involves the depletion of T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells, frequently occurs during sepsis, ultimately leading to immune paralysis. Clinical studies examining lymphocyte counts have revealed that this decrease not only occurs at sepsis onset but also persists at a low level for up to 28 days. Drewry et al. conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study to assess whether sustained lymphocytopenia following sepsis diagnosis is a predictor of inpatient mortality. The findings demonstrated significantly lower lymphocyte counts on the 4th day postdiagnosis among nonsurvivors than among survivors. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the absolute lymphocyte count on the 4th day was independently correlated with 28-day mortality (adjusted OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51–0.91) and 1-year mortality (adjusted OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.59–0.93). Inflammation and coagulation dysfunction are key contributors to organ damage in sepsis, with platelets playing a pivotal role in both processes. Thrombocytopenia is common in PICU wards and serves as a reliable predictor of poor prognosis in sepsis patients. The emergence of thrombocytopenia in sepsis is linked to various factors, including decreased platelet production, blood dilution, platelet-leukocyte aggregation, immune-mediated platelet destruction, drug-induced thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.

### Early decrease in blood lymphocyte count is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^116TG2K5]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In the early stage, lymphocyte count can dynamically reflect the pathophysiological changes in COVID-19 patients. An early decrease in lymphocyte count is associated with mortality in COVID-19 patients. This finding may indicate that COVID-19 patients with decreased lymphocytes after admission need more attention.

### Lymphopenia is associated with broad host response aberrations in community-acquired pneumonia [^111TJBNC]. The Journal of Infection (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Lymphopenia at hospital admission occurs in over one-third of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), yet its clinical relevance and pathophysiological implications remain underexplored. We evaluated outcomes and immune features of patients with lymphopenic CAP (L-CAP), a previously described immunophenotype characterized by admission lymphocyte count < 0.724 × 10 9 cells/L.

Methods

Observational study in 149 patients admitted to a general ward for CAP. We measured 34 plasma biomarkers reflective of inflammation, endothelial cell responses, coagulation, and immune checkpoints. We characterized lymphocyte phenotypes in 29 patients using spectral flow cytometry.

Results

L-CAP occurred in 45 patients (30.2%) and was associated with prolonged time-to-clinical-stability (median 5 versus 3 days), also when we accounted for competing events for reaching clinical stability and adjusted for baseline covariates (subdistribution hazard ratio 0.63; 95% confidence interval 0.45–0.88). L-CAP patients demonstrated a proportional depletion of CD4 T follicular helper cells, CD4 T effector memory cells, naïve CD8 T cells and IgG+ B cells. Plasma biomarker analyses indicated increased activation of the cytokine network and the vascular endothelium in L-CAP.

Conclusions

L-CAP patients have a protracted clinical recovery course and a more broadly dysregulated host response. These findings highlight the prognostic and pathophysiological relevance of admission lymphopenia in patients with CAP.

### Haematological manifestations of lupus [^114WQQA7]. Lupus Science & Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Clinical presentation

Presence of lymphopenia may be clinically silent or associated with increased risk of infections and/or active SLE. Data on the increased risk of infection are controversial and are complicated by the use of immunosuppressive therapies. Ethnicity may also play a role in explaining the conflicting results.

Life-table analysis of patients in the Netherlands from 1991 showed no effect of lymphopenia on patient survival. In contrast, marked T cell depletion was associated with serious and often multiple infections in severely affected patients with SLE in India. However, high-dose glucocorticoids and cyclophosphamide use make these latter results difficult to interpret. One study found the combination of severe lymphopenia, values < 0.35×10 9 /L, and immunosuppressive therapy increases risk of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Nonetheless, Ginzler's summary of the literature supports the premise that SLE is associated with increased infections even in the absence of immunosuppressive drugs. Most studies have generally found that increased disease activity associates with increased risk of infections. Uraemia and immunological dysfunction are considered the major risk factors for infection. Lymphopenia, especially affecting T cells, likely contributes to this dysfunction.

Some authors, but not all, have shown that lymphopenia correlates with disease activity. Fever, polyarthritis, as well as central and peripheral nervous system disease, in particular, are associated with lymphopenia. Development of lymphopenia during the course of disease is frequently associated with disease relapse. Mirzyan et al, in their prospective study to characterise prognostic parameters for SLE disease flares, concluded lymphopenia to be one of the predictors of flares. The authors evaluated 120 patients every three months for 2 years. At every visit, clinical manifestation and laboratory parameters were assessed and systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) was determined. All patients were in clinical remission at enrolment. The authors conclusively stated that flares in SLE could be predicted by lymphopenia. Lymphocyte counts also frequently rose with disease remission. Therefore, lymphopenia may have prognostic significance.

### Early decrease in blood lymphocyte count is associated with poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients: a retrospective cohort study [^1133uSTf]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study investigated the trends of lymphocyte count during the progression of the disease in COVID-19 patients. It was found that lymphocytes declined over time in non-survivors and increased in survivors in the early hospitalization stage. Within 10 days after admission, the difference in lymphocyte count between the two groups increases by 0.0731 × 10 9 /L per day.

Many studies have explored the correlation between lymphocytes and COVID-19 hospitalization outcomes. Xiong et al. have indicated that COVID-19 patients, particularly in severe cases, tend to have a lower count of lymphocytes. Furthermore, Niu et al. suggested that decreased lymphocyte count in hospitalized COVID-19 patients is independently associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality. Some researchers have even found that the ratio of neutrophil count to lymphocyte count (NLR) can serve as a predictive factor for COVID-19 hospital death. However, these studies only focused on the correlation between baseline lymphocyte count (lymphocyte count at admission) and hospitalization outcomes. Yet, clinicians are more concerned about changes in lymphocyte count after hospitalization, as changes in test results may indicate whether the patient has improved after treatment. Our studies have observed the trends in lymphocyte counts over time in survivors and non-survivors of COVID-19, which could reflect the changes in patients' conditions. Therefore, compared to previous studies on the correlation between baseline lymphocyte count and prognosis in COVID-19 patients, our study can better reflect the survival probability of these patients after treatment. To our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the changes in lymphocyte counts over time among survival and non-survival patients with COVID-19.

### Preoperative albumin, transferrin, and total lymphocyte count as risk markers for postoperative complications after total joint arthroplasty: a systematic review [^112AMtA7]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Poor nutritional status before total joint arthroplasty (TJA) can lead to perioperative complications such as wound complications, infection, or even mortality. Despite general agreement with this statement, the primary metric by which malnutrition is demonstrated is less clear. Several laboratory markers have been suggested as indicative of poor nutritional status. Among these, the more commonly used markers are albumin, transferrin, and total lymphocyte count (TLC).

The purpose of this systematic review is to identify whether poor nutrition, as defined by low albumin, low transferrin, or low TLC, leads to more postoperative complications. We hypothesized that it may be possible to identify the levels of these laboratory values at which point TJA may be ill advised. To this end, we analyzed the available literature regarding links between these three variables on postoperative complications after TJA.

### A nomogram for predicting the risk of peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing peritoneal dialysis: model development and validation study [^112PzhUv]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Lymphocyte count serves as another important indicator of immune function. A decreased lymphocyte count is frequently observed in malnourished patients and is associated with increased susceptibility to infections, including PDAP. He et al. confirmed that decreased lymphocyte counts were linked to a higher risk of treatment failure in PDAP, emphasizing the critical role of lymphocytes in immune defense. In the context of PDAP, reduced lymphocyte levels not only directly impair immune function, but also indirectly affect peritoneal defense mechanisms through malnutrition, thereby increasing the risk of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis.

Serum potassium levels are often low in malnourished, a condition that frequently coexists with hypoproteinemia and anemia. Hypokalemia is associated with weakened intestinal peristalsis and the imbalance of intestinal flora, which can facilitate the translocation of bacteria into the abdominal cavity, thereby increasing the risk of PDAP. Liu D et al. reported a significant association between low serum potassium levels and PDAP occurrence. A meta-analysis also showed that hypokalemia increased the risk of PDAP, with a hazard ratio of 1.53 (95% CI: 1.23–1.88). These findings highlight the importance of maintaining appropriate serum potassium levels in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis to prevention infections.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^112dh6FY]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Heterogeneity

Aging is correlated with alterations in lymphocytes. In older individuals severely affected by sepsis, a pronounced decrease in lymphocytes, especially in T cells, is evident, with these reductions persisting over extended periods. In a study involving 2300 sepsis patients, 42.6% demonstrated enduring lymphopenia, primarily observed in elderly individuals who also presented a higher prevalence of chronic complications and elevated APACHE IV and SOFA scores. Further, elderly sepsis patients manifested exacerbated apoptosis and proliferative disturbances in CD4 + T cell subsets. Aging and nutritional changes could augment the effects of cellular apoptosis. Additionally, diminished TCR diversity, spurred by lymphopenia, aggravates immune aging, potentially escalating the readmission rates in elderly patients. Remarkably, similar trends of persistent lymphopenia and raised regulatory T cell frequencies have been noticed not only in the elderly but also in neonates with hospital-acquired sepsis and early clinical infections.

Different pathogens may induce diverse lymphopenic patterns. Numerous studies distinctively addressing bacterial and viral-induced sepsis have yielded results beneficial for precision therapy. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial infections can reduce B/T cells, albeit more pronounced in the former case. Prolonged lymphopenia was significantly associated with worse clinical prognoses in influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections but not other respiratory viruses. Moreover, extensive replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is conjectured to be a plausible cause of lymphopenia in COVID-19 patients, as high viral loads might diminish peripheral blood lymphocyte counts either by inducing more significant cell apoptosis or by prompting lymphocyte migration to infected tissues. The research also indicated a positive correlation between C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin levels with viral load and a negative correlation with lymphocyte count, suggesting that control of viral replication could ameliorate lymphopenia. This hints at the necessity of considering tissue infiltration effects in lymphocyte count evaluations and proposes the potential utility of CRP and ferritin as readily accessible clinical indicators to reflect the correlation between lymphocyte levels and specific viral loads. Research also highlights that host genetic variations might affect lymphocyte quantities. A broader discussion encompassing more heterogeneous evidence is underway.

The last decade has demonstrated how outwardly similar patients may have substantial underlying biological heterogeneity, even in acute illness syndromes such as SARS-CoV-2. Identifying biological subphenotypes of acute illness and understanding how those differences may inform selection of different therapies are key precision medicine research priorities in critical care. Although Michels and colleagues raise more questions than answers, this excellent study demonstrates how a precision medicine framework integrating clinical observations, molecular assays, and advanced data analyses can bring new insights into the immunology of severe infection.

### Etrasimod (Velsipity) [^114a9Wx6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Infections

Risk of Infections

VELSIPITY causes a mean reduction in peripheral blood lymphocyte count to approximately 45% of baseline values at Week 52 because of reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. VELSIPITY may, therefore, increase the susceptibility to infections. Life-threatening and rare fatal infections have been reported in association with other sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulators.

Before initiating treatment, obtain a recent (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior UC therapy) CBC, including lymphocyte count.

Delay initiation of VELSIPITY in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved.

In UC-1, the overall rate of infections in subjects treated with VELSIPITY was 24.9% compared to 22.2% in subjects who received placebo. In pooled data from UC-2 and UC-3, the overall rate of infections in subjects treated with VELSIPITY was 14.0% compared to 11.8% in subjects who received placebo. The most common infections were urinary tract infections and herpes viral infections in UC-1, and urinary tract infections in UC-2 and UC-3 [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

### T-cell lymphocytopenia: an omnipresent predictor of morbidity and mortality in consequence of SARS-CoV disease and influenza A infections [^111jNEte]. Cytokine (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of The Research

We proposed T-cell lymphocytopenia as a strategic predictor of serious coronavirus and influenza infections. Our preeminent goal was to determine whether a degree of T-cell lymphopenia would identify a distinct threshold cell count to differentiate between severe and non-severe infections. We codified an Index Severity Score to exploit an association between T-cell cytopenia and the grade of disease activity.

Principal Result

A T-cell count of 560 cells/uL or below signified a trend towards advanced disease.

### Factors associated with mortality in immunocompromised children with varicella [^112v9bGj]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

In this study, all patients who died had normal ANC with a low absolute lymphocyte count, resulting in a high NLR. Lymphocytes are a vital component of the immune system, categorized into T lymphocytes (T cells), B lymphocytes (B cells), and natural killer (NK) cells. T cells play a significant role in viral clearance, indicating that lymphopenia tends to delay viral clearance in favor of macrophage stimulation and the cytokine storm. This can affect the host's adaptive immune response, thereby impairing the body's ability to combat infections. Such impairment can increase the risk of developing opportunistic infections and unfavorable outcomes. The causes of lymphopenia in viral infections may involve mechanisms such as cell death, increased cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors; inhibition of lymphopoiesis; metabolic disturbances; and elevated glucocorticoid levels. NLR serves as a simple and easily calculable inflammatory biomarker derived from routine peripheral blood test results. It reflects the balance between neutrophils and lymphocytes in the bloodstream, providing insights into immune responses and inflammation. NLR may serve as informative biomarkers in patients with infection, indicating underlying immune (dys)function, particularly in peripheral blood. NLR demonstrated the potential clinical utility in several infectious diseases, such as pneumonia, pertussis, COVID-19, and urinary tract infection. The accessibility and affordability of these indices would render them especially beneficial for low- and middle-income countries. Our study showed the association between a high NLR ratio and the mortality in immunocompromised children with varicella. No research to date has established the NLR cutoff values that predict death in varicella patients; hence, additional rigorously designed studies are required to corroborate our findings.

HIV primary care — CD4 count interpretation emphasizes staging and percentage correlates: The initial CD4 cell count is used to stage HIV infection, establish the risk of specific HIV-associated complications, and determine the need for prophylaxis against opportunistic infections (OIs). Total CD4 counts of 200 and 500 cells/µL generally correspond to CD4 cell percentages of 14% and 29%, respectively. In children aged < 5 years, there is more variability in the absolute CD4 cell count; therefore, CD4 percentage is generally preferred for monitoring immune status.

### Use of total lymphocyte count for informing when to start antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected children: a meta-analysis of longitudinal data [^115fVuXm]. Lancet (2005). Excellent credibility.

Background

Total lymphocyte count has been proposed as an alternative to the percentage of CD4+ T-cells to indicate when antiretroviral therapy should be started in children with HIV in resource-poor settings. We aimed to assess thresholds of total lymphocyte count at which antiretroviral therapy should be considered, and compared monitoring of total lymphocyte count with monitoring of CD4-cell percentage.

Methods

Longitudinal data on 3917 children with HIV infection were pooled from observational and randomised studies in Europe and the USA. The 12-month risks of death and AIDS by most recent total lymphocyte count and age were estimated by parametric survival models, based on measurements before antiretroviral therapy or during zidovudine monotherapy. Risks were derived and compared at thresholds of total lymphocyte count and CD4-cell percentage for starting antiretroviral therapy recommended in WHO 2003 guidelines.

Findings

Total lymphocyte count was a powerful predictor of the risk of disease progression despite a weak correlation with CD4-cell percentage (r = 0.08–0.19 dependent on age). For children older than 2 years, the 12-month risk of death and AIDS increased sharply at values less than 1500–2000 cells per muL, with little trend at higher values. Younger children had higher risks and total lymphocyte count was less prognostic. Mortality risk was substantially higher at thresholds of total lymphocyte count recommended by WHO than at corresponding thresholds of CD4-cell percentage. When the markers were compared at the threshold values at which mortality risks were about equal, total lymphocyte count was as effective as CD4-cell percentage for identifying children before death, but resulted in an earlier start of antiretroviral therapy.

Interpretation

In this population, total lymphocyte count was a strong predictor of short-term disease progression, being only marginally less predictive than CD4-cell percentage. Confirmatory studies in resource-poor settings are needed to identify the most cost-effective markers to guide initiation of antiretroviral therapy.

### Siponimod (Mayzent) [^112FUskC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Infections

Risk of Infections

MAYZENT causes a dose-dependent reduction in peripheral lymphocyte count to 20% to 30% of baseline values because of reversible sequestration of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. MAYZENT may therefore increase the risk of infections, some serious in nature [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Life-threatening and rare fatal infections have occurred in association with MAYZENT.

In Study 1 [see Clinical Studies (14)], the overall rate of infections was comparable between the MAYZENT-treated patients and those on placebo (49.0% vs. 49.1%, respectively). However, herpes zoster, herpes infection, bronchitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, and fungal skin infection were more common in MAYZENT-treated patients. In Study 1, serious infections occurred at a rate of 2.9% in MAYZENT-treated patients compared to 2.5% of patients receiving placebo.

Before initiating treatment with MAYZENT, results from a recent CBC (i.e., within 6 months or after discontinuation of prior therapy) should be reviewed.

Initiation of treatment with MAYZENT should be delayed in patients with severe active infection until resolution. Because residual pharmacodynamic effects, such as lowering effects on peripheral lymphocyte count, may persist for up to 3 to 4 weeks after discontinuation of MAYZENT, vigilance for infection should be continued throughout this period [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)].

### The elevated preoperative platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts poor prognosis in breast cancer patients [^113yveLG]. British Journal of Cancer (2014). Low credibility.

Major strengths of our study include the relatively large sample size and the narrow time frame for blood collection within 3 days before surgery excluding possible clinically significant infections.

However, as with all retrospective studies, limitations of our study are inherent to its design including the retrospective data collection. In addition, it has to be taken into account that lymphocyte and platelet counts may be influenced by several other conditions or factors. Increased platelet counts are often caused by inflammatory diseases, such as connective tissue disorders, medication, bacterial diseases, or viral infections. The most common cause of low lymphocyte counts is a recent infection. In addition, lymphocytopenia may also be caused by infections, malnutrition, connective tissue disorders, severe stress, intense physical exercise, and medical treatments. Nevertheless, even considering these limitations, our data indicate that an increased preoperative PLR might represent an independent prognostic factor for CSS and OS in non-metastatic breast cancer patients.

In conclusion, an increased preoperative PLR seems to significantly affect CSS and OS in non-metastatic breast cancer patients and may support oncological therapy decisions. Clarifying the optimal PLR cutoff level and independent validation of our findings is warranted.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^114wMd38]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Relation with secondary infections

The reduction in T lymphocytes holds predictive value for higher risks of secondary infections and prolonged hospital stays. Lymphopenia is closely associated with secondary infections and complications, including infections in the lungs, urinary tract, bloodstream, and abdomen. Distinct from the intrinsic functional status of individual T cells, the heightened susceptibility to secondary infections due to lymphopenia mainly manifests through extensive adaptive cell apoptosis, reduced T-cell diversity, and an immune suppression state induced by the relative increase in suppressive cells. The diversity of T-cell receptors (TCR) is critical to ensuring an individual's effective immune responses to various foreign antigens in a fluctuating environment. Research indicates that the loss of TCR diversity is induced by a reduction in lymphocytes, which aligns with the study outcomes showing a decrease in the proportion of Naïve T cells rather than a reduction in memory T cells.

Consequently, the discussion on the decline in lymphocytes continues to encompass the loss of TCR diversity, particularly from thymic atrophy caused by cellular apoptosis. It has been discovered that there is a notable decline in TCRβ diversity in adult patients with sepsis, correlating with an increased mortality rate. In the context of long-term use of invasive devices such as intubation, catheterization, and central venous catheterization, reduced TCR diversity could potentially heighten susceptibility to hospital infections related to certain chronic viral infections (e.g. hepatitis C virus), which are more prone to immune evasion. In addition, 42.7% of sepsis patients harbor multiple viruses, considering the cellular exhaustion, reduced CD4 and CD8 T cells, and increased myeloid-derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, all of which could facilitate viral reactivation due to the inability to eliminate high pathogen loads thoroughly. The association between lymphopenia and the progression and outcome of sepsis is summarized in Table 2.

### Prognostic value of leukocytosis and lymphopenia for coronavirus disease severity [^111Ge6pq]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Pooled data across early studies validate a significant correlation between elevated leukocyte count and decreased lymphocyte count among patients with severe cases of COVID-19 compared with those with mild cases. Why lymphopenia is associated with severe illness remains unclear. It has been hypothesized that this association could result from direct lymphocyte infection, destruction of lymphatic tissue, inflammation leading to lymphocyte apoptosis, or inhibition of lymphocytes by metabolic disorders such as lactic acidosis. Lymphopenia as a marker of severity does not seem to be specific to COVID-19; it has been used to prognosticate other viral pneumonias such as influenza. Neutrophilia may be more specific to severe disease than leukocytosis, but neutrophil count was not uniformly reported across the studies included in our analysis.

Despite our findings regarding clinical characteristics of severe COVID-19, our study had several limitations. First, our literature search found an expected paucity of data surrounding this topic because published characterizations of patients with COVID-19 remain minimal. More COVID-19 data from other nations and patient populations will aid in the comparison and validation of our clinical findings. Second, we noted significant heterogeneity in both the leukocyte and lymphocyte analyses. This phenomenon probably resulted from the small sample size, limited and early data, and skewed representation of the patient population. Third, the definitions of severe cases were somewhat inconsistent across these studies, varying from acute hypoxic respiratory failure to requiring mechanical ventilation. This variability could further compound the heterogeneity found across these studies. Last, only a minority of the manuscripts reported the proportion of patients with lymphopenia, and variable cutoffs based on the articles' reference ranges made it difficult to ascertain a cutoff for severe disease.

With the rising cases of COVID-19 and limited resources, being able to prioritize patients with severe disease is crucial. Some therapeutic agents are being investigated; however, supplies are often low and procurement may be delayed. The sooner patients with severe disease can be identified, the sooner the process of obtaining therapy can be initiated.

### Dimethyl fumarate kit (Dimethyl fumarate) [^1162kErr]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In these controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, among patients who did not experience prolonged, severe lymphopenia during treatment, the median times for lymphocyte counts to return to normal after discontinuing dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules were as follows:

4.3 weeks in patients with mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count ≥ 0.8×109/L) at discontinuation,
10 weeks in patients with moderate lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0.5 to < 0.8×109/L) at discontinuation, and
16.7 weeks in patients with severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 0.5×109/L) at discontinuation.

Dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules has not been studied in patients with pre-existing low lymphocyte counts.

Obtain a CBC, including lymphocyte count, before initiating treatment with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules, 6 months after starting treatment, and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Consider interruption of dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.5×109/L persisting for more than six months. Given the potential for delayed recovery of lymphocyte counts, continue to obtain lymphocyte counts until their recovery if dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules are discontinued or interrupted due to lymphopenia. Consider withholding treatment from patients with serious infections until resolution. Decisions about whether or not to restart dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules should be individualized based on clinical circumstances.

Rotavirus vaccine (RV) in HIV-exposed or HIV-infected infants — eligibility, timing, and product note: Minimum Age: 6 Weeks. Practitioners should consider the potential risks and benefits of administering RV to infants with known or suspected altered immunocompetence, and consultation with an immunologist or infectious disease specialist is advised, particularly for infants with HIV infection who have a low CD4 T lymphocyte cell percentage or count. Limited safety and efficacy data are available; however, considerations support vaccination of infants who are HIV exposed or HIV infected: in infants born to mothers with HIV, an HIV diagnosis may not be established before the age of the first RV dose (≤ 2% of infants with perinatal HIV exposure in the United States will eventually be determined to have HIV infection), vaccine strains of rotavirus are considerably attenuated, and RV can be administered to infants with HIV irrespective of CD4 count and percentage. The maximum age for the first dose in the RV series is 14 weeks and 6 days; for the final dose in the series, it is 8 months and 0 days, and vaccination should not be initiated for infants aged ≥ 15 weeks and 0 days. If Rotarix® is administered at ages 2 months and 4 months, a dose at age 6 months is not indicated.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^1152VqXb]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion and prospects

Lymphopenia is a prevalent phenomenon during the progression of sepsis. It serves as an index for assessing the severity and prognosis of sepsis associated with a heightened risk of secondary infections. Numerous epidemiological studies have subsequently affirmed the direct correlation between peripheral lymphopenia and increased ICU admissions and mortality rates, particularly emphasizing the substantial decrease in T-lymphocytes. These findings catalyzed an extensive exploration of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying sepsis-induced lymphopenia in hopes of illuminating potential therapeutic avenues.

Current studies have preliminarily elucidated several underlying potential mechanisms, yet a deeper investigation into the dynamic changes and mutual regulation relationships of different stages and lymphocyte subgroups is imperative. The two underlying mechanisms of lymphopenia that can be generalized from the dynamics of lymphocyte reduction to recovery after sepsis are apoptosis and impaired proliferation. Apoptosis is thought to be the leading cause of the dramatic decrease in the absolute number of lymphocytes due to sepsis. In contrast, lymphocyte redistribution illuminates a relative decrease in lymphocyte count in the peripheral circulation. Sepsis survivors tend to show signs of recovery of lymphocyte counts quickly, whereas nonsurvivors ultimately fail to recover lymphocyte counts. Therefore, inadequate or untimely recovery of lymphocyte counts after sepsis is associated with poor outcomes, and the underlying factor affecting the recovery of lymphocyte numbers may be the relative lack of proliferative capacity.

From a therapeutic standpoint, comprehensive treatment strategies that restore lymphocyte quantity and function appear more promising. We anticipate the development of more targeted, low-side-effect therapeutic drugs to prevent and rectify lymphopenia and immunosuppression induced by sepsis. We also foresee advancements in auxiliary diagnostic technologies, including establishing monitoring and early warning systems based on lymphocyte count and subgroups. It is essential to note the substantial heterogeneity in the degrees of lymphopenia among different patients, closely correlated with factors such as age, underlying diseases, and infection pathways. For instance, elderly sepsis patients experience more pronounced and persistent lymphopenia, a phenomenon associated with accelerated immunosenescence. Distinct pathogens induce varying patterns of lymphocyte decline, necessitating the differentiation of lymphocyte kinetic alterations in different types of sepsis patients to adopt more personalized treatment strategies. This area remains relatively unexplored and warrants further study

Factors that affect absolute CD4 count — basis, variability, and preferred parameter: The absolute CD4 count is a calculated value based on the total white blood cell (WBC) count and the percentages of total and CD4 T lymphocytes, and this absolute number may fluctuate or be influenced by factors affecting WBC count and lymphocyte percentages, such as use of bone marrow–suppressive medications, chronic corticosteroids, or acute infections; splenectomy or coinfection with human T-lymphotropic virus type I may cause misleadingly elevated CD4 counts, and in these settings CD4 percentage remains stable and may be a more appropriate parameter to assess a person's immune function.

### Circulating vitamin D levels status and clinical prognostic indices in COVID-19 patients [^111gqkts]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Elevated neutrophil count predicts ongoing inflammation and decreased lymphocyte count is considered an indicator of poor prognosis. A combination of these two measures, and the derived NLR ratio dNLR, are considered predictive of an inflammatory status. In acute Covid-19 disease, the more severe status is often associated with increased neutrophil cell count and a reduction of lymphocytes. Both CD4 T-helper and CD8 T-cytotoxic lymphocytes may be affected, with a CD4 more severe reduction associated with more severe disease and worst prognosis. In our patients, a moderate correlation was observed between CD4 + /CD8 + ratio, CD8 + count and VitD plasma levels. In addition, a statistically significant difference was detected between patients with low VitD plasma levels in comparison with those with more elevated VitD levels in both CD4 + /CD8 + and CD8 cell count. More elevated CD4/CD8 ratio was detected in patients with low VitD plasma levels. T-lymphocytes are essential in coordinating several immune functions, helping macrophages and B lymphocytes to counteract the development of the disease. The disease-induced loss of lymphocyte activity markedly weakens the immunological responses. Although, the causes of peripheral blood lymphocyte (PBMC) suppression were under investigation, no viral gene expression was detected in PBMC and no COVID-19 virus infection was demonstrated in these cells. Their reduction may be the result of migration/compartmentalization to the site of damaged tissue. In fact, the T CD8 + cell expansion into the lung of mild symptomatic COVID patients, assessed by bronchoalveolar lavage has been described.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Candidiasis (mucocutaneous) epidemiology in HIV indicates that oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis are common in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, the vast majority are caused by Candida albicans, and occurrence is an indicator of immune suppression most often observed with CD4 T lymphocyte (CD4) cell counts < 200 cells/mm3, with esophageal disease typically occurring at lower CD4 counts than oropharyngeal disease. The advent of antiretroviral therapy (ART) has led to a dramatic decline in the prevalence of oropharyngeal and esophageal candidiasis and a marked diminution in cases of refractory disease. Fluconazole (or azole) resistance is predominantly the consequence of previous exposure to fluconazole (or other azoles), particularly repeated and long-term exposure, and prior exposure to azole therapy has been associated with a gradual emergence of non-C. albicans species, particularly Candida glabrata, as a cause of refractory mucosal candidiasis in patients with advanced immunosuppression and low CD4 counts. In contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis — whether a single episode or recurrent — is common in healthy, adult women and does not suggest HIV infection.

### Differentiating dengue from COVID-19: comparison of cases in Colombia [^112emFQu]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

During the first week of symptoms, neutrophil and lymphocyte count, NLRs, and thrombocytopenia could guide the initial differential approach between dengue and COVID-19 patients. Thrombocytopenia tends to occur earlier in dengue patients and will present without fever. COVID-19 patients usually will have low platelet counts later in their clinical course and present with fever. Dengue patients tend to be younger at admission to the ER. These findings can be helpful for the differential diagnosis of both diseases in regions with a lack of resources.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in pediatric HIV infection [^112ajxqe]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — CD4 monitoring and clinical use: However, some clinicians find it useful to monitor CD4 percentages because they remain relatively consistent, whereas absolute CD4 counts vary with age and changes in total leukocyte counts, and CD4 counts and percentages are best measured when patients are clinically stable; Low CD4 values should be confirmed by a repeat test at least 1 week after the first test to inform clinical decisions. CD4 count and percentage decline as HIV infection progresses; patients with lower CD4 counts or percentage values have a poorer prognosis than patients with higher values. Children with higher baseline CD4 percentages, younger ages (< 4 years), or early ART initiation can potentially recover normal CD4 counts, whereas children with severe baseline immune suppression may not achieve normal CD4 levels with ART. Some clinicians find CD4/CD8 ratios useful for gauging overall immune dysfunction, and Guidelines recommend that all people with HIV receive ART, regardless of their CD4 count and clinical stage.

### Laboratory clues to immunodeficiency; missed chances for early diagnosis? [^114GHXNU]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2015). Low credibility.

Primary immunodeficiency is seen in an estimated one in 1200 people, and secondary immunodeficiency is increasingly common, particularly with the use of immunosuppresion, cancer therapies and the newer biological therapies such as rituximab. Delays in the diagnosis of immunodeficiency predictably lead to preventable organ damage. Examples of abnormal pathology tests that suggest immunodeficiency from all laboratory specialities are given, where vigilant interpretation of abnormal results may prompt earlier diagnosis. If immunodeficiency is suspected, suggested directed testing could include measuring immunoglobulins, a lymphocyte count and T-cell and B-cell subsets.

Consider interruption of VUMERITY in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.5 × 109/L persisting for more than six months. Given the potential for delayed recovery of lymphocyte counts, continue to obtain lymphocyte counts until their recovery if VUMERITY is discontinued or interrupted because of lymphopenia. Consider withholding treatment from patients with serious infections until resolution. Decisions about whether or not to restart VUMERITY should be individualized based on clinical circumstances.

### Infections during peginterferon / ribavirin therapy are associated with the magnitude of decline in absolute lymphocyte count: results of the IDEAL study [^111AWmsT]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Myelosuppression due to pegylated interferon (peg-IFN) is common during treatment for hepatitis C virus. The relationship between infection risk and decreases in leukocyte lines, however, is not well established. The objective of this analysis was to determine the incidence of and risk factors for infections during peg-IFN/ribavirin (RBV) therapy.

Methods

A total of 3070 treatment-naive, chronic hepatitis C genotype 1-infected patients were treated for up to 48 weeks with peg-IFN alfa-2b 1.5 µg/kg/week or 1 µg/kg/week, or peg-IFN alfa-2a 180 µg/week plus RBV. On-treatment leukocyte counts were obtained every 2–6 weeks. Dose reduction was required for a neutrophil count < 0.75 × 10(9) cells/L, and treatment discontinuation was required for a neutrophil count < 0.5 × 10(9) cells/L. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was prohibited. Data on infections were captured at each study visit and categorized according to MedDRA version 13.0.

Results

A total of 581 (19%) patients experienced moderate, severe, or life-threatening infections as assessed by the investigator; 648 (21%) patients had at least 1 neutrophil count < 0.75 × 10(9) cells/L, but only 242 (8%) sustained an infection and had a neutrophil count < 0.75 × 10(9) cells/L at any time while on treatment. Twelve patients had severe or life-threatening infection and grade 3/4 neutropenia, but only 4 had temporally related infections. In a multivariate logistic regression model, nadir lymphocyte count, history of depression, and female sex, but not nadir neutrophil count, were associated with moderate, severe, or life-threatening infection.

Conclusions

Nadir lymphocyte count, not nadir neutrophil count, was independently associated with moderate, severe, or life-threatening infections in the IDEAL study. Clinicians should be aware of their patients' absolute lymphocyte counts during peg-IFN/RBV therapy; peg-IFN dose reductions may be a consideration in patients with significant lymphocytopenia (< 0.5 × 10(9) cells/L).

### Pragmatic recommendations for the use of diagnostic testing and prognostic models in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 in low-and middle-income countries [^113v9gSh]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale.

A variety of laboratory investigations may aid in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. Some markers may predict disease severity and progression to ARDS, thromboembolic complications, or multi-organ failure. The U.S. NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines suggest performing the following laboratory tests as part of the initial evaluation of patients with severe and critical COVID-19 disease: a complete blood count with differential, metabolic profile, and liver and renal function tests. It also advises measuring the levels of inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), D -dimer, and ferritin for their prognostic values, though not part of the standard care. The WHO interim guidelines on the management of COVID-19 disease (May 27, 2020, September 11, 2020) however do not provide guidance on specific laboratory testing in COVID-19 patients. This section attempts to address this discrepancy with a focus on resource-constrained LMIC settings.

Search results.

MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science were searched through the end of September 2020. The search used combinations of MeSH terms and free-text words, including "COVID–19", "coronavirus", "SARS–CoV–2", and "laboratory findings" or "laboratory abnormalities". Few of the studies originated from LMICs. The search identified two useful systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The search, did not identify any randomized clinical studies.

Evidence.

Hematology.

Lymphopenia, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and low hemoglobin predict progression toward severe COVID-19. White blood cell (WBC) and neutrophil counts are higher, and lymphocyte counts and hemoglobin are lower in patients who die. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was one of the independent predictive factors for critical illness at hospital admission. Eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe and non-severe COVID-19. Blood cell counts may be a useful diagnostic aid in patients with a suggestive history and imaging for COVID-19 but who test negative by RT-PCR. –

### SARS-CoV-2 mediated dysregulation in cell signaling events drives the severity of COVID-19 [^111tCJrm]. Virus Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Abnormal Cell count: Low count of lymphocytes and thrombocytes, while increasing level of neutrophils is common phenomenon in severe COVID-19 patients.

CRP: C-reactive protein is a non-specific acute phase protein produced by hepatocytes that can increase in response to infection and inflammation, thus it become a biomarker for confirming different viral or bacterial infection. In COVID-19 diagnostics, CRP also has been suggested inconsistently as a prognostic marker, since, elevated level of CRP for patients with COVID-19 was associated with increased inpatient mortality and was indicative of disease severity at admission.

Others: Elevated level of-dimer, a fibrin degradation product has been constantly detected in COVID-19 cases in severe stage. Besides, increasing level of creatinine, an indication of kidney infection also reported to found in patients with COVID-19.

### PAN-immune inflammation value: a new biomarker for diagnosing appendicitis in children? [^116iokud]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Complete blood count (CBC) is easy to perform, cost-effective, and provides information on various cell types and morphological parameters (white blood cell count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, monocyte count, platelet count, and mean platelet volume). For example, the diagnostic value of low-cost and routinely measured markers such as mean platelet volume (MPV) and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) has been investigated. However, meta-analyses conducted in the pediatric population have shown that MPV does not significantly differ between children with acute appendicitis and healthy controls (WMD = -0.42, p = 0.19), and RDW similarly lacks discriminatory power (WMD = 0.23, p = 0.28). These findings indicate the limited clinical utility of MPV or RDW as standalone diagnostic tools. Additionally, combined ratios of these parameters are used as inflammation indices, assisting in the diagnosis, progression, and risk stratification of many diseases. The diagnostic value of CBC parameters is not limited to appendicitis alone; Growing evidence suggests that composite scores based on CBC can serve as prognostic biomarkers in cancer and inflammatory diseases. For example, parameters such as MPV and WBC (white blood cell count), when combined with machine learning models, have achieved an accuracy of 85% in COVID-19 diagnosis. Similarly, LYM (lymphocyte count) and PDW (platelet distribution width) have been used by automated algorithms to distinguish between influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infections, achieving an accuracy of 98.4%. However, since many of these markers show non-specific elevations in infections, their use alone in diagnosing appendicitis is limited. In this context, several markers have been developed, including the recently introduced pan-immune-inflammation values (PIV), which encompasses levels of neutrophils, monocytes, platelets, and lymphocytes. By reflecting inflammatory and immune response dynamics that cannot be captured by a single biomarker, these markers may enhance diagnostic accuracy.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the recently developed PIV index, which includes levels of neutrophils, platelets, monocytes, and lymphocytes, can be used as a biomarker for diagnosing acute appendicitis in children and to compare the performance of PIV with other commonly used systemic inflammatory markers, such as the Systemic Immune-Inflammation Index (SII), Systemic Inflammatory Response Index (SIRI), Neutrophil/Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR), and Platelet/Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR).

16.7 weeks in patients with severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 0.5x109/L) at discontinuation.

Dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules has not been studied in patients with pre-existing low lymphocyte counts.

Obtain a CBC, including lymphocyte count, before initiating treatment with dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules, 6 months after starting treatment, and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Consider interruption of dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsulesin patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.5 x 109/L persisting for more than six months. Given the potential for delayed recovery of lymphocyte counts, continue to obtain lymphocyte counts until their recovery if dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsules is discontinued or interrupted due to lymphopenia. Consider withholding treatment from patients with serious infections until resolution. Decisions about whether or not to restart dimethyl fumarate delayed-release capsulesshould be individualized based on clinical circumstances.

Lymphocyte count decrease

Lymphocyte count decrease was assessed for the target conditions: mortality, deterioration, and combined outcome.

For mortality (Figure 8), the cut‐off values to define lymphocyte count decrease ranged from 0.7 to 1.5 x 10 9 cells/L (13 studies). Sensitivity ranged from 41% to 98%. Specificity ranged from 18% to 89%. At a fixed specificity of 48% (Q1), 61% (median), and 70% (Q3), meta‐analyses produced a sensitivity of 79% (95% CI 68% to 87%), 67% (95% CI 56% to 77%), and 56% (95% CI 43% to 68%), respectively.

### Lymphocytopenia and neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio predict bacteremia better than conventional infection markers in an emergency care unit [^112MjbJ4]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Discussion

Culturing microorganisms is the most definitive way to confirm bacterial infections. Unfortunately, this gold standard is time consuming and may be influenced by several factors including previous antibiotic usage. Currently used conventional infection markers such as the CRP level, the WBC count and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate have relatively poor discriminatory capacity in distinguishing patients with bacterial infections versus patients with nonbacterial infections. Increasing the diagnostic yield possibly lies in the combination of well-known parameters or the introduction of new markers.

Lymphocytopenia has previously been described as a marker of bacteremia but did not gain broad acceptance as an infection marker. The mechanisms responsible for lymphocytopenia in sepsis and septic shock involve margination and redistribution of lymphocytes within the lymphatic system and marked accelerated apoptosis. Apoptosis is a prominent feature of sepsis. This process, in which selected cell populations can be actively deleted from certain tissues, has been shown a mechanism of lymphocyte death in animal sepsis models. Jilma and colleagues observed sustained lymphocytopenia during experimental human endotoxemia. In blood of septic shock patients, lymphocyte apoptosis is rapidly increased - leading to a profound and persistent lymphocytopenia associated with poor outcome. In mice, prevention of lymphocyte death in sepsis improved survival.

### Lymphocytopenia as a marker for pandemic influenza A / H1N1 2009 virus infection in children [^11734qDW]. Journal of Medical Virology (2011). Low credibility.

Lymphocytopenia has been reported in adults with pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 infection, but data in children are inconclusive. Data from 76 children presented with flu-like symptoms between July and November 2009 and tested for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus and white blood cell (WBC) counts were analyzed. Samples from 37 (48.7%) children resulted in a positive PCR assay for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus. When comparing data from these children with data from 39 (51.3%) children with uncomplicated flu-like illness and negative PCR assay for pandemic influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus, no difference in disease duration, median age, red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, C reactive protein concentration, and absolute neutrophil count was observed, whereas significant differences were apparent when considering WBC count, relative and absolute lymphocyte count, absolute lymphocyte count z-score, and platelet count. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the best absolute lymphocyte count and absolute lymphocyte count z-score cut-points that simultaneously maximized sensitivity and specificity were 2,256 cells/µl and -0.89, respectively, sensitivity being 0.81 (95% CI: 0.68–0.94), specificity 0.87 (95% CI: 0.77–0.98), positive predictive value 0.85 (95% CI: 0.74–0.97), and negative predictive value 0.83 (95% CI: 0.71–0.94). In conclusion, lymphocytopenia is a marker for influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus infection in children. Absolute lymphocyte count < 2,556 cells/µl or absolute lymphocyte count z-score < -0.89 may be useful cut-offs to discriminate against children at higher risk of infection during epidemics. Considering that the pandemic virus is highly likely to continue to circulate in the coming winter season, these findings provide direct and practical implications for the near future.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^111kZAK7]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Use of CD4 count for monitoring response to ART — The CD4 count is used to assess a person's immunologic response to ART and to determine whether prophylaxis for OIs can be discontinued. For most people, an adequate response is defined as an increase in CD4 count in the range of 50 cells/mm3 to 150 cells/mm3 in the first year of ART, generally with an accelerated response in the first 3 months of treatment, and subsequent increases average approximately 50 cells/mm3 to 100 cells/mm3 per year until a steady state level is reached; people who initiate therapy with a low CD4 count or at an older age may have a blunted increase in their counts despite virologic suppression.

### Two distinct immunopathological profiles in autopsy lungs of COVID-19 [^116SWTWE]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

ISG low COVID-19 patients in our study die with classical features of DAD, on average 9.1 days after hospitalization. Later death compared to patients with an ISG high pattern and progressive decline of systemic ISG expression during COVID-19, led us to infer that the ISG low pattern in lungs reflects a later phase of pulmonary COVID-19. ISG low lungs show higher frequencies of T and B lymphocytes, compared to ISG high lungs. None of our fatal cases showed lung lymphocyte counts below control levels. Therefore COVID-19-associated lymphopenia in blood, or spleensdoes not translate into lymphocyte depletion in infected lungs. Potential reasons are that the infected lung acts as a potent sink for circulating lymphocytes and that local proliferation limited recruitment from the blood, as was shown for CD8 + T cells in BAL of severe patients. Consistent with previous observations, we describe an activated CD8 + T cell signature in the lungs of ISG low patients that contain low viral counts. This suggests that CD8 + T cells are critical for antiviral protection, and may transition into a protective memory pool, as observed for SARS-CoV. In addition, we found elevated frequencies of CD8 + PD1 + cells in ISG low lungs compared to ISG high lungs, but not above control levels. The observation that PD1 levels are elevated in peripheral CD8 + T cells of severe COVID-19 infection, and whether this indicates exhaustion, remains controversial. Overall, although we did not have paired serum antibody levels available, the infiltration pattern of ISG low lungs suggested adaptive immune activation.

### Lymphocytopenia and neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio predict bacteremia better than conventional infection markers in an emergency care unit [^1129GZzi]. Critical Care (2010). Low credibility.

Infection markers

Infection markers upon presentation to the ED for the study cohort and the control group are shown in Table 3.

Table 3
Infection markers in the study cohort and control group

Data presented as mean ± standard deviation.

At ED admission, the CRP level in the study cohort was significantly higher compared with the control group (mean ± standard deviation 176 ± 138 mg/l vs. 116 ± 103 mg/l; P = 0.042). A CRP level of 50 mg/l or more has been reported as highly suggestive of sepsis, while the combination of a CRP level of 50 mg/l or more with systemic inflammatory response syndrome was identified as the best model to diagnose infection at ICU admission. In the study cohort, 69/92 patients had a CRP level of 50 mg/l or more (sensitivity 75.0%) against 58/92 patients in the control group (specificity 37.0%). Using 50 mg/l as the cut-off point, the positive predictive value (PPV) of CRP in diagnosing bacteremia was 54.3% against a negative predictive value (NPV) of 59.6%.

The WBC count in the study cohort did not differ significantly from the WBC count in the control group (13.6 ± 6.6 × 10 9 /l vs. 12.9 ± 5.2 × 10 9 /l). A WBC count below 4.0 × 10 9 /l or above 12.0 × 10 9 /l is used in the definition of systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In the study cohort, 5/92 patients had a WBC count below 4.0 × 10 9 /l and 48/92 patients had a WBC count above 12.0 × 10 9 /l (sensitivity 57.6%). In the control group, there were no patients with a WBC count below 4.0 × 10 9 /l and 43/92 patients had a WBC count above 12.0 × 10 9 /l (specificity 53.3%). Using systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria as the cut-off point of normal versus abnormal, the PPV of WBC count in diagnosing bacteremia was 55.2% against a NPV of 55.7%.

### Risk of common infections in people with inflammatory bowel disease in primary care: a population-based cohort study [^1177aJ6g]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

We did not show an association between mild lymphopenia or neutropenia and increased infection risk in IBD, an interesting finding that warrants further study. The finding that lower lymphocyte counts were associated with a decreased chance of infection in CD might correlate with thiopurine use and consequent lower disease activity. Similarly, a retrospective observational study from Germany found no association between mild lymphopenia and opportunistic infections, while Toruner et al found thiopurine-induced lymphopenia or neutropenia in IBD did not increase opportunistic infections. These findings suggest that either IBD itself or the drugs used to treat it result in, or are associated with, immune dysfunction and/or dysregulation that influences infection risk independent of either neutropenia or lymphopenia. Recent studies have indicated that innate lymphoid cells play a key role in mucosal inflammation and immunity against bacterial, viral and parasitic infection, and that an imbalanced accumulation in the population of Th1, Th2, Th17 and natural killer cells not only perpetuates chronic inflammation but also causes a dysfunctional immune response to infection in IBD. It is also likely that additional inhibition of innate and adaptive immunity by drugs used to treat IBD could exacerbate immune and/or cytokine imbalance, contributing to the observed infection risk.

### 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) clinical practice guideline for the treatment of coccidioidomycosis [^116GAo7h]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2016 coccidioidomycosis — HIV infection management recommendations state that antifungal prophylaxis is not recommended to prevent coccidioidomycosis in patients infected with HIV living in coccidioidal endemic regions (strong, moderate), and that antifungal therapy is recommended for all patients with HIV infection with clinical evidence of coccidioidomycosis and a peripheral blood CD4+ T-lymphocyte count < 250 cells/μL (strong, moderate). Antifungal therapy should be continued as long as the peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte count remains < 250 cells/μL (strong, low), whereas for patients with peripheral CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts ≥ 250 cells/μL, clinical management of coccidioidomycosis should occur in the same manner as for patients without HIV infection, including discontinuing antifungal therapy in appropriate situations (strong, moderate). Within coccidioidal-endemic regions, patients should receive yearly serologic screening and chest radiography for coccidioidomycosis (strong, low), but outside coccidioidal-endemic regions, serologic screening is not recommended (strong, moderate). Although data are lacking, pediatric patients with HIV infection and coccidioidomycosis should be managed in a manner similar to adult patients (strong, very low), and initiation of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART) should not be delayed because of the concern about coccidioidal immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) (strong, low). All the above recommendations are based on the assumption that the patient has been prescribed potent ART, which is strongly encouraged.

### Immunocompromised host pneumonia: definitions and diagnostic criteria: an official American Thoracic Society workshop report [^114cg4pE]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Cancer and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients — pneumonia risk varies by malignancy type and immune defects, with patients with lung cancer having a 21-fold increase in pneumonia compared with a 1.7-fold increase in those with breast cancer compared with the general population. The most readily quantifiable immune defect in clinical practice for patients with cancer and receiving HCT is neutropenia, and the period of neutropenia for most patients with solid tumors receiving chemotherapy is brief, often less than 7 days, whereas patients with acute leukemias and pre-engraftment HCT recipients frequently have more than 10 days of neutropenia, placing them at substantial risk for immunocompromised host pneumonia (ICHP). Although the use of absolute lymphocyte count to stratify infection risk is not well defined, it may be used to guide the need for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis or indicate the likelihood of viral pneumonia. Novel therapies further shape risk: in chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy the initial neutropenia of conditioning is brief whereas off-tumor hypogammaglobulinemia can be chronic with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, and anti-CD20 therapies such as rituximab are associated with notably poor B-cell response to vaccination even more than 12 months after receipt of therapy.

### Decreased lymphocytes and increased risk for infection are common in endogenous pediatric Cushing syndrome [^116dDM3v]. Pediatric Research (2018). Low credibility.

BackgroundHypercortisolemia results in changes of the immune system and elevated infection risk, but data on the WBC changes in pediatric Cushing syndrome (CS) are not known. We describe the changes of the WBC lineages in pediatric endogenous hypercortisolemia, their associations with the markers of disease severity, and the presence of infections. MethodsWe identified 197 children with endogenous CS. Clinical and biochemical data were recorded. Sixty-six children with similar age and gender, and normocortisolemia served as controls. ResultsThe absolute lymphocyte count of CS patients was significantly lower than that of controls, while the total WBC and the absolute neutrophil counts were significantly higher. These changes correlated with several markers of CS severity and improved after resolution of hypercortisolemia. Infections were identified in 35 patients (17.8%), and their presence correlated to elevated serum morning cortisol, midnight cortisol, and urinary free cortisol levels, as well as with the decrease in absolute lymphocyte count. ConclusionsChildren with endogenous CS have abnormal WBC counts, which correlate with the severity of CS, and normalize after cure. Infections are common in this population; clinicians should be aware of this complication of CS and have low threshold in diagnosis and treating infections in CS.

### Lymphopenia in sepsis: a narrative review [^112s5yLD]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Lymphopenia is also hypothesized to be a potential cause or consequence of CAP, potentially associated with chronic illnesses, critical illnesses, lymphocyte adherence to vascular endothelium, or extensive migration to the lungs. A lymphocyte count below 1,000/µL may be an independent biomarker for a 30-day mortality rate in CAP patients. For patients in the L-CAP study, a lymphocyte count under 724/mm³ doubled the risk of in-hospital death within 30 days. Therefore, lymphopenia markedly correlates with higher ICU admission risks and in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates in CAP patients compounded with sepsis. Early identification of lymphopenia may facilitate pinpointing CAP septic patients who are in urgent or impending need of intensive care. A significant correlation was observed between a lymphocyte count below the usual lower limit and the mortality rate in a study involving 3099 COVID-19 patients. Specifically, the lymphocyte count was exceedingly low (less than 5% of white blood cells) in deceased individuals. In contrast, it remained within normal ranges (more than 20% of white blood cells) in survivors with moderate illness.

L-CAP is characterized by CD4 depletion, a higher inflammatory response, and low IgG2 levels that correlate with greater severity at presentation and worse prognosis. Earlier, both reduced T-lymphocyte counts and reduced IgG levels were reported to be associated with the poor prognosis of severe CAP. In addition, the researchers also found that the severity of CAP was associated with decreased serum immunoglobulin levels (including total IgG, IgG1, and IgG2) and that low levels of immunoglobulins were independently associated with ICU admission and 30-day mortality. Lymphopenia leading to reduced immunoglobulin levels is predictable. A recent study found that TNF-α was significantly lower in gradable lymphopenia compared to non-lymphopenia and that a lower TNF-α baseline may lead to a reduced number of B-cells and immature B-cells, which can result in lower immunoglobulin levels. Immunoglobulin deficiency is also an indicator of severity in COVID-19 patients, and i.v. administration of IgG can mitigate virus-induced immunosuppression and provide passive immune protection against a broad range of pathogens.

The results of the above studies collectively show that lymphopenia is strongly associated with higher mortality rates, substantiating its role as a predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for critically ill patients. Notably, in studies significantly correlated with the probability of death on day 28, over 30% of patients exhibited lymphopenia, correlated with aggravated prognosis associated with profound T-cell lymphopenia.

### Monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam) [^112MfAko]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

In these controlled and uncontrolled clinical studies, among patients who did not experience prolonged, severe lymphopenia during treatment, the median times for lymphocyte counts to return to normal after discontinuing dimethyl fumarate were as follows:

4.3 weeks in patients with mild lymphopenia (lymphocyte count ≥ 0.8x109/L) at discontinuation,
10.0 weeks in patients with moderate lymphopenia (lymphocyte count 0.5 to < 0.8x109/L) at discontinuation, and
16.7 weeks in patients with severe lymphopenia (lymphocyte count < 0.5x109/L) at discontinuation.

Neither BAFIERTAM nor dimethyl fumarate have been studied in patients with preexisting low lymphocyte counts.

Obtain a CBC, including lymphocyte count, before initiating treatment with BAFIERTAM, 6 months after starting treatment, and then every 6 to 12 months thereafter, and as clinically indicated. Consider interruption of BAFIERTAM in patients with lymphocyte counts less than 0.5 x 109/L persisting for more than six months. Given the potential for delayed recovery of lymphocyte counts, continue to obtain lymphocyte counts until their recovery if BAFIERTAM is discontinued or interrupted because of lymphopenia. Consider withholding treatment from patients with serious infections until resolution. Decisions about whether or not to restart BAFIERTAM should be individualized based on clinical circumstances.

### Host response to infection: not all lymphopenia is created equal in SARS-CoV-2 [^113ccwF4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Dysregulation in the host immune response is a prominent feature of severe infection, particularly in SARS-CoV-2. Although acute SARS-CoV-2 is classically considered hyperinflammatory, many patients exhibit immune suppression features, including impaired adaptive immune responses, cytokine signaling disturbances, and lymphocyte apoptosis. Lymphopenia is correlated with more severe disease in SARS-CoV-2, but translating these observations into actionable treatments so far remains elusive.

In this issue of the Journal, Michels and colleagues (pp.) examined the biological heterogeneity of lymphopenia among 439 non–critically ill adults hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia in the Netherlands. All patients were enrolled within 48 hours of admission to a general medical ward. Mild (absolute lymphocyte count, 0.50–1.0 × 10 9 cells/L) and severe lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count, ≤ 0.50 × 10 9 cells/L) were present in 194 (44%) and 78 (18%) patients, respectively. As observed previously, lymphopenia was associated with increased mortality, as were several lymphocyte-associated cytokines. The authors assessed 43 plasma biomarkers to sample multiple pathophysiologic domains of the host response to infection. They observed marked differences in biomarker profiles, particularly among patients with severe lymphopenia, including enhanced endothelial activation, increased inflammation with end-organ injury, and cytokine signaling disturbances.
