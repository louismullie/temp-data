## Question

A 45-year-old woman with a known diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and multiple pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) presents for routine follow-up. She reports mild exertional dyspnea but denies overt bleeding. Her oxygen saturation on room air is 89%. Laboratory results show hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL (normal range), mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 74 fL (low), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) 24 pg (low), and serum ferritin 35 ng/mL (within normal limits).

Based on current clinical guidelines, what is the most appropriate next step regarding iron supplementation for this patient, and what laboratory findings support your decision?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the most appropriate next step regarding iron supplementation for a 45-year-old woman with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), multiple pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs), mild exertional dyspnea, room-air oxygen saturation of 89%, and labs showing hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL, MCV 74 fL, MCH 24 pg, and ferritin 35 ng/mL. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether the red cell indices indicate iron deficiency despite a normal hemoglobin. Then, I should verify how to interpret ferritin in the context of chronic bleeding and inflammation. Next, I will review guideline-directed iron-replacement strategies in HHT, including when to use oral versus intravenous iron. After that, I need to consider the pathophysiologic rationale for iron repletion in hypoxemic HHT with PAVMs. Finally, I will outline a practical plan, monitoring, and what to do if the response is inadequate, making sure I double-check any assumptions along the way.

> Let me first confirm the hematologic pattern. Microcytosis with low MCH and low MCV in the setting of chronic bleeding is classic for iron deficiency, and importantly, a normal hemoglobin does not exclude iron deficiency when compensatory erythropoiesis maintains hemoglobin at the expense of iron stores and red cell indices, which is precisely what we see here with ferritin 35 ng/mL and microcytic, hypochromic indices [^8b296127] [^98fc18ab].

> Wait, let me verify how to interpret ferritin here. Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and can be misleadingly normal in inflammatory states or chronic disease; in HHT, chronic low-grade bleeding and inflammation can yield a ferritin in the "normal" range that still reflects iron deficiency, so I should not anchor on ferritin alone and must integrate the microcytosis and clinical context, including the low MCV/MCH and the known chronic blood loss from HHT [^8b296127] [^db58b627].

> Next, I should review guideline direction. The Second International HHT Guidelines recommend offering iron replacement for HHT patients with iron deficiency or anemia, starting with oral iron and escalating to intravenous iron if oral therapy fails or is not tolerated, and they explicitly advise evaluating for additional causes of anemia only if there is an inadequate response to appropriate iron therapy, which supports initiating iron now rather than deferring [^9f41db23] [^e5c7461e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about route. I initially thought to go straight to IV iron because many HHT patients require it, but wait, I should confirm the sequence: guidelines endorse oral iron first-line for iron deficiency in HHT, reserving IV iron for intolerance, malabsorption, or failure of oral therapy, so I should start with oral iron and reassess in 4–8 weeks before escalating, unless there is severe anemia or urgent need, which is not the case here [^9f41db23] [^21419b71].

> I need to ensure the pathophysiologic rationale is sound. In HHT with PAVMs, right-to-left shunting lowers arterial oxygen content; compensatory polycythemia and increased cardiac output help maintain tissue oxygen delivery, but iron deficiency constrains erythropoiesis and can worsen hypoxemia and increase stroke risk from paradoxical emboli, so correcting iron deficiency supports oxygen-carrying capacity and may mitigate complications even when hemoglobin is "normal" by laboratory standards [^9971c383] [^66fa81a7].

> Let me consider the practical plan. I would initiate oral iron, typically ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day to maximize absorption and minimize GI upset, and I would pair it with vitamin C to enhance uptake; I should confirm adherence and tolerance and recheck CBC, reticulocytes, and iron studies in about 4–8 weeks to document a reticulocyte response and rising hemoglobin, recognizing that a hemoglobin rise of at least 10 g/L within 2 weeks strongly supports iron deficiency when compliance is assured [^26134a7d] [^96c8ca2d] [^80df5a00].

> But wait, what if the response is suboptimal or not tolerated? If there is inadequate hemoglobin rise, ongoing microcytosis, or intolerance, I should escalate to IV iron per HHT guidelines, with common options including ferric carboxymaltose or iron sucrose, and I should continue to monitor for recurrent bleeding that may necessitate adjunctive hemostatic strategies such as tranexamic acid or antiangiogenic therapy in selected cases, while also remembering that in HHT, severity grading for anemia management is framed around whether hemoglobin goals are met with oral versus IV iron or require transfusion, which helps guide escalation decisions [^9f41db23] [^dbcc8a65] [^53bc87c7].

> I should double-check that I am not missing alternative causes of microcytosis. Given the history and indices, iron deficiency from chronic bleeding is most likely, but if the response to iron is poor or if there are atypical features, I would reconsider thalassemia trait or other hemoglobinopathies and, if indicated, obtain hemoglobin electrophoresis to avoid unnecessary GI workup in the wrong ethnic context, while still pursuing iron therapy in parallel if iron deficiency is supported by the clinical picture [^141a7c5a].

> In summary, I should confirm the diagnosis of iron deficiency from the microcytosis and hypochromia despite a normal hemoglobin, start oral iron with vitamin C, and reassess in 4–8 weeks; if there is inadequate response or intolerance, I will switch to IV iron and evaluate for ongoing bleeding sources and adjunctive therapies as needed, aligning with HHT guidelines and the pathophysiology of hypoxemia with PAVMs [^9f41db23] [^8b296127] [^26134a7d] [^96c8ca2d].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **initiate oral iron therapy** [^9f41db23] because the patient has iron deficiency evidenced by microcytosis and hypochromia (MCV 74 fL, MCH 24 pg) [^98fc18ab] despite a normal hemoglobin, and ferritin 35 ng/mL is consistent with iron deficiency in the context of chronic bleeding from HHT [^8b296127]. Iron replacement is indicated in HHT patients with iron deficiency, even without overt anemia, to preserve compensatory erythropoiesis and mitigate dyspnea and hypoxemia [^notfound]. Start with oral iron (e.g. ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day) [^26134a7d] and reassess in 4–8 weeks; if oral iron is not tolerated or is ineffective, escalate to intravenous iron [^9f41db23] [^21419b71].

---

## Laboratory evidence supporting iron supplementation

- **Microcytosis and hypochromia**: MCV 74 fL (normal 80–100 fL) and MCH 24 pg (normal 27–32 pg) indicate iron deficiency, even with normal hemoglobin, because chronic blood loss drives iron-restricted erythropoiesis [^98fc18ab].

- **Ferritin 35 ng/mL**: In the setting of chronic bleeding, ferritin < 50 ng/mL is consistent with iron deficiency despite being within the "normal" range, as ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and can be misleadingly normal in inflammation [^8b296127] [^db58b627].

- **Normal hemoglobin**: A normal hemoglobin does not exclude iron deficiency in HHT, where compensatory mechanisms can maintain hemoglobin at the expense of iron stores and red cell indices [^8b296127].

---

## Clinical rationale for iron supplementation

In HHT, chronic epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding cause iron loss that exceeds dietary intake, leading to iron deficiency and anemia [^68261bf9]. Iron deficiency impairs erythropoiesis, reduces oxygen-carrying capacity, and worsens dyspnea and hypoxemia — particularly in patients with PAVMs who already have right-to-left shunting and reduced arterial oxygen saturation [^9971c383]. Correcting iron deficiency improves oxygen delivery, reduces cardiac workload, and may lessen dyspnea and fatigue [^66fa81a7].

---

## Guideline recommendations

The Second International Guidelines for HHT recommend **iron replacement for patients with iron deficiency or anemia**, starting with oral iron and escalating to intravenous iron if oral therapy fails or is not tolerated [^9f41db23]. They also advise evaluating for other causes of anemia only if there is an inadequate response to appropriate iron therapy [^e5c7461e]. The British Thoracic Society further supports iron supplementation in hypoxemic HHT patients with PAVMs, even when hemoglobin is normal, to support compensatory erythropoiesis [^8b296127].

---

## Recommended iron supplementation strategy

| **Step** | **Intervention** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Oral iron (ferrous sulfate 325 mg once daily or every other day) [^26134a7d] | First-line therapy; improve absorption and minimize GI side effects |
| 2 | Reassess in 4–8 weeks (CBC, ferritin, transferrin saturation) | Confirm response and adherence |
| 3 | Escalate to IV iron if oral iron is not tolerated or ineffective (ferric carboxymaltose or iron sucrose) [^9f41db23] | Preferred for moderate-to-severe iron deficiency or oral intolerance |
| 4 | Monitor for adverse effects and adjust dosing | Ensure safety and efficacy |

---

## Potential risks and considerations

Iron therapy is generally safe, but clinicians should monitor for **GI upset, constipation, and rare hypersensitivity** [^notfound]. In HHT, some patients report increased epistaxis with higher-dose oral iron; if this occurs, consider lower-dose, divided dosing, or switching to IV iron [^2d09e688]. Avoid iron in patients with hemochromatosis or iron overload syndromes [^10294e05].

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Initiate **oral iron therapy** now because microcytosis and hypochromia with ferritin 35 ng/mL indicate iron deficiency from chronic HHT bleeding, and correcting this will improve oxygen delivery and symptoms. Reassess in 4–8 weeks and escalate to IV iron if needed [^9f41db23].

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is an autosomal dominant disorder that causes abnormal blood vessel formation. The diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is clinical, based on the Curaçao criteria. Genetic mutations that have been identified include ENG, ACVRL1/ALK1, and MADH4/SMAD4, among others. Patients with HHT may have telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations in various organs and suffer from many complications including bleeding, anemia, iron deficiency, and high-output heart failure. Families with the same mutation exhibit considerable phenotypic variation. Optimal treatment is best delivered via a multidisciplinary approach with appropriate diagnosis, screening and local and/or systemic management of lesions. Anti-angiogenic agents such as bevacizumab have emerged as a promising systemic therapy in reducing bleeding complications but are not curative. Other pharmacological agents include iron supplementation, antifibrinolytics and hormonal treatment. This review discusses the biology of HHT, management issues that face the practising hematologist, and considerations of future directions in HHT treatment.

### Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations [^9971c383]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Within the past decade, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) have evolved from rare curiosities to not uncommon clinical states, with the latest estimates suggesting a prevalence of ~1 in 2,600. PAVMs provide anatomic right-to-left shunts, allowing systemic venous blood to bypass gas exchange and pulmonary capillary bed processing. Hypoxemia and enhanced ventilatory demands result, although both are usually asymptomatic. Paradoxical emboli lead to strokes and cerebral abscesses, and these commonly occur in individuals with previously undiagnosed PAVMs. PAVM hemorrhage is rare but is the main cause of maternal death in pregnancy. PAVM occlusion by embolization is the standard of care to reduce these risks. However, recent data demonstrate that currently recommended management protocols can result in levels of radiation exposure that would be classified as harmful. Recent publications also provide a better appreciation of the hematologic and cardiovascular demands required to maintain arterial oxygen content and oxygen consumption in hypoxemic patients, identify patient subgroups at higher risk of complications, and emphasize the proportion of radiologically visible PAVMs too small to treat by embolization. This review, therefore, outlines medical states that exacerbate the consequences of PAVMs. Chief among these is iron deficiency, which is commonly present due to concurrent hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: iron deficiency impairs hypoxemia compensations by restricting erythropoiesis and increases the risk of ischemic strokes. Management of periodontal disease, dental interventions, pulmonary hypertension, and pregnancy also requires specific consideration in the setting of PAVMs. The review concludes by discussing to what extent previously recommended protocols may benefit from modification or revision.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), the second most common inherited bleeding disorder, is associated with the development of malformed blood vessels. Abnormal blood vessels may be small and cutaneous or mucosal (telangiectasia), with frequent complications of bleeding, or large and visceral (arteriovenous malformations [AVMs]), with additional risks that can lead to significant morbidity and even mortality. HHT can present in many different ways and can be difficult to recognize, particularly in younger patients in the absence of a known family history of disease or epistaxis, its most common manifestation. HHT is commonly diagnosed using the established Curaçao clinical criteria, which include (1) family history, (2) recurrent epistaxis, (3) telangiectasia, and (4) visceral AVMs. Fulfillment of 3 or more criteria provides a definite diagnosis of HHT, whereas 2 criteria constitute a possible diagnosis of HHT. However, these criteria are insufficient in children to rule out disease due to the age-dependent development of some of these criteria. Genetic testing, when positive, can provide definitive diagnosis of HHT in all age groups. Clinical course is often complicated by significant epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to anemia in half of adult patients with HHT. The management paradigm has recently shifted from surgical approaches to medical treatments aimed at control of chronic bleeding, such as antifibrinolytic and antiangiogenic agents, combined with aggressive iron replacement with intravenous iron. Guidelines for management of HHT, including screening and treatment, were determined by expert consensus and originally published in 2009 with updates and new guidelines in 2020.

- need to increase the hemoglobin acutely, such as before surgery or during pregnancy

- inability to maintain an adequate hemoglobin despite frequent iron infusions.

We describe a case of a previously healthy 58-year-old woman who presented with gradual onset shortness of breath on exertion, erythrocytosis, hypoxia and hypoxaemia. Initial investigations revealed a normal chest radiography and pulmonary function test, however, there was an isolated reduction in diffusion capacity. She was subsequently found to have a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with intermittent shunting. A contrast echocardiography study hinted towards an extracardiac shunt. No shunt was detected in spite of using advanced imaging techniques. A lung biopsy was ultimately performed and histopathology revealed diffuse microvascular pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. This is one of few cases reported of this rare vascular abnormality and highlights its strong genetic association with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia. The diagnostic challenges and management of this unique condition are reviewed in detail.

### Can iron treatments aggravate epistaxis in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia? [^2d09e688]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, iron treatments remain essential, but we suggest there is a rationale to consider reduced strength iron tablets, closer to the recommended dietary allowance. More frequent administration of lower individual iron dosages may be helpful for individual HHT patients reporting that their nosebleeds increase after commencing or escalating iron treatments for anemia.

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Mild|- Hemoglobin goal is met with oral iron|
|Moderate|- Hemoglobin goal is met with IV iron|
|Severe|- Hemoglobin goal is not met despite adequate iron replacement, or blood transfusions are required.|

### How to manage patients with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^0cf87416]. British Journal of Haematology (2015). Low credibility.

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is a rare systemic autosomal dominantly inherited disorder of the fibrovascular tissue with a wide variety of clinical manifestations. Diagnosis is based on the clinical Curaçao criteria or molecular genetic testing. Dilated vessels can develop into telangiectases or larger vascular malformations in various organs, calling for an interdisciplinary approach. Epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding can result from these vascular defects. Various conservative and interventional treatments have been described for these conditions. However, no optimal therapy exists. Treatment can become especially difficult due to progressive anaemia or when anticoagulant or anti-thrombotic therapy becomes necessary. Screening for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVM) should be performed in all confirmed and suspected patients. Treatment by percutaneous transcatheter embolotherapy and antibiotic prophylaxis is normally effective for PAVM. Cerebral or hepatic vascular malformations and rare manifestations need to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to determine the best course of action for treatment.

### Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia with multiple complications presenting in an older patient [^ebb58dde]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a rare autosomal dominant multi-organ vascular disorder associated with bleeding and a reduced life expectancy. We present a 91-year-old woman with complications of previously undiagnosed HHT. This case demonstrates three potential complications: pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) resulting in a right to left shunt, cerebral infarctions and pericardial effusion. Despite these potentially life-threatening complications and the reduced life-expectancy associated with HHT the patient has survived to an advanced age. Due to the patient's late diagnosis and frailty, the treatment options of AVM embolization and pericardiocentesis were deemed inappropriate. The patient was treated with tranexamic acid to reduce bleeding severity and discharged home with a care package and home oxygen.

Management of GI bleeding

Evidence of GI bleeding or a sharp decline in hematocrit without epistaxis should involve a prompt GI evaluation and an upper and lower endoscopy and, if these do not provide clear results, consideration of video capsule endoscopy. Telangiectasias and AVMs may be visualized in the esophagus, stomach, small intestine and/or colon. If accessible, local endoscopic treatment should be attempted. Patients with recurrent bleeding, multiple AVMs, and small bowel AVMs may require additional pharmacological measures. As in the management of epistaxis, antiangiogenic, antifibrinolytic agents and/or other hormonal agents may be considered. Octreotide therapy has also been proposed in reducing transfusion needsbut is without much supporting data. Management of the anemia and iron deficiency that result from this blood loss is addressed below.

Management of pulmonary, hepatic, and CNS AVMs

Collaboration with a pulmonologist, hepatologist, gastroenterologist, neurologist, neurosurgeon, and interventional radiologist with experience in treating HHT patients is crucial to the management of AVMs found in the lungs, liver or brain. Screening is, therefore, important early in the diagnosis of these patients. Management will depend on the size of the AVMs, symptoms and location, and may include embolization of a pulmonary AVMs, surgical intervention for a CNS AVM and/or continued surveillance. Angiographic treatment of hepatic AVMs may be helpful in some patients but is often considered a higher risk by interventional radiologists.

Introduction

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, is a common autosomal dominant disorder that causes abnormal blood vessel formation. The eponym recognizes the 19 th century physicians William Osler, Henri Jules Louis Marie Rendu, and Frederick Parkes Weber, who each independently described the disease. Clinical sequelae of HHT include mucocutaneous telangiectasias, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and bleeding, with consequent iron deficiency anemia. Patients with HHT have been found to have abnormal plasma concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β)and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)secondary to mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and MADH4. There is considerable inter- and intra-family variation in disease onset and clinical severity, even in cases resulting from an identical mutation. Iron deficiency and associated anemia are frequent complications of the disease due to recurrent epistaxis and/or gastrointestinal bleeding. There are no accepted guidelines on management of patients with HHT beyond supportive measures of iron supplementation, red cell transfusion, and directed treatments to ablate bleeding sites and AVMs.

Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks angiogenesis via VEGF inhibition, appears to be promising in HHT as an intravenous formulation for reducing the frequency and severity of epistaxis and impacting quality of life. However, data on intranasal bevacizumab have been conflicting, and studies investigating the use of intravenous bevacizumab are limited to case reports and retrospective series. Treatment of HHT involves a multidisciplinary approach of specialists in cardiology, pulmonology, hepatology, interventional radiology, ear, nose and throat (ENT), genetics, and hematology. This review focuses on the biology of HHT and the management issues that confront the hematologist, as well as proposing a hematology management scheme.

### A case report of acute myocardial infarction with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^0d6e34d8]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) affecting the lungs, liver, and brain. Owing to its rarity and diagnostic challenges, early identification is often elusive. Underdiagnosis and prolonged diagnostic delays are prevalent. Here, we present the case of a 63-year-old male who presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Subsequently, he underwent placement of a drug-eluting stent in the right coronary artery (RCA). However, recurrent postoperative epistaxis resulted in severe anemia, prompting further investigation leading to the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia through comprehensive medical history and genetic testing. Future studies are warranted to evaluate reperfusion strategies in HHT patients presenting with myocardial infarction.

A 64-year-old woman with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) characterized by a pathological variant in ACVRL1 presents to the clinic for follow-up. Manifestations of HHT include frequent epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding, leading to iron-deficiency anemia. Bevacizumab is initiated, with resolution of the anemia. While maintained on a regimen of bevacizumab every 6 weeks, she continues to report frequent epistaxis and has ongoing iron-deficiency requiring periodic iron infusions. She also finds the bevacizumab infusions inconvenient. She is interested in discussing other options for managing her disease.

Key Points
- HHT is a genetic disorder in which blood vessels do not develop normally leading to bleeding that can be serious or life threatening.
- Frequent nosebleeds are the most common sign.
- Complication can vary widely, even among affected family members.
- Treatment to control bleeding and prevent complications may be needed. What it is HHT is a disorder in which some blood vessels do not develop properly. A person with HHT may form abnormal capillaries or abnormal capillary connections between the arteries and veins. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels that pass blood from arteries to veins. The abnormal blood vessels formed in HHT are often fragile and can burst, causing bleeding. Men, women, and children from all racial and ethnic groups can be affected by HHT and experience the problems associated with this disorder, some of which are serious and potentially life-threatening. Fortunately, if HHT is discovered early, effective treatments are available.

However, there is no cure for HHT. Signs Nosebleeds are the most common sign of HHT, resulting from small abnormal blood vessels within the inside layer of the nose. Abnormal blood vessels in the skin can appear on the hands, fingertips, face, lips, lining of the mouth, and nose as delicate red or purplish spots that lighten briefly when touched. Bleeding within the stomach or intestines is another possible indicator of HHT that occurs because of abnormal blood vessels lining the digestive tract. Additional signs of HHT include abnormal artery-vein connections within the brain, lungs, and liver, which often do not display any warning signs before rupturing. Causes of HHT HHT is a genetic disorder. Each person with HHT has a gene that is altered, which causes HHT. It takes only one gene with a mutation to cause HHT. Hundreds of possible mutations in several different genes have been linked to HHT. Diagnosis HHT can be diagnosed by performing genetic testing.

Most people with HHT are first diagnosed by using clinical criteria. Complications and Treatments The complications of HHT can vary widely, even among people affected by HHT in the same family. Complications and treatment of HHT depend on the parts of the body that are affected by this disorder. Treatment may include controlling bleeding and anemia and preventing complications from abnormal artery-vein connections in the lungs and brain.

Introduction

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a well-defined endothelial vasculopathywith established clinical diagnostic criteria, known causal genes, and expert consensus informing clinical practice across general and subspecialty management. Estimated to affect approximately 1.5 million individuals worldwide, HHT usually results from a heterozygous null allele in ACVRL1, ENG, or SMAD4 and is transmissible as an autosomal dominant trait. Evidence from early family-based analyseshas been supported by decades of studies in patientsand animal models, confirming that loss-of-function causes abnormal vascular structures, including telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).

Telangiectasia and larger AVMs are characterized by defective vascular walls predisposing to hemorrhage. Individuals affected by HHT experience spontaneous, recurrent nosebleeds due to abnormal nasal vasculature and exhibit small, visible telangiectatic vessels that tend to develop on the lips, oral cavity, and finger pads. Many have long-term excellent health with modest hemorrhagic losses, although most experience nosebleeds sufficient to lead to iron deficiency anemia unless dietary iron intake is supplemented, and significant proportions require surgical interventional treatments and/or disease-modifying drugs such as antiangiogenic agents.-Patients are commonly found to have silent visceral AVMs, and screening/primary prevention strategies have led to improved life expectancy.

### Bevacizumab in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and severe hepatic vascular malformations… [^cb0ceee8]. JAMA Network (2012). Excellent credibility.

Results A total of 25 patients were included between March 2009 and November 2010. Of the 24 patients who had echocardiograms available for reread, there was a response in 20 of 24 patients with normalization of cardiac index in 3 of 24, partial response in 17 of 24, and no response in 4 cases. Mean duration of epistaxis, which was 221 minutes per month at inclusion, had significantly decreased at 3 months and 6 months. Quality of life had significantly improved. The most severe adverse events were 2 cases of grade 3 systemic hypertension, which were successfully treated. Hepatic shunting, like other extracardiac systemic shunts, is thought to be associated with increased cardiac preload and decreased peripheral vascular resistances, leading to an adaptative increase of cardiac output.

High-output cardiac failure usually starts with a progressive increase in cardiac output, in turn leading to elevated left ventricle filling pressures, dyspnea, heart failure, and pulmonary hypertension.
6. Partial response was defined by any decrease in the cardiac index compared with the initial value but without normalization. Echocardiography was performed using a Vivid 7 echocardiograph and by the same cardiologist, under the same conditions, to minimize induced variations in cardiac output. Left ventricle size and function, left atrial size, Doppler evaluation of LV-filling pressures, and pulmonary pressure were assessed using standard measurements. Cardiac output was evaluated by measuring left ventricular outflow tract and LVOT velocity-time integral, obtained on pulse Doppler imaging.

The LVOT region of interest was outlined with a cursor as identified on pulse Doppler imaging. From this point, the computer obtained subsequent measurements automatically. Secondary criteria at 3 months included: dyspnea according to New York Heart Association classification and echocardiographic data and skin, mouth, and nose examination. We used a daily time report and a grid to record daily duration and number of episodes of epistaxis. Hemoglobin levels and number of blood transfusions were systematically recorded at each visit. Quality of life was evaluated using the Short Form-36 Health Survey questionnaire15 before treatment and 3 and 6 months after treatment. Liver volumes were obtained using CT scan and Vitrea version 5.

1.

Liver Doppler ultrasound determined diameter, course, and abnormalities of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and hepatic veins. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound was recorded and analyzed offline to assess functional modifications of liver hepatic perfusion, enhancement times, and kinetics before treatment and at 15 days, 29 days, 57 days, and 3 months after the beginning of treatment for patients who did not have pulmonary AVMs. Twenty-eight patients were included in this study between March 2009 and November 2010. Of them, 3 patients did not receive the treatment: 1 because of technical difficulties associated with vein access for the perfusion followed by a withdrawal of consent and 2 because of hypertension before treatment. Twenty-five patients were treated and 24 analyzed because the echocardiogram was not available for reread.

Iron deficiency/iron deficiency anemia

Iron deficiency/iron deficiency anemia is common in HHT. The underlying cause of iron deficiency in this patient population is the chronic blood loss from telangiectasias (e.g. nasal mucosa or intestinal tract) leading to iron store depletion. Approximately 5% of patients with HHT may have severe hemorrhages from epistaxis and/or intestinal AVMs. This consequently leads to a microcytic or normocytic anemia and symptoms of fatigue. Cardiopulmonary complications as described above can develop.

Other events

Though other events are not frequently reported, they include thromboembolic disease, pulmonary hypertension, liver disease, high-risk pregnancies, and spinal events. There is a 1% risk of mortality during pregnancy due to hemorrhage from cerebral or pulmonary AVMs. Patients are also affected socially and psychologically due to uncontrolled bleeding episodes. They commonly face difficulties with work, travel, social phobias, isolation, anxiety, and depressive disorders.

Juvenile polyposis

Juvenile polyposis is a rare association with HHT and results from a germline mutation in MADH4. This condition is also an autosomal dominant disorder. Mutations in MADH4 may manifest phenotypically as juvenile polyposis alone, HHT alone, or the combined syndrome of JP-HHT. The polyposis is best characterized by numerous hamartomatous polyps (i.e. 5–100) that are typically benign, but some patients may develop gastric or colorectal cancer, and so screening is encouraged. Patients with JP-HHT associated with MADH4 mutations are at an increased risk for early colorectal cancer. These patients may also have thoracic aorta dilation.

Juvenile polyposis syndrome — hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) screening for SMAD4 carriers is outlined with specific timing and tests. We suggest patients with SMAD4 pathogenic variants be clinically evaluated for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia at the time of the diagnosis, including screening for and appropriate management of cerebral and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. (Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence) Children with possible or confirmed HHT should be screened for brain AVMs at the time of diagnosis and undergo at least 1 follow-up MRI at puberty; lung AVM screening and surveillance is recommended at diagnosis and then every 3–5 years with pulse oximetry testing and consideration of transthoracic contrast echocardiogram; and in adulthood surveillance should include annual hemoglobin or hematocrit for all patients older than 35 years. Transthoracic contrast echocardiogram as a screen for pulmonary AVMs should be performed at the time of diagnosis, within 5 years preceding planned pregnancy, after pregnancy, and otherwise every 5–10 years, and brain MRI with and without contrast should be performed at birth or at the time of diagnosis to screen for cerebral vascular malformations.

### Iron deficiency responses and integrated compensations in patients according to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasiaandgenotypes [^66fa81a7]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

To provide further detail, HHT is a complex, heritable vasculopathy that is estimated to affect between one in 3,000–8,000 people, and is characterized by nosebleeds (epistaxis), mucocutaneous telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVM). In hematological circles, the greatest concern is the management of iron deficiency anemia secondary to HHT bleeding. This was a focus of recent International HHT Guidelines, and is an active area of pharmaceutical development.HHT patients develop iron deficiency when dietary iron is inadequate to provide both their usual iron requirements, and to replace additional iron losses due to bleeding from the nose, the gastrointestinal tract, menstruation, blood donation, and other losses as quantified by the hemorrhage-adjusted iron requirement. Iron deficiency anemia can have significant consequences for HHT patients and is one of the strongest predictors of mortality in HHT. As for any anemia, iron deficiency anemia reduces arterial oxygen content necessitating higher cardiac output to maintain tissue oxygenation, and this is a particular problem in HHT where visceral AVM lower the systemic vascular resistance, also resulting in higher cardiac outputs. Additional complications associated with iron deficiency and its treatment are reported in HHT, in particular patients with hepatic or pulmonary AVM. Furthermore, in HHT, ongoing bleeds mean that conventional transfusional support algorithms need to be modified. PanHHT genotyping is identifying more variable expressivity in all genotypes than previously expected, including paucity of clinical signs in patients presenting by less conventional routes (e.g. organ-specific AVM rather than clinical genetics, hematology or ENT surgery; AVM/HHT rather than juvenile polyposis gastroenterology). That said, there is clear evidence that particular AVM distribution patterns differ between the major HHT genotypes, and that SMAD4 ± patients can have additional phenotypes including juvenile polyposis and aortopathy.

Management of iron deficiency anemia

The development of anemia can have significant consequences for the patient with HHT. Although oral iron [e.g. ferrous sulfate 325 mg 3 times daily, ferrous asparto glycinate-polysaccharide iron complex 150 mg capsules 1–3 times daily] may be adequate for mildly affected HHT patients, many require intravenous iron such as ferumoxytol, iron sucrose or ferric carboxymaltose. Some patients may require 500–1000 mg of iron a month. Sometimes red blood cell (RBC) transfusion support is needed, but chronic RBC transfusion carries risk of infections and can lead to transfusion reactions and alloimmunization. In some patients, supplementation with erythroid stimulating agents (e.g. epoetin alfa, darbepoetin alfa) may be helpful. A suggested approach to the anemic HHT patient is presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3.
Treatment algorithm for iron deficiency anemia in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Oral iron may be attempted first but is typically insufficient in HHT patients with moderate or severe chronic bleeding. In this case, intravenous (IV) iron should be given at regular intervals unless bleeding ceases. When bleeding is so severe that IV iron is insufficient, consideration of antifibinolytics, such as tranexamic acid, is the next step. If this is unsuccessful, a trial of bevacizumab therapy is reasonable. CBC: complete blood count; IV: intravenous; PO: oral administration; TID: 3 times / day; q: every.

Use of hormonal agents

Estrogen and progestins (e.g. ethinyl estradiol, norethindrone or mestranol) have been used in HHT patients to reduce bleeding complications. Mestranol or norethynodrel may help increase nasal squamous epithelium and protect nasal lesions from injury. This hormonal therapy, however, can result in gynecomastia and/or loss of libido in men, weight gain, coronary events, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). Given the age of some patients and the potential side effects of this treatment, it has not been widely used. The overall improvement in hematologic parameters is also questionable.

Other hormonal treatment options include danazol 200 mg 3–4 times oral daily, tamoxifen 20 mg oral daily or raloxifene 60 mg oral daily. But these are not widely used.

Introduction

Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler–Weber–Rendu syndrome, is a rare vascular disorder characterized by autosomal dominant transmission. It causes severe complications including bleeding, recurrent epistaxis, iron deficiency, anemia, mucocutaneous telangiectasias, and arteriovenous malformations (AVM) in different organs (e.g. lungs, liver, brain, digestive tract). In some cases, AVM can be asymptomatic and often goes undetected in HHT patients, thus increasing morbidity and mortality. In addition, there is a considerable inter- and intra-family variation in symptoms and clinical severity, even in cases resulting from an identical pathogenic variant –. HHT requires a multidisciplinary approach as it is a multiorgan disease for which management and treatment depend on individual case evaluation. International guidelines have been elaborated for the diagnosis and management of HHT. According to these guidelines, anti-angiogenic and anti-fibrinolytic drugs are now recommended to treat bleeding and epistaxis in HHT patients – but treatment improvements are still awaited.

### Second international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^793cb914]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Description

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 5000 that is characterized by the presence of vascular malformations (VMs). These result in chronic bleeding, acute hemorrhage, and complications from shunting through VMs. The goal of the Second International HHT Guidelines process was to develop evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management and prevention of HHT-related symptoms and complications.

Methods

The guidelines were developed using the AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) framework and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology. The guidelines expert panel included expert physicians (clinical and genetic) in HHT from 15 countries, guidelines methodologists, health care workers, health care administrators, patient advocacy representatives, and persons with HHT. During the preconference process, the expert panel generated clinically relevant questions in 6 priority topic areas. A systematic literature search was done in June 2019, and articles meeting a priori criteria were included to generate evidence tables, which were used as the basis for recommendation development. The expert panel subsequently convened during a guidelines conference to conduct a structured consensus process, during which recommendations reaching at least 80% consensus were discussed and approved.

Recommendations

The expert panel generated and approved 6 new recommendations for each of the following 6 priority topic areas: epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia and iron deficiency, liver VMs, pediatric care, and pregnancy and delivery (36 total). The recommendations highlight new evidence in existing topics from the first International HHT Guidelines and provide guidance in 3 new areas: anemia, pediatrics, and pregnancy and delivery. These recommendations should facilitate implementation of key components of HHT care into clinical practice.

### International guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^94c76707]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Background

HHT is an autosomal dominant disease with an estimated prevalence of at least 1/5000 which can frequently be complicated by the presence of clinically significant arteriovenous malformations in the brain, lung, gastrointestinal tract and liver. HHT is under-diagnosed and families may be unaware of the available screening and treatment, leading to unnecessary stroke and life-threatening hemorrhage in children and adults.

Objective

The goal of this international HHT guidelines process was to develop evidence-informed consensus guidelines regarding the diagnosis of HHT and the prevention of HHT-related complications and treatment of symptomatic disease.

Methods

The overall guidelines process was developed using the AGREE framework, using a systematic search strategy and literature retrieval with incorporation of expert evidence in a structured consensus process where published literature was lacking. The Guidelines Working Group included experts (clinical and genetic) from eleven countries, in all aspects of HHT, guidelines methodologists, health care workers, health care administrators, HHT clinic staff, medical trainees, patient advocacy representatives and patients with HHT. The Working Group determined clinically relevant questions during the pre-conference process. The literature search was conducted using the OVID MEDLINE database, from 1966 to October 2006. The Working Group subsequently convened at the Guidelines Conference to partake in a structured consensus process using the evidence tables generated from the systematic searches.

Results

The outcome of the conference was the generation of 33 recommendations for the diagnosis and management of HHT, with at least 80% agreement amongst the expert panel for 30 of the 33 recommendations.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia may be the most morbid inherited bleeding disorder in women [^8686c1a9]. Blood Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is the second-most common inherited bleeding disorder (BD) worldwide and remains without approved therapies. HHT causes serious mucosal bleeding resulting in severe iron-deficiency anemia, major psychosocial complications, and visceral arteriovenous malformations in the brain, lung, and liver, which can cause life-threatening hemorrhagic complications. No study has examined the relative morbidity of HHT and von Willebrand disease (VWD), which is the most common inherited BD in women. We performed an observational cohort study of women with HHT or VWD, comparing a representative sample of 100 randomly selected women with HHT to 100 randomly selected age-matched women with VWD. In HHT vs VWD, recurrent epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding were more likely (odds ratio [OR], 32.73 [95% confidence interval, 13.81–71.80]; P < .0001 and 5.69 [2.59–12.89]; P < .0001) and heavy menstrual bleeding was less likely (OR, 0.32 [0.18–0.57]; P < .0001). Iron-deficiency anemia was significantly more likely, and the lowest hemoglobin was significantly lower in HHT than in VWD. The odds of iron infusion dependence, requirement for red cell transfusion, and hemostatic surgical procedures were significantly higher-17-fold, threefold, and eightfold higher, respectively-and hospital admissions to manage disease complications were both ∼14 times more frequent in women with HHT vs those with VWD. In conclusion, much higher disease-related morbidity, mortality, and health care use were observed in women with HHT vs VWD, providing evidence that HHT may be the most clinically significant inherited BD in women. Given the vast gap in research funding for HHT compared with both hemophilia (a disease primarily of men) and VWD, these findings have significant implications for gender equity in hematology.

A 28-year-old primigravid woman (36 +0 weeks) presented with dyspnea, chest tightness, and dry cough for 5 days and was admitted to the maternal ICU for hypoxemia with an O₂ saturation of 90%. She had been found to be Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) positive 10 days previously. Upon admission, her arterial blood gas showed low O₂ (Pa O₂ 53.6 mm Hg), suggesting hypoxemic respiratory failure (respiratory alkalosis combined with metabolic acidosis). Supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula (3 L/min) did not significantly alleviate the hypoxemia. Echocardiography showed normal function, with a pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 17 mm Hg. Chest X-ray and computed tomography revealed bilateral patchy shadows in the lungs, suggestive of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) (Figures 1A and 1B). She underwent cesarean section because of fetal distress on the next day and received low-dose heparin thromboprophylaxis 24 hours postpartum. Oxygen saturation subsequently improved to 92% at rest and 90% with activity. Computed tomography angiography on Day 7 postpartum confirmed bilateral PAVMs and a thrombus within the PAVM of the right lower lobe (Figures 1C and 2). She had no symptoms suggestive of thromboembolism. Screening for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia by whole-exome sequencing was negative. Eight months postpartum, after the completion of breastfeeding, a coil embolization procedure on the right lobe PAVM (the lingual PAVM was not accessible) was performed (Figure 1D), and the patient's oxygen saturation was restored and kept at 95%.

### How I treat bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^53bc87c7]. Blood (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT; Osler-Weber-Rendu disease) affects 1 in 5000 persons, making it the second most common inherited bleeding disorder worldwide. Telangiectatic bleeding, primarily causing recurrent epistaxis and chronic gastrointestinal bleeding, is the most common and most important manifestation of this multisystem vascular disorder. HHT-associated bleeding results in substantial psychosocial morbidity and iron deficiency anemia that may be severe. Although there remain no regulatory agency-approved therapies for HHT, multiple large studies, including randomized controlled trials, have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of antifibrinolytics for mild-to-moderate bleeding manifestations and systemic antiangiogenic drugs including pomalidomide and bevacizumab for moderate-to-severe bleeding. This has led to a recent paradigm shift away from repetitive temporizing procedural management toward effective systemic medical therapeutics to treat bleeding in HHT. In this article, 4 patient cases are used to illustrate the most common and most challenging presentations of HHT-associated bleeding that hematologists are likely to encounter in daily practice. Built on a framework of published data and supported by extensive clinical experience, guidance is given for modern evidence-based approaches to antifibrinolytic therapy, antiangiogenic therapy, and iron deficiency anemia management across the HHT disease severity spectrum.

### Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia… [^2137c09d]. AAFP (2010). Low credibility.

What is hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is a genetic disorder of the blood vessels. It is also called Osler-Weber-Rendu disease. People with HHT have abnormal blood vessels that tend to burst open and bleed. Who gets it. HHT affects men and women from all racial and ethnic groups. The abnormal gene comes from one parent who has HHT. If a parent has HHT, his or her children have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the gene and developing HHT. It is possible to have HHT with symptoms so mild that you don't notice them. How can I tell if I have it. HHT is diagnosed based on the signs and symptoms caused by abnormal vessels. These vessels have a greater chance of rupturing and bleeding compared with normal blood vessels. They can occur in the nose, skin, gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and brain. HHT can be diagnosed with genetic tests.

If the gene is found in one family member who is known to have HHT, other family members can be tested to see if they have HHT. What are the symptoms. About nine out of 10 people with HHT have nosebleeds that keep coming back. These can happen every day or only once in a while. The bleeding may be light or heavy. Abnormal vessels in the stomach or intestines can cause black or bloody stools or anemia. In the lungs, they can cause shortness of breath and possibly strokes if they become large. There is a higher risk of bleeding during pregnancy. In the brain, abnormal vessels can be dangerous if they bleed. Often they don't cause warning symptoms, so anyone with known or suspected HHT should be screened. Some people with HHT have abnormal vessels in the liver, but these don't usually cause problems in most people. No one with HHT has all of the signs and symptoms. Most symptoms vary, even within a family. A parent may have bad nosebleeds, but no abnormal vessels in an internal organ.

Yet, his or her child may have a nosebleed only rarely but abnormal vessels in one or more internal organs. Doctors can't predict how likely someone is to have one of the hidden, internal abnormal vessels based on how many nosebleeds or skin telangiectasias they have. How is it treated. There is no way to stop the abnormal blood vessels from forming, but most can be treated if they cause problems. Using a humidifier or ointments in the nose can help nosebleeds. Laser therapy or other surgeries can also help. Abnormal blood vessels in the lungs or brain are treated by embolization, which closes off the blood vessel to keep it from rupturing. Telangiectasias of the skin can be treated with laser therapy if they bleed often. Who should be screened for HHT. Anyone with a family history of HHT should be checked for the disease.

If someone in a family has the disease, other family members should see their doctor, who can help arrange for genetic testing. The symptoms of HHT can be mild, so even family members without symptoms should be screened. Where can I get more information.

- obtain low-dose non-contrast chest CT for diagnostic testing in patients with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary AVM (this testing can be performed at any gestational age, as clinically indicated)

- treat pulmonary AVMs starting in the second trimester unless otherwise clinically indicated.

### A case of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia with hypoxemia onset in the neonatal period [^69743004]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The described patient details a neonatal male presenting with hypoxemia and found to have a cerebral AVM as well as a suspected pulmonary AVM in addition to telangiectasias and epistaxis. This constellation of symptoms and findings is highly suggestive of HHT. HHT is a hereditary, relatively common, systemic disease characterized by multiple vascular bed telangiectasias and AVMs, affecting about 1 in 5,000–8000 individuals worldwide. However, clinical manifestations of HHT exhibit an age-related penetrance, and telangiectasias and epistaxis are uncommon in children and predominantly seen in late childhood or adulthood, resulting in the diagnosis being frequently delayed until later stages. For example, epistaxis is the most common clinical manifestation of HHT, and the average age of onset is 12 years. Diagnostic delays primarily occur because children seldom fulfill existing clinical criteria known as the Curaçao criteria including recurrent spontaneous epistaxis, multiple characteristic telangiectasias, visceral vascular malformation, first-degree family member meeting HHT criteria. Throughout the entire course, this patient met only one diagnostic criterion, which does not qualify as HHT according to the diagnostic criteria. Thus, current standards lack sensitivity while maintaining specificity in pediatric populations.

3 Defining the Goals of Treatment

Research initiatives in HHT have been impeded by an absence of standardized severity definitions, outcomes criteria, and terminology. The manuscript by Al‐Samkari et al. proposes consensus‐based standardized terminology and definitions for outcomes and severity classification for bleeding and anemia in HHT to improve consistency in clinical trial design, aid therapeutic treatment guideline development, and provide a framework for regulatory agencies. The panel consisted of international expert HHT clinician‐investigators from the Global Research and Medical Advisory Board (GRMAB) of the Cure HHT foundation, external experts in HHT and bleeding disorders, lived experience experts, and patient advocates.

The manuscript aims to standardize the goals of treatment, bleeding severity classification, as well as specific measures and outcomes pertaining to epistaxis, hematologic measures, health‐related quality of life, and bleeding severity classification.

The consensus on the primary therapeutic goal is to reduce the frequency, duration, and severity of HHT‐related epistaxis and gastrointestinal bleeding. These endpoints are clinically meaningful and lend themselves to standardized measurement in clinical trials.

Secondary treatment goals include reducing other HHT‐related bleeding sources (e.g. visceral and mucocutaneous), correcting iron deficiency and anemia, minimizing red cell transfusion and iron infusion requirements, and improving health‐related quality of life. Importantly, these outcomes must be achieved with minimal treatment‐related toxicity, particularly in patients with less severe bleeding phenotypes.

The panel also identified emerging areas for investigation. The impact and confounding effect of heavy menstrual bleeding, reported by the majority of women with HHT, warrants systematic evaluation in future trials. Additionally, therapies that promote vascular remodeling may offer disease‐modifying potential by targeting telangiectasia and visceral AVMs. While these endpoints remain exploratory, their inclusion in clinical studies could provide valuable insights into long‐term therapeutic impact.

### Can iron treatments aggravate epistaxis in some patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia? [^ffd0d938]. The Laryngoscope (2016). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) poses a substantial burden on otorhinolaryngological practice. Inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, HHT is caused by gene defects, most commonly in ENG, ACVRL1, or SMAD4, and leads to the development of nasal and gastrointestinal telangiectasia, in addition to visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). 1, 2 Recurrent epistaxis (nosebleeds) is the hallmark of HHT 1, 2, 3, 4, and results from fragile nasal telangiectasia, which are often lined by a single endothelial layer with no smooth muscles cells or pericytes, despite acting as conduits for blood at arterial pressure 5 (see Supporting Fig. 1 in the online version of this article). Nosebleeds often occur daily, and can be associated with acute hemodynamic disturbances 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 and reduced quality of life. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 Treatments include surgically based therapies such as cauterization, laser photocoagulation, 13 septal dermoplasty, 14 and Young's procedure, 15 and medical therapies such as antioestrogens, 16 tranexamic acid, 17, 18 and bevacizumab (Avastin). 19, 20 Therapeutics are generally graded according to the severity of epistaxis, 21 and many patients require more than one modality. Further treatment modalities are currently under evaluation in clinical trials.

The epistaxis that can be so difficult to manage in clinical practice also causes additional problems. HHT patients are commonly iron deficient and/or anemic because replacing iron lost through recurrent hemorrhage demands very high iron intakes, and it is difficult to meet the hemorrhage‐adjusted iron requirement by dietary intake alone. 22 The diverse detrimental consequences of iron deficiency 23, 24, 25, 26 include anemia and transfusional requirements that occur because iron deficiency restricts erythropoeisis, 27 leading to low hemoglobin, 28 and reduced arterial oxygen content. 29, 30 The development of iron deficiency predicts development of high output cardiac failure for HHT patients with severe hepatic AVMs. 31 Additionally, low serum iron is associated with venous thromboemboli, 32 paradoxical embolic stroke through pulmonary AVMs, 33 exuberant platelet aggregation to 5HT, 33, 34 and elevated coagulation factor VIII. 32

Adults with congenital heart disease — cyanosis, iron deficiency, and erythrocytosis management: The guideline clarifies usage that "cyanosis" is used to denote hypoxemia from right-to-left shunting and emphasizes hematologic assessment in cyanotic patients: "Iron deficiency is frequently encountered in cyanotic individuals", and "Iron deficiency requires assessment of serum iron, ferritin, and transferrin levels, because mean corpuscular volume is not a reliable screening test". Limited evidence supports iron repletion when "treatment of transferrin saturation < 20% with iron supplementation until iron stores are replete can be done safely". Regarding hyperviscosity management, "Phlebotomy is, therefore, rarely necessary in patients with secondary erythrocytosis, and routine phlebotomy is not supported by data".

### A 24-year-old man with chest pain, hemoptysis, and hypoxia [^96b729c0]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations in patients remains a diagnostic challenge to the emergency physician. Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations are abnormal direct connections that shunt unoxygenated blood from pulmonary arteries to pulmonary veins, resulting in hypoxia. They represent a rare clinical entity and are usually associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. We report a case of a young man who presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of right-sided chest pain, and vital signs and laboratory findings that did not clinically correlate with his history or physical examination. To our knowledge, there are no case reports of pulmonary arteriovenous malformations described in the emergency medicine literature.

Introduction

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are abnormal vessels that provide direct communications between pulmonary arteries and veins, and an anatomic right-to-left shunt. There are extensive references within early surgical literature detailing the structural characteristics, natural history in large series, surgical models, successful responses to surgical resection and limitations of surgery when disease was widespread. With the advent of embolisation treatment, treatment modalities evolved and the majority of patients are now treated by endovascular embolisationSurgical resection is undertaken in selected cases, particularly in emergency settings for haemoptysis if embolisation facilities are not available, or where pulmonary embolisation therapy is difficult or unsuccessful for patients experiencing PAVM complications. Unfortunately, PAVMs are often technically too small and/or numerous for curative embolisation or surgical procedures, and many treated patients are left with residual right-to-left shunts.

Population-wide CT screening programmes (undertaken for lung cancer screening) suggest as many as 1 in 2600 individuals will have a PAVM. The vast majority have no respiratory symptoms, usually because the PAVM(s) are small. In addition, for those with hypoxaemia secondary to their right-to-left shunting, as for high altitude adaptation, compensation occurs through polycythaemia and haemodynamic responses. A small proportion of patients experience haemoptysis, although this is infrequent except in the settings of pregnancy (1.0% of PAVM pregnancies result in life-threatening pulmonary haemorrhage); pulmonary hypertensionor if there is a systemic arterial supply to the PAVM sac: systemic arterial supply may arise de novo, or as a consequence of previous embolisation, surgical treatmentsor intercurrent lung parenchymal conditions. Haemoptysis may also occur due to endobronchial or nasopharyngeal telangiectasiaif PAVMs are associated with hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).HHT is a multisystemic inherited vascular dysplasia which also leads to arteriovenous malformations in visceral vascular beds, and iron deficiency anaemia as a result of recurrent bleeds from nasal and gastrointestinal telangiectasia.

### Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations may be the only clinical criterion present in genetically confirmed hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia [^a061a504]. Thorax (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs) are capillary-free vascular communications between pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins, resulting in an anatomical intrapulmonary right-to-left shunt.PAVM prevalence was estimated by general population screening thoracic CT imaging at 38 per 100 000 individuals in Japan (95% CI 18 to 76), corresponding to 1/2631 (95% CI 1/1315 to 1/5555). Although this seems high for respiratory clinical practice, the majority of PAVMs are asymptomatic and undiagnosed, despite continuous right-to-left shunting, which impairs gas exchange and places individuals at high risk of neurological complications from paradoxical emboli. Neurological risks are present whether or not the individual has symptoms from the PAVM(s). Details of appropriate management of patients with PAVMs are outlined in recent British Thoracic Societyand Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europestatements.

Figure 2.
Comparison of the relationship between hemoglobin and red cell indices. Data in patients with confirmed hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) molecular genotypes; 865 values are plotted on each graph, with quadratic regression lines for the 3 HHT genotypes illustrated for ACVRL1 (blue), ENG (orange) and SMAD4 (purple). (A) Hemoglobin concentration (Hb). (B) Mean corpuscular volume (MCV). (C) Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). (D) Red blood cell count (RBC).

That said, the evidence presented begins to point to physiologically different iron homeostasis in SMAD4 ± patients, highlighting new concepts to be considered as HHT management recommendations and clinical trials proceed. The pattern resembles functioning as though the patient is in a more iron-deficient state: despite similar serum ferritin values, SMAD4 ± patients displayed lower serum iron and T f SI than the other HHT molecular genotypes. Furthermore, similar hemoglobin was achieved by a greater number of smaller red cells. SMAD4 regulates hepcidin, the key regulator of iron homeostasis, which is reduced in individuals with active bleeding (via erythroferrone) and iron deficiency. Our previously reported hepcidin datasetincluded only one individual with SMAD4 ±. Their hepcidin:ferritin ratio (1.2 ng/ mL/µg/L) was higher than the other HHT patients (0.2–0.5 [mean 0.3] ng/mL/µg/L), and controls (0.1–1.0 [mean 0.5] ng/ mL/µg/L), but the SMAD4 patient was iron replete, limiting interpretations. Whole-genome sequencing of ACVRL1 ±, ENG ± and SMAD4 ± patients was performed through the 100,000 Genomes Project, but no hepcidin (HAMP) DNA variants were identified in these individuals, precluding similar analyses to those we have recently performed for hemorrhage susceptibility in HHT. Published murine data is of only limited help - while basic erythropoiesis was normal in SMAD4 -deficient mice, it was not examined during iron-restricted erythropoiesis, nor in the setting of secondary erythrocytosis that compensates for pulmonary AVM-induced low oxygen saturation in order to maintain arterial oxygen content, and we speculate may be employed differently in the maintenance of hemoglobin in iron-deficient SMAD4 ± patients. Future prospective studies will be enhanced by incorporating measurements at the time of iron deficiency. Importantly, and unexpectedly, there were differing magnitudes of response to acute changes to the circulation on standing. Given the separate arterial pathologies observed in SMAD4 patients (e.g. aortic dilatation), possession of a SMAD4 causal variant is a plausible differential to why the orthostatic pulse discrepancies were observed and further examination is warranted, particularly as this may highlight arterial pathology beyond the expected HHT-specific variables. In conclusion, this study contributes to the growing body of literature that indicating phenotypic differences between HHT molecular genotypes, by demonstrating differences in iron, red cell and hemodynamic indices that SMAD4 ± patients may use to in settings of iron deficiency. Future studies should aim to confirm with larger numbers, requiring introduction of routine measurements of iron indices and postural pulse into assessment, and likely multicenter analyses given the sparsity of SMAD4 ± HHT patients and importance of adjusting for confounders in multivariable analyses. Future studies should also evaluate if differences identified in SMAD4 ± patients are associated with a modified symptom burden, for instance, tolerance of standing; elucidate better mechanistic understanding of the relationship between SMAD4 and hepcidin in the setting of iron deficiency to which all HHT patients are prone, and address whether there should be changes to the type of iron deficiency treatment these patients receive.

### Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations [^97d6fe81]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder affecting 1 in 8000 individuals. The eponym recognises the 19th-century physicians William Osler, Henri Jules Louis Marie Rendu and Frederick Parkes Weber who each independently described the disease. It is characterised by epistaxis, telangiectasia and visceral arteriovenous malformations. Individuals with HHT have been found to have abnormal plasma concentrations of transforming growth factor beta and vascular endothelial growth factor secondary to mutations in ENG, ACVRL1 and MADH4. Pulmonary artery malformations (PAVMs) are abnormal communications between pulmonary arteries and veins and are found in up to 50% of individuals with HHT. The clinical features suggestive of PAVMs are stigmata of right to left shunting such as dyspnoea, hypoxaemia, cyanosis, cerebral embolism and unexplained haemoptysis or haemothorax. The authors present the case of a 33-year-old woman presenting with progressive dyspnoea during the COVID-19 pandemic. She had a typical presentation of HHT with recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasia and pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. Although rare, PAVM should be considered in individuals presenting to the emergency department with dyspnoea and hypoxaemia. Delayed diagnosis can result in fatal embolic and haemorrhagic complications.

In patients with severe iron deficiency anaemia (haemoglobin [Hb] < 7–8 g/dL), i.v. supplementation is recommended, while oral ferrous formulations are often poorly tolerated and efficacy may be impaired; one small open-label study suggested good tolerability and efficacy of ferric maltol in severe pulmonary hypertension with mild-to-moderate iron deficiency and anaemia, but two small, 12 week, randomized, cross-over trials in PAH without anaemia showed no significant clinical benefit, and randomized controlled trials comparing oral vs i.v. iron are lacking.

### Standardization of terminology, definitions, and outcome criteria for bleeding in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia: International Consensus Report [^a92c219b]. American Journal of Hematology (2025). Medium credibility.

As mentioned previously, heavy menstrual bleeding may be more prevalent in HHT than in the general population and could serve as a confounder in the accurate assessment of hematologic endpoints in menstruating women. The expert panel recommends that clinical trial protocols limit the introduction of medications or interventions that may significantly impact menstrual flow (e.g. intrauterine contraceptive placement, initiation of oral contraceptives or endometrial ablation), unless medically necessary, during a clinical trial in which hematologic endpoints are designated as primary or key secondary endpoints in order to best keep menstrual blood loss stable in the absence of benefit induced by the investigational therapy. Additionally, in such trials, the expert panel recommends that a method to understand the evolution of menstrual blood loss while hematologic endpoints are being evaluated be used, such as the Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) questionnaire and/or the Menstrual Bleeding Questionnaire (MBQ). Under no circumstance should these additional recommendations discourage or reduce the participation of women in HHT clinical trials.

Lastly, when hematologic endpoints are designated primary or key secondary, the panel recommends that clinical trials impose a requirement for either discontinuation of oral iron prior to enrollment (and sole management with IV iron) or for oral iron supplementation to remain stable during all periods that hematologic endpoints are measured, to eliminate the potential for confounding on the results of hematologic endpoint measurements as it is impossible to determine the amount of iron absorbed from the gut of each individual participant taking oral iron.

### Iron deficiency responses and integrated compensations in patients according to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasiaandgenotypes [^f76af154]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Severe hemorrhage and anemia in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a major focus of drug development and repurposing. HHT is not a single disorder, but molecularly heterogenous, and most commonly caused by a single loss-of-function DNA variant in ACVRL1, ENG or SMAD4. As for all individuals in the general population, HHT patients are at risk of developing iron deficiency, anemia and sequelae if iron lost through hemorrhage is not adequately replaced, but as we have published, quantitative examination in over two decades of HHT care emphasizes that exact responses vary between individuals. We hypothesized that one element of variability may reflect the underlying HHT genotype. Here we demonstrate subtle differences that may be important to recognize when designing randomized controlled trials of new HHT therapies, and also for existing management strategies. We show that where. HHT patients were becoming anemic and iron deficient, those with a pathogenic variant in SMAD4 displayed different patterns of compensations compared to those with an ACVRL1 or ENG pathogenic variant. While the study is limited by the rarity of the SMAD4 genotype (currently, only 2.5% of HHT causal variants on the HHT Mutation Database), we explore reasons that may explain a distinctive phenotypic cluster in SMAD4 HHT patients. In order to further stimulate future prospective studies, we outline the potential relevance to HHT symptom burden and complications, rationales for differing iron treatment regimes by HHT genotype, and more broadly suggest that the cohorts provide an opportunity to further clarify relationships involved in iron and circulatory homeostasis.

4.5 Major Acute Bleeding

While most bleeding in HHT is chronic, in recognition of the seriousness and life‐threatening potential of acute bleeds, the expert panel defined a major acute bleed in HHT by adapting the definition for major bleeding from the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis to best reflect the HHT disease state. A major acute bleed in HHT is defined as satisfying one or more of the following criteria: (1) acute‐onset severe epistaxis or gastrointestinal bleeding necessitating urgent intervention performed by a healthcare provider (e.g. nasal packing, administration of intravenous antifibrinolytic, or ablative procedure); (2) pulmonary, central nervous system, or other solid organ bleeding due to a ruptured AVM; (3) acute bleeding that results in a drop in hemoglobin of ≥ 2 g/dL over a 24‐h period; or (4) acute bleeding that results in hemodynamic instability or a requirement for packed red cell transfusion (in excess of the individual's baseline maintenance red cell transfusion requirements, if any).
