## Question

Evaluation for rapid dementia and cognitive decline

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating rapid dementia and cognitive decline. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining rapid cognitive decline and why it is urgent. Then, I should verify the initial assessment priorities, including history, examination, and screening tools. Next, I will review the broad differential diagnosis and the first-line laboratory and imaging workup. After that, I need to check when to escalate to advanced testing, including CSF, EEG, and autoimmune panels. Then, I will consider special populations and settings, including HIV, young-onset disease, and resource-limited environments. Finally, I should confirm follow-up, monitoring, and communication strategies, and close with a concise decision algorithm that integrates these elements with appropriate citations.

> Let me first confirm the definition and urgency. Rapid cognitive decline is generally defined as a decline in MMSE of at least 3 points in 6 months or a similar magnitude of deterioration over weeks to months, and it is considered an urgent medical problem requiring expedited evaluation and often specialist referral because many causes are treatable or infectious and time-sensitive, and some are transmissible, such as prion disease [^f62602de] [^0cca0b66] [^8a7330aa].

> Wait, let me verify the initial assessment priorities. I need to ensure a detailed history from both the patient and a reliable informant, documenting the time course, functional impact, psychiatric and sleep symptoms, medication and substance exposures, and family history, because anosognosia and recall bias are common and informant input is essential to accuracy and safety planning [^f7a1e5b2] [^79012c8e]. I should also perform a focused neurologic and mental status examination, using validated brief screens such as Mini-Cog, MoCA, or AD8 to quantify impairment and guide next steps, while screening for depression, delirium, and dangerous behaviors that could alter management [^17596e13] [^69f287ec] [^141511b6].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology before establishing the differential. The differential for rapid decline is broad and includes neurodegenerative causes such as prion disease, atypical Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body disease; immune-mediated encephalitides; infectious etiologies including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder and opportunistic infections; toxic-metabolic derangements; vascular events; neoplastic and paraneoplastic processes; and iatrogenic or psychiatric contributors, so I need to keep a high index of suspicion for reversible causes while I proceed methodically [^8a7330aa] [^eb47d363] [^8873d91e].

> I should double-check the first-line workup. Routine laboratories should include CBC, CMP, TSH, B12, folate, and syphilis serology when indicated, with additional testing guided by risk and presentation, because reversible metabolic or infectious causes must be excluded early [^85d12255]. Structural neuroimaging with MRI is preferred to CT to evaluate for stroke, mass lesions, white matter disease, and atrophy patterns, and is particularly important in recent-onset, rapidly progressive, young-onset, or focal presentations, so I need to ensure timely access and interpretation [^85d12255] [^9c3816c8].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to advanced testing. If initial studies are unrevealing and suspicion remains high for RPD, CSF analysis becomes critical to evaluate for infection, inflammation, malignancy, and prion disease, with markers such as 14–3–3, total tau, and RT-QuIC supporting prion disease, and with CSF Aβ42, total tau, and p-tau helping adjudicate Alzheimer's pathology when clinically relevant, while EEG can reveal periodic sharp wave complexes suggestive of CJD and autoimmune encephalitis panels can identify treatable antibody-mediated disease [^ed16946b] [^cc179389] [^8a7330aa]. But wait, I should confirm safety and pretest probability before LP, and I must remember that amyloid positivity alone does not establish causality in mixed pathologies, so results must be integrated with the clinical picture [^ed16946b].

> Let me consider special populations and settings. In people with HIV, even with suppressed plasma viral load, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder and opportunistic infections remain in the differential, so I should maintain vigilance and tailor testing to local epidemiology and resource constraints, which may necessitate empiric treatment pathways in some settings [^5c557f45] [^23a083de]. In young-onset or atypical presentations, I should expedite specialist referral and broaden the workup to include genetic counseling and testing when appropriate, given the unique diagnostic and psychosocial complexities and the potential for heritable conditions [^7a10aabb] [^c959e95d].

> I need to ensure longitudinal monitoring and communication are built into the plan. Repeat neuropsychological testing at 6 to 12 month intervals can quantify change, distinguish practice effects, and refine the differential, while structured functional assessments and caregiver input help track safety and guide planning, and I should communicate clearly with the patient and care partner about goals, uncertainties, and next steps using shared decision-making principles [^7b2d95b6] [^b411ae48] [^f7a1e5b2]. Hold on, I should verify that I have addressed modifiable contributors such as sleep apnea, depression, and medication effects, because treating these can improve cognition and quality of life even when neurodegeneration is present [^f835af69] [^6bedbaa4].

> Let me synthesize a practical decision algorithm without oversimplifying. If rapid decline is suspected, I should confirm the time course and functional impact with patient and informant, screen for delirium and depression, and perform a focused neurologic and cognitive exam with validated tools; if red flags such as focal deficits, myoclonus, ataxia, visual field cuts, or seizures are present, I should escalate urgently to MRI, CSF, and EEG with autoimmune and infectious testing as indicated; if the presentation is atypical or young-onset, I should refer early to a dementia subspecialist; if initial testing is unrevealing but decline continues, I should repeat neuropsychology and consider advanced biomarkers or PET to clarify etiology and eligibility for disease-modifying therapy [^0cca0b66] [^8a7330aa] [^ed16946b].

> Finally, I should confirm that my approach aligns with evidence and guidelines. The Alzheimer's Association DETeCD-ADRD framework supports a three-step diagnostic formulation emphasizing functional status, syndrome characterization, and etiologic diagnosis, and it explicitly calls for urgent evaluation and specialist referral in rapidly progressive or atypical presentations, which reinforces the urgency and breadth of workup I have outlined here [^2d6289ae] [^0cca0b66] [^c959e95d].

---

Rapid dementia and cognitive decline require a **structured, time-sensitive approach** to identify treatable causes and guide management [^8a7330aa]. Begin with a **focused history and exam** to characterize the syndrome and exclude delirium, then order core labs and brain MRI [^85d12255]. If unrevealing, escalate to CSF, EEG, and autoimmune/paraneoplastic panels to evaluate for prion disease, autoimmune encephalitis, and other reversible etiologies [^ed16946b]. Early specialist referral is essential for atypical or rapidly progressive cases, and longitudinal neuropsychological testing helps track decline and refine the differential [^b411ae48].

---

## Clinical definition and significance

Rapid cognitive decline is generally defined as a **decline of ≥ 3 MMSE points within 6 months** or a **CDR increase of ≥ 1 stage within 1 year** [^f62602de]. This pace is clinically significant because it often signals **treatable or reversible causes** — such as autoimmune encephalitis, prion disease, or metabolic derangements — and mandates urgent evaluation to prevent irreversible damage [^8a7330aa].

---

## Initial clinical assessment

### History and examination

- **History**: Obtain a detailed timeline from the patient and informant, focusing on onset, progression, and functional impact; screen for psychiatric symptoms, sleep disturbance, medication changes, and family history [^79012c8e].
- **Examination**: Perform a comprehensive neurologic exam, including mental status, cranial nerves, motor, sensory, coordination, and gait; look for focal deficits, myoclonus, ataxia, or visual field defects that suggest specific etiologies [^7a10aabb].

---

### Cognitive screening tools

Use **validated brief screens** such as the Mini-Cog, MoCA, or AD8 to quantify impairment and guide next steps [^17596e13] [^69f287ec]. These tools are sensitive for detecting cognitive impairment but are not diagnostic and should be followed by comprehensive evaluation when positive [^a67b6e0d].

---

## Essential laboratory investigations

Order a **core laboratory panel** to exclude common reversible causes:

| **Test category** | **Specific tests** |
|-|-|
| Hematologic | CBC, ESR, CRP |
| Metabolic | CMP, TSH, free T4, B12, folate, HbA1c |
| Infectious | RPR/FTA-ABS, HIV serology, Lyme serology (if indicated) |
| Autoimmune | ANA, ENA panel, anti-dsDNA (if indicated) |
| Toxicologic | Heavy metals, medication review |

---

## Neuroimaging

Brain MRI with contrast is the **preferred modality** to evaluate for structural lesions, vascular disease, atrophy patterns, and prion disease features (e.g. cortical ribboning) [^9c3816c8]. CT is acceptable if MRI is contraindicated or unavailable, but it is less sensitive for subtle abnormalities [^notfound].

---

## Advanced diagnostic testing

If initial evaluation is unrevealing, escalate to **advanced testing**:

- **CSF analysis**: Cell count, protein, glucose, 14–3–3 protein, RT-QuIC, NMDA receptor antibodies, and other autoimmune encephalitis panels [^ed16946b].
- **EEG**: Look for periodic sharp wave complexes suggestive of prion disease or epileptiform activity indicating seizures contributing to cognitive decline [^notfound].
- **Autoimmune and paraneoplastic panels**: Anti-NMDA, anti-Hu, anti-Ma2, anti-CV2, and others as indicated by clinical suspicion [^notfound].

---

## Indications for specialist referral

Refer urgently to neurology or a dementia subspecialist for:

- **Atypical presentations**: Early-onset (< 65 years), rapid progression, focal deficits, or prominent psychiatric symptoms [^7a10aabb].
- **Complex cases**: Diagnostic uncertainty, need for advanced testing, or consideration of disease-modifying therapies [^b90ecc58].
- **Family or caregiver distress**: Need for counseling, advanced care planning, or support services [^8a57f0f3].

---

## Role of neuropsychological testing

Neuropsychological evaluation provides a **detailed profile of cognitive strengths and weaknesses**, aids differential diagnosis, and establishes a baseline for tracking decline [^84082c7d]. It is particularly valuable in atypical or early-onset cases and when brief screens are inconclusive [^b229e103].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Schedule regular follow-up to monitor progression, assess response to interventions, and update care plans. Use **standardized tools** (e.g. CDR, FAST) to stage severity and guide decisions about safety, capacity, and caregiver support [^d3e19ead].

---

## Common pitfalls and challenges

- **Attributing symptoms to normal aging**: This delays diagnosis and treatment; always evaluate reported cognitive or behavioral changes [^35610d78].
- **Overlooking psychiatric comorbidity**: Depression, anxiety, and sleep disorders can mimic or exacerbate cognitive decline and must be assessed and treated [^6bedbaa4].
- **Failure to involve caregivers**: Caregiver input is essential for accurate history, safety assessment, and care planning [^f7a1e5b2].

---

## Conclusion

A structured, stepwise approach to rapid dementia and cognitive decline — history, exam, core labs, MRI, and selective advanced testing — enables timely identification of treatable causes and guides management. Early specialist referral and longitudinal neuropsychological testing are critical to optimizing outcomes and supporting patients and families [^8a7330aa] [^b411ae48].

Introduction

Rapid cognitive decline (RCD) occurs in dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD).

Methods

Literature review, consensus meetings, and a retrospective chart review of patients with probable AD were conducted.

Results

Literature review showed that RCD definitions varied. Mini-Mental State Examination scores < 20 at treatment onset, vascular risk factors, age < 70 years at symptom onset, higher education levels, and early appearance of hallucinations, psychosis, or extrapyramidal symptoms are recognized RCD risk factors. Chart review showed that RCD (Mini-Mental State Examination score decline ≥ 3 points/year) is more common in moderate (43.2%) than in mild patients (20.1%; P < .001). Rapid and slow decliners had similar age, gender, and education levels at baseline.

Discussion

RCD is sufficiently common to interfere with randomized clinical trials. We propose a 6-month prerandomization determination of the decline rate or use of an RCD risk score to ensure balanced allocation among treatment groups.

### Clinical reasoning: rapidly progressive dementia in a man with HIV infection and undetectable plasma viral load [^5c557f45]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Neurocognitive decline associated with HIV infection remains prevalent even in the antiretroviral therapy (ART) era, albeit usually in less severe forms. The differential diagnosis of cognitive impairment in this population is quite broad, including infectious causes such as CNS opportunistic infections, causes directly related to HIV such as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders, and causes entirely unrelated to HIV infection such as primary dementia syndromes. In this case report, a 47-year-old man with HIV on ART with an undetectable plasma viral load presented with rapidly progressive dementia to a clinic in Zambia. He had been functioning independently and fully employed before symptom onset but had to stop working within 2 months of symptom onset because of the severity and rapidity of his cognitive decline. Initial workup led to an empiric diagnosis and initiation of an empiric treatment regimen, which was ultimately ineffective. This prompted re-evaluation, additional workup, and, ultimately, discovering the correct diagnosis. This case highlights the stepwise approach to developing a diagnosis in a resource-limited setting where there exists a high burden of HIV infection, including the necessity of empiric diagnoses of treatment plans when investigations are limited and the importance of reconsidering these diagnoses in the face of additional clinical information. In addition, it highlights both infectious and noninfectious causes of cognitive decline in people with HIV.

### Cognitive decline in prodromal Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment… [^c5da4dbd]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Results During follow-up, 462 persons developed Alzheimer disease. Five to six years before diagnosis, the rate of global cognitive decline accelerated more than 15-fold. The acceleration in cognitive decline occurred slightly earlier for semantic memory and working memory than other cognitive functions. Mild cognitive impairment was also preceded by years of cognitive decline that began earlier and proceeded more rapidly in the amnestic than in the nonamnestic subtype. To see if results varied across cognitive domains, we conducted separate analyses using composite measures of specific cognitive functions.

As shown in Figure 2, the prodromal period began about 63 months before dementia onset for episodic memory, 76 months for semantic memory, 75 months for working memory, 70 months for perceptual speed, and 65 months for visuospatial ability. Prior to the prodromal period, episodic memory was stable and there was gradual decline in the other domains. Decline in all functions increased sharply during the prodromal period with less marked acceleration after AD was diagnosed. There was an approximately 4. 5-year period of gradual global cognitive decline prior to MCI onset, with a further doubling in the rate of decline after MCI was diagnosed. In a group of more than 2000 elderly people followed up annually for up to 16 years, we assessed the change in cognitive function during the prodromal phases of AD and its precursor, MCI.

The rate of cognitive decline increased sharply about 5 to 6 years before dementia was diagnosed and showed a modest increase approximately 4 to 6 years before MCI was diagnosed. The results indicate that dementia in AD is preceded by many years of progressively accelerating cognitive decline. These data show that by the time individuals meet clinical criteria for a diagnosis of AD, they have already experienced many years of accelerating cognitive decline. This has important public health implications because it is generally assumed that treatments for AD will be more effective if introduced before this prodromal period begins and cognitive systems are manifestly dysfunctional. Further, an effective early treatment could compress the cognitive morbidity of AD, 36 whereas effective treatment after dementia onset might prolong it, underscoring the need for biologic and behavioral markers to aid in early diagnosis.

### Individualized, cross-validated prediction of future dementia using cognitive assessments in people with mild cognitive symptoms [^8d65ece9]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

There is already approved anti‐amyloid treatment for AD in the United States and elsewhere. With available disease‐modifying treatment for AD, there will expectantly be a significant increase in the number of patients seeking healthcare for evaluation of their cognitive symptoms. Therefore, in everyday clinical practice, clinicians urgently need accessible and brief decision‐support algorithms, especially in primary care, where the triaging of patients with cognitive impairment first takes place. These algorithms could help identify two groups: patients at high risk of progressing to dementia, who require further evaluation to determine the underlying cause, and those at low risk, who can either be reassured or monitored in primary care, with follow‐up risk assessments to optimize symptom management and plan effectively for the future.

Although previous studies investigated predictors of future dementia, none developed algorithms utilizing easily accessible measures for individualized prognosis in individuals seeking care for cognitive symptoms. Furthermore, these studies do not reflect a real clinical setting where people with subjective or objective cognitive symptoms seek healthcare. External validation of existing dementia prediction models has highlighted the need for updated models due to high variability in discriminative power (area under the curve [AUC] ranging from 0.55 to 0.81). Repeated measures over time allow for dynamic prediction models that can be updated as new information becomes available. Previous research suggested that multiple serial measurements over time can enhance the predictive accuracy of AD. However, to our knowledge, no previous models created practical tools for clinicians to predict individual progression to dementia based on longitudinal cognitive test results.

Patients seek healthcare at various stages of their cognitive decline, ranging from having subtle subjective symptoms to clear objective impairment. Some individuals may present with an evident low or high risk of progressing to dementia based on the initial assessment. However, for other patients, the initial evaluation may be inconclusive, necessitating follow‐up with repeated testing. Such a two‐step workflow has been applied in the screening for AD using plasma biomarkers and proved to effectively reduce the need for confirmatory testing in some cases. Thus, we hypothesized that a two‐step model for cognitive testing would align well with clinical practice and current workflows. We aimed to develop a model for predicting all‐cause dementia at 4 years by analyzing existing longitudinal data in individuals with cognitive symptoms from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We planned to replicate our findings in the BioFINDER‐1 study. We also aimed to develop an app that calculates individualized risk scores.

### The Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for specialty care [^b90ecc58]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

FIGURE 3
In a specialty care setting (usually general neurology, geriatric psychiatry, or geriatrics), this diagram briefly illustrates how each primary care clinical practice recommendation fits into the typical workflow (see Figure 2 for details). Additional detail is provided on how higher tier assessments and diagnostic tests fit into the specialty care workflow. In some specialty care settings, the assessments and tests illustrated in Figure 4 are performed to arrive at the 3‐step diagnostic formulation. This diagnostic formulation should then be disclosed clearly and compassionately, and a treatment plan can then be initiated.

Other patients may have a history and examination that are incongruent: for example, a patient may not have a history suggestive of delirium but on examination may be highly inattentive or may exhibit signs suggestive of a toxic‐metabolic encephalopathy or a related syndrome. Still other patients may present with a history of substantial cognitive–behavioral change in daily life yet have what appears to be a normal examination in an initial office encounter. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider referral to a specialist with expertise in dementia; and to strongly consider neuropsychological evaluation. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.,

Specialized neurobehavioral assessments and neurologic examinations are also used to monitor status, as well as to disentangle the adverse effects of prior or current treatments (e.g. parkinsonism, dyskinesias, cognitive side effects of medications, sleep and mood changes) from the symptoms of disease(s) and comorbid conditions. Recommendation 12 provides additional detail on patient characteristics that warrant specialist referral.

### Individualized, cross-validated prediction of future dementia using cognitive assessments in people with mild cognitive symptoms [^2a48a8cd]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). Medium credibility.

Already at the first step (initial test visit), a high NPV was achieved, which is particularly relevant in clinical practice for reassuring patients they are at low risk of developing dementia. This is especially important in primary care (> 76% of participants in the validation cohort were referred directly to primary care). The overall lower PPV indicates that this workflow alone is not sufficient for identifying those with underlying prodromal dementia. Instead, it can be used to identify individuals at increased risk who would likely benefit from a more thorough secondary care work‐up involving advanced biomarker investigations, which typically exhibit high PPVs, thereby enhancing overall diagnostic accuracy.

Those at intermediate risk in this workflow are recommended to undergo a second cognitive test visit after 1 year. The second step of the model incorporated changes in cognitive testing into the best predictive model, aligning with previous research showing that the prediction of progression to dementia is improved if longitudinal information is incorporated. Regarding the composition of cognitive stages at the second step, there were few individuals with SCD included in ADNI (five individuals), as many SCD individuals were screened as low risk in the first step (N = 87 out of 103), while two were screened as high risk. Although the second step increased the overall accuracy, it came with the drawback that some individuals had already progressed to dementia when it was time for the 1‐year follow‐up testing needed for Step 2. In an era where new disease‐modifying treatment is being implemented, it is important to identify patients as early as possible to achieve the best treatment effect. In countries or regions where secondary care allows for a higher number of referrals, it could thus be an option for primary care physicians to refer patients at either high or intermediate risk already after Step 1.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Recommendation 12 — Referral for atypical, early-onset, or rapidly progressive cases — A patient with atypical findings or in whom there is uncertainty about how to interpret the evaluation, or that is suspected of having an early-onset or rapidly progressive cognitive–behavioral condition, should be further evaluated expeditiously, usually including referral to a specialist (Strength of Recommendation A). Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered to be urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management, and atypical, rapidly progressive or early-onset (young age of onset, age < 65 years) dementias pose unique diagnostic and care challenges that may require comprehensive neuropsychiatric evaluation and specialist assessment, interpretation, or management.

### Rapidly progressive dementia [^eb47d363]. Annals of Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

In contrast with more common dementing conditions that typically develop over years, rapidly progressive dementias can develop subacutely over months, weeks, or even days and be quickly fatal. Because many rapidly progressive dementias are treatable, it is paramount to evaluate and diagnose these patients quickly. This review summarizes recent advances in the understanding of the major categories of RPD and outlines efficient approaches to the diagnosis of the various neurodegenerative, toxic-metabolic, infectious, autoimmune, neoplastic, and other conditions that may progress rapidly.

What new investigations are emerging in the diagnosis of dementia?

Cerebrospinal fluid sampling is used to exclude inflammatory, infective, and malignancy related causes of dementia and is typically recommended in individuals with rapid cognitive decline, unusual or neurological presentations, or cognitive impairment at less than 55 years of age. More recently there has been a focus on developing cerebrospinal fluid based markers, such as β amyloid and tau, for changes in Alzheimer's disease that can predate the onset of the dementia, the so called prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease. Although such markers have been incorporated into recent diagnostic criteria for Alzheimer's disease, whether they are effective at predicting those who will develop dementiaand, more importantly, practically acceptable, makes their widespread clinical use challenging at present.

It is now possible to directly image amyloid in the brain using several positron emission tomography radiotracers, and this imaging technique may have a future role clinically in predicting which people with mild cognitive impairment will develop Alzheimer's disease. However there is still major heterogeneity in how these scans are interpreted. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that although amyloid imaging has high sensitivity (83–100%) in detecting people with mild cognitive impairment who convert to Alzheimer's disease related dementia, diagnostic specificities varied considerably between studies (46–88%).

The Alzheimer's Association clinical practice guideline for the Diagnostic Evaluation, Testing, Counseling and Disclosure of Suspected Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders (DETeCD‐ADRD) focuses on recommendations that encourage timely, accurate, and effective diagnosis, staging, and disclosure for individuals living with cognitive‐behavioral decline. The guidelines provide a structured and well operationalized, yet person‐centered, evaluation plan for clinicians in primary and subspecialty care, with the important goal of empowering providers to confidently approach the diagnostic evaluation and disclosure process with their patient and care partner dyads. Furthermore, these recommendations are offered at a time when the financial, societal, and ethical benefits of timely detection, accurate diagnosis, and effective management are being increasingly realized, with dementia prevalence increasing as the population ages, and with the emergence of disease‐modifying treatments being implemented in clinical practice. Thus the timely detection, accurate diagnosis, appropriate disclosure, and proper management of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), is of the utmost importance. In this Perspective, we use ADRD to refer to diseases such as the group of frontotemporal lobar degenerations (tauopathies and TAR DNA‐binding protein‐43 (TDP‐43) proteinopathies) and cortical Lewy body disease, and specifically discuss the importance of incorporating neuropsychology, as detailed in recommendation 14 of the practice guidelines.

The clinical practice guidelines (CPG) provide a multitiered, three‐step approach to diagnostic formulation, allowing for a structured but individualized process. As outlined in the primary articles, the steps include (1) to delineate the cognitive functional status (i.e. the overall level of impairment); (2) to characterize the patient's cognitive‐behavioral syndrome; and (3) to generate and narrow the differential diagnosis of the brain disease(s) or disorder that is the likely cause(s) of the patient's cognitive‐behavioral syndrome, recognizing the importance of differentiating AD from ADRD or other diseases, disorders (e.g. mood disorders), conditions (e.g. sleep apnea), and factors (e.g. effects of medications or alcohol) that may cause or contribute to cognitive or behavioral symptoms. A similar approach and diagnostic framework have been proposed to address ongoing challenges in dementia nomenclature.

### Practical recommendations for timely, accurate diagnosis of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (MCI and dementia) in primary care: a review and synthesis [^d76a6e76]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Timely and accurate diagnosis and concomitant application of multimodal intervention that eventually includes a DMT may slow or delay cognitive decline due to AD, at a point in the disease continuum where (i) neurodegeneration is not so sufficiently advanced as to render intervention biologically ineffective; and (ii) a patient's independence and quality of life are relatively robust and subsequently defended. Timely and accurate diagnosis of early AD will depend on multiple evolving parameters related to detection, evaluation and biomarker‐aided assessments that we expect to expand presently, both in accessibility and in ease of use. Along with continuing general preventative efforts, the detection of early disease offers the best opportunity for counselling, lifestyle modification and medical intervention – as well as long‐term planning and participation in research. We look forward to rapid refinements in healthcare that will enable all providers, including primary care clinicians, to fully reimagine their approach to the AD disease spectrum, leading to better patient outcomes.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^0cca0b66]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Atypical or rapidly progressive presentations — urgent evaluation and specialist referral guidance includes that delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management. Atypical features may include prominent focal cognitive abnormalities, sensorimotor impairment, or profound mood and behavioral symptoms, and patients with such signs on examination require an approach with a broader differential diagnosis, which often warrants specialist examination and distinct testing or studies to arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate interdisciplinary care plan. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider and facilitate referral to a specialist with expertise in cognitive–behavioral neurology or geriatric psychiatry. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.

### Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for primary care [^c3a70038]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2.1 Core element one: whom to evaluate and how to establish shared goals

The first core element of the process, covered by Recommendations 1 through 3, addresses foundational considerations when initiating and proceeding through a diagnostic evaluation and disclosure process. These include in whom and when to initiate an evaluation; the importance of a patient‐centered and collaborative partnership in the goal‐setting, diagnostic, and disclosure processes; and the three‐step conceptual framework for diagnostic formulation. The DETeCD‐ADRD CPG also emphasizes the critical importance — in most situations — of including both the patient and an informant or care partner in the diagnostic and disclosure process.

Recommendation 1 applies the basic tenets of a high‐quality medical approach to the evaluation of symptoms of cognitive or behavioral decline. The timely evaluation of an individual with cognitive or behavioral symptoms concerning for MCI or dementia represents best medical practice.,

Any middle‐aged or older patient who self‐reports — or whose spouse, family, or other informant (or clinician) reports concern regarding symptoms of cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline — should undergo an evaluation to determine whether they might have a cognitive–behavioral syndrome arising due to specific neuropathologic changes (Recommendation 1). A clinician should not assume "normality" or ascribe cognitive or behavioral symptoms to "normal aging" without an appropriate evaluation. The optimal approach to the evaluation of a patient with suspected cognitive or behavioral impairments, whether at the level of subjective cognitive decline, MCI, mild behavioral impairment, or dementia, is grounded in the biopsychosocial model of health and illness.

Clinicians evaluating a patient suspected of having a cognitive–behavioral syndrome arising from neurodegenerative disease may face unique challenges arising from impairments that may be present in a patient's awareness of the illness (anosognosia) or understanding and appreciation of medical facts and the ability to use this information to make decisions about medical care or other important activities (capacity). Impairments in awareness and capacity that may be present at the outset or that will arise sooner or later in all patients with dementia due to AD or ADRD dictate the need to engage a care partner in the communication of the diagnosis, optimally from the beginning.

### Toward a sequential strategy for diagnosing neurocognitive disorders: a consensus from the "Act on dementia" European joint action [^bffad5ab]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurocognitive disorders causing progressive cognitive, functional, and behavioral impairment remain underdiagnosed. The needs for a timely diagnosis are now widely acknowledged since person-centered care helps to preserve life quality and prevent crises. One powerful barrier to detection in primary care is the lack of an easy-to-follow stepwise approach, grounded in evidence and consistent with high-quality specialty practice. To help fill this gap, the current European Joint Action proposes a graduated diagnosis strategy tailored to the patients' needs and wills, clarifying appropriate components for primary and specialty care. This strategy considers a first evaluation in primary care that may detect a neurocognitive disorder, that would lead to a second evaluation step allowing etiological diagnosis hypotheses performed mostly by the specialist. A third evaluation stage considering some biological, electrophysiological, or neuroimaging complementary techniques would be proposed to atypical cases or patients willing to consider access to research.

### The role of neuropsychological assessment in the evaluation of patients with cognitive-behavioral change due to suspected Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive impairment and dementia [^b411ae48]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Also of importance when considering the role of neuropsychology in the assessment of cognitive‐behavioral change or suspected AD/ADRD is assessing cognitive trajectory and symptom progression over time. A repeat neuropsychological evaluation provides the opportunity to update diagnostic considerations and recommendations appropriately to meet the patient's changing profile and needs. In the context of an underlying neurodegenerative condition, commonly an individual with subjective cognitive concerns and minimal presumed cognitive decline on initial evaluation will have symptoms that progress over time, and having the ability to closely assess interval changes is critical to ensure a more timely diagnosis and appropriate care. Furthermore, the assessment of change over time can help clarify differential diagnosis when factors such as language or cultural barriers make initial interpretation more challenging. Finally, most individuals lack a neuropsychological baseline for comparison when symptoms first appear. Thus older individuals are encouraged to consider obtaining baseline neuropsychological testing at the time of subjective cognitive concerns, before the onset of overt cognitive‐behavioral changes or major symptoms. Evaluations are reimbursable through Medicare and other payors upon medical necessity, which includes when there are mild or questionable deficits on standard mental status testing or when even subtle concerns are raised in clinical interviews. The frequency of repeat assessments should be dictated by the neuropsychologist. If there are abnormalities raising concern for future decline, a re‐evaluation in 1 year is recommended. Alternatively, an evaluation may be normal, although subjective cognitive decline or other factors may increase the risk of cognitive change; in these instances, a 2‐year re‐evaluation may be more appropriate. In all cases, as the CPG delineates, there is an opportunity to promote brain‐healthy behaviors and to help reduce modifiable risk factors for dementia as part of the neuropsychological evaluation and feedback process.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^a4b3adbb]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Introduction — epidemiology and terminology: Dementia (major neurocognitive disorder) is described as a leading cause of cognitive and functional decline among older adults worldwide; by 2060, 13.9 million Americans age 65 and older are projected to be living with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, although the incidence of dementia may be decreasing. The incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may be twice as high as dementia, and African Americans and Latinx have higher rates of dementia due in part to historical, sociocultural, and healthcare inequities. Although dementia and MCI occur in individuals under age 65, the majority of cases occur in older adults, who are the population of focus in these guidelines.

Diagnostic formulation in suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders — three-step approach and implementation guidance emphasize that the first step is to delineate the patient's cognitive functional status, the second step is to characterize the specific clinical profile of the patient's cognitive–behavioral syndrome, and the third step is to establish the most likely brain disease (or condition) causing the clinical syndrome; a structured and individualized approach detailed in Recommendations 4 to 9 should be used, and for a majority of individuals with a typical presentation of dementia due to AD a first tier of clinical assessments, laboratory tests, and neuroimaging should be sufficient, after which clinicians decide if data are sufficient to reference established clinical diagnostic criteria or if additional tests or referrals are needed, noting that molecular biomarker confirmation may be desired and that despite increasing age raising the likelihood of multiple processes, a specific primary etiologic diagnosis is most likely and should be established and communicated.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). High credibility.

Diagnostic workflow for suspected AD/ADRD emphasizes sequential formulation: In most cases, the goal is to determine whether the patient has a diagnosable brain disease affecting cognition or behavior, with the first step being determination that a person does or does not have dementia and integration of reliable history with performance on tests of cognitive function in multiple domains; the second step — determination of the cognitive-behavioral syndrome — may warrant additional information or specialist consultation, and a neuropsychological evaluation by a neuropsychologist proficient in AD/ADRD assessment is often invaluable and can also be very helpful to suggest next steps; third, clinicians implicate a specific disease and/or consider the likely cause(s) of cognitive impairment or dementia, recognizing a persistent differential diagnosis and using risk and resilience factors and established clinical diagnostic criteria while the field evolves toward separating clinical syndromes from likely neuropathologic changes informed by core and ancillary biomarkers.

### Practical recommendations for timely, accurate diagnosis of symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (MCI and dementia) in primary care: a review and synthesis [^a2da5927]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The accumulation of Aβ is associated with an increased risk of developing cognitive decline and progression towards symptomatic AD. Although all patients with AD demonstrate abnormal Aβ accumulation, that accumulation alone is not sufficient to lead to the clinical presentation of AD. In fact, some individuals with Aβ pathology may never convert to symptomatic phases of AD during their lifetime. In contrast, the presence of a second elevated marker of either tau pathology or neurodegeneration in an individual demonstrating excess Aβ accumulation (i.e. one who is positive on an Aβ biomarker) is associated with greater prognostic predictability, reflected clinically by a more consistent and rapid progression.

In summary, during the preclinical phase of AD, Aβ deposition is followed by a sequence of events, including tauopathy and abnormalities in markers associated with synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death, all of which occur before the onset of cognitive and functional impairments. These data open the possibility for a biomarker‐based AD diagnosis at a disease stage where interventions could be introduced to potentially slow, or even stop, the emergence of symptoms.

Mild cognitive impairment due to AD

Mild cognitive impairment due to AD marks the beginning of the symptomatic stage of the disease. From a biomarker perspective, patients in this phase experience a deceleration or even a plateau in Aβ accumulation. Both tau accumulation and further neurodegeneration, including impaired glucose metabolism and hippocampal atrophy, continue throughout clinical expression of disease and are more tightly correlated with and predictive of the degree of cognitive impairment a person will experience. The effects of AD pathology on cognitive and other clinical manifestations are gradual and progressive, making it presently impossible to define a discrete onset of the clinical state. Eventually, as AD pathology progresses, individuals begin to exhibit subtle cognitive deficits, entering a transitional phase of MCI due to AD, also known as prodromal AD. Although these terms are interchangeable, in this review we will use the term MCI due to AD.

Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

While multiple barriers to timely diagnosis and appropriate disclosure of AD/ADRD exist in primary care, individuals with typical AD dementia can and should be readily diagnosed with confidence in the primary care setting. By gaining proficiency with the testing and processes recommended in this guideline, most PCPs should find it relatively straightforward to suspect and then diagnose dementia likely due to AD in a patient with a typical presentation of gradually progressive memory loss and difficulty with judgment and problem solving, and often spatial and/or temporal orientation, which have impacted ADLs, and in whom cognitive lab panel and brain MRI are also supportive (i.e. unrevealing in the former and consistent with AD in the latter). However, some patients — especially those who are relatively young — may not only present with an unusual history of subtle, atypical, or rapidly progressive symptoms but may also exhibit unusual signs on office‐based examination. Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing subacutely within weeks or months) are considered urgent medical problems requiring rapid, and in some cases inpatient, evaluation and management.

Atypical features may include prominent focal cognitive abnormalities (e.g. aphasia, cortical visual dysfunction), sensorimotor impairment (e.g. visual field cut, limb apraxia or rigidity, myoclonus, eye movement abnormalities, incoordination, gait abnormalities), or profound mood and behavioral symptoms (e.g. disinhibition, manic‐like behavior, flat or indifferent affect, or severe depressive or anxious mood or psychotic thought content). Patients with such signs on examination require an approach with a broader differential diagnosis, which often warrants specialist examination and distinct testing and studies to arrive at a diagnosis and appropriate interdisciplinary care plan.

Other patients may have a history and examination that are incongruent: for example, a patient may not have a history suggestive of delirium but on examination may be highly inattentive or exhibit signs suggestive of a toxic‐metabolic encephalopathy or a related syndrome. Still other patients may present with a history of substantial cognitive–behavioral change in daily life yet have what appears to be a normal examination in an initial office encounter. In patients whose examination may be difficult to interpret in the primary care setting, it is critical to consider and facilitate referral to a specialist with expertise in dementia; and to strongly consider neuropsychological evaluation. Evaluation for suspected rare or rapidly progressive dementia is complex, includes a very broad differential diagnosis, and is best performed by a dementia subspecialist.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^f0573187]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment — clinical characterization and risk: The diagnosis of MCI and/or mild neurocognitive disorder is described as a period prior to dementia in which one exhibits cognitive difficulties that are greater than expected based on demographically appropriate normative data, but not so severe as to warrant a diagnosis of dementia given relative sparing of everyday functioning. Although individuals with MCI often remain stable or revert to cognitively typical ranges, MCI classification does generally confer a greater risk for progression to dementia, and specific criteria for defining MCI in clinical and research settings vary. Subtypes of MCI (amnestic vs. non-amnestic; single vs. multiple domains) may provide additional information about disease severity and breadth of cognitive domains impacted that may be useful in determining etiology, brain regions/systems affected, likelihood of reversion to cognitively unimpaired, or risk of future progression to dementia.

### Quantifying the diagnostic pathway for patients with cognitive impairment: real-world data from seven European and north American countries [^41743213]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

To ensure that patients with dementia and their caregivers receive appropriate treatment and support, early diagnosis is essential but remains challenging. Real-world data from a multi-national, cross-sectional survey of physicians and their patients were analyzed to quantify the diagnostic pathway for dementia, including a focus on severity of patients' cognitive impairment (CI) at the time of symptom onset, referral and subsequent diagnosis. Data were collected for 7,620 patients with CI. Most patients saw a healthcare professional within 1 year of first symptoms and received a diagnosis within 3–7 months of initial consultation. However, only 20% of patients received a diagnosis before their disease progressed beyond the prodromal stage and 23.5% already had moderate CI at diagnosis. These findings show that the goal of identifying and diagnosing CI at the earliest stages of disease is, for many patients, not achieved. Efforts toward public awareness and proactive, earlier detection and intervention, must be maintained-indeed where possible invigorated.

Screening process for pAD

In conclusion, we recommend the following three steps to screen for pAD (figure 3):

Figure 3
Workflow for screening prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Aβ+, positive amyloid-β deposition; ACEIII, Third version of Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination; AD-8, Ascertain Dementia 8-item Questionnaire; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; G3, 3 min version of game-based cognitive assessment; MoCA, Montreal Cognitive Assessment; pAD, prodromal Alzheimer's disease; PDD, Parkinson's disease dementia; PET, positron emission tomography; VaD, vascular dementia.

Step 1: A preliminary screening should be carried out in the community or primary care settings using brief screening scales. Individuals who are suspected to have cognitive impairment are then transferred to specialised outpatient clinics for further examination, including systemic medical history collection, physical examination, laboratory testing and brain imaging. After the initial procedures described above, individuals can be categorised into one of three groups: cognitively normal, dementia and transitional stage. Cognitively normal adults should be followed up. Patients with dementia should be given standardised treatment.

Step 2: Individuals in the transitional stage should proceed to further screening, including 'Aβ+ sensitive' cognitive tests, blood biomarkers and brain atrophy evaluation. Individuals with impaired scores on 'Aβ+ sensitive' tests (such as CaST and metamemory), abnormal blood biomarkers (decreased plasma Aβ42/Aβ40 and increased p-tau181) and brain atrophy in the hippocampus, amygdala, precuneus or temporal lobe should be assigned the label of 'high-risk pAD' and proceed to step 3 for further examination. Patients who are suspected of having other diseases (eg, cognitive impairment caused by vascular dementia or Parkinson's disease) should be given appropriate interventions. Those with no identifiable cause (uncertain aetiology) should proceed to step 3.

Step 3: If the individual is still undiagnosed after all the above examinations, a PET scan or CSF testing should be performed for a definite diagnosis.

### Systematic approach to diagnosing suspected creutzfeldt-jakob disease [^cc179389]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Evaluation of rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is usually challenging. In most cases, patients progress to dementia in weeks to months, and the differential diagnosis is broad. In this case, a woman in her 60s presented with a 1-month history of episodic vertigo, cognitive decline, ataxia and myoclonus. Cerebrospinal fluid total tau was markedly elevated, which was helpful in establishing the diagnosis and discussing prognosis/end-of-life measures with the patient's family. This case summarises a stepwise diagnostic approach for patients with RPD and highlights recent literature on biomarkers of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and autoimmune encephalitis.

### Initial cognitive changes in Parkinson's disease [^76eed2a3]. Movement Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The focus on cognitive impairment in neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, is shifting from the dementia stage to earlier stages of impairment, including mild cognitive impairment. This shift is driven primarily by the desire to improve long-term outcomes by delivering therapeutic interventions earlier in the clinical course, even presymptomatically in those at highest risk, and at the initial stage in the pathophysiological cascade that underpins common dementia syndromes. This article focuses on key findings and challenges in studying earliest stages of cognitive decline in PD, including a detailed examination of neuropsychological testing, cognitive performance in early and prodromal PD, epidemiological research for PD mild cognitive impairment to date, and expert recommendations for assessment. © 2018 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.

1.2 History of cognitive symptoms

In the context of a suspected cognitive–behavioral syndrome in an older adult, the potential for complexity, ambiguity, or misdirection of the response to this question is predictably unpredictable. Because diminished insight is common in individuals with a syndrome of cognitive–behavioral impairment, the patient and their care partner (informant) may have divergent opinions about the nature of the symptoms and their consequences. The likelihood of a potential disagreement in perspectives can be communicated up front and be acknowledged as a useful clue for the clinician (e.g. "This is a safe place and time when you should feel free to disagree with each other: it can help me understand and advise you better"). It may be valuable to interview the patient and informant(s) separately because of discomfort with honest reporting or overt friction. Therefore, the clinician needs to be flexible and to encourage and pursue all lines of the story and, informed by these and other information gathered during or after the visit (post‐visit phone calls are often helpful), integrate perspectives and information into an initial narrative that represents the most likely approximation of the actual events.

The meaning of words like "memory loss" or "confusion" used by the patient and informant may differ substantially from the clinician's sense of those words. The clinician must therefore encourage the patient or informant to elaborate by giving specific examples. The loss of episodic memory that occurs in typical MCI or dementia due to AD involves difficulties with learning and recalling newly acquired information and recent life events. Sometimes patients or informants may use the term "memory loss" when referring to word‐finding difficulty, inattention, loss of geographic orientation, or loss of the ability to perform step‐by‐step tasks. It can be very challenging to distinguish the early stages of cognitive decline due to neurodegenerative disease from normal aging. It is important to skillfully communicate that changes which may be common in individuals with advancing age are not always normal and could benefit from further diagnostic evaluation. Several validated instruments offer structured questionnaires to assist in the organization and reporting of symptoms of cognitive impairment (some of these also include mood/behavior and/or daily function (Table 1)).

Guideline 4 — psychologists seek and provide appropriate consultation in the course of performing evaluations of dementia and age-related cognitive changes — emphasizes that complex issues arise during the evaluation of suspected cognitive decline or dementia, including multiple medical comorbidities or medication side effects, sociobiographical background and cultural origins, genetic and heritability factors, abuse or neglect, questions of legal competence or guardianship, conflicting or unclear assessment results, and families overwhelmed or divided by the potential diagnosis, and for these reasons, integrated health care approaches are particularly well-suited for cognitive decline and dementia care.

### A missed detection of prodromal dementia may be the worst enemy of a timely diagnosis [^1abaf424]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2016). Low credibility.

To face the challenge of the under-diagnosis of dementiaand to meet the crucial need for its timely diagnosis, many countries have adopted a stepwise case-finding diagnostic strategy. The first step usually consists of nonspecialist screening of cognitive impairment in a primary care setting. If it is positive, the patient is referred to a secondary care service where a full evaluation is carried out; if it is negative, the patient is generally referred to a follow-up screening some time later. This strategy probably represents a great advancement in the diagnosis of dementia, and its efficacy is supported by several lines of evidence indicating that cognitive screening can considerably improve the identification of dementia. Nonetheless, it should be noted that a nonspecialist first evaluation has the potential to be rather inaccurate. It can definitely result in false negatives as well as in false positives. For instance, a recent study addressing the effect of screening for cognitive impairment in elderly veterans has shown that many individuals who were found to be normal at a brief cognitive test were recognized as having dementia at a subsequent full evaluation. Conversely, a widespread cognitive screening tool (i.e. the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) was found to yield many false positives when used to detect dementia. A certain number of false negatives may be acceptable for a case-finding strategyand false positives would be an economic, but not a diagnostic issue, as overdiagnosis would likely be amended at the second step of the full evaluation. However, to maximize the benefits of a timely diagnosis of dementia, it is currently believed that it should indeed be made at a prodromal (i.e. at mild cognitive impairment, MCI) stage. At this stage, we would expect the first nonspecialist evaluation to be more inaccurate, especially in terms of false negatives, as prodromal signs of dementia can be subtle and difficult to recognize and require more extensive cognitive examination. Moreover, a missed detection could have worse consequences on the diagnostic process at a prodromal rather than at a more advanced stage of dementia. In fact, it is likely that patients with mild-to-moderate dementia unidentified at the first screening would ask for a new referral very soon, because of significant cognitive and/or behavioral disturbances causing distress to themselves and their families. On the other hand, patients with prodromal dementia going undetected on first screening might not feel the need for a new referral for a long time, because their subtle or selective disturbances are probably less distressing. Thus, an inaccurate first detection of prodromal dementia can significantly delay its recognition and become the worst enemy of a timely diagnosis. In sum, the current diagnostic strategy does not seem to be able to adequately cope with the challenge of a timely diagnosis of prodromal dementia and could thus result in the loss of a whole range of potential benefits: for patients (e.g. improving quality of life), caregivers (e.g. developing appropriate care plans), health care professionals (e.g. providing patients and families with important information), and society (e.g. reducing health care costs). It is likely that in a near future, a more accurate diagnosis of prodromal dementia will be possible in primary care when reliable biomarkers of the disease (e.g. low Aß 42 in the cerebrospinal fluid) or other attractive advanced tests (e.g. the cholinergic stress test)will be routinely available in a clinical setting. In the meanwhile, we believe that it is possible to improve the current strategy by incorporating a new diagnostic stage between the nonspecialist screening and the specialist full evaluation. We envisage an intermediate stage — we may call it a "1.5 stage of full detection" — where a "frontline" dementia specialist (i.e. a behavioral neurologist, a neuropsychologist, a geriatrician, an old age psychiatrist, or an advanced-practice nurse) would cooperate side by side with the primary care doctor, by performing additional skilled evaluations of the patient's cognitive, affective, and behavioral status. The implementation of this new model in countries whose health care system is organized in primary and secondary care would require creating new shared spaces where a close collaboration between generalists and specialists may be achieved (e.g. district memory clinics) and converting a number of specialists to full-time consultants for primary care services. In conclusion, there is current emphasis on the role of primary care services in the diagnosis and management of dementia, and this is certainly important, but it should be borne in mind that we urgently need dementia specialists to assist primary care physicians in the assessment of dementia at a prodromal stage. Yet, dementia specialists are incredibly few, and it takes time to train them. The clock is ticking…

### Improving dementia care: the role of screening and detection of cognitive impairment [^663a59b9]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2013). Low credibility.

The value of screening for cognitive impairment, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease, has been debated for decades. Recent research on causes of and treatments for cognitive impairment has converged to challenge previous thinking about screening for cognitive impairment. Consequently, changes have occurred in health care policies and priorities, including the establishment of the annual wellness visit, which requires detection of any cognitive impairment for Medicare enrollees. In response to these changes, the Alzheimer's Foundation of America and the Alzheimer's Drug Discovery Foundation convened a workgroup to review evidence for screening implementation and to evaluate the implications of routine dementia detection for health care redesign. The primary domains reviewed were consideration of the benefits, harms, and impact of cognitive screening on health care quality. In conference, the workgroup developed 10 recommendations for realizing the national policy goals of early detection as the first step in improving clinical care and ensuring proactive, patient-centered management of dementia.

DETeCD-ADRD recommendations — Recommendation 1 (evaluation trigger and scope): For patients who self-report or whose care partner or clinician report cognitive, behavioral, or functional change, the clinician should initiate a multi-tiered evaluation focused on the problem (Strength of Recommendation A). Any middle-aged or older patient who self-reports — or whose spouse, family, or other informant (or clinician) reports concern regarding symptoms of cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline — should undergo an evaluation to determine whether they might have a cognitive–behavioral syndrome arising as a result of a specific neuropathology, and a clinician should not assume "normality" or ascribe cognitive or behavioral symptoms to "normal aging" without an appropriate evaluation, which would constitute suboptimal care. The evaluation process for possible cognitive or behavioral impairment can be initiated and in most cases completed at any of a variety of clinical practice settings: primary care, specialty care, or dementia subspecialty care, and the practitioner's proficiency with this patient population and the profile of the individual patient should guide the evaluation process. The evaluation begins with a history from not only the patient but also — importantly — from someone who knows the patient well (an informant).

Guideline 11 — appropriate use of longitudinal data: Psychologists make appropriate use of longitudinal data and are frequently asked to perform repeat assessments to follow progression of a condition, track recovery, or track responses to intervention, making use of longitudinal data whenever possible and using existing cognitive data as a baseline to determine magnitudes and rates of cognitive change by follow-up testing. Psychologists are strongly encouraged to utilize prior cognitive data when available, recognize that many cognitive instruments are insensitive to changes over shorter periods and that true cognitive decline may be underestimated if practice effects are not taken into account, and recommend follow-up testing only as appropriate; in most cases, a one-year follow-up interval is adequate for monitoring changes in cognitive performance unless there are reports of more rapid change or new concerns, or the individual is 85 years old or older. Psychologists are strongly encouraged to use statistical methods to assess reliable change so that the extent of change can be interpreted appropriately, with methods cited including the Simple discrepancy score, Standard deviation index, Reliable Change Index (RCI), and Regression-based change formulas.

Guideline 15 — as part of the evaluation process, psychologists recommend appropriate, empirically-based interventions available to people living with cognitive impairment and their family caregivers. In addition to cognitive decline, people living with dementia experience a wide range of changes in daily functioning, mood, behavior, and social relationships. Psychologists play an important role by incorporating a range of interventions to enhance functioning and quality of life. A variety of psychosocial and behavioral interventions focused on the person living with dementia and their caregivers have been developed which can reduce behavioral problems, enhance quality of life, and address unmet needs. Caregiver interventions improve the health and well being of caregivers and also reduce nursing home admission and the negative impact of behavioral and psychological changes exhibited by the person living with dementia.

### Rapidly progressive young-onset dementias: neuropsychiatric aspects [^b7118934]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is roughly defined as neurocognitive decline resulting in dementia or death within 2 years. Although RPDs affect all age groups, many occur in patients with young-onset dementia. Although prion disease (eg, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease) is often thought to be the prototypic rapidly progressive young-onset dementia, the differential diagnosis is broad and some etiologies may be treatable. Hence, an appropriate workup to determine the etiology of RPD is crucial to planning the appropriate management. This article reviews the differential diagnosis, diagnostic workup, and management considerations for this unique patient population.

### The Alzheimer's association clinical practice guideline for the diagnostic evaluation, testing, counseling, and disclosure of suspected Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (DETeCD-ADRD): executive summary of recommendations for specialty care [^7a10aabb]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

2.4 Which patients might be considered for a referral to a specialist?

Some patients — especially those who are relatively young — may not only present with an unusual history of subtle, atypical, or rapidly progressive symptoms but may also exhibit unusual signs on office‐based examination. An evaluation by a specialist or a dementia subspecialist should be strongly considered if a patient presents with atypical cognitive abnormalities (e.g. aphasia, apraxia, agnosia), sensorimotor dysfunction (e.g. cortical visual abnormalities, movement or gait disorders), accompanying mood/behavioral disturbance (e.g. profound anxiety, depression, apathy, psychosis, or changes in personality), rapid progression, or fluctuating course (e.g. suggestive of potential superimposed delirium, LBD, or VCID; Figure 3). Delirium and rapidly progressive dementia (usually defined as developing within weeks or months) are urgent medical problems requiring prompt examination, and in some cases, in‐patient evaluation and management. Patients with atypical forms of neurodegenerative dementias may have substantially different care and management needs and considerations regarding safety than patients with typical presentations of dementia due to AD. Delays in accurate diagnosis and appropriate management of patients with atypical and young‐onset dementias may cause substantial distress, harm, and costs to patients, families, and society, especially when a patient is working and/or raising children at home.

DETeCD-ADRD framework — three-step diagnostic formulation centers on a patient-centered diagnostic evaluation and disclosure process and specifies sequential steps: the first step is to delineate the cognitive functional status, the second step is to characterize the patient's cognitive–behavioral syndrome, and the third step is for the clinician to generate and narrow the differential diagnosis of the likely cause(s) while differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) and other contributors; the guideline also emphasizes identifying accompanying factors or conditions that may exacerbate symptoms and promoting brain-healthy behaviors.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^84082c7d]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Neuropsychological evaluation for differential diagnosis: Psychologists, using specialized neuropsychological tests, assess cognitive and behavioral changes and distinguish typical changes from early signs of neuropathology. Neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing remains the most effective differential diagnostic methods for discriminating pathophysiological dementia from age-related cognitive decline, cognitive difficulties that are depression related, and other related disorders. Although biomarkers are used broadly in research and some clinical settings, neuropsychological evaluation and cognitive testing are necessary to determine the onset of dementia, the functional expression of the disease process, the rate of decline, the functional capacities of the individual, and response to disease-modifying therapies, and while biomarkers can detect the underlying neuropathologic changes, cognitive testing is necessary to determine how the disease is impacting one's functioning.

### Rapidly progressive Alzheimer disease… [^f62602de]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Various definitions for rapid have been used in previous studies. For example, the word has been used to describe survival shorter than 4 years6 and MMSE score decreases of more than 5 points per year, 41 more than 3 points per year, 42 more than 4 points per 6 months, 43 or more than 2. 56 points per year, 44 as well as Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score progression from 1 to 2 or 3 within a maximum of 3 years. 45 In a meta-analysis, Ito et al46 observed a mean MMSE score decrease of 5. 5 points per year in patients with mild to moderate AD. An attempt to propose a consensus defined rapid cognitive decline as a decrease of 3 or more MMSE points per 6-month period.
47. In another prospective study, 43
24. 8% of a cohort with AD experienced rapid decline, defined as a 4-point decrease in MMSE score within 6 months. In a recent study by Wallin et al, 49 approximately 8% of the study population with AD had a significantly higher mortality rate and mean cognitive decline of 4.

9 MMSE points per year. Table 2 gives an overview of studies with different designs that show rpAD and its frequency. Preprogression rates of MMSE score decline have been shown to correlate with speed of further deterioration, 41 and early loss of at least 4 MMSE points within 6 months predicts poor outcome. 51 Also, baseline cognitive status among patients with AD predicts speed of decline in functional basic-care abilities. 66 Baseline level of cognition does not necessarily correlate with mortality rate; the rate of cognitive decline showed substantial variability in prospective investigations. 68 A recent meta-analysis46 demonstrated that baseline Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale–Cognitive values represent a covariate in speed of deterioration. We encourage discussion to more clearly define rpAD in terms of survival time, cognitive decline, and functional decrease. A uniform definition would facilitate AD research and render results more comparable overall.

Classic AD and rpAD features are summarized in Table 5, but data are lacking. Based on our review of the literature pertaining to rpAD, we suggest that rapid, in this context, should be defined as an MMSE score decrease of 6 points per year, consistent with the proposal by Soto et al. 47 Given the knowledge regarding nonlinear decline, it is important to relate the speed of deterioration to disease stage to avoid false conclusions of heterogeneity.

### Rate of progression differs in frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer disease [^1c2460d3]. Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare survival and rates of cognitive and functional decline in patients with autopsy-confirmed frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer disease (AD) in a large multicenter study.

Background

Despite advances in the clinical characterization of FTD, little is known about its rate of progression. Characterizing survival and rate of decline in FTD is important because it can provide prognostic guidelines and benchmarks to use in the evaluation of disease-modifying drugs.

Methods

Seventy patients with FTD and 70 patients with AD who were followed by seven Alzheimer disease research centers until confirmation of diagnosis at autopsy were matched for overall age, education, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score at initial evaluation. Survival and rates of cognitive and functional decline were compared.

Results

Patients with FTD had significantly shorter survival from initial evaluation to death than patients with AD (FTD = 4.2 years, AD = 6.0 years; log-rank test = 5.17, p < 0.05), and they declined significantly faster over one year on the MMSE (mean annual rate of change: -6.7 points for FTD vs -2.3 points for AD). A significantly greater proportion of patients with FTD were impaired in basic activities of daily living (ADLs) at initial evaluation, and lost the capacity for independent or minimally-assisted ADLs over the subsequent year.

Conclusions

The results are consistent with shorter survival and faster rates of cognitive and functional decline in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) compared to those with Alzheimer disease (AD). This suggests that FTD follows a more malignant disease course than AD once dementia is clinically recognized.

### The role of neuropsychological assessment in the evaluation of patients with cognitive-behavioral change due to suspected Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive impairment and dementia [^847e0018]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

As it currently stands, the rate of timely diagnosis and appropriate disclosure is inadequately low and is especially protracted for individuals with so‐called "atypical" dementia syndromes such as behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia and primary progressive aphasiaor dementias of early onset. It is the hope that these recommendations will be prioritized by providers and resourced by health care systems to be seamlessly integrated into practice. The aim is to aid clinicians in diagnosing the illness in a timely manner, and to define the symptom profile and the likely underlying disease so that a patient‐centered care plan can be developed to optimize quality of life for the patient and family, and to improve outcomes in care settings. With respect to neuropsychology, the guidelines suggest that a more comprehensive evaluation can be especially beneficial when office‐based cognitive assessment is not sufficiently informative or in cases with a level of complexity that leaves the clinician with residual uncertainty surrounding interpretation — we agree that this is well supported by the interpretation of evidence and consensus (as detailed and supported in the CPG evidence review, rationale, and processes), and informed by the principles of good care practices. Indeed, neuropsychological evaluation is critical in these cases and can significantly aid in the assessment of the level of severity of functional status and cognitive syndrome, and in narrowing the probable underlying etiology. Furthermore, we find the positioning, details, and logistics well balanced and appropriate surrounding the addition of neuropsychological evaluation in AD and ADRD care. Specifically, (1) when and where in the evaluation process neuropsychological assessment is necessary; (2) in whom there may be most benefit; (3) what should ideally be assessed, reported, and communicated; and (4) the general "how" to incorporate neuropsychological evaluation in the flow of a patient‐centered and clinician‐orchestrated process in various clinic settings. It is our belief that the overall CPG provides a structured approach with sufficient leeway for clinician proficiency and judgment.

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^ef4686c4]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Staging of dementia — general guidance emphasizes that progressive dementias are generally staged globally according to the level of cognitive and functional impairment, and the same categories may be used to describe the degree of severity of any dementia, yet the staging criteria have not been well validated for non-Alzheimer's dementias; specific functional staging (FAST staging) has also been developed, is widely used, and can be very useful in tracking the course of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. Assessment should consider that the ability to perform a specific function depends on baseline skills, acquired deficits, and the social environment; consequently, the severity of illness should be assessed in the context of past functioning in several domains, and behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms are not stage specific.

### Development and validation of a deep learning model for earlier detection of cognitive decline from clinical notes in electronic health records [^a494de3c]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Fourth, the generalizability of the deep learning model to other stages of cognitive decline or a general population remains unknown, because it was developed and tested using a retrospective MCI cohort and implemented notes written during the 4 years preceding MCI diagnosis. Because we will use the model to screen prospective patients who do not yet have an MCI diagnosis, our next step will be to evaluate the performance of the deep learning model in detecting cognitive decline in a more general older population sample and beyond the 4-year time window.

Fifth, the model considered clinical notes in isolation from other EHR data, such as imaging data and cognitive scores. Integrating these data with our model poses several challenges. Few patients have imaging data and/or cognitive scores. In addition, radiology reports often lack the information (eg, the presence or absence of focal atrophy patterns) most helpful for predicting progressive cognitive decline. Another challenge with data integration involved cognitive testing, which was performed infrequently in nondementia specialist settings, and cognitive scores were often only documented as free text in notes. Any mention of cognitive tests in notes, even with normal scores, could indicate cognitive concerns prompting clinical evaluation. Such proxies for cognitive decline were classified as evidence of cognitive decline by the model. In follow-up studies, we will extract cognitive scores from the EHR and consider how to best leverage those data in models to predict future cognitive decline.

Sixth, our model may not distinguish well between reversible and progressive causes of cognitive decline. Although we have considered some transient or reversible contributors to cognitive decline, there are likely factors that were not considered. The models were designed to identify early cognitive symptoms 4 years before a diagnosis of MCI is made and so we had the advantage of knowing that the patients' cognitive function ultimately decreased sufficiently to merit a diagnosis of MCI, which increases the likelihood of these early symptoms being relevant to progressive cognitive decline. However, once a patient receives a diagnosis of MCI, there is still a chance of reversion to normal cognition as opposed to progression to dementia. In addition, our model could not yet differentiate the stages of cognitive decline (eg, SCD, MCI, or dementia) or predict progression of early stages of cognitive decline to MCI or dementia. To better understand the cognitive decline identified by the model and long-term outcomes, future efforts are warranted to follow up a retrospective population with initial cognitive decline for outcomes using longitudinal EHR data.

### Clinical use of amyloid-positron emission tomography neuroimaging: practical and bioethical considerations [^9e586edf]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). Low credibility.

Further pressures might come from patients and families themselves, demanding that amyloid-PET be performed, possibly when it is not medically indicated or when symptoms are not present. For example, first-degree relatives of patients diagnosed with AD may request to be tested with amyloid-PET. Fig. 1 depicts a hypothetical case in which a physician must decide the appropriate steps to take when faced with a patient who has had a history of progressive language problems and requests a scan. In this scenario, the physician needs to decide if the patient is an appropriate subject for amyloid-PET. As recommended by the AUC, before a decision regarding amyloid-PET, a standard work-up for causes of this patient's symptoms should be completed to establish the potential for AD in the differential diagnosis and to exclude other causes of the patient's language complaint. This may include more detailed language and cognitive testing to confirm the presence and type of language deficit, as well as recommended laboratory and imaging tests if indicated. It is recommended to defer ordering amyloid-PET pending the completion of other testing and only if knowledge of amyloid-β pathology will likely increase diagnostic certainty, observing the principle of beneficence.

There are also potential issues to consider regarding the underuse or omission of amyloid-PET. Some patients with cognitive impairment may be misdiagnosed and, either because of misplaced confidence in clinical methods or failure to consider all potential causes, may not be judged candidates for amyloid-PET. In such situations, the potential benefit of correcting diagnostic errors with amyloid-PET would fail to be realized. Additionally, some patients with high cognitive reserve may tolerate significantly greater amyloid-β burden with fewer symptoms than those with low cognitive reserve, but when they develop dementia, they decline more rapidly. In some instances, these patients may be regarded as "worried well" at an initial evaluation and not be considered for amyloid-PET. Then they and their families would lose the advantages associated with obtaining an early and accurate explanation for their complaint. Whether to consider the use of amyloid-PET in situations such as these will have to be made on a case-by-case basis considering the full context of the clinical circumstances.

Core element one: whom to evaluate and how to establish shared goals — evaluation initiation and partnership are emphasized, including that "Any middle-aged or older patient who self-reports — or whose spouse, family, or other informant (or clinician) reports — concerns regarding symptoms of cognitive, behavioral, or functional decline — should undergo an evaluation to determine whether they might have a cognitive-behavioral syndrome arising due to specific neuropathologic changes (Recommendation 1)". The guidance states that "A clinician should not assume 'normality' or ascribe cognitive or behavioral symptoms to 'normal aging' without an appropriate evaluation", and that optimal evaluation "is grounded in the biopsychosocial model of health and illness". It highlights "the critical importance — in most situations — of including both the patient and an informant or care partner in the diagnostic and disclosure process", and notes that dementia-related impairments "dictate the need to engage a care partner in the communication of the diagnosis, optimally from the beginning". For communication and goal-setting, "The clinician should use patient-centered communication to develop a partnership with the patient or with the patient and a care partner to (1) establish shared goals for the evaluation process and (2) assess capacity (understanding and appreciation) to engage", and it affirms that "The timely evaluation of an individual with cognitive or behavioral symptoms concerning for MCI or dementia represents best medical practice".

Interprofessional dementia evaluation — psychologists are aware that full evaluation of possible dementia is an interprofessional, holistic process involving other health care providers, respect other professional perspectives and approaches, and communicate fully and refer appropriately to support integration of the full range of information for informing decisions about diagnosis, level of severity, and elements of the treatment plan. The rationale notes that no single provider is ever likely to have all the essential information that can contribute to making an accurate diagnosis and that an interdisciplinary team is most likely to provide all the essential information necessary to make an accurate diagnosis and develop a comprehensive treatment plan.

### Rapidly progressive dementias-aetiologies, diagnosis and management [^8a7330aa]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2022). High credibility.

Rapidly progressive dementias (RPDs) are a group of heterogeneous disorders that include immune-mediated, infectious and metabolic encephalopathies, as well as prion diseases and atypically rapid presentations of more common neurodegenerative diseases. Some of these conditions are treatable, and some must be diagnosed promptly because of their potential infectivity. Prion disease is considered to be the prototypical RPD, but over the past two decades, epidemiological reports and the identification of various encephalitis-mediating antibodies have led to a growing recognition of other encephalopathies as potential causes of rapid cognitive decline. Knowledge of RPD aetiologies, syndromes and diagnostic work-up protocols will help clinicians to establish an early, accurate diagnosis, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality, especially in immune-mediated and other potentially reversible dementias. In this Review, we define the syndrome of RPD and shed light on its different aetiologies and on secondary factors that might contribute to rapid cognitive decline. We describe an extended diagnostic procedure in the context of important differential diagnoses, discuss the utility of biomarkers and summarize potential treatment options. In addition, we discuss treatment options such as high-dose steroid therapy in the context of therapy and diagnosis in clinically ambiguous cases.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of dementia and age-related cognitive change [^6bedbaa4]. The American Psychologist (2012). Medium credibility.

Dementia evaluation — psychiatric comorbidity and cognitive symptoms: Cognitive decline or complaints often co-occur with mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety, and declines in attention, concentration, or increased indecisiveness and slowed thinking are included in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder and a major depressive episode. Given the complex relationship between mood/psychiatric symptoms and cognitive changes, familiarity with the cognitive impact of common psychiatric disorders is essential for differentiating between psychiatrically-related cognitive impairments, mood and behavioral changes that may sometimes signal early stages of a neurodegenerative process, and late-life mood and behavior changes that may develop in response to experiencing declining cognition.

### Blood-based biomarkers for Alzheimer's pathology and the diagnostic process for a disease-modifying treatment: projecting the impact on the cost and wait times [^a068e526]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2020). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Model structure

Our model builds on previous work that combined a Markov model of disease development and progression, a systems dynamics model that uses predicted capacity for specialist visits and confirmatory biomarker testing to estimate wait times, and an accounting facility that tracks associated costs (Supplemental Exhibit 1). 2, 7 We improve upon limitations in the previous work in three ways. First, the new model incorporates information on sensitivity and specificity of initial and confirmatory tests to estimate false‐positive rates, whereas the previous model assumed "perfect" tests. Second, we account for the fact that cognitively normal but worried patients rather than only those with actual cognitive decline will seek out evaluation. Third, the model now assumes that patients may seek another evaluation after having previously tested negative.

The model simulates the journey of patients seeking evaluation for subjective memory complaints or as part of a wellness exam. The model has two interacting layers. The first layer captures one of four true health states: cognitively normal, MCI due to AD, MCI due to other causes, and dementia. We define AD based on amyloid positivity and cognitive decline. The second layer captures a patient's journey through different evaluation stages: initial evaluation with cognitive and/or blood‐based biomarker testing by a primary care clinician, neurocognitive testing by a dementia specialist, and confirmatory biomarker testing with positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing. For example, a cognitively normal, but worried patient starts in the "Cognitively Normal ‐ Screening Naïve" state and moves forward to receive evaluation at the primary care setting. If the patient tests (false) positive, they can move to be evaluated by a specialist and then receive a confirmatory biomarker test. If the patient is tested negative during any one of evaluation stages, the patient is sent to the "Cognitively Normal ‐ Screening Experienced" state.

### CJD mimics and chameleons [^8c45364d]. Practical Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is a clinical syndrome that is not well defined and little studied. There are some excellent and comprehensive reviews, including by Murray, in this journal. The archetypal diagnosis is Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), and most experiences have been reported from specialist prion disease referral centres and from a small number of specialist cognitive clinics. Some have used a definition of a diagnosis of dementia within 1 year of symptom onset, although this is problematic, as initial symptoms are often non-specific and merge with highly prevalent complaints in the population; therefore, the exact time of onset is hard to pinpoint. Nevertheless, the concept of RPD is sensible, as it differentiates a set of syndromes and diagnoses that are, to a significant degree, distinct from those seen in the differential diagnosis of common neurodegenerative disorders. CJD is associated with progression from normal function to death in under a year in approximately 90% of patients. Those reporting the history of patient with CJD witness a cognitive and neurological disorder leading to obvious progressive changes in everyday functions over periods of weeks or a month's duration, rather than noticing change over 6 months to a year, which would be more typical of a common dementia.

There are no population studies of RPD, and the experience in prion disease referral centres is likely to be substantially different from the reality in primary and secondary care centres. Referral patterns vary considerably between countries, based on historical factors and the services provided by a specialist clinic. The proportion of RPD patients eventually diagnosed as prion disease varies in reports from 20% to the large majority (> 80% in our case). This variation relates to the considerable amount of filtering done by local physicians before patients are referred.

Undoubtedly, many patients with rapid changes in their function and dementia have a delirium, recognised by acute or subacute deficits in attention; concentration and orientation; a cognitive disorder and an explanatory toxic, metabolic or infective physiological problem (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth edition). A key feature here is the identification through history taking of a pre-existing and more insidiously progressive cognitive disorder. Similarly, multiple strokes, viral encephalitis and brain tumours might meet our working definition of RPD but are readily identified at initial assessments. Here, we focus more on particularly difficult cases that have made it through the filters of local physicians and were therefore challenging to differentiate from CJD.

### Dementia: timely diagnosis and early intervention [^bd5e03f5]. BMJ (2015). Excellent credibility.

How can clinicians recognise dementia?

Diagnosing dementia can be difficult owing to its insidious onset, symptoms resembling "normal ageing" memory loss, and a diversity of other presenting symptoms — for example, difficulty in finding words or making decisions. An individual's ability to accommodate, compensate, or even deny his or her symptoms in the early stages should also be considered. The individual's family may also have noticed difficulties in communication and personality or mood changes; family concern is of particular importance. Increasing frequency of patients' visits to their general practice, missed appointments, or confusion over drugs may also be warning signs.

Diagnosis of subtype is important given differences in management, disease course, and outcomes for different dementias; awareness of early symptoms in less common dementias can assist generalists in deciding to which specialist services patients are referred (box 1). Duration over which symptoms have developed is also important, with Alzheimer's disease tending to have a more insidious onset than vascular dementia.

Considerations for implementation — triage urgency and referral: The diagnosis of delirium requires urgent or emergent care across settings, rapidly progressive dementia requires urgency and specialist involvement, and atypical or early-onset presentations should usually involve prompt specialist referral; atypical findings may include attentional impairments, prominent language or social–behavioral abnormalities, sensory or motor dysfunction of cerebral origin, and cognitive performance confounded by educational/occupational attainment.

Procedural guidelines — Guideline 7: Psychologists conduct a clinical interview as part of the evaluation, as although objective testing provides valuable data for diagnostic purposes, the clinical interview remains one of the central elements of an in-depth assessment for dementia. Clinical interviews with the client and knowledgeable informants provide a more complete picture of the person's history, daily functioning, support systems, and other social and psychological resources, and directly interviewing the person communicates respect while allowing firsthand evaluation of cognitive function and awareness of cognitive and behavioral changes. The clinical interview also enables discernment of psychosocial stressors or other mental health problems that may be contributing to cognitive change, and such data obtained from direct interviews are described as invaluable for both diagnostic and intervention planning purposes.

Guideline 2 — psychologists performing evaluations of dementia are familiar with the prevailing diagnostic nomenclature and specific diagnostic criteria — states that updating of knowledge is important to sustain a high level of proficiency in assessing cognitive disorders, that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) contains diagnostic criteria for major and mild neurocognitive disorder, that in general a major neurocognitive disorder due to a likely neurodegenerative etiology is consistent with dementia while mild neurocognitive disorder is consistent with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and that major or mild neurocognitive disorder can also be due to non-degenerative etiologies such as traumatic brain injury, infection, or other disease processes; separate from DSM-5, familiarity with other diagnostic schemes such as International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes is encouraged, and for Alzheimer's disease, guidelines have also been provided by task forces jointly established by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Alzheimer's Association (AA).

### American psychiatric association practice guideline for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. second edition [^86521f36]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2007). Medium credibility.

Prevalence and course of dementia — age-stratified rates and etiologies are described: prevalence rates approximate 5%–8% of individuals over age 65 years, 15%–20% of individuals over age 75 years, and 25%–50% of individuals over age 85 years, with Alzheimer's disease as the most common cause for 50%–75% of total cases; pure vascular disease may account for 5%–20% of cases and mixed dementia occurs at least as frequently, and dementia with Lewy bodies may account for up to 20% of individuals with dementia. Course depends on etiology, with Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia having an insidious onset and gradual decline, whereas vascular dementia may be characterized by more acute onset and stepwise decline; other dementias may be progressive, static, or occasionally remitting, and the reversibility of a dementia is a function of the underlying etiology and of the availability and timely application of effective treatment.

Primary care workflow during the AWV — assessment without an informant and communication to patients: According to the algorithm, any patient who does not have an informant present should be assessed with a structured tool, and for such patients completion of this structured assessment can be administered by trained medical staff as the first step for cognitive impairment detection. To increase acceptance, the reason can be normalized with a statement such as, "This is something I do for all of my older patients as part of their annual visit", and when the initial assessment prompts further evaluation, explanation of results should be deferred until a more comprehensive evaluation has been completed; an example statement is, "There are many reasons for not getting every answer correct. More evaluation will help us determine that".

### Neuroimaging of rapidly progressive dementias, part 1: neurodegenerative etiologies [^9c3816c8]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

Most dementias begin insidiously, developing slowly and generally occurring in the elderly age group. The so-called rapidly progressive dementias constitute a different, diverse collection of conditions, many of which are reversible or treatable. For this reason, prompt identification and assessment of acute and subacute forms of dementia are critical to effective treatment. Numerous other entities within this category of presenile rapid-onset dementias are untreatable such as the prion-related diseases. Neuroimaging aids in the diagnosis and evaluation of many of these rapidly progressive dementias, which include myriad conditions ranging from variations of more common neurodegenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia; infectious-related dementias such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome dementia; autoimmune and malignancy-related conditions; to toxic and metabolic forms of encephalopathy. This first of a 2-part review will specifically address the ability of MR imaging and ancillary neuroimaging strategies to support the diagnostic evaluation of rapidly progressive dementias due to neurodegenerative causes.

As the number of older Americans grows, the prevalence of dementia is increasing. Older patients who present to primary care offices often have some form of dementia, but various factors can cause the diagnosis to be missed or delayed. Physicians can work to proactively assess dementia in their patients and provide a timely diagnosis. The diagnostic process for dementia includes screening for pathology and, when indicated, conducting a cognitive evaluation and performing a differential diagnosis. Several brief but reliable tools are available to aid in screening and evaluating patients for dementia.

### Nationally informed recommendations on approaching the detection, assessment, and management of mild cognitive impairment [^d21df2a5]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Prior to the usual clinical symptoms of dementia, there can be subtle changes in cognitive function that differ from the normal age-related cognitive decline, which has been termed mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The increase in the numbers of individuals with possible MCI presenting to health care professionals, notably, General Practitioners (GPs), is going to rise dramatically in the coming years. With ever increasing demands on GPs, it is therefore timely to provide information that can be accessed by health care professionals to assist them in making appropriate diagnoses and to provide the most relevant, evidence-based treatment options. We have provided a comprehensive list of recommendations that aim to address key aspects of MCI in primary care. Specifically, these relate to detection and diagnosis; sharing the diagnosis, monitoring, and follow up; practical interventions to potentially delay progression; and personalizing care — planning, engagement, and patient motivation for the long term.

### Patterns of cognitive decline prior to dementia in persons with mild cognitive impairment [^5df16017]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Only a limited number of studies have investigated the decline of discrete cognitive domains as individuals progress from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Thus, the goal of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the cognitive changes underway during the years preceding a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to compare these changes to those found in MCI participants who do not progress to dementia. Participants were compared as a function of whether they later converted to AD (n = 47) or not (n = 74). Cognitive change was assessed prior to the conversion year, using that year as a starting point. A combination of polynomial regression analyses and mixed ANOVAs assessed 1) the trajectory of cognitive decline for each domain and 2) the differences between non-progressors and those who had converted to AD. The different cognitive domains demonstrated very different patterns of decline in the group of MCI progressors. A quadratic function, i.e., many years of stable performance followed by a rapid decline just prior to diagnosis, was observed for delayed recall, working memory, and spatial memory. In contrast, a gradual linear decline was observed for immediate recall, executive function, and visuo-spatial abilities. Finally, language in progressors was impaired on all time periods relative to non-progressors, but there was no further change between the first assessments and conversion to AD. Individuals with MCI who progress to AD show abnormal cognition at least two years prior to their dementia diagnosis. The pattern of symptom change observed appears to depend upon the cognitive domain and thus, clinical studies should not assume similar rate of decline across domains. In contrast and, apart from verbal memory, the non-progressors present a performance similar to that of healthy older adults.

3.2 Determining the need for initial workup and determining the level of concern for AD

The HCP should assess whether the patient has objective cognitive symptoms that warrant further evaluation (Figure 1, Step 1). If no objective cognitive symptoms are present and/or the patient declines further workup, no additional follow‐up should be conducted. It may be suggested that the patient be reassessed in 6 to 12 months if the cognitive symptoms persist. If the patient has objective cognitive symptoms and is amenable to further testing, an initial workup should be initiated. The initial workup may occur during the same visit or at a follow‐up visit.

The initial workup should include cognitive screening, depression and/or neurobehavioral screening, and routine bloodwork to evaluate for potential treatable causes of cognitive impairment (e.g. vitamin B12 deficiency, thyroid abnormalities) (Figure 1, Step 2). Upon reviewing the results of the initial workup, the HCP should determine the patient's level of risk for AD in accordance with local clinical and practice standards. If AD is suspected as the cause of cognitive impairment, the HCP should discuss the results with the patient and care partner, ensuring their interest in continued workup before proceeding. Conversely, if the patient's cognitive impairment is not thought to be caused by AD, the patient should be evaluated for non‐AD causes of cognitive impairment.

3.3 Conducting a BBM test in primary or secondary care

The next step is to conduct a BBM test in either primary or secondary care (Figure 1, Step 3). This choice is driven by how comfortable the primary care HCP is in interpreting and disclosing BBM test results and associated wait times for specialty care. If the HCP is comfortable interpreting a BBM test, an AD BBM test for triaging can be ordered and conducted in primary care. Structural neuroimaging tests, such as brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans, can also be ordered concurrently or sequentially if these resources are readily available. BBM tests are anticipated to become more accessible than structural imaging modalities, potentially leading to quicker availability of BBM test results. Consequently, some patients may choose to forego neuroimaging at this stage.

### Recent advances in screening for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease [^a67b6e0d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

In recent years, scientific understanding of the pathophysiology underlying Alzheimer disease (AD) has advanced substantially. Among the most transformative of discoveries is the existence of biomarkers, such as Aβ42, which can manifest in the central nervous system decades before the onset of disease-associated dementia. By detecting these biological entities early, clinicians can close diagnostic delays and substantially improve outcomes for patients with AD. With prompt news of a diagnosis, patients can initiate long-term planning and devise goals for treatment while their cognition is relatively intact. To differentiate among different forms of dementia, neurologists and supporting clinicians should additionally capitalize on the availability of validated screening tools. Increasingly adopted, tests such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment yield highly sensitive, specific findings that can improve the standard of care. These results, when paired with insights gleaned from patient histories and clinical examinations, can further inform treatment-decision making and help ensure that patients receive care tailored to their unique circumstances and needs.

### Rapidly progressive dementia in an elderly man [^23a083de]. Practical Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

CNS cryptococcosis typically presents as a subacute meningoencephalitis in most of both people living with HIV and HIV-uninfected individuals with features including meningism, fever, headache, focal neurological deficits and vomiting. However, cryptococcal meningitis rarely presents as rapidly progressive dementia and mimicking traditional dementia syndromes such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. As such, cryptococcal meningitis may be misdiagnosed as these non-infective syndromes.

Rapidly progressive dementia has many causes that are often reversible, and patients need extensive diagnostic testing to identify treatable causes. However, in resource-constrained settings with limited diagnostic capabilities, establishing a definitive diagnosis requires a prioritised stepwise diagnostic approach focused on identifying potentially reversible causes. It is also important in the local setting to have a comprehensive understanding of the most common causes of rapidly progressive dementia, as causes differ by region, with infections likely being more common in low-resource settings such as Zambia. Therefore, it is important to exclude infective processes early in the diagnostic workup.

Key points

Cryptococcal meningitis may present as rapidly progressive dementia in people without HIV.
Where resources are limited, workup for rapidly progressive dementia should proceed in a prioritised, stepwise fashion based on prevailing local epidemiology.
Identifying reversible causes of rapidly progressive dementia remains the priority, including in settings with resource limitations.
Infective causes of rapidly progressive dementia may be more common in regions where CNS infections are prevalent, even in people with normal immunity.

### Early diagnosis of dementia [^0927a101]. American Family Physician (2001). Low credibility.

Until recently, the most significant issue facing a family physician regarding the diagnosis and treatment of dementia was ruling out delirium and potentially treatable etiologies. However, as more treatment options become available, it will become increasingly important to diagnose dementia early. Dementia may be suspected if memory deficits are exhibited during the medical history and physical examination. Information from the patient's family members, friends and caregivers may also point to signs of dementia. Distinguishing among age-related cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease may be difficult and requires evaluation of cognitive and functional status. Careful medical evaluation to exclude treatable causes of cognitive impairment is important. Patients with early dementia may benefit from formal neuropsychologic testing to aid in medical and social decision-making. Follow-up by the patient's family physician is appropriate in most patients. However, a subspecialist may be helpful in the diagnosis and management of patients with dementia with an unusual presentation or following an atypical course.

### Alzheimer's disease: the benefits of early treatment [^e4a484ab]. European Journal of Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review was to summarize research on the clinical benefits of early treatment for Alzheimer's disease via a focused discussion of data on donepezil. Well-controlled clinical trials demonstrate that donepezil is effective in stabilizing or slowing progressive decline in cognition, function, and behavior. Several studies reveal statistically significant and clinically meaningful advantages to initiating treatment early in the course of the disease. Benefits of donepezil treatment include behavioral stabilization and preserved independence, in addition to slowed cognitive decline. Epidemiologic studies and evidence from histopathology underlie a rationale for treating patients who are cognitively impaired but do not have dementia. Clinical trials in such patients indicate that treating patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) may delay the onset of Alzheimer's dementia. Substantial evidence favors initiating treatment early in the course of dementia and reinforces the necessity to assess behavior and activities of daily living to accurately evaluate treatment response. Results of early studies of donepezil in MCI are promising and suggest directions for further research.

### The role of neuropsychological assessment in the evaluation of patients with cognitive-behavioral change due to suspected Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive impairment and dementia [^fb507de6]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

An evaluation, ideally, should be structured around a referral question guided by a standardized mental status examination, which assists the referring provider in determining whether referral for further testing is appropriate and, if so, to define the referral question for the neuropsychologist. For any clinician, brief cognitive assessments can provide a quick estimate of an individual's cognitive function and identify those individuals who would benefit from a more detailed cognitive evaluation. However, the referral question may be different for primary care as opposed to specialty care clinicians, as the complexity that prompts a referral for primary care may be less than that required by specialty care. In addition, primary care providers often face significant time limitations that constrain their assessments, which can translate to less well‐defined or well‐sourced referrals and may require a more comprehensive approach to evaluation in order to address a broader referral question. Nonetheless, limitations in clinicians' bandwidths are widespread across disciplines and clinical settings (primary, specialty, and subspecialty care), and consequently neuropsychological evaluation can provide an added level of comprehensive diagnostic clarification and individualized patient care, filling a much‐needed gap. Neuropsychological evaluations are comprehensive, often taking several hours depending on the referral question, and optimally provide a more refined, quantitative assessment of an individual's history and level of functioning cognitively, behaviorally, and in daily life. The examination allows for a targeted assessment of change across various aspects of cognition, and it typically includes standardized and normed evaluation of premorbid functioning, and the domains of learning and memory, attention, executive functioning, visuospatial functioning, and language, which cannot be obtained through brief standardized assessments or bedside examination. An evaluation also often assesses mood and psychological functioning, which may be otherwise overlooked, although these factors can have implications for both current cognitive functioning and risk for decline. Similarly, the neuropsychologist is allowed the time, reimbursed by insurance in the context of medical necessity, to gather a comprehensive and detailed history from a review of records, and an interview with the individual and their care partner, which can provide additional important information as well as assist in goal‐setting and future planning. Overall, the history and cognitive profile taken together can be greatly informative in clarifying the individual's cognitive profile and the underlying neurological basis of their presenting symptoms and behavior, and in communicating the results to both the patient and the referring provider.

### Patterns of cognitive decline prior to dementia in persons with mild cognitive impairment [^a4724f5a]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

Abstract

Only a limited number of studies have investigated the decline of discrete cognitive domains as individuals progress from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. Thus, the goal of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the cognitive changes underway during the years preceding a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD), and to compare these changes to those found in MCI participants who do not progress to dementia. Participants were compared as a function of whether they later converted to AD (n = 47) or not (n = 74). Cognitive change was assessed prior to the conversion year, using that year as a starting point. A combination of polynomial regression analyses and mixed ANOVAs assessed 1) the trajectory of cognitive decline for each domain and 2) the differences between non-progressors and those who had converted to AD. The different cognitive domains demonstrated very different patterns of decline in the group of MCI progressors. A quadratic function, i.e. many years of stable performance followed by a rapid decline just prior to diagnosis, was observed for delayed recall, working memory, and spatial memory. In contrast, a gradual linear decline was observed for immediate recall, executive function, and visuo-spatial abilities. Finally, language in progressors was impaired on all time periods relative to non-progressors, but there was no further change between the first assessments and conversion to AD. Individuals with MCI who progress to AD show abnormal cognition at least two years prior to their dementia diagnosis. The pattern of symptom change observed appears to depend upon the cognitive domain and thus, clinical studies should not assume similar rate of decline across domains. In contrast and, apart from verbal memory, the non-progressors present a performance similar to that of healthy older adults.

### Computerized cognitive testing to capture cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease: longitudinal findings from the ARMADA study [^145e4049]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

1 BACKGROUND

Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiological change is the most common cause of cognitive decline and dementia. Therefore, timely detection and tracking of AD‐related cognitive decline have become a public health priority. Here, timely detection refers to identifying emerging cognitive impairment at a stage when an individual is still (relatively) independent, also referred to as mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with the goal to preserve as much independence for as long as possible. Subsequently, tracking cognition longitudinally in those with MCI or mild dementia due to AD is important for monitoring disease severity and optimizing patient care, as it allows for time to build a care team and prepare future planning. Finally, given currently available and upcoming disease‐modifying treatments in those with MCI or mild AD dementia, as well as emerging secondary prevention trials that target earlier, preclinical stages of AD, assessing cognition in individuals with AD pathophysiological change has become more relevant to identify treatment candidates and evaluate putative treatment effects.

In‐clinic paper‐and‐pencil–based neuropsychological assessments are considered the gold standard for evaluating cognition in older adults; these assessments typically comprise various individual tests that cover multiple cognitive domains. However, assessing and scoring these in‐clinic assessments is time‐consuming and older adults often experience them as burdensome, which may cause them to abort the testing procedure or avoid follow‐up testing. Moreover, a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation is not always readily available due to long wait times and may not always be suitable for widescale use due to a lack of appropriate normative data, particularly in racially, ethnically, and linguistically diverse groups. In addition, many different versions of neuropsychological tests are being used across research studies and clinical practices, which makes it challenging to harmonize and compare findings across studies and clinics. Brief cognitive screening tests to overcome some of these logistic challenges exist; however, they tend not to be sufficiently sensitive to detect mild cognitive deficits and track cognitive change over time. As such, there is a critical need for a comprehensive as well as efficient and scalable approach to identify and monitor individuals with or at risk for AD‐related cognitive decline.

Assessing cognitive ability — For any patient older than age 65 without a known history of cognitive impairment or dementia, a history and cognitive assessment, such as the Mini-Cog, are essential; if possible, a knowledgeable informant, such as a spouse or a family member, should be interviewed about the evolution of any cognitive or functional decline; if the patient has experienced a decline, they should be referred for further evaluation to a primary care physician, geriatrician, or mental health specialist; postoperative cognitive dysfunction is common but difficult to quantify without documentation of the patient's baseline cognitive status; and the cognitive assessment should be performed early in the patient evaluation because any evidence of cognitive impairment or dementia may indicate that subsequent assessment of functional status and/or medication use may be unreliable.

Natural history

The majority of the studies assessing the cognitive profile in MCI are predictive studies aiming to identify the factors/neuropsychological tests that are predictive of future progression to dementia (for a review, see). In turn, natural history studies aim to characterize the changes that occur in different cognitive domains as individuals progress during the early phase of MCI, and to provide the opportunity to study the trajectory of the symptoms, per cognitive domain. Only a few studies have investigated the natural history of cognitive symptoms in MCI patients. Those studies have indicated that different cognitive domains may manifest different rates of decline. For instance, Wilson and colleagues compared the decline rate of persons with AD, MCI, and normal cognition over an 11-year period. They found that persons with AD decline more rapidly than those with MCI, and that MCI persons experience a faster decline rate than normal individuals. In another study, Bennett et al. examined cognitive decline for discrete cognitive domains. They evaluated decline over a seven-year period in a group of healthy older adults (HOA) and a group of MCI persons on composite measures of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and visuo-spatial abilities. Their findings revealed that individuals with MCI had significantly lower scores at baseline and displayed accelerated cognitive decline compared to HOA. However, they noted that not all cognitive domains exhibited a similar decline. Individuals with MCI experienced a faster decline rate in terms of episodic memory, semantic memory, and perceptual speed compared to HOA. The decline rate regarding working memory and visuo-spatial abilities, however, did not appear to be significantly faster in MCI persons compared to HOA.

### Alzheimer's disease progression: factors influencing cognitive decline [^1d8b3eb4]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients present high variability in the rate of cognitive decline. Despite the wide knowledge on factors influencing dementia risk, little is known on what accounts for AD progression. Previous studies on this topic have mainly analyzed each factor separately without taking into account the interaction between genetic and non-genetic factors.

Objective

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the role of demographic, clinical, therapeutic, and genetic factors and their interaction on cognitive decline among newly diagnosed AD patients.

Methods

We retrospectively selected 160 AD patients diagnosed at the Neurology Unit of Careggi University Hospital of Florence. We evaluated the occurrence of rapid cognitive changes defined as the worsening of more than four points at the Mini-Mental State Examination after 2-year follow up period.

Results

Among the 160 AD patients, 50% presented rapid disease progression. Extrapyramidal signs at disease onset were predictors of worse outcome (OR 2.2), especially among Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ɛ4 allele carriers, while the presence of family history for dementia decreased the risk of rapid progression by about 50%. Higher educated ɛ4-carriers showed a slower AD progression. We identified the chronic use of aspirin as potential secondary preventative strategy for the non ɛ4-carriers.

Conclusion

At dementia onset, some clinical and demographic data can be predictors of future progression. The outcomes of the present study support the already hypothesized interaction between genetic and non-genetic factors during disease course and suggest genetic-based approaches.

1.6 History of sleep disturbance

In an evaluation of a patient with cognitive or behavioral symptoms, a clinician should always ask questions about sleep. Instruments useful for this purpose include the Mayo Sleep Questionnaireor the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease (SCOPA). Sleep‐related symptoms may be hallmarks of certain neurodegenerative diseases causing dementia, or sleep disorders may adversely impact overall function in any individual, particularly those with MCI or dementia; addressing sleep problems through lifestyle interventions improves general health. Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder — with loss of REM‐associated atonia resulting in acting out of dreams, often violently — has a strong association with LBD. Symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorders are even more likely to be under‐reported by informants and, almost never, by patients.REM sleep behavioral disturbances may precede by many years what ultimately evolves to become DLB or Parkinson's‐related dementia. In cognitively unimpaired persons, reduced slow‐wave sleep activity and low sleep efficiency are both associated with accelerated rate of cortical amyloid beta plaque deposition, and hence accumulation of AD‐related neuropathological change.

Sleep disorders have multiple relationships with cognitive and behavioral syndromes. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is deleterious to optimal brain function and health. It is common in MCIand can exacerbate impairments in cognition, mood/behavior, and/or function. Treatment of OSA may reverse cognitive and behavioral decline in some patients.

1.7 Examination

Primary care clinicians hold a key relationship with their patients who often trust them for information, guidance, endorsement, recommendations, and referrals. Primary care providers are also often in the best position to detect early signs on examination of a cognitive–behavioral syndrome as it is developing given their longitudinal relationship with the patient, even if mental status was not previously formally assessed. It may be obvious to a primary care clinician that a patient's cognition, mood, or behavior is clearly different relative to their baseline, prompting a formal mental status examination. Or, concerns raised in the history or by information provided from an informant may identify the need for a mental status examination. A first‐tier mental status examination of cognitive ability, mood, and behavior may be efficiently completed within a problem‐focused primary care visit. The goal of such an assessment is to detect, with acceptable sensitivity, the presence of potentially clinically significant lower‐than‐expected or impaired cognitive performance, or abnormal mood or behavior. We recommend that a mental status examination include the use of a validated brief cognitive assessment test instrument(s) (Table 4).

### Traits of patients who screen positive for dementia and refuse diagnostic assessment [^370e1818]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Dementia poses a major challenge to public health and can have devastating emotional and economic impacts on patients and their families. It is currently estimated that 5.3 million Americans have dementia and that as many as 50% of patients with dementia are never diagnosed. Among patients aged 70 years and more with cognitive problems, only 45% have a history of a cognitive evaluation, suggesting that as many as 1.8 million Americans with dementia have not seen a physician about their cognitive problems.

The driving forces for the under detection of dementia are unclear. Patients may delay or decline a diagnostic assessment for dementia because of concerns that others might learn about their cognitive status, the belief that dementia cannot be treated, or a general negative attitude toward medical assessment. Patient caregivers also influence the decision to obtain a cognitive evaluation. Previous work has found that despite caregivers acknowledging the benefits of a cognitive evaluation, 70.3% had a hard time accepting their family member's cognitive decline, and 67.7% were concerned with how a diagnosis of dementia would impact their own lives.

Physicians' attitudes about dementia and their confidence in performing cognitive evaluations may also contribute to the under detection of dementia. Primary care physicians (PCPs) sometimes question the clinical usefulness of an early diagnosis because of limited treatment options and the need to prioritize other "treatable" health problems.

Those in favor of the earlier identification of dementia argue that population-based screening will increase the likelihood that dementia will be diagnosed. It is also argued that early diagnosis has a variety of potential benefits including the following: earlier evaluation and treatment of reversible causes of cognitive symptoms; improvements in care processes and long-term outcomes by providing opportunities for physicians to discuss prognosis, learn about patient's goals, and tailor prevention and disease-management targets; and improvements in patient and family outcomes such as knowledge about dementia, preparedness for future medical decisions, and confidence in medical decision making. Despite these potential benefits, it is unclear if routine screening for dementia in primary care would increase the likelihood that patients would receive a diagnostic assessment or result in improvements in patient and caregiver outcomes. There is no evidence that screening for dementia delays or alters disease progression, and relatively few studies have evaluated patient, caregiver, and physician perceptions about the value of early identification of dementia as a result of screening in primary care.

### The role of neuropsychological assessment in the evaluation of patients with cognitive-behavioral change due to suspected Alzheimer's disease and other causes of cognitive impairment and dementia [^b229e103]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

We agree with the CPG workgroup that the neuropsychological evaluation can prove exceptionally useful when working with individuals with suspected cognitive decline, but whose level of decline may not be sufficiently detectable during the mental status examination or on brief validated cognitive assessments. It is not uncommon for an individual who subjectively suspects cognitive decline as compared to their baseline functioning to perform well within normal limits on routine office‐based screening. This most often occurs in individuals with high historical functioning, achievement, and/or education, and can contribute to considerable delays in diagnosis, future planning, and appropriate treatment and care. Conversely, the neuropsychological evaluation is also beneficial when there is a question of decline, or brief evaluation is not normal, but there are complicating developmental or cultural factors that interfere with interpretation of brief assessments. The neuropsychologist not only has the ability to take a comprehensive history that can aid in interpretation and formulation, but also to objectively measure decline in relation to estimated historical functioning through utilizing standardized testing and normative data, while simultaneously taking into account that normative standards may not be entirely appropriate for the individual's baseline, culture, or education. Although limitations in normative samples utilized in neuropsychology are well recognized and can pose a challenge, a neuropsychologist's clinical acumen can add an additional level of nuance to interpretation in these cases, and strides are being made in creating more‐appropriate cross‐cultural neuropsychological batteries. Moreover, studies have shown that neuropsychological evaluation provides an additional layer of diagnostic certainty in individuals with above average intelligence and of varying racial and cultural backgrounds. Ultimately, it is important for primary care and specialty care alike to appreciate that the interpretation of brief cognitive assessments, such as the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE)or Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)can be particularly difficult in cases confounded by factors such as race/ethnicity, culture/primary language, education level, quality of education, level of life achievement, prior medical history, sensory difficulties (e.g. primary vision or hearing impairments), history of neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. intellectual disability or learning disorder), prominent psychiatric comorbidities, or underlying complicating factors (e.g. sleep disorder). Thus, despite limitations, we agree with the recommendation and rationale provided in the CPG that a more extensive evaluation in these cases is often paramount to accurately determine and characterize the extent of cognitive change over time, while also providing a more thorough assessment of cognitive functioning across domains and recommendations for further workup, monitoring, and individual care.

Questions for consideration

What is the likely localisation of his presentation?
What is the differential diagnosis?

His marked cognitive decline suggested diffuse cortical dysfunction. Frontal release signs suggested frontal lobe involvement while the episode of incoherent speech might suggest a focal seizure localising to Wernicke's area on the left. Ideomotor apraxia localises to the premotor cortex in the dominant hemisphere, and the right homonymous hemianopia to the left hemisphere, either along the optic tract, at the lateral geniculate body, or in the calcarine cortex.

The rapid decline suggested a rapidly progressive dementia, with a wide differential diagnosis, including vascular (eg, multiple infarcts, thalamic or callosum infarcts, cerebral amyloid angiopathy), infective (eg, viral encephalitis, HIV dementia, urinary tract infections in an elderly person with mild dementia), toxic-metabolic (eg, vitamin B 12 and B 1 deficiencies, endocrine abnormalities, hyperglycaemia, metal toxicity), autoimmune (eg, central nervous system (CNS) lupus), malignancy/metastasis related (eg, carcinomatous meningitis, paraneoplastic encephalitis), iatrogenic (eg, illicit drug use, chemotherapy), neurodegenerative (eg, Alzheimer's disease, prion disease, dementia with Lewy bodies) and systemic disease (eg, epilepsy). In case series from rapidly progressive dementia referral centres, common causes of rapidly progressive dementia include immune-mediated encephalopathies, prion diseases and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia. In other series, secondary reversible causes including infections were most common. Though the epidemiology in low-income settings is largely unknown, these settings might be expected to have higher rates of infective causes.

AWV algorithm for detection of cognitive impairment — The Alzheimer's Association Medicare Annual Wellness Visit Algorithm for Assessment of Cognition illustrates a stepwise process intended to detect patients with a high likelihood of having dementia; the AWV algorithm includes both structured assessments and other less structured patient- and informant-based evaluations; by assessing and documenting cognitive status on an annual basis during the AWV, clinicians can more easily determine gradual cognitive decline; for patients with a previous diagnosis of MCI or dementia, this should be documented and included in their AWV list of health risk factors; annual unstructured and structured cognitive assessments could be used to monitor significant changes in cognition and potentially lead to a new diagnosis of dementia for those with MCI or new care recommendations for those with dementia.

Medicare Annual Wellness Visit (AWV) cognitive assessment process — The unstructured and structured cognitive assessments being recommended for the AWV are only the first steps in diagnosing dementia, and cognitive assessment is best as an iterative process; clinicians concerned with HRA information about decline in function may proceed directly to a structured assessment or continue to query the patient for additional information, and a self-reported memory concern coupled with a failed structured cognitive assessment should always result in a full dementia evaluation.

### Biomarkers for cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly people [^48c5d321]. The Lancet: Neurology (2008). Medium credibility.

The threat of a looming pandemic of dementia in elderly people highlights the compelling need for the development and validation of biomarkers that can be used to identify pre-clinical and prodromal stages of disease in addition to fully symptomatic dementia. Although predictive risk factors and correlative neuroimaging measures will have important roles in these efforts, this Review describes recent progress in the discovery, validation, and standardisation of molecular biomarkers — small molecules and macromolecules whose concentration in the brain or biological fluids can aid diagnosis at different stages of the more common dementing diseases and in the assessment of disease progression and response to therapeutics. An approach that efficiently combines independent information from risk-factor assessment, neuroimaging measures, and biomarkers might soon guide clinicians in the early diagnosis and management of cognitive impairment in elderly people.

Vigorous efforts are underway worldwide to explore CSF for biomarkers of other neurodegenerative diseases — including specific markers of FTLDand synucleinopathies, and for biomarkers of neurodegeneration that may be less specific to these pathologic conditions such as neurofilament light chain (a marker of axonal neuronal injury) and neurogranin (a marker of synaptic dysfunction). When the differential diagnosis is broader in the evaluation of a patient with rapidly progressive or atypical cognitive–behavioral or other neurologic symptoms, CSF may be a critically important test when there is a suspicion for infectious disease, immune‐mediated encephalitis, prion disease (e.g. Creutzfeldt–Jacob disease), subacute cerebrovascular or demyelinating disease, or cancer presenting with primary neurologic symptoms (paraneoplastic syndrome).

Both the lumbar puncture and the AD‐related assay are reimbursed by Medicare (CMS) and usually also by other payors in the United States. The assays are often performed in centralized laboratories as send‐outs from local labs. Global efforts are working to better standardize CSF amyloid and tau threshold values across laboratories as new assays are continually developed. The interpretation of results in the clinical context, however, may be difficult, because a sizeable percentage of cognitively normal older adults harbor these pathologic markers of AD, with the percentage increasing with age over ≈ 60 (20%–40% of cognitively normal older adult patients have AD pathological changes). That is, just because a patient with cognitive impairment has abnormal amyloid and tau biomarkers does not mean AD is the etiology primarily driving or even potentially substantially contributing to cognitive impairment. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of older adult patients with what appears clinically to be probable AD dementia are found to have multiple types of pathologic changes at autopsy, including other proteinopathies and evidence of VCID; emerging evidence suggests that co‐pathologies may influence CSF AD biomarker findings. And much of the research to date has not included ethnically and racially diverse participants.

Finally, when considering a lumbar puncture, it is always important to assess safety and communicate risks and burdens appropriately to patients. The safety of lumbar puncture for CSF collection in the evaluation of patients suspected of having AD has been well established in many thousands of patients. The most critical element of the safety and tolerability of this procedure is the experience and proficiency of the clinician, and knowledge of the potential contraindications to lumbar puncture, including use of anticoagulant medications, some blood clotting disorders, recent seizures, intracranial lesions associated with increased intracranial pressure, papilledema, and impaired consciousness.
