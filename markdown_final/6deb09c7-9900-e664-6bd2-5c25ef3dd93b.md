## Question

A 58-year-old woman is incidentally found to have a 5 mm unruptured saccular aneurysm of the right middle cerebral artery during workup for headaches. She has no history of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and her only vascular risk factor is well-controlled hypertension. After multidisciplinary discussion, the decision is made to manage her aneurysm conservatively without surgical or endovascular intervention. She asks about the need for future imaging and how her aneurysm should be monitored over time.

Based on current guideline recommendations, what is the appropriate approach to radiographic follow-up for this patient, including the choice of imaging modality and suggested timing of follow-up studies?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the appropriate radiographic follow-up approach for a 58-year-old woman with a 5 mm unruptured right middle cerebral artery aneurysm managed conservatively, including the choice of imaging modality and the timing of follow-up studies. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the patient's baseline rupture risk and how size, location, and morphology influence that risk. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (AHA/ASA and ESO) recommend for surveillance intervals and modality selection. Next, I will examine the evidence base for growth and rupture risk to justify the cadence. After that, I should consider patient-specific modifiers and cost-effectiveness. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified plan and state what to do if growth is detected, anchoring each step to the best available evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm the baseline risk profile. A 5 mm MCA aneurysm in a patient without prior SAH falls into a low-risk category for rupture; the UCAS Japan cohort reported an overall annual rupture rate of 0.95% with size-specific risks rising meaningfully at ≥ 7 mm, and meta-analytic data suggest annual rupture risks around 0.4% for aneurysms < 7 mm, with growth being the key dynamic risk amplifier [^114CVpCS] [^112y7vMj] [^116nmrAK]. Hold on, I should verify location risk: MCA aneurysms are generally considered lower rupture risk than anterior or posterior communicating artery locations, which supports a conservative surveillance approach in this case [^113JUGzF].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on surveillance. The AHA/ASA recommends radiographic follow-up with MRA or CTA at regular intervals for conservatively managed UIAs, with a first follow-up at 6–12 months and then yearly or every other year if stable; they also note that the optimal interval and duration are uncertain, so clinical judgment is required [^11237ibR] [^114uHuRY]. The ESO advises radiological monitoring to detect growth when the risk of treatment complications exceeds the estimated 5-year rupture risk, which fits this patient's low-risk profile and supports surveillance rather than intervention at this time [^1173Au7A].

> I will now examine the evidence for growth and rupture dynamics to justify the cadence. Growth is uncommon but clinically meaningful: pooled analyses show growth around 6% overall for small UIAs, with higher rates as size increases, and growth substantially elevates near-term rupture risk to roughly 2.9% at 6 months and 4.3% at 1 year after growth detection, which is why detecting growth changes management [^115JNm2f] [^116nmrAK]. Wait, let me verify the short-term follow-up data: a prospective cohort found 2.6% growth over a median 1 year with 0.4% rupture, reinforcing the value of early surveillance to catch growth before rupture [^115bG1ww].

> Now, modality selection. I should confirm that noncontrast time-of-flight MRA is preferred for repeated follow-up when MRI is feasible because it avoids radiation and iodinated contrast; CTA remains a reasonable alternative if MRI is contraindicated or if MRA visualization is limited, and DSA is reserved for diagnostic uncertainty or if treatment is being considered [^112vEwCA] [^115g38SK] [^114ch7Tv]. Hold on, I should verify detection performance: modern MRA and CTA have high sensitivity for aneurysms ≥ 3 mm, which supports their use for 5 mm lesion surveillance, though very small remnants may still require DSA if treatment decisions hinge on fine detail [^117NBKux] [^115M55pR].

> Let me consider patient-specific modifiers. Age 58, female sex, and hypertension (even if well controlled) are associated with modestly increased rupture risk, but without other high-risk features such as posterior circulation location, irregular/multilobed morphology, or documented growth, the absolute risk remains low and surveillance remains appropriate; shared decision-making should incorporate these factors and the patient's preferences [^113JUGzF] [^111P2GLh]. I should double-check that guidelines emphasize modifiable risk reduction: yes, strict blood pressure control and smoking cessation are recommended adjuncts during conservative management [^1111x1Xf].

> Next, I should review cost-effectiveness to avoid over-imaging. Modeling suggests that for small UIAs, MRA every 2 years is the most cost-effective strategy, with annual imaging becoming favorable only when growth or rupture risks are higher; given this patient's low baseline risk, biennial imaging after stability is established is reasonable [^112kN3bp]. But wait, what if the aneurysm were 3 mm or smaller? Comparative effectiveness modeling indicates that no routine follow-up may be optimal for tiny aneurysms, underscoring that our 5 mm case justifies surveillance but not excessive frequency [^116XSswJ].

> Synthesizing the plan, I should confirm the following: obtain a baseline high-quality MRA now if not already available to document size and morphology; repeat MRA at 6–12 months to detect early growth; if stable, extend to every 2 years; if growth ≥ 1 mm is detected, shorten the interval and refer for multidisciplinary evaluation to reconsider treatment given the marked rise in rupture risk after growth; continue indefinitely while life expectancy and clinical context warrant, with periodic reassessment of the risk–benefit balance [^11237ibR] [^116nmrAK] [^1173Au7A]. Hold on, I should verify that indefinite follow-up aligns with practice: surveys of neuroradiologists show many favor lifelong surveillance for small UIAs, reflecting the lack of a definitive "stop" point and the possibility of late growth or de novo aneurysms, though intervals can be individualized as risk evolves [^1119xGGX].

> Finally, I need to ensure the patient understands red flags and logistics. She should seek immediate care for sudden severe headache or neurologic deficits, and we should coordinate follow-up imaging with a center experienced in cerebrovascular imaging to minimize variability in measurement and maximize detection of subtle change; if MRA is limited by artifact or patient factors, CTA can be substituted, and DSA remains the gold standard if treatment is contemplated or if noninvasive studies are discordant [^114ch7Tv] [^1135NgdV]. I should confirm that this plan is consistent with contemporary multidisciplinary care: yes, guidelines endorse management at higher-volume centers and shared decision-making for UIAs managed conservatively, which we will adhere to in this case [^1112jZNL] [^111B3pwd].

---

For a 5 mm right MCA unruptured aneurysm managed conservatively, **repeat MRA at 6–12 months** [^11237ibR] is recommended to assess stability, then **every 1–2 years** if unchanged [^114uHuRY]. Use **non-contrast TOF MRA** [^112vEwCA] to avoid radiation and contrast; CTA is an alternative if MRI is contraindicated [^115g38SK]. If growth ≥ 1 mm or new high-risk features appear, escalate to CTA/DSA and multidisciplinary review for treatment [^116nmrAK] [^111doB41]. Lifelong surveillance is reasonable given persistent, albeit low, rupture risk [^1119xGGX] [^113JUGzF].

---

## Recommended imaging modality

Non-contrast time-of-flight (TOF) MRA is **preferred** for serial follow-up because it avoids radiation and iodinated contrast [^112vEwCA]; CTA is an alternative when MRI is contraindicated or image quality is limited [^115g38SK].

---

## Recommended follow-up intervals

- **Initial follow-up**: 6–12 months after discovery to detect early growth [^11237ibR] [^115bG1ww].
- **Subsequent follow-up**: every 1–2 years if stable; shorten to annually if risk factors are present (e.g. hypertension, smoking, family history) [^114uHuRY] [^1111x1Xf].
- **Indefinite surveillance**: reasonable given persistent, albeit low, rupture risk [^1119xGGX] [^113JUGzF].

---

## Indications for escalation of imaging or intervention

Escalate to CTA or DSA and consider intervention if any of the following occur:

- **Growth**: ≥ 1 mm increase in any dimension [^116nmrAK].
- **New high-risk features**: daughter sac, multilobulation, or change in morphology [^112TjHPz].
- **Symptoms**: new focal deficits or thunderclap headache [^notfound].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting recommendations

- **Growth risk**: Small UIAs have a pooled growth rate ~6% over mean 42 months, with higher risk in larger or posterior circulation lesions [^115JNm2f].
- **Rupture risk**: Growth increases rupture risk to ~4.3% at 1 year and ~6.0% at 2 years after detection of growth [^116nmrAK].
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Biennial MRA is the most cost-effective strategy for small UIAs, balancing growth detection and resource use [^112kN3bp].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

In this 58-year-old with well-controlled hypertension, **annual follow-up is reasonable** given age and vascular risk, though biennial imaging is acceptable if stability is confirmed and risk remains low [^114uHuRY] [^112kN3bp].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Imaging modality** | **Initial follow-up** | **Subsequent follow-up** | **Escalation criteria** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Non-contrast TOF MRA (preferred) | 6–12 months | Every 1–2 years if stable | - Growth ≥ 1 mm <br/> - New high-risk features <br/> - Symptoms |
| CTA (alternative) | 6–12 months | Every 1–2 years if stable | Same as above |

---

Non-contrast TOF MRA at **6–12 months** [^11237ibR], then every 1–2 years if stable, is appropriate; escalate if growth or high-risk features emerge [^116nmrAK], and continue surveillance long term given persistent risk [^1119xGGX].

Aneurysm follow-up — patients treated without surgery or coiling: imaging interval and modality selection emphasize early imaging and noncontrast options. Most published work indicates a preference for first follow-up imaging 6 to 12 months after initial discovery, and continued follow-up is then generally recommended yearly or every 2 years once stability is documented. Both CTA and MRA have been used for follow-up. In general, because a TOF MRA does not require intravenous contrast and does not involve x-ray radiation, this may be the most appropriate first-line method for repeated imaging follow-up, while for patients with contraindications to MRA or whose aneurysm(s) cannot be suitably visualized with this technique, CTA remains a viable alternative. When a patient's age or medical comorbidities make invasive intervention inordinately high risk or of no significant benefit, it may be reasonable to discontinue further scheduled follow-up.

Aneurysm follow-up — patients treated without surgery or endovascular coiling: recommendations are as follows. For patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) that are managed noninvasively without either surgical or endovascular intervention, radiographic follow-up with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) at regular intervals is indicated. The optimal interval and duration of recommended follow-up are uncertain (Class I; Level of Evidence B). For patients with UIAs that are managed noninvasively without either surgical or endovascular intervention, a first follow-up study at 6 to 12 months after initial discovery, followed by subsequent yearly or every other year follow-up, may be reasonable (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C). For patients with UIAs that are managed noninvasively and in whom there are no contraindications to MRI, it may be reasonable to consider time-of-flight MRA (TOF MRA) rather than CTA for repeated long-term follow-up (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C).

Not Available For the first time, the American Heart Association has issued guidelines for the treatment of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The recommendations, published October 31 in Circulation, are intended as a framework for treatment plans and a foundation for future research. Based on the consensus of an AHA Stroke Council task force, the guidelines support screening — currently by magnetic resonance angiography — in people with a family history of aneurysm or subarachnoid hemorrhage, or a genetic predisposition to aneurysm formation. Treatment of asymptomatic aneurysms of less than 10 mm should depend on the patient's age and progression of the aneurysm. However, surgery should be considered for young patients and those who have symptoms, a previous ruptured aneurysm, or growth of the aneurysm. Observation with repeated brain scans is recommended for patients who do not undergo surgery. Voelker R. Aneurysm Guidelines. JAMA. 2000; 284:

Diagnosing/imaging for unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) includes the following guideline statements: digital subtraction angiography (DSA) can be useful compared with noninvasive imaging for identification and evaluation of cerebral aneurysms if surgical or endovascular treatment is being considered (Class IIa; Level of Evidence B), and DSA is reasonable as the most sensitive imaging for follow-up of treated aneurysms (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are useful for detection and follow-up of UIA (Class I; Level of Evidence B), and it is reasonable to perform MRA as an alternative for follow-up for treated aneurysms, with DSA used as necessary when deciding on therapy (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C). Coiled aneurysms, especially those with wider neck or dome diameters or those that have residual filling, should have follow-up evaluation (Class I; Level of Evidence B). The timing and duration of follow-up is uncertain, and additional investigation is necessary. The importance of surveillance imaging after endovascular treatment of UIAs, including high-risk features for recurrence remains unclear, but surveillance imaging is probably indicated (Class IIa; Level of Evidence C).

Unruptured intracranial aneurysm — procedure selection, technology use, and follow-up note that microsurgical repair is generally associated with higher perioperative morbidity than endovascular repair but also higher rates of aneurysm obliteration and lower recurrence; in older patients (more than > 60 years of age) the benefit of coiling compared with surgery appears greater for most lesions; with current technology there appears to be an advantage to microsurgery for most middle cerebral artery aneurysms and to endovascular repair for most basilar apex and vertebrobasilar confluence aneurysms; because long-term effects of emerging technologies such as flow-diverting low-porosity stents and stent-assisted coiling remain largely unknown, strict adherence to US Food and Drug Administration indications for use is recommended until additional trial data show incremental safety and efficacy improvements; after clipping, coiling, or stenting, assessment of cognitive outcome is reasonable, early documentation of aneurysm obliteration is necessary to guide follow-up, and if long-term imaging frequency is uncertain it is reasonable to increase frequency for aneurysms incompletely obliterated during initial treatment.

### Management of small unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a survey of neuroradiologists [^1119xGGX]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The long-term history and management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms is not well understood. Our aim was to determine current practice patterns in the management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, especially regarding imaging surveillance for conservatively managed aneurysms of this type.

Materials and Methods

An on-line survey was designed to examine physician practice and preference regarding the management of small unruptured intracranial aneurysms (≤ 7 mm in diameter). The survey was circulated to members of the American Society of Neuroradiology. Participation was voluntary, and all responses were anonymous.

Results

A total of 227 individual survey responses were obtained and included in the analysis with 54.6% (124/227) from diagnostic neuroradiologists (practicing > 50% neuroradiology) and one-third (29%) from neurointerventional radiologists. One hundred seventy-three of 227 responded that routine, periodic imaging surveillance would be appropriate for conservatively managed unruptured intracranial aneurysms, and 84% of respondents recommended surveillance frequency of at least once a year. Fifty-nine percent favored indefinite, life-long follow-up for small unruptured intracranial aneurysms, and a similar number of respondents favored noncontrast MR angiography for aneurysm follow-up. Significant heterogeneity was found in size measurements used to assess aneurysms and criteria used to define growth on surveillance imaging.

Conclusions

The natural history of intracranial aneurysms is not well-understood. A large proportion of incidentally detected, unruptured aneurysms are small (< 7 mm). The survey results show significant heterogeneity in practice even among neuroradiologists and underlies the need to standardize imaging practice. Further studies are needed to assess the optimal frequency and duration of surveillance imaging for unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The criteria used to measure aneurysms and define growth on imaging also need to be standardized.

### Management of unruptured incidentally found intracranial saccular aneurysms [^113es3p4]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms occur in 3–5% of the general population. As the use of diagnostic medical imaging has steadily increased over the past few decades with the increased availability of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), so has the detection of incidental aneurysms. The management of an unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysm is challenging for both patients and physicians, as the decision to intervene must weigh the risk of rupture and resultant subarachnoid hemorrhage against the risk inherent to the surgical or endovascular procedure. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of factors to be considered in the decision to offer treatment for unruptured intracranial aneurysms in adults. In addition, we review aneurysm and patient characteristics that favor surgical clipping over endovascular intervention and vice versa. Finally, the authors propose a novel, simple, and clinically relevant algorithm for observation versus intervention in unruptured intracranial aneurysms based on the PHASES scoring system.

### Management of incidental unruptured intracranial aneurysms [^1166vo3w]. Practical Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

The widespread use of MR has led to the increasingly frequent diagnosis of unruptured incidental intracranial aneurysms. Most are small (< 7 mm diameter) and will never rupture. Yet, their recognition causes much anxiety, and their optimal management remains controversial. This review addresses the difficulties in managing incidental unruptured saccular intracranial aneurysms. Note that our conclusions and recommendations do not apply to symptomatic unruptured aneurysms or to fusiform, dissecting, mycotic, traumatic and paediatric aneurysms, each of which has a different natural history.

Imaging analysis and reporting for intracranial aneurysm — whatever aneurysm imaging method is chosen, certain aspects of the anatomy require appropriate analysis and documentation to be useful for management and follow-up of UIAs, including accurate measurement of the neck size, a neck-to-dome ratio descriptor, measures of the aneurysm in 3 dimensions, and the relationship of the aneurysm to the surrounding vessels, with documentation of the presence, measurements, and descriptions of residuals and any parent vessel changes and identification of any new aneurysm development.

Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) — DSA continues to be the gold standard for aneurysm diagnosis, with 3D rotational angiography providing more detailed imaging and studies showing greater sensitivity, especially in aneurysms smaller than 3 mm. Catheter arteriography carries risks, with permanent neurological complications in patients with cerebral aneurysms, SAH, and arteriovenous malformation occurring at a rate of 0.07%; the invasiveness and cumulative radiation make it less frequently used for follow-up, though selective DSA follow-up for treated aneurysms carries a low risk.

Unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) — surgical clipping recommendations state that several factors, including patient age and aneurysm location and size, should be taken into account when considering surgical clipping as the mode of treatment for a UIA (Class I; Level of Evidence B). Imaging after surgical intervention, to document aneurysm obliteration, is recommended given the differential risk of growth and hemorrhage for completely versus incompletely obliterated aneurysms (Class I; Level of Evidence B). Long-term follow-up imaging may be considered after surgical clipping given the combined risk of aneurysm recurrence and de novo aneurysm formation, and may be particularly important for those aneurysms that are incompletely obliterated during initial treatment (Class IIb; Level of Evidence B). Surgical treatment of UIA is recommended to be performed at higher-volume centers (eg, performing > 20 cases annually) (Class I; Level of Evidence B). The use of specialized intraoperative tools and techniques for avoiding vessel compromise or residual aneurysms may be considered to reduce the adverse outcomes seen with operative management of UIAs (Class IIb; Level of Evidence C).

Purpose

The aim of this updated statement is to provide comprehensive and evidence-based recommendations for management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

Methods

Writing group members used systematic literature reviews from January 1977 up to June 2014. They also reviewed contemporary published evidence-based guidelines, personal files, and published expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and when appropriate, formulated recommendations using standard American Heart Association criteria. The guideline underwent extensive peer review, including review by the Stroke Council Leadership and Stroke Scientific Statement Oversight Committees, before consideration and approval by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee.

Results

Evidence-based guidelines are presented for the care of patients presenting with unruptured intracranial aneurysms. The guidelines address presentation, natural history, epidemiology, risk factors, screening, diagnosis, imaging and outcomes from surgical and endovascular treatment.

The management of unruptured cerebral aneurysms remains one of the most controversial topics in neurosurgery. To this end, we discuss the diagnosis and estimated prevalence of these lesions as well as review the literature regarding the rate of rupture for cerebral aneurysms and risks of operative intervention. Our interpretation of the literature concludes that aneurysms are present in approximately 1% of the adult population, varying between less than 1% in young adults to 4% in the elderly. The yearly risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage for an unruptured intracranial aneurysm is approximately 1% for lesions 7 to 10 mm in diameter. Based on these assumptions, we recommend that 1) with rare exceptions, all symptomatic unruptured aneurysms should be treated; 2) small, incidental aneurysms less than 5 mm in diameter should be managed conservatively in virtually all cases; 3) aneurysms larger than 5 mm in patients younger than 60 years of age should be seriously considered for treatment; 4) large, incidental aneurysms larger than 10 mm should be treated in nearly all patients younger than 70 years of age; and 5) microsurgical clipping rather than endovascular coiling should be the first treatment choice in low-risk cases. Critical to our guidelines is collaboration by a highly experienced cerebrovascular team of microneurosurgeons and endovascular neurosurgeons working at a tertiary medical center with a high case volume and using a decision-making paradigm designed to offer only low-risk treatments. In certain patients for whom both treatment and natural history carry high risks, such as those with giant aneurysms, nonoperative management is typically elected.

### Imaging intracranial aneurysms in the endovascular era: surveillance and posttreatment follow-up [^116L9gZ5]. Radiographics (2022). Medium credibility.

While most intracranial aneurysms (IAs) remain asymptomatic over a patient's lifetime, those that rupture can cause devastating outcomes. The increased usage and quality of neuroimaging has increased detection of unruptured IAs and driven an increase in surveillance and treatment of these lesions. Standard practice is to treat incidentally discovered unruptured IAs that confer high rupture risk as well as ruptured IAs to prevent rehemorrhage. IAs are increasingly treated with coil embolization instead of microsurgical clipping; more recently, flow diversion and intrasaccular flow disruption have further expanded the versatility and utility of endovascular IA treatment. Imaging is increasingly used for posttreatment IA follow-up in the endovascular era. While cerebral angiography remains the standard for IA characterization and treatment planning, advances in CT and CT angiography and MR angiography have improved the diagnostic accuracy of noninvasive imaging for initial diagnosis and surveillance. IA features including size, dome-to-neck ratio, location, and orientation allow rupture risk stratification and determination of optimal treatment strategy and timing. The radiologist should be familiar with the imaging appearance of common IA treatment devices and the expected imaging findings following treatment. In distinction to clipping and coil embolization, flow diversion and intrasaccular flow disruption induce progressive aneurysm obliteration over months to years. Careful assessment of the device; the treated IA; adjacent brain, bone, meninges; and involved extracranial and intracranial vasculature is crucial at posttreatment follow-up imaging to confirm aneurysm obliteration and identify short-term and long-term posttreatment complications.

A catheter angiogram of a 25-year-old woman (4 points favoring treatment for patient age younger than 40 years) who previously underwent MRI for persistent headaches, vertigo, and occasional bitemporal vision disturbances (due to a migraine aura) with (A) posterior-anterior and (B) lateral projection as well as (C) posterior-anterior and (D) lateral 3-dimensional reconstructions is shown. This left-sided wide-necked paraophthalmic internal carotid artery aneurysm had a maximum diameter of 3 mm with a neck diameter of 2.7 mm (3 points favoring conservative management for aneurysm complexity due to wide neck). The patient did not report any additional risk factors or comorbidities in her past medical history. The resulting scores based on the UIATS were 4 points in favor of aneurysm repair and 8 points (including 5 points favoring conservative management for the constant intervention-related risk) in favor of conservative management. The resulting UIATS recommendation was "conservative management". Overall agreement with this UIATS recommendation was 3.7 (95% confidence interval 3.44–3.96) for both reviewer cohorts.

This incidental irregularly shaped (3 points favoring treatment for irregular morphology) anterior communicating artery aneurysm (arrow, 2 points favoring treatment for aneurysm location) had a maximum diameter of 7.6 mm (2 points favoring treatment for aneurysm diameter) with a neck diameter of 3.5 mm. Aspect and size ratios were calculated to be 2.1 and 3.8, respectively (1 point favoring treatment for aspect or size ratio greater than 1.6 or 3.0, respectively). Her medical history included arterial hypertension (2 points favoring treatment for risk factor hypertension) but no other chronic comorbidities. The resulting scoring based on the UIATS was 13 points in favor of aneurysm repair and 7 points in favor of conservative management (1 point for patient age 41–60 years, 1 point for aneurysm size 6–10 mm, and 5 points for the constant intervention-related risk). The resulting UIATS recommendation was "aneurysm repair". Overall agreement with this UIATS recommendation was 4.73 (95% confidence interval 4.62–4.85) for both reviewer cohorts.

Unruptured intracranial aneurysm natural history — size, location, and morphology: A meta-analysis reports an overall annual rupture rate for aneurysms < 7 mm of 0.4% and increased risk with symptomatic aneurysm, diameter > 5 mm, and posterior circulation location with relative risks specified. In the UCAS Japan cohort of 6697 patients followed a mean of 1.7 years, the annual rupture rate was 0.95%, and size-specific annual risks ranged from 0.36% (3–4 mm) to 33.4% (≥ 25 mm). Risk was higher for anterior or posterior communicating artery locations (hazard ratio 1.90 and 2.02 versus middle cerebral artery) and for aneurysms with daughter sacs (hazard ratio 1.63), whereas family history and prior SAH from a different aneurysm were not identified as rupture risk factors. Smaller Japanese cohorts reported overall rupture risks of 0.5% per year (374 patients; mean 41 months) and 1.4% per year (419 patients; mean 2.5 years). A U.S. series of 319 aneurysms ≤ 7 mm with mean 2.4-year follow-up reported no ruptures, but growth of at least 0.75 mm occurred at an annual rate of 5.4%. In a familial intracranial aneurysm cohort nearly all < 7 mm, rupture occurred at 1.2% per year (95% CI, 0.14%–4.3%).

Outcome and follow-up

After multidisciplinary discussion, it was deemed reasonable to continue conservative management with surveillance. The patient remains in good health at 6 months from diagnosis with no new symptoms, no limitations to his daily activities, nor any modifiable risk factors. An interval CT angiogram of the brain was performed at 12 months from diagnosis to assess for aneurysm growth and the subsequent risk of rupture as suggested by Thompson et al — this was stable.

### Update on the management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms [^117MRrFK]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Over the past decade, several factors have led to a dramatic change in the manner in which patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms are diagnosed and treated. These factors include the increased use of noninvasive imaging modalities for the diagnosis of intracranial aneurysms, publication of new natural history data detailing the hemorrhage risks associated with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, and the broad application of endovascular therapy for their treatment. With these new technologies and new natural history data has come considerable uncertainty about the optimal treatment strategy for patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms. In this light, it seems prudent to review periodically and examine critically all recent data pertaining to the natural history and treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms, in an effort to provide a scientific update on which management recommendations can be based. This review article represents the authors' attempt at such an update, and it is their hope that members of the community of neurovascular surgeons might find this information helpful during their continuing efforts to provide optimal care for their patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

### Current treatment options for unruptured intracranial aneurysms [^115QY7Z3]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

A patient with an unruptured intracranial aneurysm has three options: surgical clip placement, endovascular coil occlusion, and observation. The decision making about management of these lesions should be based on the risk of aneurysm rupture and the risks associated with surgical or endovascular intervention. For patients who require interventions, factors such as aneurysm recurrence rate, its location, surgical or endovascular accessibility, the patient's general medical condition, and the individual's treatment preference should be taken into account to determine the choice of therapies. Currently, a team approach by neurosurgeons and endovascular interventionists is recommended to evaluate each patient and to tailor the best treatment plan.

Recommendations

Smoking can increase the risk of UIA formation. Patients should be counselled the importance of smoking cessation (class I; level of evidence B).
Hypertension may be involved in the growth and rupture of intracranial aneurysms. Patients should monitor BP and receive BP lowering treatment (class I; level of evidence B).
Aneurysmal SAH (aSAH) can be regarded as a risk factor for the rupture of other coexistent UIAs. Patients with a history of aneurysmal SAH are probably recommended to proper treatment (class IIa; level of evidence B).
Patients with single anterior circulation aneurysms (size < 5 mm) can be managed conservatively. For posterior circulation aneurysms, or size of aneurysm of > 5 mm, with a history of aneurysmal rupture, symptomatic aneurysms, image-based risk factors (including the enlargement, increased number of daughter sacs and blebs, blood blister-like aneurysms), individualised treatment should be considered. Age, neurological function, overall condition, medical comorbidities and the risk of rupture should be considered in the decision making process (class IIa; level of evidence B).
Radiographic follow-up is indicated regularly for patients with UIAs managed non-invasively. For those with detected enlargement of the aneurysms during the follow-up, unless contraindicated, proper treatment is recommended (class I; level of evidence B).
Radiographic screening for follow-up of UIA can be conducted with CTA or MRA (classI; level of evidence B). For patients without contraindications to MRI, it is reasonable to consider MRA for long-term follow-up. DSA can be conducted if needed. It is reasonable to consider a first follow-up at 6–12 months after initial discovery of UIA, and follow-up every 1–2 years (class IIa; level of evidence C).
Treatment includes surgical clipping and endovascular treatment. Treatment selection is related to multiple factors including aneurysm location, size and morphology; documented growth of aneurysms during the follow-up; the age of the patient; history of aSAH; family history of cerebral aneurysm; the presence of multiple aneurysms or the presence of concurrent pathology such as an arteriovenous malformation or other cerebrovascular or inherited pathology (class I; level of evidence C).

vessel, and dissecting aneurysms which results from a tear between the inner and outer vessel wall causing blood to collect between layers of the vessel wall. Neck size, the size of the opening that connects the parent artery to the aneurysm body, is also an important descriptor for aneurysms and can. patient outcomes based on anatomical location was primarily based on the safety and effectiveness of the treatment modality, and was supported by subsequent studies which determined that the advantages of endovascular versus open surgical treatment can depend greatly on the aneurysm location in part due to the accessibility of the aneurysm through endovascular means. This investigation. was a randomized, prospective study where 1070 patients were selected for surgical clipping and 1063 were treated using endovascular approaches. The primary outcome was measured by death or dependence at 1 year of 3–6).

The investigators determined that the risk ratio more. strongly favored endovascular treatment in the posterior circulation as compared to the anterior circulation, although the risks of treatment were lower in both locations of the neurovasculature in favor of endovascular treatment.
2. 2. 1 Perforating Arteries One of the contributors of worse clinical outcomes for patients with cerebral aneurysms located in the posterior circulation of the neurovasculature may also be due to the presence of perforating arteries. Perforating arteries are small branches that emerge from larger vessels that are responsible for supplying. et al. 2008; D'Urso et al. 2011).
2. 3 Risk Factors for Aneurysm Rupture Most aneurysm treatments are performed electively on unruptured aneurysms. Treating unruptured aneurysms helps to prevent the risk of aneurysm rupture, which can result in a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Subarachnoid hemorrhage can lead to mortality and serious morbidity and thus treatment is performed prophylactically. Ruptured aneurysms are also commonly treated as there is a high risk of recurrent SAH with untreated ruptured aneurysms. Based on natural history, it has been suggested that. Executive Summary Neurological Devices Panel Meeting 6 study comparing conservative management to intervention, 51 patients in the unoperated cohort experienced a confirmed aneurysm rupture during follow-up with 49 of those occurring within the first 5 years of diagnosis while Juvela et al. followed patients for more than 20 years and found an annual incidence rupture rate of 1. 1%. In summary, it is difficult to predict the risk of aneurysm rupture because the rupture risk can be affected by many factors such as a history of prior SAH, location of the aneurysm in the neurovasculature. Additional studies have confirmed the correlation between increased rupture rates and a prior history of SAH. Size and location of the cerebral aneurysm in the neurovasculature can also affect the risk of rupture. In the article by Wiebers, aneurysms in the ICA, AComm, ACA, or MCA that were < 7 mm, 7–12 mm, 13–24 mm, and > 25 mm had rupture rates of 0%, 2. 6%,

### Unruptured intracranial aneurysms: development, rupture and preventive management [^111ZhwK8]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2016). Medium credibility.

Saccular unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) have a prevalence of 3% in the adult population, and are being increasingly detected because of improved quality and higher frequency of cranial imaging. Large amounts of data, providing varying levels of evidence, have been published on aneurysm development, progression and rupture, but less information is available on the risks and efficacy of preventive treatment. When deciding how to best manage UIAs, clinicians must consider the age and life expectancy of the patient, the estimated risk of rupture, the risk of complications attributed to preventive treatment, and the level of anxiety caused by the awareness of having an aneurysm. This Review highlights the latest human data on the formation, progression and rupture of intracranial aneurysms, as well as risks associated with preventive treatment. Considering these we discuss the implication for clinical management. Furthermore, we highlight pivotal questions arising from current data on intracranial aneurysms and the implications the data have for future experimental or clinical research. We also discuss data on novel radiological surrogates for rupture for those aneurysms that do not require preventive occlusion. Finally, we provide guidance for clinicians who are confronted with patients with incidentally detected UIAs.

### Unruptured intracranial aneurysms: appraisal of the literature and suggested recommendations for surgery, using evidence-based medicine criteria [^117M5ERG]. Neurosurgery (2000). Low credibility.

Objective

The literature on unruptured intracranial aneurysms is reviewed, and an attempt is made to stratify it according to the weight of the evidence. Recommendations for surgery are suggested, using evidence-based criteria.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was performed for 1966 to 1999. The focus was restricted to surgical management rather than other types of management, such as endovascular treatments. Each article was classified as Class I, II, or III according to the weight of the evidence. Some articles, such as literature reviews and data analyses, did not fit this classification and were grouped separately. Recommendations are based on the evidence available.

Results

Forty-five articles were reviewed. Thirteen articles contained information on the natural history, 19 contained data on the risks of surgery, and 2 contained information on both. In addition, 11 contained analyses of costs and benefits. None met the criteria for Class I evidence. Seven articles on the natural history and 7 on the risks of surgery met the criteria for Class II evidence, and 6 and 12, respectively, met those for Class III evidence. The remainder of the articles were analyses or review articles.

Conclusion

There is insufficient evidence to recommend a standard of management. As a therapeutic guideline, conservative treatment is recommended for small aneurysms (< 10 mm) and asymptomatic nongiant aneurysms in older people, whereas surgery is recommended for larger aneurysms in younger people and symptomatic aneurysms in fit patients. Other recommendations can be justified only as therapeutic options, using evidence-based criteria. Areas for future investigation are discussed.

Regarding surgical interventions for unruptured intracranial aneurysm, more specifically with respect to indications for aneurysm repair, AHA/ASA 2015 guidelines recommend to take into account the following factors for the selection of optimal management of a UIA:

- the size, location, and other morphological characteristics of the aneurysm

- documented growth on serial imaging

- patient age

- history of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage

- family history of cerebral aneurysm

- the presence of multiple aneurysms

- the presence of concurrent pathology such as an AVM or other cerebrovascular or inherited pathology predisposing to a higher risk of hemorrhage.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guidelines on management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms [^111B3pwd]. European Stroke Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) occur in around 3% of the population. Important management questions concern if and how to perform preventive UIA occlusion; if, how and when to perform follow up imaging and non-interventional means to reduce the risk of rupture. Using the Standard Operational Procedure of ESO we prepared guidelines according to GRADE methodology. Since no completed randomised trials exist, we used interim analyses of trials, and meta-analyses of observational and case-control studies to provide recommendations to guide UIA management. All recommendations were based on very low evidence. We suggest preventive occlusion if the estimated 5-year rupture risk exceeds the risk of preventive treatment. In general, we cannot recommend endovascular over microsurgical treatment, but suggest flow diverting stents as option only when there are no other low-risk options for UIA repair. To detect UIA recurrence we suggest radiological follow up after occlusion. In patients who are initially observed, we suggest radiological monitoring to detect future UIA growth, smoking cessation, treatment of hypertension, but not treatment with statins or acetylsalicylic acid with the indication to reduce the risk of aneurysm rupture. Additionally, we formulated 15 expert-consensus statements. All experts suggest to assess UIA patients within a multidisciplinary setting (neurosurgery, neuroradiology and neurology) at centres consulting > 100 UIA patients per year, to use a shared decision-making process based on the team recommendation and patient preferences, and to repair UIA only in centres performing the proposed treatment in > 30 patients with (ruptured or unruptured) aneurysms per year per neurosurgeon or neurointerventionalist. These UIA guidelines provide contemporary recommendations and consensus statement on important aspects of UIA management until more robust data come available.

### Clinical relevance of short-term follow-up of unruptured intracranial aneurysms [^115bG1ww]. Neurosurgical Focus (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are common incidental findings on brain imaging. Short-term follow-up for conservatively treated aneurysms is routinely performed in most cerebrovascular centers, although its clinical relevance remains unclear. In this study, the authors assessed the extent of growth as well as the rupture risk during short-term follow-up of conservatively treated unruptured intracranial aneurysms. In addition, the influence of patient-specific and aneurysm-specific factors on growth and rupture risk was investigated.

Methods

The authors queried their prospective institutional neurovascular registry to identify patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms and short-term follow-up imaging, defined as follow-up MRA and/or CTA within 3 months to 2 years after initial diagnosis. Medical records and questionnaires were used to acquire baseline information. The authors measured aneurysm size at baseline and at follow-up to detect growth. Rupture was defined as a CT scan-proven and/or CSF-proven subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).

Results

A total of 206 consecutive patients with 267 conservatively managed unruptured aneurysms underwent short-term follow-up at the authors' center. Seven aneurysms (2.6%) enlarged during a median follow-up duration of 1 year (range 0.3–2.0 years). One aneurysm (0.4%) ruptured 10 months after initial discovery. Statistically significant risk factors for growth or rupture were autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (RR 8.3, 95% CI 2.0–34.7), aspect ratio > 1.6 or size ratio > 3 (RR 10.8, 95% CI 2.2–52.2), and initial size ≥ 7 mm (RR 10.7, 95% CI 2.7–42.8).

Conclusions

Significant growth of unruptured intracranial aneurysms may occur in a small proportion of patients during short-term follow-up. As aneurysm growth is associated with an increased risk of rupture, the authors advocate that short-term follow-up is clinically relevant and has an important role in reducing the risk of a potential SAH.

### Saccular posterior cerebral artery aneurysm encased within a lipoma [^116uABYJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Intracranial lipomas rarely justify surgical management given that they are non-malignant, and most cases are asymptomatic. Tahmouresie et al 's review of 21 patients showed postoperative improvement in 23.8% and death in 47.6%. In these cases, the substantial risk of operative complications may be owed to adhesions to surrounding structures, calcification of the lipoma or surrounding structures, and hypervascularisation. Due to these operative complexities, in cases where an adjacent or encasing lipoma is expected to significantly limit access to an aneurysm for the purpose of clipping and definitive management is indicated, we would recommend an endovascular approach. Biopsy may be considered when the diagnosis is uncertain from imaging alone, and if excision is deemed necessary, it should be limited to partial removal.

Intracranial aneurysms in the posterior circulation measuring 7–12 mm have a 5-year rupture rate of 14.5%. Risk factors for lifetime rupture aside from the size of the aneurysm include current smoking status (OR 3.05), female sex (OR 2.50) and the age at diagnosis of the unruptured intracranial aneurysm being less than 50 years old (OR 7.50). In the presence of a lipoma, there is no clear evidence for increased rupture risk — from our review of the literature and including our case, one out of nine cases of saccular aneurysms associated with a lipoma within the anterior circulation ruptured on presentation, and no aneurysms that were contiguous with the lipoma ruptured. The incidence of rupture on follow-up could not be concluded from these cases, and the proportion of aneurysms that present with rupture is not well described in the literature. However, given that the prevailing theories on its pathogenesis may support an ongoing theoretical risk for further wall weakening, it is reasonable to exercise caution by performing vessel wall imaging and following up earlier than usual to establish whether the aneurysm is growing. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to recommend earlier treatment compared with isolated aneurysms. The decision to treat an aneurysm, whether endovascularly or with microsurgical clipping, is a risk versus benefits decision usually made in conjunction with the patient. In this case, the aneurysm being encased within the lipoma would increase the operative complexity if being accessed by microsurgical means. On one hand, the patient had several predictors of poor endovascular outcome including an age greater than 50 and the location of the aneurysm being in the posterior circulation. On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge this patient's age, the borderline size of the aneurysm and paucity of other risk factors for rupture. Additionally, the lipoma wrapping the aneurysm itself may provide a degree of protection against subarachnoid haemorrhage. On balance, it was deemed reasonable to conservatively manage his aneurysm.

### Guidelines for the management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^1111x1Xf]. Stroke (2015). Medium credibility.

American Heart Association/American Stroke Association — risk factor management in unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) emphasizes counseling for smoking cessation, blood pressure control, and imaging follow-up. Given that smoking appears to increase the risk of UIA formation, patients with UIA should be counseled regarding the importance of smoking cessation (Class I; Level of Evidence B). Given that hypertension may play a role in growth and rupture of IAs, patients with UIA should monitor blood pressure and undergo treatment for hypertension (Class I; Level of Evidence B). Aneurysm growth may increase the risk of rupture, and intermittent imaging studies to follow those UIAs managed conservatively should be considered (Class I; Level of Evidence B).

There is active study of morphology and hemodynamics in relation to rupture, and the combination has been shown to discriminate between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms.

Materials and methods

Patients

We retrospectively assessed 100 patients with 103 MCAB aneurysms who underwent a detachable coil embolisation in our institution between August 2003 and December 2008. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board.

In our practice, ruptured MCAB aneurysms are treated on an emergent basis. For unruptured MCAB aneurysms, treatment was recommended in patients with aneurysms larger than 5 mm and if the patient was 75 years old or younger. If the MCAB aneurysms were smaller than 2 mm, then an annual follow-up evaluation was recommended. For MCAB aneurysms with sizes between 2 and 5 mm, the decision for treatment was dependent on the morphology of the aneurysm, such as the daughter sac, multiplicity, previous history of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH), patient's age, patient's emotional status, and/or technical feasibility.

The clinical data were obtained from the patient's medical records. Using procedural records and images, the aneurysm characteristics, including the location of the aneurysm, size of the aneurysm (width and height), aneurysm neck diameter, vessel incorporation, and procedural details, including the immediate angiographic results and complications, were reviewed.

### Guidelines for the management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^113JNhyz]. Stroke (2015). Medium credibility.

Unruptured intracranial aneurysm — growth, hemorrhage risk, and imaging follow-up: In a serial MRA cohort, 1002 patients with 1325 aneurysms yielded 18 with interval growth, with an annual hemorrhage rate of 18.5% among those with documented growth, and modeling estimated that 90.3% of growing aneurysms would be detected before hemorrhage with screening at 6-month intervals. A second study of 258 aneurysms found 18% grew, with per-year hemorrhage 2.4% in the growing group versus 0.2% in the nongrowing group. Accordingly, "routine screening by noninvasive vascular imaging techniques to detect aneurysm growth is probably indicated", and "treatment of enlarging aneurysms with documented growth may be reasonable". Patients with aneurysms and autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease "do not appear to be at increased risk of aneurysm rupture, but experience is limited".

### An approach to recurrent aneurysms following endovascular coiling [^111U6pAC]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence regarding the most appropriate management of aneurysm recurrences following coiling consists only of uncontrolled case series and the resulting expert opinions, which range from not following coiled patients at all to performing invasive angiography at regular intervals.

Methods

We discuss several current attitudes toward how to manage post-coiling recurrences and outline an approach to finding concrete, practical answers to common clinical questions.

Results

Although some maxims and general statements can be reluctantly offered, in the absence of evidence the best approach is to emphasize proper methods in order to one day find reliable answers. These can only come from randomized clinical trials. The multitude of research questions is an added difficulty. A program of necessary trials is proposed and centers are encouraged to work in a collaborative fashion in order to offer best possible care as well as progress.

Conclusion

Common clinical questions, including how to follow coiled aneurysm patients, if and when to re-treat, and with which treatment modality, are best addressed with the sound scientific methodology of clinical trials.

Computed tomographic angiography (CTA) — With modern-generation scanners compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with 3D rotational acquisition, one report indicated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 96.3%, 100%, and 94.6%, respectively, with smaller aneurysms (those < 3 mm) showing 81.8%, 100%, and 93.3%, respectively. A 2003 meta-analysis of 21 studies including 1251 patients reported sensitivity 93.3% and specificity 87.8% for CTA compared with DSA. CTA can be considered as an initial diagnostic test for aneurysm detection and screening, but artifacts from bone or metal and radiation concerns may limit its usefulness for long-term follow-up in treated aneurysms.

KEY POINTS FOR PRACTICE
- The Ottawa SAH rule can be used to clinically rule out aneurysmal SAH.
- Early aneurysm repair at a stroke center that treats more than 35 cases per year improves outcomes.
- Euvolemia and blood pressure stability improve outcomes.
- After aneurysmal SAH, screening for psychological, sexual, and cognitive impairment can improve patient quality of life. From the AFP Editors Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage presents at a mean age of 55 years and affected patients are more likely to be Black, female, or tobacco users or have hypertension. Although patients rarely have a family history of cerebral aneurysm, two or more first-degree relatives with the condition confers a 12% prevalence of cerebral aneurysm. The American Heart Association and American Stroke Association released guidelines for the management of patients with aneurysmal SAH.

DIAGNOSING ANEURYSMAL SAH Classically, aneurysmal SAH presents with sudden-onset headache that immediately reaches its maximum intensity. Warning or sentinel headaches precede up to 43% of these hemorrhages. Aneurysmal SAH can be ruled out in alert patients 15 years or older with sudden-onset nontraumatic headache that reaches maximum intensity within 1 hour, and who have none of the signs or symptoms listed in the Ottawa SAH rule: age 40 years or older, neck pain or stiffness, witnessed loss of consciousness, onset during exertion, thunderclap headache, or limited neck flexion on examination.

### Management of tiny unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a comparative effectiveness analysis [^116XSswJ]. JAMA Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) are relatively common in the general population and are being increasingly diagnosed; a significant proportion are tiny (≤ 3 mm) aneurysms. There is significant heterogeneity in practice and lack of clear guidelines on the management of incidental, tiny UIAs. It is important to quantify the implications of different management strategies in terms of health benefits to patients.

Objective

To evaluate the effectiveness of routine treatment (aneurysm coiling) vs 3 strategies for imaging surveillance compared with no preventive treatment or routine follow-up of tiny UIAs.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A decision-analytic model-based comparative effectiveness analysis was conducted from May 1 to June 30, 2017, using inputs from the medical literature. PubMed searches were performed to identify relevant literature for all key model inputs, each of which was derived from the clinical study with the most robust data and greatest applicability. Analysis included 10 000 iterations simulating adult patients with incidental detections of UIAs 3 mm or smaller and no history of subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Interventions

The following 5 management strategies for tiny UIAs were evaluated: annual magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) screening, biennial MRA screening, MRA screening every 5 years, aneurysm coiling and follow-up, and no treatment or preventive follow-up.

Main Outcomes and Measures

A Markov decision model for lifetime rupture was constructed from a societal perspective per 10 000 patients with incidental, tiny UIAs. Outcomes were assessed in terms of quality-adjusted life-years. Probabilistic, 1-way, and 2-way sensitivity analyses were performed.

Results

In this analysis of 10 000 iterations simulating adult patients with a mean age of 50 years, the base-case calculation shows that the management strategy of no treatment or preventive follow-up has the highest health benefit (mean [SD] quality-adjusted life-years, 19.40 [0.31]). Among the management strategies that incorporate follow-up imaging, MRA every 5 years is the best strategy with the next highest effectiveness (mean [SD] quality-adjusted life-years, 18.05 [0.62]). The conclusion remains robust in probabilistic and 1-way sensitivity analyses. No routine follow-up remains the optimal strategy when the annual growth rate and risk of rupture of growing aneurysms are varied. When the annual risk of rupture of nongrowing UIAs is less than 1.7% (0.23% in base case scenario), no follow-up is the optimal strategy. If annual risk of rupture is more than 1.7%, coiling should be performed directly.

Conclusions and Relevance

Given the current literature, no preventive treatment or imaging follow-up is the most effective strategy in patients with aneurysms that are 3 mm or smaller, resulting in better health outcomes. More aggressive imaging surveillance for aneurysm growth or preventive treatment should be reserved for patients with a high risk of rupture. Given these findings, it is important to critically evaluate the appropriateness of current clinical practices, and potentially determine specific guidelines to reflect the most effective management strategy for patients with incidental, tiny UIAs.

Endovascular treatment of unruptured intracranial aneurysms — systematic reviews and temporal trends — reported low procedural mortality and morbidity, with a "case fatality rate of 0.6%, permanent morbidity rate of 7%, and hemorrhage rate of 0.9%", and "Procedural morbidity decreased from 8.6% to 4.5% in studies after 1995". In a systematic review of 71 publications, complications and efficacy included "procedural complications in 4.8% of cases, satisfactory aneurysm occlusion in 86.1%, and aneurysm regrowth or recurrence in 24.4% over 0.4 to 3.2 years of surveillance, as well as retreatment in these cases in 9.1%". This review also noted that "The annual risk of bleeding in treated patients was 0.2%, although clinical follow-up was often brief, only 6 months in 76.7% of reported cases".

### Prediction of outcomes after surgery for unruptured… [^117KLoa5]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Prediction of Outcomes After Surgery for Unruptured Intracranial Aneurysms ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Introduction Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are incidentally detected at an increasing rate, mostly owing to the rise in availability of non-invasive cranial imaging. Decision-making in UIAs is complex and requires consideration of many risk factors for aneurysm growth and rupture to balance the benefits and risks of treatment versus observation. This is due to: 1) the high morbidity and case fatality inherent to aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage 2) the relatively low rupture rate of unruptured aneurysms; 3) the potential morbidity and mortality rate associated with either microsurgical or endovascular treatment. Some consistent risk factors for rupture have been identified, including involvement of the posterior circulation, larger diameter, higher age, and some specific populations such as Japanese and Finnish patients.

Many other risk factors have been suggested based on varying levels of evidence. However, it is difficult to integrate this considerable number of factors into a single risk assessment and to present a clear clinical decision making algorithm to patients. A range of scoring systems have been developed and validated to approximate the risk of rupture and growth or to balance the risks and benefits of microsurgical treatment versus follow-up imaging directly by integrating some of these risk factors. Still, these scores are focused on predicting rupture events instead of neurological outcome. In addition, they usually are focused on solely one outcome, instead of providing a wide range of objective predictive analytics that may then improve shared decision-making. Machine learning methods have been extraordinarily effective at integrating many clinical patient variables into one holistic risk prediction tailored to each patient.

A previous pilot study has been carried out to assess the feasibility of predicting surgical outcomes after surgery for UIAs in a small single-center sample, and it was found that prediction was feasible with good performance metrics, and the most important factors to be included in such models were also identified. A robust, multicenter, externally validated prediction model or predictive score for surgical outcome after microsurgery for UIAs does not yet exist. Endpoint Definitions Models will be developed for the following three endpoints at discharge: Poor neurological outcome, as well as presence of new sensorimotor neurological deficits and any complications. Neurological outcome was assessed by the modified Rankin scale, and a favorable neurological outcome was defined as mRS 0, 1, or 2. Input Feature Definitions All features are measured preoperatively.

Recorded baseline variables will include age, gender, maximum aneurysm diameter, anatomical location, total number of aneurysms per patient, if multiple aneurysms were treated during the index session, calcification of the aneurysm wall or neck, aneurysm morphology, involvement of critical perforating or branch vessels, and intraluminal thrombosis. In addition, the investigators will capture prior SAH, mRS at admission, prior aneurysm treatment, presence of anticoagulation/antiplatelet therapy preoperatively, and hypertension, as well as American Society of Anesthesiologists grading, the PHASES, ELAPSS, and UIATS scores including the UIATS "pro-repair" and "pro-conservative treatment" subscores.

### Intracranial aneurysms: current evidence and clinical… [^1146jBoe]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

Intracranial aneurysm is a fairly common condition that is often asymptomatic until the time of rupture. Subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with aneurysmal rupture is a potentially lethal event with a mortality rate as high as 50 percent. 1 Many patients who survive the initial hemorrhage have permanent disability. Recent research has provided a greater understanding of intracranial aneurysms. dysplasia Pheochromocytoma Klinefelter's syndrome Tuberous sclerosis Noonan's syndrome Alpha-glucosidase deficiency|Age over 50 years Female gender Current cigarette smoking Cocaine use Infection of vessel wall Head trauma Intracranial neoplasm or neoplastic emboli Hypertension Alcohol Oral contraceptive pill use Hypercholesterolemia|. Various hereditary connective tissue disorders have been associated with the formation of aneurysms, presumably as a result of the weakening of vascular walls. One study.

Recent data have shown that age over 50 years, female gender, and current cigarette smoking are risk factors for intracranial aneurysm. 11 Saccular aneurysms develop from defects in the muscular layer of arteries. Alterations in the internal elastic membrane of cerebral arteries are thought to weaken vessel walls and render them less resistant to changes in intraluminal pressure. 12 These changes most frequently develop at sites of vessel bifurcation, where blood flow is most turbulent and shear forces against the arterial wall are greatest 13. Clinical Presentation Most intracranial aneurysms are asymptomatic and remain undetected until the time of rupture. Subarachnoid hemorrhage, a medical emergency, remains the most common initial clinical presentation. It was the first symptom in 58 percent of patients in one series.

15 A history of the abrupt onset of a severe headache of atypical quality is typical of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Headache onset may or may not be associated with brief loss of consciousness, nausea and vomiting, focal neurologic deficits, or meningismus. Despite the characteristic history, subarachnoid hemorrhage is frequently misdiagnosed. Nearly one half of patients present with milder symptoms caused by a "warning leak" before full rupture of the aneurysm. 16 A case-record review of 111 patients referred to a tertiary care center for the management of unruptured aneurysm found that only 41 percent of the aneurysms produced symptoms. Risk of Aneurysmal Rupture Given the high mortality rate associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms, determining the likelihood of rupture is critical to management decisions. Before 1998, several large studies 2, 19 found annual rupture rates of 1. 4 to

1.

9 percent for intracranial aneurysms; rates of rupture were higher when aneurysms were larger than 10 mm in diameter, symptomatic, or located in the posterior circulation. The annual rupture rate for larger aneurysms approached 1 percent. The ISUIA data suggest that aneurysms with a diameter of 10 mm or more are at critical risk for rupture. The study findings also make a strong case for differentiating patients with aneurysms and a history of subarachnoid hemorrhage from those without such a history. Surveillance of patients from the ISUIA is ongoing and will help to define the risk of aneurysmal rupture over time. Treatment of Intracranial Aneurysms Patients with suspected or confirmed asymptomatic or symptomatic intracranial aneurysms should be referred to a neurosurgeon. The two options for invasive treatment are open craniotomy and endovascular treatment. CRANIOTOMY AND OPEN REPAIR Surgical intervention has a longer history of use and more outcome data.

### Current imaging assessment and treatment of intracranial aneurysms [^1168sr3G]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

This article reviews current neuroimaging techniques used for screening, diagnosis, and follow-up of patients with intracranial aneurysms as well as neuroendovascular therapeutic options available to patients.

Conclusion

The diagnosis and management of intracranial aneurysms have evolved dramatically in the past 20 years. MR angiography and CT angiography allow radiologists to reliably and noninvasively diagnose most intracranial aneurysms. Nonoperative endovascular techniques for treating intracranial aneurysms are now making treatment increasingly safer and more effective.

### Indications for the performance of intracranial endovascular neurointerventional procedures: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^115oGPZp]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Unruptured intracranial aneurysms — rupture risk by history and size — report that among patients with no history of SAH, the rupture risk was 0.05%/y for aneurysms < 10 mm and ≈1%/y for larger aneurysms, whereas among those with a history of SAH from a different aneurysm, the rupture risk was 0.5%/y for those < 10 mm and ≈0.7%/y for larger aneurysms. Phase 2 of the ISUIA included a prospective natural history study of 1692 patients with 2686 unruptured aneurysms with a mean follow-up of 4.1 years, and five-year cumulative rupture rates for patients without a history of SAH with aneurysms selected for conservative management in the anterior circulation (ICA, anterior communicating or anterior cerebral artery, or MCA) were 0%, 2.6%, 14.5%, and 40% for aneurysms < 7, 7 to 12, 13 to 24, and ≥ 25 mm, respectively, compared with 2.5%, 14.5%, 18.4%, and 50% for the same size categories in the posterior circulation and posterior communicating artery.

### Management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms [^113F61YP]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Intracranial aneurysms are frequent incidental findings on cranial imaging. The decision for preventive treatment depends on the presumed risk of rupture, the efficacy and risk of complications of preventive treatment, and the quality of life having to live with an unruptured aneurysms. Data on all these factors are still incomplete, and additional data are needed.

Recent Findings

The current review describes advances of the last 2 years in assessment of risk of rupture, on risks of preventive aneurysms occlusion, on follow-up imaging and on medical management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

Summary

In addition to risk factors used to predict absolute risks of rupture, also aneurysm irregularity and aneurysm growth during follow-up are potential risk factors for rupture. To what extent these factors improve risk prediction in absolute terms is yet uncertain. Uncertainty also continues on whether endovascular or surgical occlusion is the preferred method, but a trial comparing these two strategies is ongoing. Aneurysm growth can now be predicted in absolute risks. Enhancement of the aneurysm wall on MRI probably is also related to aneurysm instability and reflects inflammation. A trial assessing the effects of anti-inflammatory treatment and blood pressure lowering on aneurysm growth and rupture is currently ongoing.

### The unruptured intracranial aneurysm treatment score: a multidisciplinary consensus [^113P7DS5]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

RESULTS

The study flow and participant frequencies during the Delphi consensus process are given in figure 1. The UIATS model was developed based on the data from rounds 1–4 in 3 domains (patient-, aneurysm-, and treatment-related), comprising 13 different categories and 29 different features (figure 2).

Figure 2
The unruptured intracranial aneurysm treatment score

The unruptured intracranial aneurysm treatment score (UIATS) model includes and quantifies the key factors for clinical decision-making in the management of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs), developed based on relevance rating data from Delphi consensus rounds 1–4. To calculate a management recommendation for a UIA, the number of points corresponding to each patient-, aneurysm-, or treatment-related feature on both management columns of the scoring form ("in favor of UIA repair" and "in favor of UIA conservative management") are added up. This will lead to 2 numerical values, 1 favoring aneurysm repair (surgical or endovascular), and 1 favoring conservative management. The definitions for each category and factor are found in the Methods section. For cases with a score difference of 3 points or more, the direction, i.e. the difference between the calculated numerical values on each side of the recommendation columns, will suggest an individual management recommendation (i.e. aneurysm repair or conservative management). For cases that have similar aneurysm treatment and conservative management scores (± 2 point difference or less), the recommendation is "not definitive" and either management approach could be supported, as additional factors apart from those used in the development of UIATS may be considered in making a final decision regarding the management recommendation and long-term follow-up. For cases with multiple aneurysms, every aneurysm must be evaluated separately, which will then also result in separate recommendations for each aneurysm. *The minimal intervention-related risk is always added as a constant factor (5 points). AComA = anterior communicating artery; BasA = basilar artery; BP = blood pressure; multiple = multiple selection category; PComA = posterior communicating artery; SAH = subarachnoid hemorrhage; single = single selection category.

### The natural course of unruptured cerebral aneurysms in a Japanese cohort [^114CVpCS]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

Background

The natural history of unruptured cerebral aneurysms has not been clearly defined.

Methods

From January 2001 through April 2004, we enrolled patients with newly identified, unruptured cerebral aneurysms in Japan. Information on the rupture of aneurysms, deaths, and the results of periodic follow-up examinations were recorded. We included 5720 patients 20 years of age or older (mean age, 62.5 years; 68% women) who had saccular aneurysms that were 3 mm or more in the largest dimension and who initially presented with no more than a slight disability.

Results

Of the 6697 aneurysms studied, 91% were discovered incidentally. Most aneurysms were in the middle cerebral arteries (36%) and the internal carotid arteries (34%). The mean (± SD) size of the aneurysms was 5.7 ± 3.6 mm. During a follow-up period that included 11,660 aneurysm-years, ruptures were documented in 111 patients, with an annual rate of rupture of 0.95% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.15). The risk of rupture increased with increasing size of the aneurysm. With aneurysms that were 3 to 4 mm in size as the reference, the hazard ratios for size categories were as follows: 5 to 6 mm, 1.13 (95% CI, 0.58 to 2.22); 7 to 9 mm, 3.35 (95% CI, 1.87 to 6.00); 10 to 24 mm, 9.09 (95% CI, 5.25 to 15.74); and 25 mm or larger, 76.26 (95% CI, 32.76 to 177.54). As compared with aneurysms in the middle cerebral arteries, those in the posterior and anterior communicating arteries were more likely to rupture (hazard ratio, 1.90 [95% CI, 1.12 to 3.21] and 2.02 [95% CI, 1.13 to 3.58], respectively). Aneurysms with a daughter sac (an irregular protrusion of the wall of the aneurysm) were also more likely to rupture (hazard ratio, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.08 to 2.48).

Conclusions

This study showed that the natural course of unruptured cerebral aneurysms varies according to the size, location, and shape of the aneurysm. (Funded by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare in Japan and others; UCAS Japan UMIN-CTR number, C000000418.).

### Radiological surveillance of small unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a systematic review, meta-analysis, and meta-regression of 8428 aneurysms [^115JNm2f]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

With the widespread use of imaging techniques, the possibility that an asymptomatic unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) is detected has increased significantly. There is no established consensus regarding follow-up, duration, and frequency of such imaging surveillance. The objectives of this study include assessing the growth rate and rupture risk of small (less than 7mm) UIAs, identifying associated risk factors and providing an aneurysm surveillance protocol in appropriately selected patients. Systematic searches of Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central were undertaken from database inception to March 2020 for published studies reporting the growth and rupture risks of small UIAs. Twenty-one studies reporting 8428 small UIAs were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled mean age was 61 years (95% CI: 55–67). The mean follow-up period for growth and rupture ranged from 11 to 108 months, with the pooled mean follow-up period across 14 studies being 42 months (95% CI: 33–51). Pooled overall growth rate was 6.0% (95% CI: 3.8–8.7). Pooled growth rates for aneurysms < 5mm and < 3 mm were 5.2% (95% CI: 3.0–7.9) and 0.8% (95% CI: 0.0–6.1), respectively. Pooled overall rupture rate was 0.4% (95% CI: 0.2–0.7). From the meta-regression analysis, having multiple aneurysms, smoking, hypertension, and personal history of SAH did not significantly predict growth, and a personal history of SAH, smoking, hypertension, and multiple aneurysms were not statistically significant predictors of rupture. Our findings suggest that small UIAs have low growth and rupture rates and very small UIAs have little or no risk for rupture. In the setting of incidental small UIAs, patients with multiple and/or posterior circulation aneurysms require more regular radiological monitoring.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation, management, and treatment of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) [^111uZKgf]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Intracranial aneurysm (ICA) screening and management in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) should be discussed for people with de novo ADPKD, those with unknown familial history or a small number of ADPKD-affected relatives, and those with personal or familial history of extracerebral vascular phenotype, and also can be discussed in specific clinical settings such as evaluation for kidney and/or liver transplantation or before major elective surgery. People with ADPKD who are not considered at increased risk for ICA and who, after comprehensive information, prefer being screened for ICA should be given access to screening. In women with ADPKD and either a family history of ICA, SAH, or unexplained sudden death; de novo ADPKD; unknown familial history; or a small number of ADPKD-affected relatives, screening for unruptured ICA should precede pregnancy planning. When screening is pursued, time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) without gadolinium enhancement should be used, with high-resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) as an alternative. If initial screening is negative in people with a high risk of ICA, the timing of rescreening should be individualized, possibly every 5–10 years, based on risk factors, age, and life expectancy. When one or several ICAs are identified, treatment options such as conservative management and microsvascular or endovascular repair should be assessed within a multidisciplinary setting at centers of expertise with high ICA case volumes.

### Guidelines for the management of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^114Fi7yo]. Stroke (2015). Medium credibility.

Imaging performance and follow-up after treatment — magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with volume rendering versus digital subtraction angiography (DSA) showed very high accuracy (96.4%–97.3% for the readers), and with this level of accuracy and appropriate protocols even small aneurysms should be detected. In postcoiled aneurysms, contrast-enhanced MRA had an overall sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 96% in detecting residual aneurysm compared with DSA, and care should be taken to ensure that the metallic implants are compatible with the magnetic environment of the MRI scanner. In the follow-up of treated UIAs, magnetic resonance is a reasonable option given the high sensitivity for a residual aneurysm, and for untreated UIAs the lack of ionizing radiation or contrast (for TOF MRA) makes it the option of choice in patients with renal compromise or in whom radiation exposure risks are relevant. For endovascularly treated aneurysms, imaging is often performed at 6 months to 1 year after treatment, and with residual aneurysms after coiling long-term follow-up is indicated because annual rates of hemorrhage in large and giant aneurysms are up to 1.9%. There is evidence that wider neck diameters, larger aneurysms, and partial treatment have a greater association with recurrence, and with unruptured aneurysms follow-up is indicated.

Fig. 1
A large right ruptured MCA aneurysm was treated with a total of 19 coils. The red arrow points to an incidental right paraclinoid unruptured aneurysm

Coiling is increasingly popular but does come with several shortcomings. Not all IAs are completely cured at first treatment necessitating post-treatment surveillance imaging and, in a minority, may require retreatment. Routine follow-up imaging of a treated IA is usually performed noninvasively by either CTA or MRA. There exist no guideline and no scientific data defining the optimal regime how frequently and how long to follow-up, but generally, the frequency is dictated by the completeness and method of the original repair, as well as the other patient and IA-specific factors. Another drawback of coiling is the need for retreatment due to coil compaction or IA recurrence, hence also further necessitating follow-up. A second treatment of IAs has been reported to be around 12%, on average of 27 months after the previous procedure. Hence, the typical scheme would include a first follow-up scheduled 3–6 months after the endovascular procedure, followed by a 12–24-month follow-up and a midterm follow-up at 3–5 years. The combination of invasiveness and radiation make digital subtraction angiography (DSA) less readily used for follow-up, but is useful to ascertain an accurate estimation of the size of the IA remnant. If not diligently followed post-treatment, ruptured IA patients treated with coiling may be at risk of delayed IA recanalization and recurrent SAH.

Possible determinants for initial incomplete IA occlusion and complications are unfavorable IA anatomy and vessel geometry as well as the types of coils that are used. Possible risk factors for recurrence of a coiled IA over time are large IA size, presence of intraluminal thrombus, low packing density, initial incomplete occlusion, duration of follow-up, ruptured IAs, location in the posterior circulation, and a large neck–dome ratio.

There are several major complications associated with coil embolization: thromboembolism, perforation of the IA, early rebleeding, parent artery obstruction, collapsed coils, coil malposition, even coil migration.

### Experience of a single center in the conservative approach of 20 consecutive cases of asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery aneurysms [^116ufUwi]. European Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

The clinical course and optimal treatment strategy for asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery aneurysms (ECAAs) are unknown. We report our single-center experience with conservative management of patients with an asymptomatic ECAA.

Methods

A search in our hospital records from 1998 to 2013 revealed 20 patients [mean age 52 (SD 12.5) years] with 23 ECAAs, defined as a 150% or more fusiform dilation or any saccular dilatation compared with the healthy internal carotid artery. None of the aneurysms were treated and we had no pre-defined follow-up schedule for these patients. The primary study end-point was the yearly rate for ipsilateral ischemic stroke. Secondary end-points were ipsilateral transient ischemic attack, any stroke-related death, other symptoms related to the aneurysm or growth defined as any diameter increase.

Results

The ECAA was either fusiform (n = 6; mean diameter 10.2 mm) or saccular (n = 17; mean diameter 10.9 mm). Eleven (55%) patients with 13 ECAAs received antithrombotic medication. During follow-up [median 46.5 (range 1–121) months], one patient died due to ipsilateral stroke and the ipsilateral cerebral stroke rate was 1.1 per 100 patient-years (95% confidence interval, 0.01–6.3). Three patients had ECAA growth, two of whom were asymptomatic and one was the patient who suffered a stroke.

Conclusions

In this retrospective case series of patients with an asymptomatic ECAA, the risk of cerebral infarction is small but not negligible. Conservative management seems justified, in particular in patients without growth. Large prospective registry data are necessary to assess follow-up imaging strategies and the role of antiplatelet therapy.

### Growth and rupture risk of small unruptured intracranial aneurysms: a systematic review [^114cLtS8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Small unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) are increasingly diagnosed. Management depends on growth and rupture risks, which may vary by aneurysm size.

Purpose

To summarize evidence about the growth and rupture risk of UIAs 7 mm and smaller and to explore differences in growth and rupture risks of very small (≤ 3 mm) and small (≤ 5 mm) aneurysms.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library from inception to 2017 (with no language restrictions).

Study Selection

Published case series and observational studies that reported natural history data on UIAs 7 mm and smaller.

Data Extraction

2 reviewers abstracted study information, evaluated study quality, and graded strength of evidence.

Data Synthesis

Of 26 studies, 5, 10, and 8 described the growth rate of aneurysms 3 mm and smaller, 5 mm and smaller, and 7 mm and smaller, respectively, whereas rupture rates were reported in 7, 11, and 13 studies for aneurysms 3 mm and smaller, 5 mm and smaller, and 7 mm and smaller, respectively. The annualized growth rate was less than 3% in all but 1 study for all 3 size categories. The annualized rupture rate was 0%, less than 0.5%, and less than 1% for the 3 size categories, respectively. Strength of evidence was very low quality for growth rates and low quality for rupture rates.

Limitation

Heterogeneous definitions of growth; heterogeneous and selective treatment and follow-up methods, particularly in high-risk patients.

Conclusion

Poor-quality evidence suggests that small UIAs have low growth and rupture rates and very small UIAs have little or no risk for rupture.

Primary Funding Source

None.

### Opinion: imaging follow-up after coiling of intracranial aneurysms [^11446KmP]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2009). Low credibility.

Coiling is increasingly used as treatment for intracranial aneurysms with favorable short-term outcome. Concern exists about long-term reopening and the inherent risk of recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and long-term imaging follow-up is advocated. It is unknown for how long and how often coiled aneurysms need to be followed and what subgroups carry a higher or lower risk for reopening. Recently, new data have become available that concern the designation of an optimal long-term follow-up protocol. Three studies focused on a special subgroup, the coiled aneurysms that are adequately occluded at 6 months. This subgroup comprises about 80% of all coiled aneurysms. In these aneurysms, the risk of reopening that needs retreatment during the next 5–10 years is very low. In addition, the risk of recurrent SAH is almost zero, even lower than that after clipping. Within the first 5 years after coiling, the incidence of the development of de novo aneurysms or enlargement of existing untreated aneurysms is low, with an extremely low risk of recurrent SAH from these aneurysms. These data suggest that aneurysms that are adequately occluded at 6 months after coiling, in general, do not need prolonged imaging follow-up in the next 5–10 years. More data are needed to identify possible subgroups with adequately occluded coiled aneurysms at 6 months that behave differently on longer follow-up, such as giant aneurysms, partially thrombosed aneurysms, or patients with a positive family history.

Unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA) surgical clipping — efficacy and durability show high immediate occlusion with variable long-term recurrence: in a meta-analysis, only 10 of 61 studies reported postoperative angiography, and 5 studies showed 11 incomplete clippings among 158 patients for a 93% complete obliteration rate; across 1969 postoperative examinations, 91.8% were completely occluded, 3.9% had neck remnants, and 4.3% were incompletely occluded; limited long-term hemorrhage data found 3 hemorrhages (0.38%) during an average 1.2-year follow-up among 773 patients; in a 147-aneurysm series, immediate angiography showed complete occlusion in 135 (91.8%) with residual neck in 12 (8.2%), and at 3 years 2 recurrent aneurysms (1.5%) occurred; among known residuals, 2 of 8 dog‑ear residuals enlarged versus 3 of 4 broad‑based; longer-term series reported regrowth 0.26% per year for completely clipped aneurysms, de novo formation 0.89% per year, higher regrowth in incompletely clipped lesions (7.1% versus 2.4%), a cumulative SAH risk of 1.4% in 10 years and 12.4% in 20 years, and in a large series 0.2% SAH and 0.9% recurrent aneurysms among 1016 over 15 years; collectively, these findings warrant consideration for repeat imaging within a 5- to 10-year time frame, and even up to 20 years in younger patients.

### Best practices guidelines in imaging [^112tNMRH]. ACS (2018). Medium credibility.

Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) imaging — adult screening, modality roles, and follow-up is described, noting a high false positive rate "up to 47.9 percent" especially with Grade I BCVI, and that in this patient population "it is recommended to re-evaluate the patient with MDCTA in 7–10 days or proceed with DSA to confirm diagnosis". "DSA is now usually reserved for the patient who requires an endovascular intervention or when a complex lesion needs to be more clearly defined, and when findings on CTA are equivocal or are negative and clinical suspicion remains high". Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) "requires a longer imaging time and a potential need for sedation that limits its application as a screening study for patients with critical injuries" and, for BCVI screening at the time of brain MRI, "is judged to be inferior to CTA by the American College of Radiology (ACR), with an assigned appropriateness criteria of 5 (a score of 9 is most appropriate and 1 is least appropriate)". Follow-up is emphasized: "Follow up imaging is needed to reassess the patient diagnosed with BCVI", with timing that "remains controversial and varies from 1 week to 3 months, depending of the grade of injury and the clinical condition of the patient".

### Cost-effectiveness analysis on small [^112kN3bp]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Unruptured intracranial aneurysms are frequently detected during routine clinical diagnostic processes. A significant portion are small aneurysms less than 5 mm in diameter. While follow-up of patients with small aneurysms has been advocated, the cost-effectiveness of such care and the optimal follow-up interval remain unknown. This study aimed to explore the most cost-effective follow-up interval for small (< 5 mm) unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

Methods

A decision analysis study was performed using a Markov model with Monte Carlo simulations to simulate patients undergoing follow-up by MRA at different time intervals (1-, 2-, 3-, 5-, and 7-year intervals) for small (< 5 mm) unruptured intracranial aneurysms. Input data for the model were extracted from the current literature, primarily meta-analyses. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the model.

Results

Given the current literature and the model in this study, following up every 2 years with noninvasive imaging is the most cost-effective strategy (cost $126,996, effectiveness 21.9 quality-adjusted life-years), showing the highest net monetary benefit. The conclusion remains robust in probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. As the annual growth risk of small aneurysms and annual rupture risk of growing aneurysms increase, following up every year is optimal. When the cost for follow-up with MRA is less than $2223, following up every year is cost-effective.

Conclusions

The most cost-effective follow-up strategy for small (< 5 mm) unruptured aneurysms using MRA is following up every 2 years. More frequent follow-up strategies or prompt preventive treatment would be more appropriate in patients with higher risk factors for growth and aneurysm rupture.

### Risk of rupture after intracranial aneurysm growth [^116nmrAK]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Unruptured intracranial aneurysms not undergoing preventive endovascular or neurosurgical treatment are often monitored radiologically to detect aneurysm growth, which is associated with an increase in risk of rupture. However, the absolute risk of aneurysm rupture after detection of growth remains unclear.

Objective

To determine the absolute risk of rupture of an aneurysm after detection of growth during follow-up and to develop a prediction model for rupture.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Individual patient data were obtained from 15 international cohorts. Patients 18 years and older who had follow-up imaging for at least 1 untreated unruptured intracranial aneurysm with growth detected at follow-up imaging and with 1 day or longer of follow-up after growth were included. Fusiform or arteriovenous malformation-related aneurysms were excluded. Of the 5166 eligible patients who had follow-up imaging for intracranial aneurysms, 4827 were excluded because no aneurysm growth was detected, and 27 were excluded because they had less than 1 day follow-up after detection of growth.

Exposures

All included aneurysms had growth, defined as 1 mm or greater increase in 1 direction at follow-up imaging.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was aneurysm rupture. The absolute risk of rupture was measured with the Kaplan-Meier estimate at 3 time points (6 months, 1 year, and 2 years) after initial growth. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify predictors of rupture after growth detection.

Results

A total of 312 patients were included (223 [71%] were women; mean [SD] age, 61 [12] years) with 329 aneurysms with growth. During 864 aneurysm-years of follow-up, 25 (7.6%) of these aneurysms ruptured. The absolute risk of rupture after growth was 2.9% (95% CI, 0.9–4.9) at 6 months, 4.3% (95% CI, 1.9–6.7) at 1 year, and 6.0% (95% CI, 2.9–9.1) at 2 years. In multivariable analyses, predictors of rupture were size (7 mm or larger hazard ratio, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4–7.2), shape (irregular hazard ratio, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.3–6.5), and site (middle cerebral artery hazard ratio, 3.6; 95% CI, 0.8–16.3; anterior cerebral artery, posterior communicating artery, or posterior circulation hazard ratio, 2.8; 95% CI, 0.6–13.0). In the triple-S (size, site, shape) prediction model, the 1-year risk of rupture ranged from 2.1% to 10.6%.

Conclusion and Relevance

Within 1 year after growth detection, rupture occurred in approximately 1 of 25 aneurysms. The triple-S risk prediction model can be used to estimate absolute risk of rupture for the initial period after detection of growth.

### Aneurysm growth and de novo aneurysms during aneurysm surveillance [^112kQfFW]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2016). Low credibility.

OBJECTIVE Many low-risk unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIAs) are followed for growth with surveillance imaging. Growth of UIAs likely increases the risk of rupture. The incidence and risk factors of UIA growth or de novo aneurysm formation require further research. The authors retrospectively identify risk factors and annual risk for UIA growth or de novo aneurysm formation in an aneurysm surveillance protocol. METHODS Over an 11.5-year period, the authors recommended surveillance imaging to 192 patients with 234 UIAs. The incidence of UIA growth and de novo aneurysm formation was assessed. With logistic regression, risk factors for UIA growth or de novo aneurysm formation and patient compliance with the surveillance protocol was assessed. RESULTS During 621 patient-years of follow-up, the incidence of aneurysm growth or de novo aneurysm formation was 5.0%/patient-year. At the 6-month examination, 5.2% of patients had aneurysm growth and 4.3% of aneurysms had grown. Four de novo aneurysms formed (0.64%/patient-year). Over 793 aneurysm-years of follow-up, the annual risk of aneurysm growth was 3.7%. Only initial aneurysm size predicted aneurysm growth (UIA < 5 mm = 1.6% vs UIA ≥ 5 mm = 8.7%, p = 0.002). Patients with growing UIAs were more likely to also have de novo aneurysms (p = 0.01). Patient compliance with this protocol was 65%, with younger age predictive of better compliance (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Observation of low-risk UIAs with surveillance imaging can be implemented safely with good adherence. Aneurysm size is the only predictor of future growth. More frequent (semiannual) surveillance imaging for newly diagnosed UIAs and UIAs ≥ 5 mm is warranted.

### Detection rates and trends of asymptomatic unruptured intracranial aneurysms from 2005 to 2019 [^113ij1Cr]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

In the past 15 years, there has been a significant increase in the number and detection rate of asymptomatic UIAs in parallel with the increased use of brain CTA and MRA imaging. This increase is particularly notable in elderly populations, who are increasingly undergoing brain CTA and MRA imaging. As a result, a higher number of UIAs are being detected in the older population. In addition, there has been a rise in the detection of UIAs smaller than 5 mm. Our findings underscore the importance of developing standardized management guidelines for detected UIAs and further research to better understand their natural history.

### Comprehensive review of imaging of intracranial aneurysms and angiographically negative subarachnoid hemorrhage [^1135NgdV]. Neurosurgical Focus (2019). Medium credibility.

Intracranial aneurysms confer the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), a potentially devastating condition, though most aneurysms will remain asymptomatic for the lifetime of the patient. Imaging is critical to all stages of patient care for those who harbor an unruptured intracranial aneurysm (UIA), including to establish the diagnosis, to determine therapeutic options, to undertake surveillance in patients who elect not to undergo treatment or whose aneurysm(s) portends such a low risk that treatment is not indicated, and to perform follow-up after treatment. Neuroimaging is equally as important in patients who suffer an SAH. DSA remains the reference standard for imaging of intracranial aneurysms due to its high spatial and temporal resolution. As noninvasive imaging technology, such as CTA and MRA, improves, the diagnostic accuracy of such tests continues to increasingly approximate that of DSA. In cases of angiographically negative SAH, imaging protocols are necessary not only for diagnosis but also to search for an initially occult vascular lesion, such as a thrombosed, ruptured aneurysm that might be detected in a delayed fashion. Given the crucial role of neuroimaging in all aspects of care for patients with UIAs and SAH, it is incumbent on those who care for these patients, including cerebrovascular neurosurgeons, interventional neurologists and neuroradiologists, and diagnostic radiologists and neurointensivists, to understand the role of imaging in this disease and how individual members of the multispecialty team use imaging to ensure best practices to deliver cutting-edge care to these often complex cases. This review expounds on the role of imaging in the management of UIAs and ruptured intracranial aneurysms and in the workup of angiographically negative subarachnoid hemorrhage.

### Detection rates and trends of asymptomatic unruptured intracranial aneurysms from 2005 to 2019 [^112MFmzv]. Neurosurgery (2024). Medium credibility.

The most striking finding in our study was that brain CTA/MRA imaging and detection rate of asymptomatic UIAs have increased over time, especially in the elderly population. Specifically, from 2015 to 2019, the detection rate of UIAs increased notably among subjects aged over 70 years when compared with earlier periods. However, the detection rate of asymptomatic UIAs did not change significantly in patients aged 0–49 years between 2005 and 2019. Similar to earlier studies, we observed an age-related increase in the detection rate of asymptomatic UIAs, with the highest detection rate observed in individuals older than 50 years (3.2%-3.5%), with a peak in the age group of 60–69 years.

The incidence of aneurysmal SAH is increasing in the elderly, and higher age might increase the risk of UIA rupture even after the age of 80 years. However, the management of asymptomatic UIAs in the elderly population is controversial, because surgical procedures may pose a higher risk of complications in these individuals, although careful patient selection may decrease the risk of complications. Nevertheless, it seems that the number of detected UIAs in the elderly population is increasing, and the trend is likely to continue with the aging of the population and increased life expectancy.

As in previous studies, we also observed that most of the detected UIAs are small. We found that the mean size of detected UIAs has decreased over time and that the detection rate and the proportion of UIAs smaller than 5 mm have increased. Because aneurysms of size less than 5–7 mm are generally recommended to be managed conservatively, more aneurysms may require imaging surveillance, which could potentially result in an increased burden on healthcare budgets.

Based on our study, the number of discovered asymptomatic UIAs is increasing, particularly in the elderly population. It is crucial to develop more precise methods for assessing the risk of UIA rupture, which would aid in better resource allocation. In addition, it would be advantageous to have conservative treatment options for UIAs, such as medication, and new imaging modalities for evaluating the risk of UIA rupture.

The 5-year risk of rupture for small aneurysms (< 5 mm) of ≈1.7% was reported; compared with aneurysms 3 to 4 mm, those 5 to 6 mm were not associated with a significantly increased risk, but rupture risk was significantly higher for all aneurysms ≥ 7 mm, and aneurysms at the anterior communicating artery and posterior communicating artery junction with the ICA had a significantly greater risk. Smoking and hypertension were also associated with higher rupture risks. Separately, a long-term follow-up series tracked 142 patients with unruptured aneurysms for a total of 34 002 person-years.

### Unruptured intracranial aneurysms conservatively followed with serial CT angiography: could morphology and growth predict rupture? [^112TjHPz]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Despite several landmark studies, the natural history of unruptured intracranial aneurysms (UIA) remains uncertain. Our aim was to identify or confirm factors predictive of rupture of UIA being observed conservatively with serial CT angiography (CTA) in a North American patient population.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of patients with UIA being followed with serial CTA studies from 1999 to 2010. The following features for each aneurysm were cataloged from the official radiologic reports and CTA images: maximum diameter, growth between follow-up studies, location, multiplicity, wall calcification, intraluminal thrombus and morphology. Univariate logistic regression analysis of the potential independent risk factors for aneurysm rupture was performed. Statistically significant risk factors from the univariate analysis were then entered into a multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

152 patients with a total of 180 UIA had at least two CTA studies. Six aneurysms in six different patients ruptured during the CTA follow-up period for an overall rupture rate of 3.3% and an annual rupture rate of 0.97%. All ruptured aneurysms were ≥ 9mm. In the univariate analysis, the statistically significant predictors of aneurysm rupture were aneurysm size (p = 0.003), aneurysm growth (p < 0.0001) and aneurysm multilobulation (p = 0.001). The risk factors that remained significant following the multivariate analysis were growth (OR 55.9; 95% CI 4.47 to 700.08; p = 0.002) and multilobulation (OR 17.4; 95% CI 1.52 to 198.4; p = 0.022).

Conclusions

Aneurysm morphology and interval growth are characteristics predictive of a higher risk of subsequent rupture during conservative CTA follow-up.

### Follow-up of intracranial aneurysms in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease [^114zEuSj]. Kidney International (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Approximately 8% of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients have intracranial aneurysms. The risk of growth and rupture of those discovered by presymptomatic screening is key to the feasibility and success of a screening program. This study was initiated to ascertain this risk.

Methods

ADPKD patients were offered screening with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging that included three-dimensional time-of-flight MR angiographic and three-dimensional phase-contrast sequences. Patients with aneurysms were recommended periodic surveillance, initially at 6 months and yearly, and less frequently after demonstration of their stability.

Results

Twenty-two saccular and one fusiform aneurysms were detected at the initial screening in 21 patients from 19 families (seven men and 14 women, 47.9 ± 10.6 years old). All the saccular aneurysms were small (mean diameter 3.5 mm, range 2.0 to 6.5 mm) and the majority (77%) in the anterior circulation. Two patients died from unrelated causes without further follow-up. One patient was lost to follow-up. A new 2 mm middle cerebral artery aneurysm developed in one patient. One aneurysm increased from a size of 4 mm to 5 mm after a follow-up of 105 months. No aneurysmal development or growth occurred in the remaining 16 patients. No aneurysmal rupture occurred during a mean imaging follow-up of 81 months and a mean clinical follow-up of 92 months. During the period of the study, two additional ADPKD patients, with three intracranial aneurysms detected elsewhere by presymptomatic MR angiographic screening, were referred for surgical treatment. The larger size of these aneurysms (10, 8, and 8 mm) probably reflects referral bias.

Conclusion

Most intracranial aneurysms detected by presymptomatic screening in ADPKD patients are small and in the anterior circulation. The follow-up results do not suggest an increased risk for growth and rupture, compared to those of intracranial aneurysms in the general population. These data do not support widespread screening for intracranial aneurysms in the ADPKD population.

### Noninvasive imaging of treated cerebral aneurysms, part II: CT angiographic follow-up of surgically clipped aneurysms [^111oo2uA]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2007). Low credibility.

Although not useful for the evaluation of coiled aneurysms, CT angiography (CTA) is far superior to MR angiography (MRA) for the evaluation of aneurysms after surgical clipping. Using the latest multidetector row scanners and optimized imaging parameters, CTA can often effectively depict and follow small aneurysm remnants; demonstrate patency, stenosis, or vasospasm in the adjacent parent vessels; and provide surveillance of the entire cerebrovasculature for de novo aneurysms after surgical clipping. Despite these advances, conventional angiography remains the gold standard for the evaluation of surgically treated aneurysms and should be liberally used to resolve any cases of diagnostic uncertainty on noninvasive imaging.

Summary — cerebral aneurysm management states that endovascular treatment of unruptured cerebral aneurysms is reasonable to prevent subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and patients deemed amenable to endovascular treatment should be fully informed of the risks and benefits of endovascular and microsurgical treatments, as well as medical management and imaging surveillance. Patients with nontraumatic SAH should undergo immediate vascular imaging; computed tomographic angiography (CTA) may be the first vascular imaging test and is often sufficient for treatment decisions, and if CTA is inconclusive or does not show the cause of SAH, digital subtraction angiography remains the gold standard vascular imaging test. Endovascular coil occlusion is appropriate for patients with ruptured cerebral artery aneurysms that are deemed treatable either by endovascular coiling or by surgical clipping. Endoluminal flow diversion may be considered as an alternative to coil embolization in carefully selected cases, but there is insufficient evidence at this time to recommend this strategy as a treatment for most aneurysms; strict adherence to the FDA's indications for use is probably indicated until additional trial data demonstrate an incremental improvement in safety and efficacy over existing technologies.
