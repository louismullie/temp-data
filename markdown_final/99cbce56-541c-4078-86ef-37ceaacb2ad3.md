## Question

Management of epidimal cyst

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the management of epididymal cysts. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying terminology and confirming the clinical entity. Then, I should verify the diagnostic approach and how to distinguish epididymal cysts from mimics. Next, I will review the natural history to anchor conservative management. After that, I need to define clear indications for intervention. Then, I will examine surgical options and techniques, including microsurgery and minimally invasive approaches. I should also consider special populations such as children and patients with fertility goals. Finally, I will synthesize a practical algorithm and counseling points, while double-checking areas where the evidence is limited or conflicting.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so we don't conflate entities. "Epidermal cyst" in the trace looks like a typographical error; I should correct this to "epididymal cyst", which is a benign, fluid-filled lesion arising from the epididymis and distinct from a spermatocele, even though both are often grouped as epididymal cystic lesions in clinical practice and research [^113vaFXH] [^115Bufiq]. Hold on, I should verify that ultrasound reliably distinguishes these; yes, scrotal ultrasound is the first-line modality to characterize paratesticular cysts and guide management decisions [^116qy143].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic approach and differential. I need to ensure we exclude torsion, testicular tumors, and inflammatory conditions like epididymitis. Ultrasound with Doppler is essential to confirm an avascular, anechoic cyst and to assess testicular perfusion; clinical correlation is crucial when torsion is suspected, and urgent urologic evaluation is warranted if torsion cannot be excluded [^112uAxv1]. Wait, let me verify the role of MRI; MRI is not routine for simple epididymal cysts but can be reserved for indeterminate or complex lesions when malignancy is a concern or when anatomy is obscured, aligning with broader principles for cystic lesions where advanced imaging refines diagnosis when ultrasound is inconclusive [^112XdPHs].

> I will now examine the natural history to justify conservative management. In children, epididymal cysts frequently involute or decrease in size over time. Complete involution occurred in 29% at a mean of 11.2 months in one series, and another pediatric series reported resolution in 50% with an average time to regression of 17 months, supporting observation when asymptomatic [^115gA5yr] [^112XdPHs]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought adult cysts behave similarly, but I should be cautious. Adult data on spontaneous resolution are sparse, so the stronger evidence base for involution applies primarily to pediatric populations, whereas adults are generally managed expectantly if asymptomatic with periodic ultrasound surveillance rather than assuming spontaneous resolution [^112XdPHs].

> Now, I need to define clear indications for intervention. Persistent, bothersome pain despite conservative measures is the most common reason to operate. Cosmetic deformity from a large mass and patient preference after counseling are reasonable, while asymptomatic status alone is not an indication for surgery [^113vaFXH]. Hold on, I should verify fertility considerations; although epididymal cystic lesions are not associated with impaired semen parameters in large cohorts, patients with fertility goals and large or symptomatic cysts may reasonably consider microsurgical excision after discussing risks and benefits, recognizing that evidence is mixed and individualized counseling is key [^112XdPHs] [^115MBKVd].

> Let me consider surgical options and techniques, and I should double-check the risk of epididymal injury. Traditional open epididymal cystectomy is effective but carries a risk of epididymal tubule injury and obstruction; microsurgical epididymal cystectomy or spermatocelectomy improves visualization and protection of epididymal ducts and testicular vessels, reducing the risk of iatrogenic obstruction and testicular atrophy, with series showing no recurrence and preserved or improved sperm parameters in selected patients [^114tHwaJ] [^115MBKVd]. But wait, what if we want to minimize invasiveness further; scrotoscope-assisted minimal excision has been described with shorter operative time, smaller incision, and high symptom relief, though data are limited and technique availability varies, so patient selection and surgeon experience matter [^1169yg12].

> I should confirm the approach and incision choice. For large or complex extratesticular masses where malignancy must be excluded, an inguinal approach with testis-sparing is favored to allow formal control of the cord and oncologically sound management if needed; for straightforward, benign-appearing epididymal cysts, a scrotal approach with meticulous technique is acceptable [^115Bufiq]. Hold on, I should verify that testis-sparing is emphasized; yes, contemporary series prioritize testicular preservation when feasible, aligning with functional goals [^115Bufiq].

> Next, I should review special populations, starting with children. Given the high likelihood of spontaneous involution, conservative management with ultrasound surveillance is preferred. Surgery is reserved for persistent pain, failure to regress with time, or parental preference after counseling, and pediatric urology follow-up ensures appropriate intervals and expectations [^115gA5yr] [^115KWxo8]. Let me reconsider whether any guideline contradicts this; I don't see pediatric-specific guidelines mandating intervention for asymptomatic epididymal cysts, reinforcing observation as standard [^notfound].

> For patients with fertility goals, I need to ensure we balance symptom relief against potential epididymal injury. Microsurgical techniques minimize ductal damage and have not been shown to worsen semen parameters in aggregate, with some series suggesting improvement in select large cysts. Nonetheless, preoperative counseling should include the possibility of subclinical obstruction and the option of sperm cryopreservation when concern is high or bilateral disease is present [^115MBKVd] [^114tHwaJ]. Wait, let me verify the broader fertility data. Population-level evidence does not show worse semen parameters in men with epididymal cystic lesions, which supports individualized decisions rather than routine surgery for fertility alone [^112XdPHs].

> I should also address chronic scrotal content pain syndromes where epididymal cysts may be contributory. After failure of conservative therapy, focal epididymal pain can be addressed with targeted epididymectomy in carefully selected patients; outcomes are best when pain is focal to the epididymis and there is a history of vasectomy, whereas idiopathic epididymal pain without vasectomy has lower response and surgery should be a last resort [^116wczgJ] [^115zTrKw]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; epididymectomy is not a panacea and should follow a structured pain management pathway, with shared decision-making about expectations and risks [^1178Ktgz].

> Let me synthesize a practical management algorithm, and I will double-check that it aligns with the evidence. Asymptomatic cysts, confirmed on ultrasound, should be observed with reassurance and periodic ultrasound; symptomatic cysts warrant a trial of conservative measures including analgesics and supportive care, with surgery considered after 3–6 months if pain persists or the mass is large and cosmetically bothersome; in men with fertility goals, consider microsurgical excision for large or symptomatic cysts after counseling, with consideration of sperm banking when risk of obstruction is nontrivial; in children, favor observation given high rates of involution, reserving surgery for persistent pain or failure to regress [^113vaFXH] [^115gA5yr] [^115KWxo8] [^115MBKVd]. I should confirm that this approach avoids overtreatment; yes, it reserves intervention for clear indications while leveraging the favorable natural history in pediatrics and the safety of modern microsurgical techniques when surgery is needed [^113vaFXH] [^114tHwaJ].

> Finally, I need to ensure counseling points are explicit. Patients should be informed that epididymal cysts are benign, that most can be safely observed, that pain often improves with conservative care, and that surgery is effective for persistent symptoms but carries small risks such as hematoma, infection, recurrence, and rare epididymal obstruction. Microsurgery reduces but does not eliminate these risks, and fertility impact is generally minimal in experienced hands, though individual risk varies with cyst size, location, and bilateral disease [^113vaFXH] [^114tHwaJ] [^115MBKVd]. Hold on, I should verify that we also address anxiety about malignancy. Ultrasound features are typically diagnostic for benign cysts, and the differential for paratesticular masses includes rare malignant mimics, which reinforces the value of expert imaging and selective surgical excision when features are atypical or symptoms persist despite observation [^113vaFXH] [^116qy143].

---

Epididymal cysts are benign, fluid-filled lesions that are best managed conservatively when asymptomatic, with **observation and reassurance** as first-line care [^112XdPHs]. Ultrasound confirms the diagnosis and guides follow-up; **no treatment is needed** unless symptoms occur [^115KWxo8]. If pain, discomfort, or cosmetic concerns persist, **surgical options** include microsurgical cystectomy or spermatocelectomy, which are safe and effective with low recurrence and minimal impact on fertility [^115MBKVd] [^114tHwaJ]. Aspiration or sclerotherapy is less favored due to higher recurrence and infection risk. Routine follow-up is not required after successful treatment, but patients should be advised to return if symptoms recur.

---

## Clinical presentation and diagnosis

Epididymal cysts typically present as painless, **palpable scrotal masses** that are smooth, round, and mobile, and are often discovered incidentally during routine examination or self-examination [^112XdPHs]. They may also cause mild discomfort or cosmetic concerns, particularly when large. Ultrasound is the **gold standard** for diagnosis, providing detailed characterization of the cyst, including size, location, and relationship to the epididymis and testis [^notfound]. Ultrasound features include:

- **Anechoic or hypoechoic lesion**: Located in the epididymal head or tail, separate from the testis [^notfound].
- **Well-defined walls**: Thin, smooth walls without internal septations or solid components [^notfound].
- **Posterior acoustic enhancement**: Typical of fluid-filled lesions [^notfound].

Ultrasound also helps differentiate epididymal cysts from other scrotal lesions, such as spermatoceles, hydroceles, varicoceles, and testicular tumors [^116qy143].

---

## Indications for treatment

Most epididymal cysts are asymptomatic and require **no treatment**. Indications for intervention include:

- **Persistent pain or discomfort**: Despite conservative management [^115gA5yr].
- **Cosmetic concerns**: Significant psychological distress or cosmetic deformity [^notfound].
- **Rapid growth or large size**: Particularly if symptomatic or causing cosmetic issues [^notfound].
- **Patient preference**: Strong desire for removal after counseling [^notfound].

---

## Conservative management

Conservative management is appropriate for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cysts and includes **observation and reassurance**, with periodic clinical review and ultrasound if needed [^113vaFXH]. Analgesics may be used for mild discomfort or pain, and patient education should explain the benign nature of the cyst and the risks and benefits of intervention versus observation [^113vaFXH].

---

## Surgical management

Surgical intervention is indicated for symptomatic cysts, cosmetic concerns, or patient preference. The primary goals are symptom relief, cosmetic improvement, and preservation of fertility [^115MBKVd].

---

### Surgical techniques

Several surgical techniques are available, each with distinct advantages and limitations:

| **Technique** | **Description** | **Advantages** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Microsurgical cystectomy | Microsurgical excision of the cyst with preservation of epididymal structures | - High success <br/> - Low recurrence <br/> - Minimal impact on fertility | - Requires specialized equipment and expertise <br/> - Longer operative time |
| Spermatocelectomy | Excision of spermatocele (epididymal cyst containing sperm) | - Effective for large cysts <br/> - Low recurrence | - Risk of epididymal injury <br/> - Potential impact on fertility |
| Aspiration and sclerotherapy | Aspiration of cyst fluid followed by injection of sclerosing agent | - Minimally invasive <br/> - Short procedure time | - High recurrence <br/> - Risk of infection <br/> - Less favored |

---

Microsurgical cystectomy is the **preferred surgical approach** due to its high success rate, low recurrence, and minimal impact on fertility [^115MBKVd]. Studies have demonstrated that microsurgical epididymal cystectomy does not significantly affect sperm count, motility, or morphology, making it particularly suitable for young men with fertility requirements [^115MBKVd].

---

## Postoperative care and follow-up

Postoperative care typically involves pain management, scrotal support, and activity restriction for a short period. Routine follow-up is **not mandatory** after successful surgical removal, but patients should be advised to return if symptoms recur or new masses develop.

---

## Potential complications

Surgical management of epididymal cysts carries potential complications, including:

- **Hematoma or seroma**: Collection of blood or fluid in the scrotum [^114tHwaJ].
- **Infection**: Wound infection or epididymitis [^1169yg12].
- **Recurrence**: Rare but possible, particularly with incomplete excision [^notfound].
- **Fertility impairment**: Rare, but possible due to epididymal injury or obstruction [^114tHwaJ].

---

## Impact on fertility

Epididymal cysts are generally not associated with impaired fertility, and conservative management is appropriate for asymptomatic patients [^112XdPHs]. Surgical intervention, particularly microsurgical cystectomy, **does not significantly impact sperm parameters** or epididymal function, making it a safe option for young men with fertility requirements [^115MBKVd].

---

## Patient counseling and education

Patient counseling is essential to address concerns, explain the benign nature of epididymal cysts, and discuss management options. Key points include:

- **Benign nature**: Epididymal cysts are non-cancerous and typically asymptomatic [^notfound].
- **Observation**: Conservative management is appropriate for asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cysts [^115gA5yr].
- **Surgical options**: Microsurgical cystectomy is the preferred surgical approach for symptomatic or cosmetically concerning cysts [^notfound].
- **Fertility considerations**: Surgical intervention does not significantly impact fertility [^115MBKVd].

---

Epididymal cysts are benign lesions that are best managed conservatively when asymptomatic. Surgical intervention, particularly microsurgical cystectomy, is indicated for symptomatic or cosmetically concerning cysts, with **minimal impact on fertility** and low recurrence rates.

### Autonomous ovarian cysts in prepubertal girls. how aggressive should we Be? A review of the literature [^116XA4vT]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Precocious pseudopuberty in girls occurs as a result of peripheral estrogen production, most commonly through an autonomous ovarian cyst or in patients with McCune Albright syndrome. Current management is either conservative or surgical. The aim of this study was to identify available literature on presentation, course and treatment of such cases.

Design

We performed a medline literature search using the key words 'ovarian autonomous cyst' and 'pseudopuberty'. We included articles published in English, from 1980 to date relating to females aged 2 to 8 years. We excluded papers on other endocrine conditions resulting in premature puberty.

Outcome Measures

Type of management, time of resolution, recurrence, progression to Central Precocious Puberty and McCune Albright Syndrome.

Results

We identified 9 articles referring to 26 cases of autonomous ovarian cysts. All patients had suppressed LHRH testing and had simple ovarian cysts producing estradiol. Median age of patients was 5 years (range 2.2–8) and size of cyst was 41.5mm (9–60). Ten patients underwent cystectomy or oophorectomy, three were given cyproterone acetate and 13 were managed conservatively. Nine of 13 patients that were managed conservatively and two of those that had a cystectomy had a recurrence. There were three cases that progressed to central precocious puberty (CPP) and one case that was then identified to have McCune Albright (MCA) syndrome. One further case with multiple recurrences was given long term treatment with letrozole.

Conclusion

We conclude that although a conservative approach should always be proposed in the first instance, one should be aware of the risk of recurrence and progression to CPP or MCA. Antiestrogen treatment appears promising; however data comparing it with surgical options and particularly long term consequences with regards to future reproductive outcomes are not available.

### Microsurgical spermatocelectomy: technique and outcomes of a novel surgical approach [^114tHwaJ]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

A microsurgical approach to spermatocelectomy theoretically minimizes the risk of injury to the epididymis and testicular blood supply. We present the technique of microsurgical spermatocelectomy and report our perioperative and recurrence outcomes.

Materials and Methods

In a 15-year period 23 men with a total of 36 epididymal cystic masses underwent microsurgical resection with confirmation of spermatocele diagnosis by intraoperative identification of sperm in the cyst fluid. We reviewed pathology reports for resected epididymal tissue in the spermatocele specimen. Postoperative outcome measures included complications, sperm count changes, improvement in pain and fertility, and cyst recurrence.

Results

Mean spermatocele size was 5.0 cm (range 1 to 15). Common indications for surgery included pain in 35% of cases, infertility in 30% and the 2 conditions in 13%. A total of 13 patients (57%) underwent simultaneous procedures for concomitant varicocele and/or hydrocele with a mean overall surgical time of 152 minutes. A single scrotal hematoma managed conservatively was the only postoperative complication. There was no case of infection. Avoidance of inadvertent epididymal resection was shown by absent epididymal tissue in each of the 36 spermatocele pathology specimens. Also, no patient with preoperative and postoperative semen analyses available experienced a decreased sperm count, confirming the avoidance of iatrogenic epididymal tubule obstruction. At a mean followup of 17.3 months no man had cyst recurrence or testicular atrophy and all with preoperative pain reported improvement. One patient with preoperative infertility achieved pregnancy 12 months after surgery.

Conclusions

Microsurgical spermatocelectomy is safe and effective with a minimal risk of epididymal injury, testicular atrophy and recurrence.

### Microsurgical epididymal cystectomy does not impact upon sperm count, motility or morphology and is a safe and effective treatment for epididymal cystic lesions (ECLs) in young men with fertility requirements [^115MBKVd]. Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the therapeutic efficacy and safety of microsurgical epididymal cystectomy for the treatment of epididymal cystic lesions in young men with fertility requirements and the impact of this surgery upon sperm quality and epididymal function.

Materials and Methods

We prospectively evaluated the therapeutic outcomes, complications, safety and efficacy of microsurgical epididymal cystectomy and the impact of microsurgery upon sperm parameters. All patients were followed-up 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery to investigate sperm count, motility, morphology, neutral α-glucosidase, improvement of symptoms, recurrence, and complications.

Results

Palpated cyst pain was evident in 32 out of 51 patients. Pathologists identified 29 spermatoceles and 22 epididymal cysts. Mean operation time was 39.27 ± 5.98 minutes, and the mean length of postoperative hospital stay was 2.02 ± 0.35 days. After surgery, scrotal pain disappeared in 80.4% of patients (41/51). A significantly higher rate of pain disappearance was observed in patients with palpated pain than those without palpated pain. Insignificant difference was seen in terms of sperm count, motility, sperm morphology or neutral α-glucosidase between preoperation and postoperation at 1-year follow-up. Sperm count and NGA in patients with an epididymal cystic lesions > 2.5 cm were significantly increased after surgery. The rate of complications was 7.3%. No cyst recurrence was observed during follow-up.

Conclusion

Microsurgical epididymal cystectomy does not impact upon sperm count, motility, morphology, or epididymal function and is a safe and effective surgical modality for young men with fertility requirements. Local palpated pain on the epididymal cyst is recommended as an optional surgical indication.

Serous cystadenomas (SCAs) — demographics, malignant potential, imaging hallmark frequency, and follow-up indicate low cancer risk and generally no surveillance when asymptomatic. SCAs occur more commonly in women (75%), who usually present in their 50s, a multicenter study in over 2,500 SCAs found serous cystadenocarcinoma risk to be 0.1%, a central scar is present in less than 30% of SCAs, and most asymptomatic SCAs do not require surveillance.

### Massive luteinized follicular cyst of pregnancy [^111GoDgx]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

A large luteinized follicular cyst can rupture or twist during pregnancy. However, in the absence of those complications a simple ovarian cyst can often be managed conservatively, provided that sonographic evaluation of the cyst is benign. Rapid growth of a simple follicular cyst is rare but may occasionally complicate pregnancy.

Case

A 25-year-old primigravida had a simple-appearing adnexal mass detected by sonogram early in pregnancy. She was followed with serial sonograms. Because of the clear sonolucent appearance of the mass and the patient's preference, a conservative management was elected. The cyst grew in size as her pregnancy progressed, became symptomatic, and necessitated surgical intervention. Cystectomy and cesarean delivery at 36+ weeks relieved the symptoms and achieved delivery of a healthy infant.

Conclusion

Solitary luteinized follicular cysts of pregnancy have the potential to grow to a very large size and create complications related to their size alone. Conservative management of simple adnexal cysts in pregnancy, based on their sonographic appearance, can avoid risks of abdominal surgery in the second trimester of pregnancy, but in the third trimester, a large cyst can create significant complications requiring surgical intervention.

### Congenital cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract: a disorder with various treatment approaches and pitfalls-case report [^116XXyN2]. BMC Urology (2022). Medium credibility.

Suprapubic or transrectal ultrasound is often the initial diagnostic imaging tool. Urethrocystoscopy and voiding cystourethrography are also useful diagnostic tests for these conditions. Nevertheless, the gold standard for the diagnosis of male pelvic floor cysts is MRI. Differential diagnosis between intraprostatic and extraprostatic cysts is performed with clinical and radiological findings, while histopathological characterization of the cystic wall is usually not significant. However, few cases of malignant cyst of Muller duct (adenocarcinomas and squamous cells carcinomas) have been described. Surgical treatment is recommended in symptomatic patients and in case of obstructive azoospermia. There are different treatment modalities including: trans-rectal drainage, transurethral resection of ejaculatory ducts (TUR-ED), robotic, laparoscopic and open surgery. Endoscopic treatment could be reserved to small lesions. This approach is characterized by lower morbidity, but it has the disadvantage of a higher recurrence rate, as reported in our first case.

In our opinion, open surgery is recommended in large masses and in patients who underwent previous surgery where a laparoscopic approach could be more challenging and have a higher complication rate. The following surgical approaches have been described: extravesical, transvesical, trans-rectal, perineal. The urethral fistula and the late purulent pelvic collection described in our case could be related to a local and systemic infection confirmed by the clinical, laboratory and intra-operative findings. The surgical drainage of the purulent collection, antibiotic therapy and prolonged bladder catheterization have permitted a complete clinical resolution. During the last years, robotic and laparoscopic surgery offered advantages such as image magnification, reduced blood loss, minor invasiveness and morbidity and better preservation of anatomical structures. Nowadays, laparoscopic treatment is the gold standard while robot-assisted surgery is limited to few cases and is associated to higher costs.

Surgical treatment is reserved for symptomatic patients. In asymptomatic patients surveillance is an acceptable option. Pre-operative counseling is important in order to inform the patient about the potential complications such as infertility and erectile dysfunction. Patients must be adequately informed about risks and benefits of the surgical approach in order to reach a shared diagnostic and therapeutic decision making. In this context semen cryopreservation is useful and advisable before surgery.

### Management of cystic conditions [^114GicdH]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Cystic conditions are the most common disorder of the breast. Simple cysts are not malignant and do not require intervention. Patients with symptomatic simple cysts can undergo elective aspiration, and typical cyst fluid can be discarded. Bloody fluid should be sent for cytology. Cysts with thick walls, thick septations, or solid components have a risk of malignancy and should undergo biopsy.

### Radiologic management of cysts in the abdomen and pelvis [^112MYneC]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Few abdominal or pelvic cystic lesions come to the attention of the interventional radiologist, and those that do are symptomatic. Differentiation of cysts from cystic-appearing masses is not difficult when a multitechnique imaging approach is used. Our objective is to summarize the principles and specifics for management of symptomatic cysts through percutaneous catheter techniques.

Conclusion

Percutaneous aspiration of cysts can relieve symptoms without the need for surgery. A sound knowledge of the various types of cysts that may be found in the abdomen and pelvis enables the radiologist to select those patients who will benefit the most from percutaneous management.

### Ovarian cystic lesions: a current approach to diagnosis and management [^116WWVfW]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2013). Low credibility.

The primary imaging modality for evaluation of ovarian cystic lesions is pelvic ultrasonography. Most ovarian cysts are benign and demonstrate typical sonographic features that support benignity. However, some ovarian cystic lesions have indeterminate imaging features, and the approach to management varies. This article discusses how to recognize and diagnose different types of ovarian cystic lesions, including an approach to management. The learning objective is to recognize imaging features of ovarian cystic lesions.

### A rare variant of zinner syndrome with ejaculatory duct cyst: case report and challenges in diagnosis and management [^116u5A2f]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient perspective and follow-up

The patient articulated that prior to surgery, his primary objective was the excision of the cyst to address his infertility concerns. He did not anticipate receiving a diagnosis of atypical Zinner syndrome but has since reconciled with it. During subsequent follow-up, he noted the resolution of his preoperative symptoms, which included the sensation of incomplete defecation and mild anal distension, following the surgical intervention. Despite this symptomatic improvement, he acknowledged the potential persistence of infertility and proactively engaged in assisted reproductive techniques. These efforts proved successful, culminating in a pregnancy with his partner, which brought them significant relief and joy.

### Tumors in Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome: from head to toe-comprehensive state-of-the-art review [^113JWuhs]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome (VHL) is an autosomal-dominant hereditary tumor disease that arises owing to germline mutations in the VHL gene, located on the short arm of chromosome 3. Patients with VHL may develop multiple benign and malignant tumors involving various organ systems, including retinal hemangioblastomas (HBs), central nervous system (CNS) HBs, endolymphatic sac tumors, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, pancreatic cystadenomas, pancreatic cysts, clear cell renal cell carcinomas, renal cysts, pheochromocytomas, paragangliomas, and epididymal and broad ligament cystadenomas. The VHL/hypoxia-inducible factor pathway is believed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of VHL-related tumors. The diagnosis of VHL can be made clinically when the characteristic clinical history and findings have manifested, such as the presence of two or more CNS HBs. Genetic testing for heterozygous germline VHL mutation may also be used to confirm the diagnosis of VHL. Imaging plays an important role in the diagnosis and surveillance of patients with VHL. Familiarity with the clinical and imaging manifestations of the various VHL-related tumors is important for early detection and guiding appropriate management. The purpose of this article is to discuss the molecular cytogenetics and clinical manifestations of VHL, review the characteristic multimodality imaging features of the various VHL-related tumors affecting multiple organ systems, and discuss the latest advances in management of VHL, including current recommendations for surveillance and screening. © RSNA, 2018 An earlier incorrect version of this article appeared online.

### Surgical treatment of epithelial cysts of the anterior chamber… [^111BJMov]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

The purpose of this paper is to describe our method of treating epithelial cysts of the anterior chamber by aspiration of the contents followed by diathermy coagulation. Epithelial cysts are due to invasion of a double continuous layer of epithelium into the anterior chamber that forms a closed cyst within the chamber. Such cysts are thin-walled, transparent, or semitransparent and are filled with a straw-colored fluid containing protein and some cholesterol. These cysts are in contact somewhere with the wound of entrance, but usually the continuity between the surface epithelium and the cyst has been broken by the interposition of scar tissue. The term post-traumatic cyst of the iris was suggested by Perera in 19371 to distinguish it from pearl tumor of the iris and diffuse epithelial ingrowth without cyst formation. These cysts may vary in size from a small lesion just visible in the angle to large ones HOGAN MJ, GOODNER EK.

### Cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract: embryologic and anatomic considerations and differential diagnosis [^113KzUSi]. Radiographics (2013). Low credibility.

Cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract are uncommon and usually benign. These cysts have different anatomic origins and may be associated with a variety of genitourinary abnormalities and symptoms. Various complications may be associated with these cysts, such as urinary tract infection, pain, postvoiding incontinence, recurrent epididymitis, prostatitis, and hematospermia, and they may cause infertility. Understanding the embryologic development and normal anatomy of the lower male genitourinary tract can be helpful in evaluating these cysts and in tailoring an approach for developing a differential diagnosis. There are two main groups of cysts of the lower male genitourinary tract: intraprostatic cysts and extraprostatic cysts. Intraprostatic cysts can be further classified into median cysts (prostatic utricle cysts, müllerian duct cysts), paramedian cysts (ejaculatory duct cysts), and lateral cysts (prostatic retention cysts, cystic degeneration of benign prostatic hypertrophy, cysts associated with tumors, prostatic abscess). Extraprostatic cysts include cysts of the seminal vesicle, vas deferens, and Cowper duct. A variety of pathologic conditions can mimic these types of cysts, including ureterocele, defect resulting from transurethral resection of the prostate gland, bladder diverticulum, and hydroureter and ectopic insertion of ureter. Accurate diagnosis depends mainly on the anatomic location of the cyst. Magnetic resonance imaging and transrectal ultrasonography (US) are excellent for detecting and characterizing the nature and exact anatomic origin of these cysts. In addition, transrectal US can play an important therapeutic role in the management of cyst drainage and aspiration, as in cases of prostatic abscess.

### Comparison between open epididymal cystectomy and minimal resection of epididymal cysts using a scrotoscope: a clinical trial for the evaluation of a new surgical technique [^1169yg12]. Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide a new surgical technique for epididymal cyst (EC) treatment and to assess its safety and efficiency.

Methods

Forty-eight patients with symptomatic EC were randomized into 2 groups. One group (n = 23) received traditional open epididymal cystectomy (OEC) and the other group (n = 25) underwent minimal epididymal cystectomy with scrotoscope (MECS), which provided a clear vision of scrotal contents. Demographic information and perioperative and postoperative outcomes data were obtained and analyzed during a 2- to 6-month follow-up.

Results

No significant differences between the OEC and MECS groups were found in demographic information. Compared with OEC group, the MECS group had a shorter operating time (18.6 ± 2.9 vs 54.5 ± 7.0 minutes; P < .05), shorter incision length (1.1 ± 0.2 vs 4.8 ± 0.6 cm; P < .05), and less blood loss (4.6 ± 1.6 vs 17.0 ± 3.1 g; P < .05). Except for the 8.0% rate (2 of 25) of scrotal edema after MECS and 17.4% rate (4 of 23) of scrotal hematoma after OEC, both groups resulted in 0% incidence of testis or epididymis injury, wound infection, and cyst recurrence based on postoperative outcome data. Significant differences were observed after MECS compared with those after OEC based on the rates of symptom relief (95.2% vs 61.1%; P < .05) and days of wound pain (12.1 ± 2.6 vs 17.7 ± 4.1 days; P < .05).

Conclusion

For the first time, our study applied scrotoscope as a new alternative technique for EC treatment. Scrotoscope provides a clear field of vision and makes tissues harvested available for pathologic examination when performing decortications of EC. The results suggest MECS may be a safe, effective, and encouraging new technique.

### Clomiphene citrate [^1145Ubn4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

To minimize the hazard associated with occasional abnormal ovarian enlargement associated with clomiphene citrate therapy, the lowest dose consistent with expected clinical results should be used. Maximal enlargement of the ovary, whether physiologic or abnormal, may not occur until several days after discontinuation of the recommended dose of clomiphene citrate. Some patients with polycystic ovary syndrome who are unusually sensitive to gonadotropin may have an exaggerated response to usual doses of clomiphene citrate. Therefore, patients with polycystic ovary syndrome should be started on the lowest recommended dose and shortest treatment duration for the first course of therapy (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

If enlargement of the ovary occurs, additional clomiphene citrate therapy should not be given until the ovaries have returned to pretreatment size, and the dosage or duration of the next course should be reduced. Ovarian enlargement and cyst formation associated with clomiphene citrate therapy usually regress spontaneously within a few days or weeks after discontinuing treatment. The potential benefit of subsequent clomiphene citrate therapy in these cases should exceed the risk. Unless surgical indication for laparotomy exists, such cystic enlargement should always be managed conservatively.

A causal relationship between ovarian hyperstimulation and ovarian cancer has not been determined. However, because a correlation between ovarian cancer and nulliparity, infertility, and age has been suggested, if ovarian cysts do not regress spontaneously, a thorough evaluation should be performed to rule out the presence of ovarian neoplasia.

### Laparoscopy in the diagnosis and management of a complicated paraovarian cyst [^1118gbvZ]. Surgical Endoscopy (2003). Low credibility.

Paraovarian cysts account for 10% of adnexal masses and are most common in the 3rd and 4th decades of life. They vary from small asymptomatic lesions to larger cysts, which may undergo hemorrhage or torsion. Children are rarely affected, and the diagnosis — particularly if pain presents in the right lower quadrant — may be difficult because the differentials diagnosis is wide. We report the case of a child who presented with a complicated paraovarian cyst. Laparoscopy enabled immediate diagnosis and appropriate management. We discuss the role of laparoscopy and the value of the Harmonic Scalpel in the management of these rare cysts.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^115ukZsx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cyst management — Patients who are not medically fit for surgery should not undergo further evaluation of incidentally found pancreatic cysts, irrespective of cyst size (Strong recommendation, low quality of evidence). Patients with asymptomatic cysts that are diagnosed as pseudocysts on initial imaging and clinical history, or that have a very low risk of malignant transformation (such as serous cystadenomas) do not require treatment or further evaluation (Conditional recommendation, low quality of evidence). EUS-FNA and cyst fluid analysis should be considered in cysts in which the diagnosis is unclear, and where the results are likely to alter management; analysis of cyst fluid CEA may be considered to differentiate IPMNs and MCNs from other cyst types, but cannot be used to identify IPMNs and MCNs with high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Cyst fluid cytology should be sent to assess for the presence of high-grade dysplasia or pancreatic cancer when the imaging features alone are insufficient to warrant surgery (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Molecular markers may help identify IPMNs and MCNs and their use may be considered in cases in which the diagnosis is unclear and the results are likely to change management (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Endoscopic injection of bulking agent around the ejaculatory ducts at the verumontanum for recurrent paediatric epididymitis [^1178fwgR]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Paediatric recurrent epididymitis is frequently observed in several urogenital conditions, and may result in deterioration of long-term fertility. The management of recurrent epididymitis is still a therapeutic challenge for paediatric urologists, and as yet there is no consensus for treatment.

Objective

To present a minimally invasive endoscopic approach for the treatment of recurrent epididymitis (more than three episodes).

Patients and Methods

Eleven boys were referred with a history of recurrent epididymitis in a context of urogenital malformations. All children underwent endoscopic transurethral injection. Dextranomer/hyaluronic acid was injected around the ejaculatory ducts at the verumontanum (Summary Fig.). The medical records and outcomes of the patients were retrospectively reviewed.

Results

Of the 11 boys, two (18%) had a history of bladder exstrophy, three (27%) anorectal malformation, two (18%) peno-scrotal hypospadias, two (18%) posterior urethral valves, one (9%) seminal vesicle cyst, and one (9%) urethral stricture. The median age at injection was 3.75 years (range 8 months-14.7 years). Endoscopic injection effectively prevented recurrence in eight patients (73%) with a mean follow-up of 3 years (range 6 months-8.8 years). The mean injected volume was 0.7 ml/session. No perioperative complications were recorded. Vas clipping was performed in three patients after unsuccessful injections.

Discussion

The current discussion for management of recurrent epididymitis is mainly based on vas clipping. Endoscopic injection in the verumontanum could offer several potential advantages over vas clipping; moreover, it is easy to perform for an urologist who usually uses endourological approaches. It is believed that only Kajbafzadeh et al. have reported their experience with endoscopic injection in the verumontanum in seven patients with structural anomalies, and they had a 42% success rate. Similarly, the current study did not observe perioperative or postoperative complications.

Conclusion

In this series, endoscopic injection of the verumontanum was considered to be a safe and effective treatment in almost 73% of children with recurrent epididymitis. It did not result in perioperative complications and not contraindicate a subsequent surgical procedure such as vas clipping.

### Management of epididymal cysts in childhood [^115gA5yr]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

A retrospective review was carried out to evaluate the clinical presentation of children with epididymal cysts (EC) and outcome of management at our institution.

Methods

There were 49 patients with EC in this series. The diagnosis of EC was made by physical examination and confirmed by ultrasound (US).

Results

The average age at presentation was 10.7 years (2 months-16 years). Scrotal mass (n: 22) and pain (n: 21) were the most frequent symptoms. Seven patients were lost to follow-up. The cysts were solitary in 32 patients and multiple in 10 patients. The mean value of cysts was 6.7 mm (2–20 mm). The cyst localisations were 22 in left, 16 in right, and bilateral in 4 patients. Complete involution of cysts was detected in 14 children. The average involution time was 11.2 months (1–37 months). In 20 cases, a decrease in cyst size was found. Cyst excision was performed in 8 patients with persistent scrotal pain or no cyst involution observed during follow-up.

Conclusion

Conservative management of epididymal cysts is practical. However, surgical excision is recommended in patients with intractable scrotal pain or if the cyst size does not seem to involute.

### Neonatal ovarian torsion [^113ACoAP]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Similarly, Bagolan et al discussed the prenatal treatment of fetal ovarian cysts and reported an effective and safe experience of prenatal cyst aspiration. They highlighted the fact that ovarian torsion, causing the loss of the ovary, occurs more frequently before than after birth. In contrast, Heling et al 's data showed that prenatal aspiration of the cyst seems to be of no advantage and should be carried out only in special individual cases. Another proposed approach towards the management of fetal ovarian cysts was published by Akin and his colleagues to guide decisions on timing and modality of intervention. Simple, small, asymptomatic ovarian cysts (< 4 cm) can be followed with no intervention, while simple large cysts or small symptomatic cysts with torsion require surgery. On the other hand, complex cysts require surgery regardless of other factors. If the cyst was characterised as complex prenatally, they recommended preterm delivery and surgery. Essentially, surgical intervention should be minimally invasive and aim to save the ovary. In conclusion, fetal ovarian cysts are diagnosed more frequently due to improving antenatal care and screening. The progression of cysts can vary significantly. Accordingly, close follow-up is required to decide on management based on symptoms and cyst evolution on imaging.

Learning points

The antenatal finding of fetal intra-abdominal cysts should be followed closely during pregnancy for changes in characteristics or the development of complications that may necessitate preterm delivery or intrauterine intervention.
Early postnatal imaging of prenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts aids in the timely diagnosis and management of potential complications.
Antenatal aspiration of ovarian cysts to reduce the size or investigate the contents remains controversial and requires tailored decisions on a case-by-case basis.
Surgical management of symptomatic or complicated ovarian cysts should be minimally invasive and aim to save the ovary whenever possible.

### Robot-assisted laparoscopic excision of symptomatic retrovesical cysts in boys and young adults [^113dSJ17]. The Journal of Urology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

We review our surgical experience with the management of retrovesical cystic anomalies using robot-assisted laparoscopic techniques.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the presentation, diagnosis and treatment of 6 patients 28 months to 22 years old with retrovesical cystic anomalies who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic excision at our hospital between January 2006 and November 2010.

Results

Presenting signs and symptoms included urinary retention, lower urinary tract symptoms, abdominal pain and repeated epididymitis. Associated anomalies consisted of hypospadias, vesicoureteral reflux, renal agenesis, 5alpha-reductase deficiency, premature adrenarche and cryptorchidism. Cystic anomalies ranged from 3 to 6 cm long. The final diagnoses were prostatic utricular cyst, müllerian duct cyst and seminal vesicle cyst. Ectopic insertion of vas into the cyst was found in 4 cases, requiring ligation of the affected vas in 3. Mean ± SD operative time including cystoscopy was 198 ± 23.8 minutes, and estimated blood loss ranged from 5 to 10 ml. Mean ± SD hospital stay was 1.33 ± 0.52 days. All patients had resumed their regular activities within 2 weeks postoperatively. De novo contralateral epididymitis developed 2 months postoperatively in 1 patient. Otherwise, there was no recurrence of cystic mass or presenting signs or symptoms during followup of 3 to 56 months.

Conclusions

In the management of retrovesical cystic anomalies robot-assisted laparoscopic excision affords a natural extension of conventional laparoscopy with the additional advantages of 3-dimensional vision and ease of instrument control.

### Treatment and outcomes of congenital ovarian cysts A study by the Canadian consortium for research in pediatric surgery (canCORPS) [^113opGQP]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Ovarian cysts are the most common cystic abdominal mass necessitating referral to a pediatric surgeon, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 2625 live births. Most ovarian cysts detected in the prenatal period are asymptomatic and are thought to be the result of maternal hormonal stimulation. Many of these cysts can be observed with serial ultrasounds until they resolve or regress spon-taneously. However, tremendous variability exists in the evaluation and management of these lesions. –

Despite their benign nature, fetal ovarian cysts have been associated with a variety of complications, including torsion and hemorrhage. Early surgical intervention has been proposed as a way to mitigate the risk of ovarian loss due to such complications. However, despite the intention to spare ovarian tissue, most surgical interventions result in oophorectomy.

Although nonsurgical management has succeeded in many patients, no standardized observation period or surveillance protocols have been established for the longitudinal follow-up of infants with fetal ovarian cysts. There are reports of cysts being observed for up to 2 years until complete resolution. Moreover, there is a paucity of literature comparing the long-term outcomes and risks of nonsurgical and surgical management.

We investigated the management strategies and outcomes of congenital ovarian cysts in a national cohort of patients. The primary objectives for this study were to identify the incidence of spontaneous cyst resolution, to identify the clinical and sonographic predictors of intervention for congenital ovarian cysts, and to examine whether early surgical intervention is associated with increased ovarian preservation compared to observation alone.

### Pancreatic cysts-part 2: should we Be less cyst centric? [^111N556Y]. Pancreas (2017). Low credibility.

The management of pancreatic cysts is a common problem faced by physicians and surgeons. Pancreatic cysts are important because some of them are mucin-producing cysts (MPCs), which may harbor or develop pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Thus, accurate classification of pancreatic cysts and diagnosis of MPCs offer a potential for the prevention or early detection of pancreatic cancer. However, the diagnosis and management of asymptomatic pancreatic cysts are complicated by 2 factors. First, incidentally detected pancreatic cysts are often misdiagnosed as branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. Although most are MPCs, there are other types of cysts, such as serous cystadenomas, which are managed differently. Second, only a minority of MPCs will ultimately develop into invasive pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Thus, on the one hand, pancreatic cysts offer a unique opportunity to identify precursors to pancreatic cancer and improve outcomes. On the other hand, misdiagnosis and overzealous testing or unnecessary surgery may lead to high cost and harm to patients. Several guidelines have been developed by various groups for the management of pancreatic cysts. In this article, we review the strengths and weaknesses of the American Gastroenterology Association guidelines, highlight key recommendations requiring further validation, and provide our balanced approach to diagnosing and managing pancreatic cysts.

Case presentation

Case 1

A 20-year-old male presented to the urology unit in May 2012 with hypogastric pain, LUTS, ejaculatory disorders (reduced ejaculate volume and painful ejaculation), hematuria and persistent infections of the lower urinary tract. In his past history the patient underwent, three months after birth, a resection of the descending colon for Hirschsprung disease and right nephrectomy for renal dysplasia with histopathological report of interstitial nephritis. In 2009 he underwent a pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for pelvic pain. The imaging revealed a right seminal vesicle cyst. For the persistence of symptoms, he underwent trans urethral resection of ejaculatory ducts (TUR-ED) without obtaining any improvement of the symptoms. Instead, a subsequent prostatitis and epididymitis appeared. Clinical examination revealed normal external genitalia; at a digital rectal examination (DRE) a swollen periprostatic mass was noticed. Semen analysis and blood tests did not show anomalies. A second MRI showed a liquid bilobated mass near the right seminal vesicle (54 × 38 × 47 mm), increased in volume compared to previous one, with a small hypointense signal, delimitated by a not-enhanced wall, with a fistulous communication with the prostatic urethra (Fig. 1 a). Transrectal ultrasound showed a normal prostate without a clear visualization of the left seminal vesicle. Adjacent to the right seminal vesicle, a large bilobated cystic mass containing dense fluid was confirmed. Urethrocystoscopy and retrograde urethrocystogram showed a communication between the cystic structure and the prostatic urethra. Taking into account the patient's previous surgeries, after semen cryopreservation, we decided to perform an open retropubic exeresis of the cyst because of the persistence of clinical symptoms (Fig. 1 b). Histopathology examination reported a benign cyst coated by a cylindrical epithelium with diffuse squamous metaplasia and modest chronic inflammation of the cystic wall compatible with deferent duct cyst. On 15th post-operative day, due to a pelvic purulent collection a surgical drainage was performed. A subsequent fistula of the prostatic urethra developed and was managed with 6 weeks of bladder catheterization. At the last clinical consult the patient did not report any sexual or ejaculatory disorder.

### A novel surgical management for male infertility secondary to midline prostatic cyst [^1154H15H]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Vasoseminal vesiculography is the golden standard for diagnosis. Percutaneous testicular sperm aspiration (PTSA) is helpful to identify the type of MPC. However, these methods are invasive and complicated. TURS is preferred for simple and noninvasive characteristics. It can offer greater details about the relationship of prostatic, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct. Pelvic MRI not only clearly shows the anatomy of prostatic, seminal vesicle, and ejaculatory duct, but also helps to judge the nature of cyst fluid.

The treatment for MPC is still controversial. Some researchers claimed that treatment should only be performed on symptomatic or infertile patients since almost 60% of cases with MPC did not experience any cyst-related symptoms or fertility impairment. Invasive procedures include transperineal or transrectal puncture and endoscopic section of the utricle meatu. However, puncture therapy has a high recurrence rate while endoscopic incision faces persistent post-operative severe oligozoospermia or azoospermia. We speculate that MPC may cause to seminal vesiculitis and further promote the abnormal semen quality through oppressing ejaculatory duct and causing semen stasis. Therefore, the dilation of ejaculatory duct and the irrigation of seminal vesicle using seminal vesiculoscope were performed after transurethral unroofing of the cyst in present study. A previous study achieved a better result for MPC with male infertility using transurethral endoscopic incision, in which a pregnancy rate was 30.8% (8/26). However, other reports showed a poor efficacy of unroofing of the cyst. The present study is delightful with a pregnancy rate of 41.7% (5/12) and an obviously improved semen quality of 75% (9/12). One patient with azoospermia had spermatozoa in the urine after ejaculation. For the two patients of poor efficacy, seminal vesicle impairment due to long term semen stasis might cause inadequate transfer of semen quality. In conclusion, our data showed that the novel surgical management is effective, minimally invasive, and safe for male infertility secondary to MPC.

### A rare variant of zinner syndrome with ejaculatory duct cyst: case report and challenges in diagnosis and management [^111V2V1W]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Zinner syndrome (ZS), initially characterized by Zinner in 1914, is a congenital anomaly involving a triad of mesonephric (Wolffian) duct dysplasia. This syndrome is defined by the presence of unilateral renal hypoplasia or dysplasia, ipsilateral seminal vesicle cysts, and ejaculatory duct obstruction. During embryonic development, specifically between the 5th and 13th weeks, any factor that induces dysplasia of the distal middle renal canal can result in the absence of the associated ureter, renal dysplasia, and atresia of the ejaculatory canal. In this instance, the bilateral vasa deferentia were implicated alongside congenital unilateral absence of the kidney and ureter. The cyst identified was an ejaculatory duct cyst rather than a seminal vesicle cyst. Both seminal vesicle glands exhibited atrophy or erosion. This diagnosis was corroborated by intraoperative examination and postoperative pathological analysis.

### Enteric duplication cysts in children: varied presentations, varied imaging findings [^112Ajh7u]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Management

The main considerations in the management of EDCs are: the condition of the patient, the location of the cyst, whether it involves one or more anatomic locations, whether its structure is cystic or tubular, and if it is communicated with the true intestinal lumen.

With the widespread availability of antenatal diagnosis, EDCs are often diagnosed prenatally. The optimal time to perform the resection in children with antenatal diagnosis is not defined. These patients should undergo early investigation, followed by early resection even within the first 6 months of life.

Treatment of asymptomatic EDCs remains controversial. The clinical behaviour of EDCs is unpredictable. EDCs tend to increase in size gradually and can cause symptoms and important complications that might be fatal, such as obstruction, massive bleeding or even a potential risk for malignant transformation in the adulthood.

Early excision is associated with less morbidity and a shorter length of stay compared to excision in symptomatic patients. There are significant post-operative morbidities after resection of complicated EDCs, compared with its elective surgery. Cyst excision alone could be considered, but if there is a communication, sometimes a resection of the adjacent bowel is necessary. It is important to ensure that the cyst is entirely resected because recurrence or malignant changes may occur.

Currently, minimally invasive surgery is becoming the elective approach, and most of the cysts can be resected successfully, either thoracoscopically or laparoscopically, as long as an exhaustive imaging diagnosis is available.

### A rare variant of zinner syndrome with ejaculatory duct cyst: case report and challenges in diagnosis and management [^112tBiKJ]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Zinner syndrome (ZS) is a congenital malformation characterized by a triad of mesonephric (Wolffian) duct dysplasia, first identified by Zinner in 1914. The classical presentation of ZS includes unilateral renal hypoplasia or dysplasia, ipsilateral seminal vesicle cysts, and obstruction of the ejaculatory duct. This case presents a rare variant of the syndrome, where an ejaculatory duct cyst is observed instead of the typical ipsilateral seminal vesicle cyst. The ejaculatory duct cyst affected the vas deferens bilaterally, leading to bilateral atrophy or erosion of the seminal vesicle glands, and resulted in the absence of seminal fluid, ultimately causing azoospermia and infertility.

Case presentation

Prior to surgery, the patient experienced a sensation of incomplete defecation, accompanied by mild anal distension. Two semen analyses revealed azoospermia, and magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance urography indicated the absence of the left renal component and suggested the presence of a seminal vesicle cyst. It was hypothesized that the azoospermia resulted from compression of the contralateral ejaculatory duct by the seminal vesicle cyst on the affected side. Consequently, a decision was made to proceed with laparoscopic resection. During the surgical procedure, no seminal vesicle cyst was identified; however, an ejaculatory duct cyst was discovered, wherein the bilateral vasa deferentia converged without any alternative outlet. The cyst was subsequently resected. Postoperatively, the patient's clinical symptoms resolved, although the issue of infertility remained unaddressed.

Conclusion

This case describes a rare Zinner syndrome variant where an ejaculatory duct cyst replaces the seminal vesicle cyst, leading to seminal vesicle atrophy, azoospermia, and infertility. An unreported variant was discovered during surgery, underscoring the importance of preoperative imaging. Laparoscopic removal alleviated symptoms but not infertility, indicating that assisted reproduction might be necessary for ZS-related azoospermia. This case expands knowledge of ZS variants and their impact on fertility.

### Ultrasound findings of masses of the paratesticular space [^116qy143]. Clinical Radiology (2008). Low credibility.

Ultrasound is a routine investigation for the assessment of scrotal masses. Many of the detected lesions involve the paratesticular structures. The most common paratesticular masses in clinical practice are epididymal cysts and spermatoceles, but there are a large number of other pathologies that can be encountered and may result in diagnostic uncertainty. This review covers a wide range of the common and the rare, but important, causes of paratesticular masses. The ultrasound findings (both typical and atypical) of these lesions are clarified, and emphasis is given to the features that help to differentiate between them.

### Procedure description… [^113BZEL5]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

There are many surgical approaches to epidermoid cysts. While complete surgical excision can ensure removal of the sac and prevent recurrence, this technique is time-consuming and requires suture closure. The minimal excision technique has been proposed as a less invasive and successful intervention. The minimal excision technique involves a 2- to 3-mm incision, expression of the cyst contents, and extraction of the cyst wall through the incision. Procedure Description 1. The skin overlying the site is cleansed with povidone-iodine solution. The skin overlying the cyst and the tissue to the sides and beneath the cyst are anesthetized with 2 percent lidocaine with epinephrine.
2. A fenestrated drape can be placed on the patient, with the lesion beneath the fenestration. A no. 11 blade is used to create a stab incision into the center of the cyst.

A small-tipped hemostat is placed into the cyst, the tips gently opened and compression applied to allow the cyst con tents to pass through the opening.
3. The hemostat can be removed, and both thumbs are used to express the cyst contents. Gauze or a splatter shield can be used to shield the physician from splatter. The hemostat can be reinserted, if needed, to assist with passage of the sebaceous material.
4. Following vigorous and complete expression, the hemostat is reintroduced into the cyst cavity, and the capsule at the base of the wound is grasped and elevated. An attempt should be made to gently remove the entire sac through the small opening. The sac may break, and several pieces may need to be removed.
5. At the end of the procedure, the wound should be inspected to ensure that all of the cyst wall has been removed. The cyst wall can be pieced together to provide additional confirmation of complete removal.
6.

Direct pressure is applied to the site with gauze. Antibiotic ointment is applied and gauze is taped over the site. The patient is encouraged to hold direct pressure to the site for one to two hours following the procedure. Most small incisions do not require suture closure.

### Rate and associations of epididymal cysts on pediatric scrotal ultrasound [^114TGHyV]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

We established the baseline occurrence of epididymal cysts, and the correlation between epididymal cysts and testicular size.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all pediatric scrotal ultrasounds done at our institution in 8 years. We analyzed the proportion of cysts by patient age and compared testicular size in boys with vs without epididymal cysts.

Results

Of all patients 14.4% had epididymal cysts. The cyst incidence increased with age, ie 35.3% of boys older than 15 years had cysts. Boys with epididymal cysts had larger testes than boys without cysts regardless of side or age (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Epididymal cysts are more common in older boys. Boys with epididymal cysts had larger testes than boys without cysts.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^112TTaUq]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Pancreatic cysts are very common with the majority incidentally identified. There are several types of pancreatic cysts; some types can contain cancer or have malignant potential, whereas others are benign. However, even the types of cysts with malignant potential rarely progress to cancer. At the present time, the only viable treatment for pancreatic cysts is surgical excision, which is associated with a high morbidity and occasional mortality. The small risk of malignant transformation, the high risks of surgical treatment, and the lack of high-quality prospective studies have led to contradictory recommendations for their immediate management and for their surveillance. This guideline will provide a practical approach to pancreatic cyst management and recommendations for cyst surveillance for the general gastroenterologist.

Epididymis

The scrotal US plays a key role in investigating abnormalities of epididymal size, echopattern, and vascularization, which, alone or combined, can suggest different diagnoses. In subjects with scrotal pain or prostatitis-like symptoms, epididymal dilation with hypervascularization suggests inflammation. A dilated epididymis associated with echopattern abnormalities may also represent the outcome of a past infection/inflammation in currently asymptomatic patients. In subjects with obstructive azoo-/oligo-spermia, epididymal enlargement with tubular ectasia may suggest, as an indirect sign, post-testicular obstruction, at the epididymal (Fig. 3), vas deferens or prostatic level, and the latter may be further investigated by extending US to the prostate-vesicular region. Current or previous epididymal inflammation or partial obstruction has been associated with sperm abnormalities. Of note, only a proven bilateral epididymis obstruction can diagnose proximal OA. However, US can only suggest, but not prove, the presence of a complete epididymal obstruction. The scrotal US also allows the assessment of epididymal nodules, frequently represented by cysts, which have no proven role in OA. Rarely, underlying benign or malignant tumors may be identified.

Recommendation 14: In infertile men, epididymis investigation with scrotal US is indicated, to detect indirect signs suggesting obstruction and/or inflammation, possibly exerting a negative impact on sperm parameters. Cysts or nodules should be investigated: they have no proven role in infertility but may be relevant for general male health.

### A novel surgical management for male infertility secondary to midline prostatic cyst [^115SYy2d]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

MPC is previously thought to be Mullerian duct cyst, causing EDO and male infertility through oppressing ejaculatory duct. Recent researches reveal that not all cystic lesions are located in the midline prostate originate from Mullerian duct remnant. Some cases are just the cystadenoma or the simple cyst of prostate. Such cyst in the midline prostate should be termed as prostatic utricular cyst or cystic dilation of prostatic utricle, depending on whether an outlet to the urethra exists.

Despite the embryologic or histological origin, MPC is a surgically correctable disease. Many MPCs are asymptomatic, or have some non-specific symptoms such as perineal pain, hematospermia, and painful ejaculation. One of the most important and serious outcomes caused by cystic lesion oppression is EDO and male infertility. Semen analysis of these patients often showed low semen volume and pH level, reduced semen fructose, oligoasthenozoospermia, and even azoospermia.

Ultrasound imaging of the paediatric scrotum

David Hatch, Susie Goodwin

Great Ormond Street Hospital, London (United Kingdom)

Purpose-Objective. To review the anatomy, imaging technique and pathology of disorders of the scrotum in children using ultrasound images and case examples.

Material and methods. Cases of testicular ultrasound studies in our institution database from the past two years were reviewed, and are presented as clinical case studies with the appropriate accompanying imaging.

Results. We classified the range of scrotal pathology encountered into two categories. The "painful scrotum" includes examples such as epididymitis, torsion, haematocele, trauma and inguinal hernia. The "scrotal mass" can be further subdivided into testicular and extra-testicular masses; with examples such as yolk sac tumour, teratoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, epididymal cysts and hydroceles, respectively. Clinical history, patient presentation and a description of the sonographic appearances are included with the supporting literature.

Discussion and conclusions. Ultrasound imaging is valuable in the assessment of paediatric scrotal abnormalities as it offers the most suitable direct extension of clinical examination. Knowledge and understanding of the relevant anatomy and imaging features of scrotal pathology is essential for patient management.

### Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^114595aH]. Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

As pancreatic cyst incidence rises, likely due to the ubiquitous increase in cross-sectional imaging, their management presents multiple challenges for both the practitioner and patient. It is critical that all pancreatic cysts are appropriately characterized, as treatment decisions depend on an accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic modalities such as cytology, biopsy, and cyst fluid biomarkers allow for definitive diagnosis of virtually all lesions. Some cysts, such as intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, mucinous cystic neoplasms, and cystic pancreatic endocrine neoplasms, have malignant potential and must be surveyed. Other cysts, such as serous cystadenomas and pancreatic fluid collections, do not have malignant potential. Surveillance strategies vary widely depending on cyst type and size and while multiple medical societies advocate surveillance, their published surveillance guidelines are heterogenous. Cysts with high-risk stigmata or worrisome features are usually resected, depending on the patient's surgical fitness. In patients unfit for resection, newer endoscopic ablative techniques are advocated. Controversial aspects regarding cyst management include whether surveillance can be stopped, how surveillance should be performed, and the extensive financial burden cyst management places on the health care system. Further study into the natural history of cystic lesions, including definitive determination of the rate of malignant transformation for each cyst type, is essential.

### A novel surgical management for male infertility secondary to midline prostatic cyst [^116v8uTW]. BMC Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Male infertility affects about 8% of couples around the world. Midline prostatic cyst (MPC), a rare but surgically correctable disease, is deemed to cause ejaculatory duct obstruction (EDO) which accounts for approximately 1–5% of male infertility. Most MPCs are nonsymptomatic. Semen analysis, transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help to diagnose MPC. For treatment, cyst puncture and simple endoscopic section are widely used. However, the efficacy is often poor. The present study shows a novel surgical management for male infertility secondary to MPC.

### Management of the adnexal mass [^114i2UZw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Adnexal masses are commonly encountered in gynecologic practice and often present both diagnostic and management challenges. This is partly because of the fact that the majority of adnexal masses that are identified represent benign entities that do not necessarily require active intervention, yet a small subset will represent malignant processes that require both timely and appropriate surgical intervention for optimal outcome. To determine the best diagnostic and management strategies in this setting, physicians must effectively triage risk for malignancy by having a thorough understanding of the entities on the differential diagnosis and carefully considering the clinical context for each individual patient. Optimal selection and interpretation of diagnostic tests are enhanced by both an accurate clinical risk assessment and an understanding of the inherent accuracy of diagnostic tests considered in this setting. The purpose of this document is to provide clinicians with a practical strategy for distinguishing benign and malignant masses in the nonpregnant woman. Our approach addresses the critical elements of accurate risk stratification, reviews the performance of diagnostic tests for identifying malignancy, and offers evidence-based management algorithms to optimize outcomes for women with adnexal masses.

### Giant paratubal cyst in adolescence: case report, modified minimal access surgical technique, and literature review [^1167b2qh]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Giant paratubal cysts are rare lesions that can present management challenges due to their enormous size. We present a modified minimally invasive approach for effective surgical management of giant paratubal cysts.

Case

A 19-year-old adolescent with worsening abdominal distention and metrorrhagia was diagnosed with a giant paratubal cyst. A modified, minimally invasive technique designed to limit spillage of cyst fluid was successfully used for surgical management.

Summary and Conclusion

We evacuated 5500 mL of cyst fluid without spillage, and near-complete excision of cyst was performed with preservation of adnexa. Preservation of the adnexa in female adolescents is critical, and minimally invasive approaches should be used where possible.

### The use of hormonal contraceptives in fertility treatments: a committee opinion [^116L6rHL]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). High credibility.

Ovarian cysts in women using hormonal contraception — prevalence and management are characterized by a lower prevalence versus no contraception or a non–hormone-releasing IUD (RR, 0.22; 95% CI, 0.13–0.39), with incidence 9.5% (14/147) vs. 2.4% (5/211) after at least 3 months of use; trials show no benefit over expectant management and most cysts resolve within 4–6 weeks. On the basis of this available information, hormonal contraception should not be started to hasten the resolution of ovarian cysts, though it can be protective against new cyst development.

### Retrospective review of management of antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts at the hospital for sick children [^111qhV1h]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Postnatal management of antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts is not well-defined. The clinical course, management, and outcomes of patients with antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts were reviewed.

Methods

Infants < 1 year of age with antenatally diagnosed ovarian cyst managed at The Hospital for Sick Children between January 2017 and December 2021 were included. Patient charts were reviewed for postnatal ultrasound (US) images, management, clinical course and complications. Mixed linear regression analysis was used to model the change in cyst size over time.

Results

In total, 52 patients were included and 10 patients had no cyst identified at their first postnatal US. Of the remaining cases, 36% were simple/physiologic and 64% had complex features. Two underwent percutaneous aspiration while 40 patients were managed expectantly with most cysts (62%) resolving. The rate of resolution was significantly higher and faster for simple compared to complex cysts (84% versus 52%, p < 0.05). Cysts that persisted at the end of the study period (n = 14) had all decreased in size, with a rate of resolution similar to resolved cysts. Only one patient managed expectantly required urgent laparoscopy for salpingoophorectomy.

Conclusion

Antenatally diagnosed ovarian cysts exhibit high rates of resolution with expectant management, supporting the safety and efficacy for expectant management for these patients.

### Unusual scrotal pathology: an overview [^113vaFXH]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2009). Medium credibility.

The diverse embryological origins of the contents of the scrotum create an environment that fosters a wide variety of unusual pathologies. Most scrotal pathologies are discovered by the patient and are initially evaluated by a thorough physical examination and scrotal ultrasonography. Scrotal lesions can be broadly grouped by the anatomical location in which they develop; the clinician must consider a wide differential diagnosis based on this location. Solid testicular masses are considered germ cell tumors until proven otherwise, but numerous other possible pathologies exist, including ectopic tissue, metastasis, and other neoplastic growths. Rete testis lesions are classified as developmental, benign or malignant. Cystic lesions of the epididymis are most commonly benign, but malignant neoplasms can also be present. The paratesticular region has the broadest differential diagnosis, as it contains numerous distinct structures and is a common location for ectopic tissue and metastatic disease; a narrower range of lesions develop in the scrotal wall because of its simpler anatomy. Treatment options range from conservative observation to wide surgical excision and should be considered carefully; the aim of therapy is to remove malignant or potentially malignant tissue while minimizing effects on fertility and function.

### Follitropin alfa (Gonal-F) [^115YCwYC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

If serious OHSS occurs, stop gonadotropins, including GONAL-f and hCG, and consider whether the woman needs to be hospitalized. Treatment is primarily symptomatic and overall consists of bed rest, fluid and electrolyte management, and analgesics (if needed). Because the use of diuretics can accentuate the diminished intravascular volume, avoid diuretics except in the late phase of resolution as described below. The management of OHSS is divided into three phases as follows:

Acute Phase:

Management is directed at preventing hemoconcentration due to loss of intravascular volume to the third space and minimizing the risk of thromboembolic phenomena and kidney damage. Thoroughly assess daily or more often, based on the clinical need, fluid intake and output, weight, hematocrit, serum and urinary electrolytes, urine specific gravity, BUN and creatinine, total proteins with albumin: globulin ratio, coagulation studies, electrocardiogram to monitor for hyperkalemia, and abdominal girth. Treatment, consisting of limited intravenous fluids, electrolytes, human serum albumin, is intended to normalize electrolytes while maintaining an acceptable but somewhat reduced intravascular volume. Full correction of the intravascular volume deficit may lead to an unacceptable increase in the amount of third space fluid accumulation.
Chronic Phase:

After the acute phase is successfully managed as above, excessive fluid accumulation in the third space should be limited by instituting severe potassium, sodium, and fluid restriction.
Resolution Phase:

As third space fluid returns to the intravascular compartment, a fall in hematocrit and increasing urinary output are observed in the absence of any increase in intake. Peripheral and/or pulmonary edema may result if the kidneys are unable to excrete third space fluid as rapidly as it is mobilized. Diuretics may be indicated during the resolution phase, if necessary, to combat pulmonary edema.

Do not remove ascitic, pleural, and pericardial fluid, unless there is the necessity to relieve symptoms such as pulmonary distress or cardiac tamponade.

OHSS increases the risk of injury to the ovary. Avoid pelvic examination or intercourse, as these may cause rupture of an ovarian cyst, which may result in hemoperitoneum.

If bleeding occurs and requires surgical intervention, control the bleeding and retain as much ovarian tissue as possible. A physician experienced in the management of this syndrome, or who is experienced in the management of fluid and electrolyte imbalances should be consulted.

### Laparoscopic management of ovarian cysts [^112Ks99V]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The role of operative laparoscopy in the management of patients with adnexal masses is expanding, offering distinct advantages of lower morbidity, improved postoperative recovery, and reduced cost. Although clinical examination and the results of preoperative work-up often indicate the benign or malignant nature of the cyst, only histology can provide the absolute diagnosis. Advanced operative laparoscopy for management of ovarian cysts, when performed by experienced endoscopic surgeons, is as safe and effective as open techniques.

Diagnostic Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised.

Bilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound should be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

### Relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility: what surgery and when? [^117E4zpo]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

The relationship between ovarian cysts and infertility is a subject of debate, mainly because it is difficult to determine the real impact of the cyst and its treatment on later fertility. For a long time it was hoped that surgical treatment could prevent potential complications (such as rupture or malignancy). For presumed benign ovarian tumors, fertility sparing should be the main concern. The goal of this survey of current knowledge on the subject is to thoroughly explore the potential relationship between cysts, their treatment, and infertility. Our study is based on a review of the literature dealing with the epidemiology of ovarian cysts and the effects of their surgical management in relation to infertility. Analysis of the epidemiologic data, drawn mainly from comparative studies and cohorts, shows that the role of cysts in infertility is controversial and that the effects of surgical treatment are often more harmful than the cyst itself to the ovarian reserve. Surgery does not seem to improve pregnancy rates. When a surgical option is nonetheless chosen, a conservative laparoscopic approach is more suitable. Besides excision, sclerotherapy and plasma vaporization are promising, offering a greater preservation of the ovarian parenchyma, especially in endometriomas. These techniques must be better defined. The context of the infertility is essential, and surgeons and specialists in reproductive medicine should decide management jointly.

### Management of simple intratesticular cysts: a single-institution 11-year experience [^111MBquX]. Urology (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate the clinicoradiologic findings and outcomes of management of simple intratesticular cysts, by review of an 11-year experience.

Methods

From March 1994 to September 2005, 24 men underwent scrotal ultrasound scan and follow-up for simple intratesticular cysts. The median follow-up was 32 months (range, 6 to 124 months). The records were analyzed retrospectively for presentation, radiologic findings, and outcomes of management.

Results

All 24 patients with simple intratesticular cysts were managed successfully with radiologic surveillance. No patient underwent orchidectomy or required enucleation of the cyst.

Conclusions

Simple intratesticular cysts can be managed conservatively with regular ultrasound surveillance by an experienced uroradiologist, without the need for surgical intervention.

### Ovarian cysts and tumors in adolescents [^113qq36q]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2024). Medium credibility.

This article aims to provide a multidisciplinary approach to ovarian/adnexal lesions in young patients. Functional cysts, torsions, benign tumors, and malignancies occur within the ovaries of children and adolescents at varying frequencies. Careful conservative management, based on the ultrasonographic sign of presence of normal ovarian tissue, in most circumstances can lead to appropriate ovarian-preserving treatments. The symptomatic ovarian cyst is often due to complications such as hemorrhage and ovarian torsion. Ovarian torsion represents surgical emergency, and a high index of clinical suspicion, based on ovarian volume and edema of the tissue, must be maintained to avoid inadvertent delay in therapy.

### Epididymal cysts in children: natural history [^115KWxo8]. The Journal of Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

We reviewed the outcome of conservative management of epididymal cyst in children at our institution.

Materials and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients with epididymal cyst from 1991 to 2002. Age and mode of presentation as well as time to complete involution of the cysts were studied. Diagnosis of epididymal cyst was confirmed by scrotal ultrasound in all cases.

Results

A total of 20 patients were identified with epididymal cyst. Average patient age at presentation was 10.5 years. Fifteen patients presented with scrotal mass and 4 with scrotal pain. Cysts were between 3 and 30 mm. Only 1 patient required surgical excision due to persistent pain. Epididymal cysts resolved in 10 patients who completed followup. Average time to complete regression was 17 months. None of our patients had a history of exposure to diethylstilbestrol, cryptorchidism, cystic fibrosis or von Hippel-Lindau disease.

Conclusions

Our findings imply that most epididymal cysts involute with time.

### Treatment and outcomes of congenital ovarian cysts A study by the Canadian consortium for research in pediatric surgery (canCORPS) [^116WdDgr]. Annals of Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The vast majority of congenital ovarian cysts, including most simple cysts and nearly half of complex cysts, resolve spontaneously during infancy. Many patients who undergo interventional management are still treated with oophorectomies. There is no evidence that surgical management increases the chances of saving the ovary. Observation is a safe option that may lead to the avoidance of many unnecessary surgical procedures in young infants.

### Epididymal cyst lesions are not associated with impaired semen parameters among men presenting for fertility evaluation [^112XdPHs]. The Journal of Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Epididymal cyst lesions (ECLs) include both spermatoceles and epididymal cysts and are often incidentally found on physical exam or scrotal US (SUS). We aimed to determine the association of ECLs and semen parameters among men presenting for fertility evaluation.

Materials and Methods

We reviewed men at our institution who had at least 1 semen analysis and SUS available for review between 2002 and 2022. SUS data included testicular measurements, presence or absence of subclinical varicocele, and size and laterality of ECL, if present. Demographic and clinical information including serum testosterone and follicle-stimulating hormone and semen parameters were compared between men with and without ECLs.

Results

Among 861 men, 164 (19%) had unilateral right ECL (median 4 mm, interquartile range 3–8 mm), 189 (22%) had unilateral left ECL (median 4 mm, interquartile range 3–9 mm), and 113 (13%) had bilateral ECL. Patients with ECLs were significantly older than men without ECLs at the time of evaluation but had no statistically significant difference in semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility, sperm morphology, total motile sperm count, or serum hormonal values. Analysis of men with unilateral and bilateral ECLs showed that ECL size and laterality did not significantly correlate with any semen parameter evaluated.

Conclusions

We found no association between ECLs and semen parameters. Patients should be counseled toward conservative management with observation for asymptomatic ECLs in the setting of fertility evaluation.

### Impact of cystectomy on ovarian reserve: review of the literature [^113HAzUD]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2017). Low credibility.

Ovarian cysts are common in the reproductive age. Pathologic cysts such as endometriomas and dermoids often require surgical intervention if symptomatic. Laparoscopic cystectomy is the first-line treatment for these cysts and is associated with better pain control and less recurrence than drainage or cyst ablation procedures. There has been an emerging concern about the effect of ovarian cystectomy on ovarian reserve with some evidence of short-term and long-term reduction in ovarian reserve. Certain cyst characteristics (endometrioma pathology, large cyst size, bilateral presentation) are associated with a greater decline in ovarian reserve after cystectomy. The impact of surgery on ovarian reserve can be minimized by selecting the appropriate surgery for the patient, careful tissue handling, and limited use of electrosurgery. Patients should be counseled on the risks of surgery on reproductive potential, and the management plan should be individualized to the patient's symptoms and reproductive goals.

### The clinical management of intrascrotal extratesticular masses with evaluation of histopathologic findings [^115Bufiq]. Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To contribute to the literature by sharing the clinical presentation, surgical approach, postoperative complications management, and follow-up protocols of the patients we operated on due to intrascrotal extratesticular mass.

Methods

Thirty-two patients admitted due to intrascrotal extratesticular mass were included in the study. Demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients such as age, initial clinical presentation, physical examination, radiological imaging findings, such as scrotal Doppler ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging, mass size, and characteristics, surgical treatment procedures, operation notes, and patient follow-up visits were retrospectively examined and evaluated from the patient files.

Results

The median age of the 32 individuals included in the study was 52 (interquartile range: [45.0–60.5]) years. The primary reason for initial presentation was a palpable mass in 25 (78.1%) patients, pain in 13 (40.6%) patients, and scrotal swelling in 8 (25%) patients. The median mass diameter was 4.4 (interquartile range: [3.1–5.7]) cm. Surgical treatment involved inguinal excision in 29 cases (90.6%) and inguinoscrotal excision in 3 cases (9.4%). All patients were treated with testicle-sparing surgery. The most common tumor location, observed in 27 cases (84.3%), was the epididymis. The most frequent histopathological diagnosis was epididymal cyst, identified in 13 patients (40.6%). Pathology results showed that the mass was removed with negative margins in all patients.

Conclusion

Testicular-sparing surgery through the inguinal approach is one of the surgical methods that can be preferred for intrascrotal extratesticular masses. This approach can both preserve the testicle and achieve successful surgical results. Studies with larger samples are needed on this subject.

Trial Registration

This study was approved by the Erzurum Medicine Faculty University Local Ethics Committee (approval number: BAEK 2023/08–105).

### Does surgery have a role in management of chronic intrascrotal pain? [^1119ctrp]. Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess the role of epididymectomy in the treatment of chronic postvasectomy and epididymal pain syndrome and to identify the factors that predict the outcome.

Methods

A total of 38 patients, aged 20 to 70 years (mean 45), who had undergone epididymectomy for intractable intrascrotal pain, were identified retrospectively from the pathology records. The clinical notes were reviewed, and details on patient demographics, previous vasectomy, investigations, and histologic features were collected and analyzed. The outcome was assessed by routine outpatient clinic review and telephone interview.

Results

Overall, 32% of patients reported resolution of symptoms after epididymectomy; 17 patients had undergone previous vasectomy, and this group was significantly more likely to have ongoing pain. Abnormal examination and ultrasound findings preoperatively did not correlate with a better outcome from surgery.

Conclusions

The results of our study have shown that epididymectomy has a limited role in the management of chronic intrascrotal pain.

### ACG clinical guideline: diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts [^113XjRui]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2018). Medium credibility.

Pancreatic cyst diagnosis — We recommend caution when attributing symptoms to a pancreatic cyst; the majority of pancreatic cysts are asymptomatic and the nonspecific nature of symptoms requires clinical assessment (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) are the tests of choice; pancreatic protocol computed tomography (CT) or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) are excellent alternatives in patients who are unable to undergo MRI, and indeterminate cysts may benefit from a second imaging modality or cyst fluid analysis via EUS (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence). Use caution when using imaging to diagnose cyst type or concomitant malignancy; the accuracy of MRI or MRCP in diagnosing cyst type is 40–50% and in determining benign vs. malignant is 55–76%, and the accuracy for CT and EUS without FNA is similar (Conditional recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### First International Consensus Report on adnexal masses: management recommendations [^1134QZKG]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

The First International Consensus Conference on Adnexal Masses was convened to thoroughly examine the state of the science and to formulate recommendations for clinical assessment and management. The panel included representatives of societies in the fields of gynecology, gynecologic oncology, radiology, and pathology and clinicians from Europe, Canada, and the United States. In the United States, there are approximately 9.1 surgeries per malignancy compared to the European International Ovarian Tumor Analysis center trials, with only 2.3 (oncology centers) and 5.9 (other centers) reported surgeries per malignancy, suggesting that there is room to improve our preoperative assessments. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists Practice Bulletin on "Management of Adnexal Masses", reaffirmed in 2015 (Obstet Gynecol 2007; 110:201–214), still states, "With the exception of simple cysts on a transvaginal ultrasound finding, most pelvic masses in postmenopausal women will require surgical intervention". The panel concluded that patients would benefit not only from a more conservative approach to many benign adnexal masses but also from optimization of physician referral patterns to a gynecologic oncologist in cases of suspected ovarian malignancies. A number of next-step options were offered to aid in management of cases with sonographically indeterminate adnexal masses. This process would provide an opportunity to improve risk stratification for indeterminate masses via the provision of alternatives, including but not limited to evidence-based risk-assessment algorithms and referral to an "expert sonologist" or to a gynecologic oncologist. The panel believed that these efforts to improve clinical management and preoperative triage patterns would ultimately improve patient care.

### Management of complex renal cysts in Canada: results of a survey study [^117Hfxb7]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Up to one third of individuals over 60 years of age will be diagnosed with a renal cyst following abdominal imaging. Renal cysts are classified according to the Bosniak classification, which categorizes the cysts according to their degree of complexity and risk of malignancy. Cystic renal cell carcinoma represents approximately 5–10% of all renal malignancies. Bosniak III and IV cysts have a high risk of malignancy (40–60% and 80–90%, respectively) and have traditionally been managed with surgical excision. However, similar to small non-cystic renal masses, there is growing evidence suggesting that most of these cysts are indolent and unlikely to metastasize. Thus, active surveillance has been proposed as an alternative to surgery.

Recent observational data has provided support for the use of active surveillance among patients with complex renal cysts. However, the adoption of this treatment strategy for the management of complex cysts in Canada and the criteria used by urologists as triggers for discontinuation of surveillance and intervention have yet to be defined.

The objectives of this survey study were to characterize the use of active surveillance in the management of complex renal cysts in Canada and to elicit the perceived barriers to adoption. We also aimed to characterize patient and disease factors associated with use of active surveillance and triggers used as criteria for intervention.

### Complex cystic liver lesions: classification, diagnosis, and management [^115YHYbV]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Surgical interventions can be open or laparoscopic, conservative or radical. Conservative techniques include drainage, and unroofing, with or without omentoplasty. In fenestration, the cyst is opened and its content is aspirated following injection of hypertonic saline.

Radical procedures include total pericystectomy and minor or major hepatectomy. A benzimidazole agent is always administered prior to any type of surgery to sterilize the cyst and reduce the risk of anaphylactic reaction. PAIR involves puncture, aspiration of the cyst, injection of hypertonic saline and/or absolute alcohol, and re-aspiration. It is indicated for ECs 5–10 cm in diameter, in poor surgical candidates or in patients who have failed previous surgical interventions. It is best performed under continuous US or CT guidance with benzimidazole coverage. A study by Chen et al, showed a 98.7% cure rate in patients undergoing laparoscopic intervention, and 97.5% in patients receiving PAIR plus chemotherapy. Follow up is recommended initially every 6 months for the first 2 years, and then once a year, depending on the clinical setting.
