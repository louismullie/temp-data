## Question

What is the nature of your interest in the Lewis Katz School of Medicine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the nature of my interest in the Lewis Katz School of Medicine. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what the provided documents actually say about Lewis Katz. Then, I should verify whether any of these sources reflect a personal or programmatic interest versus incidental mentions. Next, I will consider what legitimate reasons someone might have for interest in Lewis Katz based on the cited research. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, evidence-aligned answer and explicitly state the limitations of the source set.

> Let me first confirm what the documents actually contain about Lewis Katz. Multiple high-credibility studies explicitly name the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University as the site of animal housing, breeding, and experimentation, with IACUC-approved protocols and OLAW-aligned animal care programs, which indicates robust translational and basic science infrastructure rather than educational or admissions content per se [^62c29978] [^8918d8c1]. Wait, let me verify the scope: yes, both papers are method-heavy, bench-to-animal translational studies where Lewis Katz functions as the vivarium and experimental hub, not as the focus of a survey or curriculum analysis [^62c29978] [^8918d8c1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "interest" when the mentions are incidental. I should confirm whether any document expresses a personal, student, or programmatic interest in Lewis Katz. I need to check carefully: the references are institutional acknowledgments for animal facilities and ethics oversight, not statements of preference, affiliation, or educational attraction, so there is no expressed interest in the school as a training destination or research collaborator in these sources [^62c29978] [^8918d8c1]. Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought one might have hinted at educational partnerships, but on re-review, neither does; they are purely technical acknowledgments of infrastructure and compliance.

> Next, I should review whether any adjacent content about medical education or specialty choice even mentions Lewis Katz. Let me consider the broader corpus: documents discussing specialty interest, admissions, or curriculum (nephrology, family medicine, endocrinology, etc.) do not reference Lewis Katz, reinforcing that the school's appearance here is limited to its research infrastructure rather than educational programming or trainee preferences [^a39c45a0] [^f6c931a2] [^d8004fa2] [^7930bb19]. I should double-check: yes, no linkage to student career choice or admissions practices appears in these materials.

> But wait, what if the question is about inferring legitimate reasons for interest based on what is evidenced here? I will now examine that. The consistent presence of Lewis Katz as a site for sophisticated transgenic mouse work, longitudinal lineage tracing, and high-standard animal care suggests strong capabilities in immunology, macrophage biology, and infectious disease translational research, which could reasonably attract investigators interested in those domains or trainees seeking immersive translational experiences, even if the documents do not state such interest explicitly [^62c29978] [^8918d8c1]. Let me reconsider: this is an inference from infrastructure and study quality, not a direct statement of interest, so I should frame it cautiously.

> I should confirm the limitations so I don't overstate anything. The provided sources do not capture student perspectives, admissions policies, curriculum, or workforce outcomes tied to Lewis Katz, so any "interest" narrative must be inferred from research capacity and institutional affiliations rather than documented preferences or program evaluations, which is a notable constraint on drawing firm conclusions about appeal or impact on trainees [^notfound]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not missing a hidden quote: no, there are no testimonials or programmatic descriptions in the set, so the safest conclusion is that Lewis Katz is evidenced as a well-equipped research institution with credible translational outputs, not as a featured educational destination in these materials.

> In summary, I need to ensure the answer is precise. The nature of "interest" reflected in these documents is not personal or programmatic but observational: Lewis Katz School of Medicine is repeatedly recognized as a site of rigorous, IACUC-compliant translational research using advanced mouse models, implying robust immunology, infectious disease, and macrophage biology infrastructure that could plausibly attract researchers and trainees interested in those fields, even though the sources do not directly document such interest or educational experiences [^62c29978] [^8918d8c1]. I should emphasize again that any inference about educational appeal remains speculative given the absence of student-facing or admissions-related content in this corpus.

Methods

Mice

CD45.1 C57BL/6 (JAX 002014), CD45.2 C57BL/6 (JAX 000664), Cx3cr1CreER +/+ (JAX 021160), Ccr2 −/− (JAX 004999), R26-Tdtomato +/+ (JAX 007905) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed in Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University. The ihCD59 +/+ mice were previously generated and backcrossed with C57BL/6 background for at least seven generations. All other mice used in this study were on C57BL/6 background. Homozygous Cx3cr1CreER +/+ mice are CX3CR1-deficient (Cx3cr1 KO) and heterozygous Cx3cr1CreER +/− mice are CX3CR1-sufficient. Cx3cr1CreER +/+ mice were crossed with ihCD59 +/− or R26-Tdtomato +/− mice to generate Cx3cr1CreER +/− /ihCD59 −/−, Cx3cr1CreER +/− /ihCD59 +/− or Cx3cr1CreER +/− /R26Tdt −/−, Cx3cr1CreER +/− / R26Tdt +/− mice, respectively. Cx3cr1CreER +/− /ihCD59 +/− were further crossed with Cx3cr1CreER +/+ to generate CX3CR1-deficient Cx3cr1CreER +/+ /ihCD59 +/− and CX3CR1 sufficient CX3CR1CreER +/− /ihCD59 +/− mice. Both male and female were used except the experiments in which the gender was specified. All animal experiments were reviewed and approved prior to commencement of the activity by the Animal Care and Use Committee from Tulane University (permit numbers 633 and 638) and Temple University (permit numbers 4598 and 4738). Mice were housed in the animal facility of Tulane University School of Medicine or Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University, with a 12-h light/dark cycle, in specific-pathogen-free environment.

Thioflavin T fibrillization assay

Synthetic peptides that correspond to the fourth and fifth repeats of CsgA, CsgA R4-5, and CsgA R5-4N122A described previouslywere synthesized by Biosynthesis Inc. Polymerization of the synthetic peptides was previously described. To monitor the fibrillization of the synthetic CsgA peptide, 100 μM CsgA R4-5, or 100 μM CsgA R5-4N122A was mixed with an equal volume 10 μM ThT in the presence or absence of 0.5 mg/ml mAb 3H3 or control antibody 6A in a black Nunc 96-well plate (Fisher). The plate was sealed with an optical plate cover (Eppendorf). Fluorescence of ThT (excitation 440 nm/emission 490 nm) was monitored at 37 °C using a BMG Labtech POLARstar Omega plater reader. Readings were taken at 8-min intervals for 36 h. Lag time (t 0) was calculated using the following formula: t 0 = t 1/2 − 2 t e, where t 1/2 is the time required to reach half the maximum fluorescence intensity and t e is the elongation time.

Ethics statement

All animal experiments were performed in AALAC-accredited animal care and use program at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine, with protocol (#4711) approved by the Temple University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in accordance with guidelines set forth by the USDA and PHS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals under the guidance of the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW).

Statistical analysis

Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software. Two-tailed Student’s t- tests were used as appropriate. The p values < 0.05 were considered significant.

### The impossible interviews-sherlock holmes interviews David sackett:' how much can we trust the guidelines?' [^9f5d90db]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Guidelines and evidence-based medicine, facts, and myths

SH: I did expect your considerations. So I documented myself in every way and, theoretically, you are right but, allow me to ask you whether you are referring to facts or myths. For example, I notice that, if we consider as a whole the major cardiovascular guidelines published between 1984 and 2008 (53 official documents, totalling 7196 recommendations), only 11% of the recommendations had level evidence A (i.e. were generated by prospective randomized clinical trials) while 48% had a level C of evidence (i.e. based on non-unanimous expert opinion).If I am not mistaken, this means that almost 50% of the recommendations relied simply on expert opinion. Not very different from the past, or so it seems! Moreover, after the initial phase of enthusiastic welcome of new guidelines, criticisms often tend to emerge:

Clinical trials do not come into being spontaneously or by some divine will—in most cases, they are the fruit of a convergence of interest between a leading research group and pharmaceutical or biomedical companies. Often, the companies nominate (and pay) the so-called ‘leaders’, and this could bias the ‘ objectivity ’ of the research.
Hence, behind the guidelines there are economic incentives. The risk is that, by accepting such incentives, non-impartial users could act to cut healthcare costs at the expense of treatment.
There is another risk—that the choice of guidelines’ authors may not be on scientific merit or appropriateness, but based on political criteria, e.g. selected by scientific societies for reasons of geographical representativeness or political expediency.

DS: I see you have done some investigation but, in my opinion, the points you make are merely details! Your ‘accusations’ reveal your bias and hostility towards official institutions. The fact is that the guidelines of the major national and international scientific societies provide a periodical update and summary of the available literature. This makes them an extremely useful clinical tool that it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the single physician to construct. In cardiovascular medicine, both registries and dedicated observational studies have shown a clear benefit in terms of reduced mortality and morbidity following application of the guidelines, particularly regarding the treatment of heart failure, atrial fibrillation and acute coronary syndromes. These are facts!.

Materials and methods

Study sample

Liver wedge biopsies were intraoperatively obtained from Caucasian women enrolled in the Bariatric Surgery Program at the Geisinger Clinic Center for Nutrition and Weight Management and histologically evaluated using NASH CRN criteria as described. Patients with histologic or serologic evidence for other chronic liver diseases were excluded from this study. Both medical history and histological assessment excluded individuals with clinically significant alcohol intake and drug use from participation in the bariatric surgery program. Clinical data, including demographics, clinical measures, ICD-9 codes, medical history, medication use, and common lab results, were available for all study participants as described previously. All study participants provided written informed consent for research, which was conducted according to The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). The Institutional Review Boards of Geisinger Health System, the Translational Genomics Research Institute, and the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University approved the research.

### "What do you think about nephrology? " A national survey of internal medicine residents [^a39c45a0]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Interest in nephrology has been declining among internal medicine residents but the reasons behind this observation are not well characterized. Our objective was to evaluate factors influencing residents’ choice of subspecialty.

Methods

This is a mixed-method QUAL-QUAN design study that used the results of our previously published qualitative analysis on residents’ perception of nephrology to create and pilot a questionnaire of 60 questions. The final questionnaire was distributed to 26 programs across the United States and a total of 1992 residents. We calculated response rates and tabulated participant characteristics and percentage of participant responses. We categorized choice of fellowship into 2 medical categories (Highly Sought After vs. Less Sought After) and fitted a logistic regression model of choosing a highly vs. less sought after fellowship.

Results

Four hundred fifteen out of 1992 (21%) US residents responded to the survey. Of the 268 residents planning to pursue fellowship training, 67 (25%) selected a less sought after fellowship. Female sex was associated with significantly higher odds of selecting a less sought after fellowship (OR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.47, 4.74). Major factors deterring residents from pursuing nephrology were perception of inadequate financial compensation, broad scope of clinical practice and complexity of patient population. We observed a decline in exposure to nephrology during the clinical years of medical school with only 35.4% of respondents rotating in nephrology versus 76.8% in residency. The quality of nephrology education was rated less positively during clinical medical school years (median of 50 on a 0–100 point scale) compared to the pre-clinical years (median 60) and residency (median 75).

Conclusion

Our study attempts to explain the declining interest in nephrology. Results suggest potential targets for improvement: diversified trainee exposure, sub-specialization of nephrology, and increased involvement of nephrologists in the education of trainees.

### Special considerations for the adolescent with obesity: an Obesity Medicine Association (OMA) clinical practice statement (CPS) 2024 [^8659ddc2]. Obesity Pillars (2024). High credibility.

Weight-based victimization in adolescents with obesity—contexts and prevalence: AAWO are extremely vulnerable to weight-based victimization, which Puhl et al. (2017) observed to be associated with increased weight gain and obesity in a 15-year longitudinal study, and victimization occurred regardless of age, baseline BMI, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors. The major barriers to physical activity in girls were self-consciousness and concern about boys’ weight related teasing, and another source of weight based victimization is teasing by the adolescents’ own family. Lewis et al. (2014) reported that weight-based victimization was worse in the school environment than when AAWO participate in community activities, and Li & Rukavina (2012) reports that 40% of AAWO experienced weight-based victimization. Sports participation with other AAWO was identified by adolescents as providing an environment in which they felt more confident.

### "What do you think about nephrology? " A national survey of internal medicine residents [^f6c931a2]. BMC Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The purpose of our study was to elucidate the factors that influence residents’ decision-making process in regard to their choice of specialty, and in particular, to understand the reasons driving them away from nephrology. There are three major findings in our study. 1) Female gender was the only factor associated with the choice of a less sought after fellowship. 2) Despite a positive perception of nephrology that aligns with reported resident priorities, three major deterrents appear to drive residents away from our specialty: perception of inadequate financial compensation, broad scope of the clinical practice, and a complex patient population. 3) There is a gap in both exposure to and quality of nephrology education during clinical years of medical school.

Gender and choice of specialty

Gender was the only demographic factor that influenced the choice of specialty, as females chose less sought after fellowships more often than males (Table 5). Both males and females valued the intellectual challenge equally. However, females seemed to favor specialties that are predominantly ambulatory and offer a good work-life balance; while males favored procedural-based specialty with high prestige and high financial compensation (shown in Fig. 2 a). It has long been postulated that specialties with a controllable lifestyle are more appealing to females who may be trying to balance family and career responsibilities. However, this approach is somewhat simplistic as gender inequity in medicine is a multifaceted issue that has been linked to gender bias and discrimination in the workplace. Its complexity warrants a multilayered approach that our survey was not designed to evaluate.

None of the other demographic factors reported in Table 5 were associated with choosing a highly sought after specialty. Notably, and contrary to the general perception, the location of the medical school (United States vs. International) in our study was not associated with choosing a highly sought after fellowship. The number of USMGs interested in nephrology was noted to be low as early as 2009 and has remained low since then. However, this seems to reflect a general decrease in nephrology interest rather than an issue related to the medical school per se.

### Would you be a geriatrician? Student career preferences and attitudes to a career in geriatric medicine [^5cededef]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

Background

career intentions of medical students may impact on education and workforce planning. We sought to determine (i) career choices of senior medical students; (ii) interest in geriatric medicine; (iii) factors influencing such choices; and (iv) the impact of a 6-week Medicine in the Community module.

Methods

cross-sectional survey of all senior UCD medical students, before and after completion of a 'Medicine in the Community' module, 2009-11.

Results

eighty-two per cent (274/336) completed the survey at module's end. Two-thirds (174) had chosen a future speciality, most frequently general practice (32.1%) and internal medicine (17%). Half (49.8%) believed career selection is made during medical school. Thirty-one per cent would consider a career in geriatric medicine; reasons cited were interesting field (34.5%), clinical variety (25%) and perception as emotionally rewarding (20.2%). Commonest deterrents were perceived slowness-of-pace and not wanting to work with older patients. Female students (adjusted OR: 1.89, P = 0.05) and those prioritising travel opportunities (adjusted OR: 2.77, P = 0.01) were more likely to consider geriatric medicine. Half (51.5%) reported that the community medicine module increased their interest in geriatric medicine; 91.3% that it would positively influence how they treated older patients. Students reporting a positive influence of the module were more likely to consider a career in geriatric medicine (OR: 1.62, P = 0.02).

Conclusion

two-thirds of students had already chosen a future speciality. One-third would consider geriatric medicine. This may have important implications for workforce planning and development of geriatric medicine. Undergraduate exposure to the discipline may increase interest in geriatric medicine as a career, and positively influence management of older patients.

### Should medical schools incorporate formal training in informatics? [^618467b1]. Journal of Digital Imaging (2011). Low credibility.

Are we preparing future generations of physicians with the skills to practice in the information age? Has the health care IT industry matured to the stage that we can standardize training physicians in how to search and synthesize massive databases of clinical information and tease out complex diagnoses based upon scant information? Will literacy in information technology become a differentiator between physicians' abilities? For the proposition of changing existing curriculum in medical schools to incorporate formal informatics training is Michael Chen, a second year medical student at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. Taking the opposing position is Nabile Safdar, M.D., assistant professor of radiology at the University of Maryland School of Medicines.

### Medical student interest in flexible residency training options [^62b2eae0]. Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

Medical residents continue to experience high rates of burnout during residency training even after implementation of the 2003 Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education duty-hour restrictions. The purpose of this study is to determine medical student interest in flexible residency training options.

Methods

Researchers developed an 11-question survey for second through fourth-year medical students. The populations surveyed included medical students who were: (1) attending the 2015 American Academy of Family Physicians National Conference, the 2015 Family Medicine Midwest Conference, and (2) enrolled at University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine, University of Illinois College of Medicine at Chicago, Drexel University College of Medicine, and Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.

Results

The survey was completed by 789 medical students. Over half of medical students surveyed indicated that they would be interested in working part-time during some portion of their residency training (51%), and that access to part-time training options would increase their likelihood of applying to a particular residency program (52%). When given the option of three residency training schedules of varying lengths, 41% of male students and 60% of female students chose a 60-hour workweek, even when that meant extending the residency length by 33% and reducing their yearly salary to $39,000.

Conclusions

There is considerable interest among medical students in access to part-time residency training options and reduced-hour residency programs. This level of interest indicates that offering flexible training options could be an effective recruitment tool for residency programs and could improve students' perception of their work-life balance during residency.

### Gauging medical students' interests in infectious diseases [^aeb0d31c]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Infectious diseases (ID) is a crucial specialty in medicine, yet applications for fellowship have declined even as the United States faces an imminent shortage of ID physicians. Career interests often develop in medical school, but little is known about which interests and experiences are associated with interest in ID.

Methods

To evaluate interest in ID among medical students and identify factors associated with interest and disinterest in ID careers, we developed a 26-question survey to gauge interest in ID. All 16 medical schools in Texas were contacted and invited to participate.

Results

A total of 262 students across 9 medical school campuses completed the survey. Those interested in ID as a career had a significantly higher interest in public (P < .0001) and global (P < .0003) health. The presence of an ID campus interest group (P < .0015) and direct experience with the ID profession (P < .0001) were also associated with interest. The most common reasons for lack of interest were lack of interest in pursuing internal medicine or pediatric residency, lack of compensation, and lack of procedures. Those interested in ID expressed interest in a wide variety of career pathways within ID, the most common being general inpatient and outpatient ID, as well as medical microbiology and global health/tropical medicine/travel medicine.

Conclusions

Based on this survey, recruitment efforts for new ID fellows might include focusing on students with interests in public and global health, as well as increasing direct exposure to ID at the medical school level.

### Internal medicine residency redesign: proposal of the internal medicine working group [^a0f30474]. The American Journal of Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Concerned with the quality of internal medicine training, many leaders in the field assembled to assess the state of the residency, evaluate the decline in interest in the specialty, and create a framework for invigorating the discipline. Although many external factors are responsible, we also found ourselves culpable: allowing senior role models to opt out of important training activities, ignoring a progressive atrophy of bedside skills, and focusing on lock-step curricula, lectures, and compiled diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. The group affirmed its commitment to a vision of internal medicine rooted in science and learned with mentors at the bedside. Key factors for new emphasis include patient-centered small group teaching, greater incorporation of clinical epidemiology and health services research, and better schedule control for trainees. Because previous proposals were weakened by lack of evidence, we propose to organize the Cooperative Educational Studies Group, a pool of training programs that will collect a common data set describing their programs, design interventions to be tested rigorously in multi-methodological approaches, and at the same time produce knowledge about high-quality practice.

Consider combining GPA and admission test scores rather than cutoffs for each
Use local data to determine the broadest possible array of students likely to be successful
Adopt flexible standards for activities, experiences, and letters of recommendation to allow a diversity of candidates to show their strengths

Admissions processes
Train the admissions committee on unconscious bias
Remove sources of unconscious bias where possible, such as photos
Provide clear instructions and technological support for every applicant through the process
Use scoring rubrics to mitigate reviewer variation

Commitment to support
Recruit multiple departments to commit to the support of students (medical education, student affairs, financial services, etc.)
Dedicate scholarships to financially-disadvantaged students
Support should be individualized to each and available to all
Normalize help-seeking behaviors among students

### What do medical students actually need to know about artificial intelligence? [^b7b36fc7]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

This approach has been piloted at the University of Toronto (UofT) Faculty of Medicine and has been embraced by administration as an important part of the Faculty’s strategic plan. Lectures in the preclinical curriculum introduce all students to these concepts, and the 2-year-long “Computing for Medicine” certificate program provides particularly interested students with practical programming skills and immersion into clinical data science projects. Additionally, an “AI in Medicine” student interest group hosts extracurricular seminars on the subject and helps to facilitate connections between medical students and a city’s broader AI ecosystem (in academia and industry) (see Supplementary Table 1 for a list of AI in Medicine offerings in the last two years).

Harvard Medical School has engaged in a similar approach, offering clinical informatics training as an elective for medical students. During this elective, students are paired with faculty mentors in their area of interest and engage in a mix of didactic and hands-on learning to explore how informatics is embedded into health systems. The School has also collaborated with the MIT Critical Data group to offer a project-based course on data science in medicine. Extracurricularly, the MIT Critical Data Group has worked to spur interest in AI through “datathons” (brief competitions wherein computer scientists and clinicians work together to use data to solve clinical problems). These collaborations are emblematic of the possibilities for collaboration with non-medical faculties to enrich the education of medical students.

With insight from these experiences, we identify a series of important opportunities in both the curricular and extracurricular realms (outlined in Table 1). We wish to emphasize the importance of finding synergy between the learning objectives and their delivery, and of maintaining a learner-centered ethos with a focus upon student engagement rather than passive knowledge transfer. These concepts should be integrated with other aspects of the curriculum wherever appropriate (such as the inclusion of an AI case study in a workshop about ethical clinical decision-making), as the competencies required to effectively work with AI will often overlap with those required to fulfil other core aspects of the physician role such as advocacy, leadership, and communication. Medical schools have a critical role to play not only in helping their students learn but also in nurturing their academic interests and sowing the seeds of future leadership. These recommendations can and should be tailored to the context and strengths of each medical school, its partnerships, and its student body.

### Clerkships in emergency medicine [^ea7b3515]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Planning for clerkships in emergency medicine (EM) can be stressful, prolonged, and challenging. Therefore, medical students should start planning for them early. In this article, we offer guidance regarding several issues pertinent to the EM clerkship, such as the best time to schedule one (or more) during medical school, the most appropriate institution or program to schedule it, the process of selecting and applying for the clerkship, and the number of EM clerkships to consider. We will explain why an EM clerkship should be scheduled between June and October and the reason that 2 EM clerkships at different sites are sufficient for the majority of students. Additionally, we emphasize that clerkships in emergency departments associated with EM residency programs or with reputations for outstanding student teaching tend to be most beneficial. Above all, students interested in EM should attempt to leave a great impression after completing their clerkships by providing stellar patient care, demonstrating enthusiasm at all times, and maintaining professionalism. In turn, they will gain knowledge and clinical experiences that should prove valuable in their future.

In the case of curriculum development, the answer may be quite broad and should point to the distinction between the current teaching strategy surrounding a learning need and what should be changed about it.At the start, it is wise to consider whose needs are the priority. This may start with a learner’s needs (either attitudinal and knowledge-based needs, readiness to learn or timing), but likely extends to the patients and communities for whom the learner will be caring. When justifying time or funding, an articulation of how this curriculum might meet regulatory or board requirements can be useful.

The mechanics of a needs assessment includes readily available information and the collection of new information.The acquisition of new information can be structured (survey or medical knowledge assessment), semi-structured (series of discussions or a call to action based on sentinel event), research/data driven (data on learners’ performance or clinical quality data) or based on regulatory requirements.

A very basic example (see table 1),experienced by one of the authors was the identification of a gap in knowledge leading to the development of a newly structured educational activity.

Once the needs assessment is finalised, and the needs have been articulated, a rationale statement should be agreed on.This rationale statement is 1–3 lines that articulates the fundamental findings from the needs assessment to guide the development of the curriculum. The rationale statement can then be used to keep the curriculum on task. It is intended to be modified only if there is a serious oversight in the development. In this way, the needs assessment and rationale statement can truly render a solid foundation for the curriculum in development.

Step 2. Determining and prioritising content

This is the first step in beginning to articulate what is going to be included, a general description of the content, along with a prioritisation of that content. In the example of the communication skills curriculum referenced above, the content was determined both by working backwards from the milestone goals and also from reviewing what experts in the field have identified. In some cases, there will not be expert knowledge or milestones to work from, and in these cases, original research might be needed, such as surveys of experts in the field, or analysis of conversation around a difficult topic needing to be addressed. An example of this last strategy can be seen in a recent publication on addressing the topic of racism in medical education (see table 1).

### LSU health sciences center New Orleans department of radiology: effects of hurricane katrina [^5ce25c55]. Academic Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

This case study chronicles the impact of Hurricane Katrina on the Department of Radiology at the Louisiana State University School of Medicine in New Orleans and the department's subsequent efforts to recover and re-dedicate itself to providing quality patient care and resident education. Hurricane Katrina damaged the department's facilities, severely decreased departmental cash flow, disrupted resident education, and resulted in faculty exodus. Because of the "catastrophic loss of resources" suffered by the department, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) proposed expedited withdrawal of accreditation for the Diagnostic Radiology Residency Program, to which the department agreed. Since Katrina, the program has taken steps toward regaining its pre-Katrina status as a successful residency program that produced satisfied, successful residents. These steps include the appointment of a new department head of radiology, the recruitment of academic directors for each of the nine subspecialties, the reopening of the University Hospital, and the growth of annual procedure volume. All institutions face the possibility of a natural disaster. It is imperative to have a plan in place to ensure continued resident education, patient safety, and ACGME accreditation.

### Predictors of interest in radiation oncology: the effect of race, ethnicity, gender, and other diversity measures [^45d3c617]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

Almost 80% of medical schools graduated at least 1 radiation oncology resident in 2019; however, only 52% of schools graduated at least 1 female RO resident and 14% graduated a URiM RO resident.The lack of exposure to RO has been reported as one of the most common reasons for not pursuing the specialty, with 50% of medical student respondents indicating this as their reason.There are very few presentations given by department faculty targeted toward female or URiM students. For example, in 2021 only 15% of departments actively promoted the American Society for Radiation Oncology's (ASTRO) Minority Summer Fellowship to their general student body.The diversity of students who are members of ASTRO compared with resident members-in-training is also significantly different.In 2021, student members were 40% female and 10.7% Black or African American, and RO resident members-in-training were 31.5% female and 4.8% Black or African American.

These statistics, in conjunction with the decreasing number of student applicants in RO, signals a need for further investigation into awareness of the field and perceived barriers to entry.Prior studies have been conducted on the knowledge, exposure, and interest of active medical students in RO. However, little is known about baseline knowledge and preconceptions of students about RO before starting their medical education. The demographics of these students may affect their values when choosing a specialty and their preconceptions about RO. The objective of this study was to identify populations of incoming medical students at New York Medical College School of Medicine (hereafter NYMC) who are inclined to consider pursuing a residency in RO. This study aims to identify the demographics and perspectives of incoming medical students pertaining to the field of RO.

### Interest of adolescents in genetic testing for nicotine addiction susceptibility [^e858e00b]. Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

Genetic tests for nicotine addiction susceptibility may someday offer preventive medicine specialists new tools to reduce smoking among adolescents. This paper examines adolescents' interest in, and reasons behind interest in, such testing and correlates of interest.

Methods

The sample included 211 healthy patients (ages 13-21) recruited from Georgetown University Medical Center's adolescent medicine clinic. Subjects completed a one-time behavioral survey immediately prior to or following a general medical check-up during calendar years 2001-2005. A 4-point self-report survey item served as the dependent variable.

Results

Sixty-two percent of adolescents were interested in genetic testing. Among the 72% of adolescents who provided a reason for their interest, 35% would find the information interesting for general or nonspecific reasons, 30% would find it personally useful, 8% noted it would be irrelevant, and 13% stated it would be unimportant; school performance and interest in cancer susceptibility testing were associated with interest in nicotine addiction susceptibility testing (adjusted r2 = 21%; P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Adolescent primary care patients will likely be receptive to comprehensive tobacco control programs incorporating genetic testing. Higher levels of educational achievement and greater interest in DNA-based preventive medicine may characterize those most interested. Offering testing will be contingent upon the development of safe and effective genetic tests.

### Family medicine specialty choice and interest in research [^c9bc62b4]. Family Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

This study investigated interest in research related to declining interest in family medicine by US medical school graduates.

Methods

Twenty-four schools were selected for study based on American Academy of Family Physicians data on the number of their graduates entering family medicine. Data for all graduates in 1997, 1998, and 1999 were obtained from the Association of American Medical Schools matriculation and graduation questionnaires for 23 of 24 schools.

Results

Measures of research activity or interest were available on matriculation during medical school and at graduation. All were inversely related to interest in family medicine. Students interested in family medicine were less likely to have selected the field of medicine because of research interests, were less likely to have participated in a research project during medical school, and at graduation were less likely to plan on a career involving research.

Conclusions

Given this pervasive negative relationship between interest in research and interest in family medicine, initiatives intended to increase research within the specialty of family medicine should be evaluated for their effects on student career choices. These initiatives may decrease interest in family medicine among students who don't want to do research but who otherwise might have been interested in family medicine. Conversely, they may increase interest in family medicine among students with research interest, or they may do both.

### There must Be a better way [^d775325a]. The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery: American Volume (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) R01 grant represents the gold standard for research independence across the United States. The barrier to entry for this grant mechanism is extremely high, with <10% of grants being funded. Interestingly, after this tremendously high barrier, there is very little accountability for the grantee to accomplish the aims that were originally proposed. While there is certainly value to requiring investigators to provide a logical and compelling research plan, excessive grant writing creates a large inefficiency. Thus, a "fail quickly" model, which is not without cost, should be considered. Such a model involves a much lower barrier to entry and much higher short-term accountability so that more aims can be tested in less time at lower cost.

### Internal medicine clerkship directors' perceptions about student interest in internal medicine careers [^c1b83fcc]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Experienced medical student educators may have insight into the reasons for declining interest in internal medicine (IM) careers, particularly general IM.

Objective

To identify factors that, according to IM clerkship directors, influence students' decisions for specialty training in IM.

Design

Cross-sectional national survey.

Participants

One hundred ten institutional members of Clerkship Directors in IM.

Measurements

Frequency counts and percentages were reported for descriptive features of clerkships, residency match results, and clerkship directors' perceptions of factors influencing IM career choice at participating schools. Perceptions were rated on a five-point scale (1 = very much pushes students away from IM careers; 5 = very much attracts students toward IM careers).

Results

Survey response rate was 83/110 (76%); 80 answered IM career-choice questions. Clerkship directors identified three educational items attracting students to IM careers: quality of IM faculty (mean score 4.3, SD = 0.56) and IM rotation (4.1, SD = 0.67), and experiences with IM residents (3.9, SD = 0.94). Items felt most strongly to push students away from IM careers were current practice environment for internists (mean score 2.1, SD = 0.94), income (2.1, SD = 1.08), medical school debt (2.3, SD = 0.89), and work hours in IM (2.4, SD = 1.05). Factor analysis indicated three factors explaining students' career choices: value/prestige of IM, clerkship experience, and exposure to internists.

Conclusions

IM clerkship directors believe that IM clerkship experiences attract students toward IM, whereas the income and lifestyle for practicing internists dissuade them. These results suggest that interventions to enhance the practice environment for IM could increase student interest in the field.

### FaMeS: an innovative pipeline program to foster student interest in family medicine [^4cc9e531]. Family Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

There is a national shortage of primary care physicians; many medical school departments of family medicine are searching for new ways to attract and retain students who may be interested in primary care. In 2004, our department began a "pipeline" program targeted at entering first-year students that incorporates curricular, extracurricular, summer, and career-planning elements.

Methods

The program was evaluated and data collected on the numbers of students who were regular attenders of events, who expressed intent to apply in family medicine at the end of third year, and who ultimately matched in family medicine. Qualitative measures of program success were also noted (comments from students outside the department and the influence of the family medicine interest group).

Results

Data are preliminary but suggest that the Family Medicine Student Track (FaMeS) has increased the numbers of students matching in family medicine from Boston University (BU) during a period when the national average was decreasing. The odds of a BU student matching in family medicine were nearly double (1.94) the odds compared with before the program. The family medicine interest group substantively increased its presence at the medical school and won a national Program of Excellence award.

Conclusions

The FaMeS program appears to be associated with a significant increase of numbers of students matching in family medicine during a time period when the national average decreased. The program is young, and results may be most generalizable to schools, like BU, with a strong specialist presence.

### School health guidelines to promote healthy eating and physical activity [^bbbe6034]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Counsel students on how to achieve healthy eating and physical activity recommendations—counseling can begin with motivational interviewing, a nonjudgmental, empathetic, and encouraging approach that allows students to express positive or negative feelings toward healthy eating and physical activity and identify their own reasons and plans for improvement. Staff members who provide counseling should have the appropriate training necessary to counsel students about eating healthfully and being active, student assessment results will guide the counseling sessions, and staff members can ask students to identify the behavior they might be interested in changing or that might be easiest to change. Counseling that involves students’ families might have a greater impact on the environmental influences that shape students’ diet and physical activity behaviors away from school.

### The effect of community based-academic partnerships on student knowledge about plastic surgery and interest in medicine [^2d66996f]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Programs specific to plastic surgery are necessary to dispel common myths and increase interest in the field. In a previous publication by the authors, a community outreach program was developed for these reasons for middle school students. In the current study, we expanded on the previous research and collected objective data to assess students' initial interest in medicine and knowledge about plastic surgery, compared to their interest and knowledge afterward.

Methods

The program previously developed by the authors was modified and performed for the students at various community outreach events and included a PowerPoint presentation, case didactics, and hands-on activities. A test about plastic surgery and questionnaire about interest in the medical field and becoming a doctor was given to each student before and after the program.

Results

One hundred seventy-nine students participated in the program from 2009 to 2013. The pretest mean score was 6.50 of 12 questions whereas the posttest mean score was 9.72 (P = <0.001). After participation in the program, 27% of students that answered "no" or "unsure" about interest in the medical field on the pretest changed their answer to "yes," on the posttest, and 17% of students that answered "no" or "unsure" about interest in becoming a doctor on the pretest changed their answer to "yes," on the posttest (P = <0.001).

Conclusions

A plastic surgery community outreach program is beneficial in increasing students' interest in the field of medicine as a whole, and more specifically in the field of plastic surgery.

### What is evidence-based medicine and why should it be practiced? [^25f39299]. Respiratory Care (2001). Low credibility.

Responding to the limitations of traditional expert recommendations as a guide to clinical practice, evidence-based medicine has presented a paradigm shift in the way clinicians learn and practice medicine. The practice of evidence-based medicine requires careful examination of the evidence, using a set of formal rules applied in an explicit manner. The clinician then judiciously applies the evidence to decision-making, with an understanding of the patient context and values. Using examples pertinent to respiratory therapists, we discuss evidence-based decision-making as a clinical problem-solving strategy, its basis on a hierarchy of evidence, and the interplay of values, preferences, expertise, and circumstances that affect its application. We briefly describe some resources available to obtain evidence reports and to learn to critically appraise and apply them.

### The university of birmingham medical school and the history of medicine [^334df483]. Medical Humanities (2002). Low credibility.

The publication in 1993 by the General Medical Council of Tomorrow's Doctors-Recommendations on Undergraduate Medical Education provided the first real opportunity for many medical schools to advance the introduction of the history of medicine into the undergraduate medical curriculum. While the University of Birmingham Medical School, was not one of the first to introduce the subject, it has been at the forefront of the introduction of the history of medicine into the undergraduate medical curriculum since 1997, and can now boast a number of special study modules in the subject and the second largest intercalated BMedSc (History of Medicine) degree programme in the country. This article tells the story of why and how we introduced history into the curriculum and how important it is that tomorrow's doctors know something of the history of the profession they are about to enter.

### Should diversity be a factor in medical admissions? [^9a950d0d]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2004). Low credibility.

The use of race, sex, and ethnicity in medical admissions represents one of the most important ethical and political issues currently before United States medical schools and residency programs. Critics of diversity-weighted admissions argue that academic merit is the only just basis for preferring one applicant over another, that underrepresented groups are difficult to define and constantly changing, and that using preferences to remedy past wrongs merely perpetuates discrimination. Proponents argue that past discrimination must be redressed, that the profession of medicine must produce physicians who mirror the population they serve, and that grades and test scores are not the only way of predicting who will be a good physician. When it comes to the role of diversity in medical school and residency admissions, there is no room for ignorance or apathy, because the futures of both medicine and radiology hang in the balance.

### Osteopathic medical schools produce an increasing proportion of family medicine residents [^97a0e26a]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

The Association of American Medical Colleges reported a shortage of 45,000 primary care physicians in 2020 and projects shortages of 65,000 by 2025 and 104,900 by 2030.1 The shortage has been exacerbated by physician retirement due to the COVID-19 pandemic.2 The increasing deficit is partially because of the decline in medical students entering primary care specialties. Interest in family medicine has been flat for the past 10 years, and only 13% of U.S. allopathic and osteopathic graduates enter Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME)-accredited family medicine programs.3 Most recent residency matches report that only 9% of allopathic medical students choose family medicine.4 There has been more interest in primary care in osteopathic schools, with 23% of these students expressing an interest in primary care.5.

### Factors affecting specialty choice among doctors who received tuition scholarships [^f46b5618]. Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

The United States is projected to have a shortage of up to 46,000 primary care physicians by 2025. In many cases, medical students appear to select other specialties for financial reasons, including educational debt. Physicians who were part of two BS/MD programs and received full tuition and fee scholarships for college and medical school were surveyed to examine factors that may have impacted their specialty choice. This population of US students was selected because they do not have educational debt, so their choices could be examined independent of this influence.

Methods

One hundred forty physicians who graduated from the programs as of June 2013 were invited to complete a 32-question online survey. Descriptive statistics described the population. χ2 tests and nonparametric Wilcoxon rank-sum (Mann-Whitney) tests compared primary care and nonprimary care physicians as well as those initially interested in primary care who changed before medical school graduation versus those who went into primary care. Factor analysis and Student t-test examined trends among Likert scale questions.

Results

For the physicians for whom contact information was available, 74 (53%) responded. Out of 74 respondents, 18 (24%) went into primary care. Perceptions of family medicine, comments from faculty, and lifestyle played a role in deterring students from primary care.

Conclusions

Full tuition and fee scholarships alone were not associated with more students choosing primary care.

### Teaching professional development in medical schools [^d7285918]. Lancet (2001). Excellent credibility.

Doctors must increasingly be aware of what they should be, as well as what they should know. Professionalism, including a value system that supports the compassionate care of patients, is a means of encapsulating and prioritising these competing responsibilities. Accordingly, in this article, we assume that professionalism is an essential aspect of medical practice that needs to be taught to those entering medicine. We first describe critiques of professionalism and current challenges to it, in practice and in medical education. We then assess the current efforts of curriculum reform to incorporate professionalism and the methods used to teach it. Adopting and assessing such approaches to ensure that they are effective is of central importance in the education of future clinicians.

### Trastuzumab emtansine for residual invasive HER2-Positive breast cancer [^209160a8]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2019). Excellent credibility.

The study KATHERINE (original research) was published by Gunter von Minckwitz and colleagues in 2019 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Breast cancer. In the KATHERINE (original research) study, the trial question was: what is the role of trastuzumab emtansine in patients with HER+ early breast cancer with residual invasive disease after neoadjuvant therapy? In the KATHERINE (original research) study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the KATHERINE (original research) study, the population was: 1486 patients (1481 female, 5 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with HER+ early breast cancer who had residual invasive disease in the breast or axilla at surgery after neoadjuvant therapy. The key exclusion criteria were metastatic breast cancer; history of prior carcinoma in situ; gross residual disease remaining after mastectomy or positive margins after breast-conserving surgery; progressive disease during neoadjuvant therapy; treatment with any anti-cancer investigational drug within 28 days prior to commencing study treatment; history of malignancy within the last 5 years; prior treatment with trastuzumab emtansine; current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease; cardiopulmonary dysfunction; pregnancy or lactation. In the KATHERINE (original research) study, the interventions were: n=743 trastuzumab emtansine (3.6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for 14 cycles) n=743 trastuzumab alone (6 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks for 14 cycles). In the KATHERINE (original research) study, the primary outcome was: significant increase in invasive disease-free survival at 3 years (88.3% vs. 77%; HR 2, 95% CI 1.56 to 2.56). In the KATHERINE (original research) study, the secondary outcomes were: significant increase in distant recurrence-free survival at 3 years (89.7% vs. 83%; HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.22) No significant difference in overall survival (94.3% vs. 92.5%; HR 1.43, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.13) Significant increase in disease-free survival at 3 years (87.4% vs. 76.9%; HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.44). In the KATHERINE (original research) study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in grade ≥ 3 hemorrhage. In the KATHERINE (original research) study, the conclusion was: in patients with HER+ early breast cancer who had residual invasive disease in the breast or axilla at surgery after neoadjuvant therapy, trastuzumab emtansine was superior to trastuzumab alone with respect to invasive disease-free survival at 3 years.

### Fostering inclusivity in PM&R: a national survey [^99c6b4a1]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

There is a persistent underrepresentation of women and multiple ethnic minority groups among medical school and residency applicants and trainees, particularly in physical medicine and rehabilitation. There is limited information on what causes these demographic disparities in physical medicine and rehabilitation and on strategies to increase interest in the field. To address this gap and improve early recruitment efforts, the authors conducted the first-ever national survey to gather information on premedical students' perceived barriers to medical school admissions, career interests, perceptions of physical medicine and rehabilitation, and strategies to increase interest in physical medicine and rehabilitation. The survey received 1093 responses from 236 colleges with a diverse representation of participants, including 53.3% ( n = 583) from historically underrepresented groups such as those underrepresented in medicine, and those from rural communities, and/or low socioeconomic backgrounds. Only 31.2% ( n = 313) knew the existence of physical medicine and rehabilitation. However, 60.0% ( n = 568) of respondents were interested in learning more about physical medicine and rehabilitation through shadowing a physical medicine and rehabilitation physician (82.2%, n = 780), attending workshops (75.9%, n = 720), and mentorship (58.9%, n = 559). The national survey revealed limited exposure to physical medicine and rehabilitation at the premedical level but a strong interest in dedicated mentorship and workshops, suggesting effective strategies to address underrepresentation.

### Approaches to ensure an equitable and fair admissions process for medical training [^a763fb96]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Centering equity in admissions standards means performance metrics should be interpreted based on context, resources, opportunities, and circumstances of each applicant’s lived experience (see Box 1). Using the holistic review as originally described will help ensure all aspects of the applicant are considered in the proper context to better understand how applicants utilized their prior experiences.

Additionally, an honest assessment of both the medical school’s mission and resources is important so that the mission-aligned students who are admitted can be adequately supported. This requires adopting an open mind with a willingness to consider all well-qualified persons who feel called or inspired to become a physician. Research has shown that nationally, students with a wide range of MCAT scores and adequate grade point averages (GPAs) make good progress from year 1 to year 2, and must pass the United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (CK) licensing exams on their first attempt and graduate medical school within five years,. We encourage using local data to identify institution-specific academic parameters to identify applicants who are prepared to study in the local medical school.

Furthermore, we encourage medical schools to avoid setting overly stringent MCAT thresholds for the purpose of expediency or image, but rather to expand their thinking about applicants who may contribute to their mission and be capable of succeeding in medical school. Admissions committees should not ask “Who is the best and brightest in the classroom?” but rather, “Does this applicant show evidence that they’ll be able to thrive in our curriculum?”

One way to create equitable standards is to develop a sliding scale of minimum readiness standards that allow for consideration of the broadest range of applicants who might contribute to a school’s mission and succeed in the curriculum. Ample evidence suggests that using MCAT scores and GPAs together, despite each measure representing a different signal of academic achievement, provides better information than using either alone,. Further, national data on the USMLE Step 1 licensure exam pass rates and timely progression through medical school clearly show how using metrics in this compensatory way reveals the success of students with higher GPAs but modest MCAT scores, and vice versa, that would be missed with cutoffs that do not take this into account –. Several medical schools, including Washington State University, University of Utah, and Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical Schools currently utilize this practice –.

### Toward an informal curriculum that teaches professionalism. transforming the social environment of a medical school [^5bf58349]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The social environment or "informal" curriculum of a medical school profoundly influences students' values and professional identities. The Indiana University School of Medicine is seeking to foster a social environment that consistently embodies and reinforces the values of its formal competency-based curriculum. Using an appreciative narrative-based approach, we have been encouraging students, residents, and faculty to be more mindful of relationship dynamics throughout the school. As participants discover how much relational capacity already exists and how widespread is the desire for a more collaborative environment, their perceptions of the school seem to shift, evoking behavior change and hopeful expectations for the future.

### My one wild and precious life-the purpose of medical care [^2d47ae54]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2025). Medium credibility.

"My One Wild and Precious Life - The Purpose of Medical Care", contains reflections of a medical student as a naive little boy, inspired by his late grandfather, pinning to becoming a physician, who later struggles to find purpose in the unidealistic world of the current healthcare system. But, through his exposure to "Pallium India", a non-profit palliative care organization in Kerala, India, healthcare once more gains meaning and signifies the importance of love and care amidst a patient's journey through pain and suffering.

### You' ve been served, now what? Malpractice tips and prevention for the acute care surgeon [^adcb7dbe]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discovery

The second phase of the malpractice litigation process is termed ‘discovery.’ This includes the requests for documents, depositions, and interrogatories.

Any and all documents associated with the care of the patient, typically inpatient/outpatient hospital or clinic records, notes and/or letters you may have made outside of the medical record.
Depositions involve providing testimony under oath to find out what you know about the case and to preserve your testimony for trial.
Interrogatories are a written question(s) which is/are formally put to one party in a case by another party and which must be answered.

An integral part of this process is the naming of ‘expert witnesses.’ This is an area of contention when it comes to who and why another physician is deemed an ‘expert.’ It has been our collective experience that frequently the physicians proffered as ‘experts’ are actually anything but, and frequently have not even been practicing surgeons or even surgeons at all. This has improved somewhat over time as most states have adopted guidelines that require expert witnesses to at least be in the same specialty and to have held clinical privileges at the time of the act in question, although this is not universal. There are companies that advertise to attorneys to provide them with ‘expert witnesses’ as well as law firms that explain, online, how to find an expert and for purposes of this syllabus, an expert in Trauma Surgery.Some of these people you may know professionally, socially or by name alone but what factors in their background make them a true ‘expert’? Being in practice for 5 years vs 35 years, performing a few procedures 1000 times or hundreds of procedures 10–20 times or having your name on several medical journal articles are just some of the ways surgeons are identified as ‘experts.’ You have a responsibility/obligation to your defense, after careful review of an expert’s opinion given during their deposition, to read, detail, take notes and discuss issues with your attorney. It is your opportunity to ‘build a case’ against the plaintiff and their experts; is there a conflict of interest with an expert, is the expert’s opinion based on their practice or data that is challengeable and/or questionable, do they actively practice in the area they are giving an opinion, that is, experience. Is their expert witness a professional expert, that is, someone whose major portion of income is derived from legal cases. These questions can be answered and used by your attorney to challenge the integrity of the qualifications of an expert against you. Remember, the expert is basing an opinion on what the medical record tells them; retrospective reviews have biases that real-time experience may not have (hence why you need to document well!)

### Conflict-of-interest policies for investigators in clinical trials [^8672677a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2000). Excellent credibility.

Background

There is substantial concern that financial conflicts of interest on the part of investigators conducting clinical trials may compromise the well-being of research subjects.

Methods

We analyzed policies governing conflicts of interest at the 10 medical schools in the United States that receive the largest amount of research funding from the National Institutes of Health. These institutions are Baylor College of Medicine, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, Harvard Medical School, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine, the University of Washington School of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine at St. Louis, and Yale University School of Medicine.

Results

All 10 universities required that faculty members disclose financial interests to university officials. Only four required disclosure by all members of the research staff. Five universities required disclosure of all financial interests, even though federal regulations specify a threshold for disclosure. Six universities required disclosure to the institutional review board as well as to a committee on conflicts of interest or a university official. Four universities had stricter requirements for investigators conducting clinical trials than required by federal regulations. One university prohibited investigators from having stock, stock options, consulting agreements, or decision-making positions involving a company that sponsored the research. A second university prohibited researchers from trading stock or stock options in a company that sponsored the research or sold the product or device under study. Two universities ordinarily did not allow faculty members to participate in clinical research if they had what federal regulations refer to as a "significant" financial interest in the company owning the product or device being studied, but exceptions were allowed.

Conclusions

Policies governing conflicts of interest at leading medical schools in the United States vary widely. We suggest that university-based investigators and research staff be prohibited from holding stock, stock options, or decision-making positions in a company that may reasonably appear to be affected by the results of their clinical research. Of the 10 medical schools we studied, only 1 had a policy that was close to this standard.

### Why not nephrology? A survey of US internal medicine subspecialty fellows [^ee826eb7]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Background

There is a decreased interest in nephrology such that the number of trainees likely will not meet the upcoming workforce demands posed by the projected number of patients with kidney disease. We conducted a survey of US internal medicine subspecialty fellows in fields other than nephrology to determine why they did not choose nephrology.

Methods

A web-based survey with multiple choice, yes/no, and open-ended questions was sent in summer 2011 to trainees reached through internal medicine subspecialty program directors.

Results

714 fellows responded to the survey (11% response rate). All non-nephrology internal medicine subspecialties were represented, and 90% of respondents were from university-based programs. Of the respondents, 31% indicated that nephrology was the most difficult physiology course taught in medical school, and 26% had considered nephrology as a career choice. Nearly one-fourth of the respondents said they would have considered nephrology if the field had higher income or the subject were taught well during medical school and residency training. The top reasons for not choosing nephrology were the belief that patients with end-stage renal disease were too complicated, the lack of a mentor, and that there were insufficient procedures in nephrology.

Conclusions

Most non-nephrology internal medicine subspecialty fellows never considered nephrology as a career choice. A significant proportion were dissuaded by factors such as the challenges of the patient population, lack of role models, lack of procedures, and perceived difficulty of the subject matter. Addressing these factors will require the concerted effort of nephrologists throughout the training community.

### Association of family medicine interest at matriculation to medical school and FMIG participation with eventual practice as a family physician [^89f42f0a]. Family Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

An adequate family medicine workforce is needed to improve health and health care outcomes in the United States, yet few medical students in the US become family physicians. Indicators of family medicine interest upon medical school matriculation exist. Family medicine interest groups (FMIGs) may influence student choice. This study examines the association of FMIG participation with various matriculation interest indicators to predict which students go on to become family physicians.

Methods

The American Medical Association Masterfile was used to identify the practice specialty of 601 graduates of the University of Washington School of Medicine who matriculated between 2003 and 2007. Graduates' scores on the Family Medicine Interest Survey (FMIS) and whether a student listed family medicine as their top choice upon matriculation along with FMIG participation and demographic characteristics were used in a binary logistic regression model to predict eventual practice. The model output was used to calculate odds ratios and predicted probabilities of family medicine practice given initial family medicine interest and FMIG participation.

Results

FMIG participation was associated with higher odds ratios and increased predicted probability of becoming a family physician regardless of initial interest although the magnitude of the difference varied. FMIG participants who listed family medicine as their top specialty had a 68% predicted probability of entering family medicine compared to 8% probability if they did not list family medicine first and did not participate in FMIG. FMIG participation was associated with odds ratios between 3.27-4.19 for entering family medicine regardless of FMIS score.

Conclusions

Among University of Washington students with family medicine as their top specialty choice upon matriculation, FMIG participation was associated with higher odds of entering the specialty. The same was true, although to a lesser degree, for students who had a high score on the FMIS.

### Specialising in radiology in Switzerland: still attractive for medical school graduates? [^619b88bd]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To gain insight into the professional characteristics of radiologists in Switzerland and to determine how to enhance the attractiveness of radiology to medical graduates as a specialty.

Materials and Methods

Data from 262 members of the Swiss Society of Radiology (m:f = 76:24%) obtained in a questionnaire survey were analysed regarding socio-demographic variables, working status, specialty, main fields of interest, career success, mentoring and reasons for the shortage of radiologists.

Results

35 (56.4%) female and 85 (45.5%) male radiologists were aged ≤ 45 years. 228 (87%) were board-certified; 44 (17.9%) had completed a sub-specialisation. Men worked part-time mostly just before retirement, while women worked part-time at a younger age. As reasons for specialty choice, the wide range of clinical work and the combination of technology and medicine were ranked highest. Women reported significantly less career success and support. To improve the attractiveness of radiology to graduates, radiology should be visible on medical school curricula.

Conclusion

In Switzerland, more female radiologists work part-time than male ones, and there is less career success and support for women. In order to make radiology more attractive to medical graduates as a specialty, structured residency programmes and reliable gender-respecting career support are needed.

### Eliminating race-based medicine [^ad5b0148]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Institutions—Institutions “should collaborate with learner-facing organizations such as the Accreditation Council on Continuing Medical Education, the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education, the Association of American Medical Colleges, the Association of Medical School Pediatric Department Chairs, the Association of Pediatric Program Directors,” and with “the Council on Medical Student Education in Pediatrics, the Latino Medical Student Association, and the Student National Medical Association to expose new and lifelong learners to health equity curricular content, including a specific focus on the elimination of race-based medicine,” and institutions “should collaborate with academic health systems, schools of medicine, and other higher education entities in support of the research and scholarship necessary to deconstruct race-based medicine and proactively reframe clinical decision-making tools using valid, evidence-informed measures that incorporate the social determinants of health.”

### Influences of medical school admissions practices on primary care career choice [^d8004fa2]. Family Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Medical schools should understand how to matriculate students who are more likely to enter primary care specialties and put admissions processes into place that achieve this result. However, there are no existing reviews that have systematically evaluated medical school admission practices and primary care specialty choice.

Methods

We conducted a narrative synthesis utilizing a systematic literature search to evaluate the effectiveness of medical school admission strategies designed to increase the percentage of graduates entering primary care specialties.

Results

We included 34 articles in the narrative review. Multiple prematriculation programs that appear to produce students with a high likelihood of entering primary care have been described in the literature. However, all of these studies are from single institutions, were observational, and limited by selection bias. Applicants who self-identify an interest in primary care, grew up with a rural background, and are older at matriculation are more likely to enter primary care, with stated interest in primary care being most predictive. Gender and race have been associated with primary care specialty choice in some studies, but not all. Insufficient literature on admissions policies and procedures exists to draw conclusions about best practices.

Conclusions

Medical schools that want to increase the percentage of graduates entering primary care should consider developing a prematriculation program that attracts and prepares motivated and talented students with primary care interest. Admissions committees should understand which demographic criteria are associated with increased likelihood of entering primary care. The most important identifiable trait is an applicant's stated interest in primary care.

### Approaches to ensure an equitable and fair admissions process for medical training [^eeac982e]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Additional important considerations

Whilst equity must be embedded in every aspect of admissions to effect meaningful change, siloed solutions rarely work. The many distinct ideas need to become a program of change.

Complex systems must work together. The challenges facing medical school admissions are systems problems that require systems thinking and adaptive change. We are encouraged that the medical education community, which operates in a highly complex ecosystem where there are often vast differences between schools, is already aware of the issue of diversity and equity in admissions. However, solutions to problems must recognize the complexity of the entirety of each medical school system to maximize the collective impact.

It is important to recognize that virtually all progress begins with leadership commitment. The most successful educational programs almost always have a community of many leaders working together and building a culture in which everyone assumes a role of responsibility. Leadership successes do not consist of many random acts, but rather organized individual efforts to work together to solve a problem. The Morehouse School of Medicine is one example of a medical education program that embodies distributed leadership with its supportive, relationship-focused environment, family atmosphere, high degree of faculty-student engagement, and community in which the learners assume leadership roles to be “agents of positive social change”.

It is also necessary to adopt data-informed practices that include continued review and assessment, as a lack of evaluation will ensure unproven and potentially ineffective practices are continued. Evidence-based identification of problems, proposing one or more solutions based on local data and existing research, implementing those solutions and gathering data and investigating changes are required. Simply put, if an admissions process is intended to help meet the institution’s mission and goals, then outcomes should come closer at each phase to achieve the desired goals. Instances in which there is little movement or, worse, further divergence, create an opportunity to understand why, try something different, and see what happens. Therefore, the iterative practice of thinking like scientists will help foster and sustain a culture of continuous improvement. Everyone, regardless of their role or comfort working with data, is capable of thinking like a scientist to rely on data-informed decisions that are transparent and equitable.

### Confronting zoonoses, linking human and veterinary medicine [^ea75cf5e]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

For veterinarian-scientists, the situation is considered dire. A 2004 National Academy of Sciences (NAS) report found that of American Veterinary Medical Association members, <1% were board certified in laboratory animal medicine and <2% were board certified in pathology. In addition, the total number of veterinarians who receive NIH grant funding is small. In 2001, only 4.7% of all NIH grants funded for animal research were awarded to veterinarian principal investigators.

Reasons for the lack of interest in research are similar for both medical and veterinary students: an emphasis on clinical care, educational debt, and a lack of mentors and research opportunities. Medical schools now emphasize primary care and care for the underserved, and while certainly important, this shift in priorities has been at the expense of encouraging biomedical research careers.

Veterinary schools have shifted their focus from comparative medicine research and livestock medicine to companion animal medicine to meet societal demand. However, similar to the situation with medical schools, this shift has caused fewer numbers of veterinary students to pursue research careers. In addition, comparative medicine programs have been shifting from a research to service orientation that limits veterinarians' research involvement to being primarily caretakers for laboratory animals. This shift in comparative medicine orientation has discouraged many veterinary students from pursuing careers in research and hinders research on emerging zoonoses from diverse animal hosts.

What can be done? Although NIH has begun a roadmap to improve biomedical research into the 21st century, nowhere does the plan mention comparative medicine and the importance of veterinary involvement, which would certainly fit into its goals of promoting interdisciplinary research and new pathways to discovery. An NAS report recognizes the need for the roadmap initiative to address this issue and recommends creating integrated veterinary research through joint interagency collaborative programs at NIH.

### Association of a health equity curriculum with medical students' knowledge of social determinants of health and confidence in working with underserved populations [^9b5b36af]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Results

Study Population Characteristics

A total of 314 students were included in this study (160 women [51.0%], 205 [65.3%] non-Hispanic White participants). Of the 246 students who received any part of the health equity curriculum, 125 from the pilot curriculum and 121 from the full curriculum completed at least 1 survey. In the pilot curriculum class, 118 of 125 (94.4%) completed the baseline survey, 117 of 125 (93.6%) completed the end-of-third-year survey, and 77 of 121 (63.6%) completed the graduation survey. In the full curriculum class, 116 of 121 (95.9%) completed the baseline survey, 93 of 121 (76.9%) completed the end-of-third-year survey, and 104 of 114 (91.2%) completed the graduation survey. A convenience sample of 68 of 107 students (63.6%) from the No curriculum class completed the survey at graduation. Overall, 141 respondents (44.9%) reported being interested in pursuing primary care (41 [60.3%] in the no curriculum group, 49 [39.2%] in the pilot group, and 51 [42.1%] in the full curriculum group) (Table 2). There were no significant differences in sex, race/ethnicity, prior experience, or career interest between the cohorts.

### Fundamental discussions on race and ethnicity for the cardiology workforce for the United States of America [^a458ed27]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Although there is merit to knowing that people who do well on standardized testing will likely continue to do well on standardized tests, there is no accounting for applicants' etiquette, endeavors, and the qualities that may enrich the field, such as intellectual curiosity, creativity, and analytic abilities. There are multiple references to protection of "academically qualified applicants" without any consideration that admission metrics of testing scores do not predict success of the physicians in the long‐term. When it comes to the use of Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) score for medical school admission, there has been little to prove long‐term success of physicians beyond success in further standardized tests. In fact, studies have shown long‐term success of applicants with varied MCAT score if proper environment and mentorship are provided.Moreover, the sources that are cited for MCAT score success are based on MCAT preparatory centers, such as Kaplan and Princeton Review, which have a huge financial interest in maintaining the importance of the continued standardized testing. Student Doctor Network is a questionable social media tool as well, which only mentioned 3 variables for medical school acceptance (namely, MCAT score, grade point average, and race). This is a simplistic view that completely dismisses applicants' research, volunteering efforts, unique backgrounds that could enrich the medical community, and quality of the personal statements that all schools require. Usually, the selection and interview process for any stage in medicine is much more complex than rationalizing it based solely on scores.

### Institutional strategies to boost medical school graduates entering family medicine [^c6b6613e]. Family Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

With a projected primary care physician shortage, efforts must be made to increase the number of students choosing family medicine. Studies have explored what might influence student choice of family medicine, though questions remain about the impact of medical school policies and processes, including for admissions, as well as longitudinal tracks. This study explores some of these structural and institutional factors and how they are associated with rates of students entering into family medicine in subsequent years.

Methods

Responses from a 2016 survey of family medicine department chairs were matched to 2017-2019 institutional family medicine graduate rates to compare the rates of students entering family medicine with (a) inclusion of primary care or family medicine in the medical school's mission statement; (b) perceived support of the dean's office in increasing family medicine teaching and leadership presence in the medical school curriculum; (c) whether the admissions committee had a charge to seek out applicants interested in primary care; and (d) the presence of Liaison Committee on Medical Education designated tracks in primary care/family medicine.

Results and Conclusions

Overall, schools whose admissions committees had a specific charge to seek out applicants interested in primary care were consistently more likely than their peer institutions to match more students into family medicine. Other institutional factors may play a role, particularly school mission statements and rural longitudinal tracks. The results of this study have helped to identify where departments of family medicine might focus institutional advocacy to support learners in choosing and subsequently matching into family medicine.

### Graduates of different UK medical schools show substantial differences in performance on MRCP (UK) part 1, part 2 and PACES examinations [^44380aab]. BMC Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Institutions can differ in the amount of 'value' that they add, an effect well known in secondary education. Training effects would predict that teaching and training in general medicine at some schools is a better preparation for MRCP(UK) than at others, perhaps because of differences in course emphasis or focus, so that candidates subsequently perform better at the MRCP(UK). If career preferences and pre-admission qualifications cannot explain all of the differences between medical schools, then a reasonable conclusion is that that medical schools also differ in the quality of their training in general medicine. Some schools may therefore be adding more value to their students than others, in relation to taking the MRCP(UK), even taking into account differences in pre-admission qualifications. However, it is of interest that none of the teaching-related measures in the Guardian compilations correlate with MRCP(UK) performance.

### Reflections: starting an otolaryngology medical student interest group [^2c880c9c]. Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

A decline in applicants for otolaryngology residency spots has been reported. Several possible factors include the lack of exposure to otolaryngology, the lack of role models, work-life balance, and the competitiveness of otolaryngology as a deterrent. Our institution started a medical student interest group to address several of these factors. Key stakeholders who were engaged in this process included medical students, otolaryngology residents, and faculty members. Sustainability of the interest group was investigated with funding and succession planning. Early exposure to otolaryngology through shadowing in the operating room and research projects were initiated with a database on a website. Logistics of starting a club and organizing a clinical skills session were discussed. Awareness of our specialty and branding of the interest group as otolaryngology versus ear, nose, and throat were debated. Starting a medical student interest group in otolaryngology may be an excellent way to foster interest in our specialty.

### Job satisfaction criteria to improve general practitioner recruitment: a Delphi consensus [^23037c13]. Family Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

4. Trying to be a person-centred doctor

The “ global ” approach, centred on the patient, “ induces satisfaction in the human relationships that make up the richness of the profession ” and is the key to a “ useful practice for the community.” It requires “ collaboration with other specialists and other health professionals.”

5. Involvement in the healthcare organization

The participants stated that GPs have an active role in the care system, not a “ simple operator ” position.

6. Benefiting from a well-managed practice

It is “ the essential prerequisite for responsible and fulfilling practice.” Some choose not to be subject to a hierarchical or institutional framework to feel “ free.” This work organization “ allows GPs to practise with an adaptable schedule, and to find a work-life balance.”

7. Being a teacher, a trainer

This factor demonstrates a certain unanimity. “ Students have a better understanding of the profession.” “ Sharing knowledge and know-how ” and “ patient-centred strategies and techniques ” are “ a priority if we want to recruit motivated young physicians.” This requires “ supervisor training.” It is rewarding for trainers to see graduate students starting a career as a GP after discovering the profession through internships at their practice. One expert said: “ How can you decide on a specialty if you can’t discover it? ” Students also value the internships where the “ training is one of the most appreciated and best rated among the graduate placements.” The family medicine internship enables aspects of the profession to be discovered which until then had not been covered by the hospital training. Being in contact with students “ leads to questions, training, and research in primary care, which is also an important factor for improving the speciality and providing an increased sense of competence.”

8. Efficient professional collaboration

A fair work environment, and good relationships within the practice and with external specialist colleagues are essential for job retention. Building a good professional network is also important. This can begin with internships as a student in the potential area where the student wants to work. Communication between primary care and hospitals is important for organizing patient care pathways and for practice efficiency. For this, meetings and training between different professionals is beneficial.

In the GP population, “Taking care of yourself as a person” and “Rich human relationships with patients” received the most points.

### Approaches to ensure an equitable and fair admissions process for medical training [^4ac587e1]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Importantly, equitable standards extend far beyond academic metrics and apply to all aspects of the application. For example, it may benefit applicants at large or less-well-resourced institutions to allow letters of recommendation not just from science faculty but from a work supervisor, the director of a volunteer organization, or the teaching assistant who led a smaller discussion section. Requirements for a certain number of volunteer hours may be challenging for students who are working to support themselves and their families. Flexibility in standards is beneficial to those who come from different backgrounds and have a less common route to medical school. Likewise, some applicants may have modest GPAs and MCAT scores but demonstrate promise by having overcome large obstacles or by appearing to be aligned with a given institution’s mission and curriculum. Adopting these changes, requires admissions committees to think flexibly and to be trained in new strategies for assessment.

Introduction

Developing curricula is an important topic at all levels of medical education, from teaching medical students and residents to developing ongoing professional education. Despite its importance, it is easy to slip into a pattern of ad hoc curriculum development with little attention to desired outcomes. To maximise the potential of any medical education initiatives, we present a systematic approach to developing and evaluating curricula. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to describe the curriculum development process over six steps: performing a needs assessment, determining content, writing goals and objectives, selecting the educational strategies, implementing the curriculum and finally, evaluating the curriculum.

It is time for medical schools to consider including content focused on ML and its applications as part of their curriculum. Medical students, residents, and fellows should have knowledge of ML and data science during their training period. This will only become a reality when medical schools begin to create curricular time for ML with an acknowledgment of the changes to come in healthcare, and there is no better time to do it than now.

### Scoping review of interventions and experiences increasing medical student interest in physical medicine and rehabilitation [^e3cc5c4b]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Increasing medical student exposure to physical medicine and rehabilitation is an important factor for future growth of the field. Therefore, it is important to determine which types of interventions during medical school have the greatest impact on medical students' decision to pursue a career in physical medicine and rehabilitation. The purpose of this study is to perform a scoping review of the current literature that has analyzed how different interventions and experiences impact medical school students' decision to pursue a career in physical medicine and rehabilitation. A systematic and comprehensive search strategy was implemented across five different journal databases and yielded 18 articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Most studies analyzing specific interventions looked only at presurvey and postsurvey comparisons of the immediate impact of the intervention on interest in physical medicine and rehabilitation, and few looked at longitudinal outcomes, such as match characteristics. The most frequently cited factor that was shown to positively impact interest in physical medicine and rehabilitation was early exposure. Participating in clinical rotations also had a positive impact but was most effective when combined with early exposure. This review highlights the need for national recommendations for integrating physical medicine and rehabilitation into all 4 yrs of medical education.

### Guidance for the better care of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^0736fdad]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The expert group considered six questions in relation to the effectiveness of drug treatment in COPD and assigned a priority to a range of outcomes that differed between the interventions. Thus, the risk of pneumonia was prioritized above efficacy outcomes for questions that related to corticosteroids, but it is not discussed in connection with long-acting bronchodilator therapy or opiate use to manage breathlessness. This suggests that prior knowledge of the field does influence the weighting given to particular outcomes. Clinical practice guidance needs to address people other than practicing clinicians with both patients and payers. The authors explain clearly the interests of these different stakeholders and use carefully nuanced language to support their conclusions and what these conclusions might mean to these interest groups. Whether people reading the summary of the document will take in these subtleties is unclear, and this would be a fertile area for further research. Understanding why guideline writers reached their conclusions is always interesting, and this is set out in the section on committee discussion, which, together with a series of research needs, accompanies each question.

### Driving factors to pursue endocrinology training fellowship: empirical survey data and future strategies [^7930bb19]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

There is a current and anticipated labor shortage of endocrinologists in the United States. Over the past decade, the number of applications to endocrinology fellowship programs has plateaued despite increased available positions, and interest in endocrinology has declined relative to other internal medicine subspecialty fields. The examination of driving factors for pursuit of endocrinology as a subspecialty career is needed.

Methods

A 12-question online survey was developed to identify the primary reasons for current endocrinology fellows/trainees to pursue the field. This survey was sent to 152 U.S. endocrinology fellowship program directors for completion by their fellows between July and August 2021.

Results

A total of 176 of 629 fellows (28.0%) completed the survey. The majority (57.4%) had decided to pursue endocrinology as a career during residency, while 27.3% had decided during medical school. The endocrinology rotation during residency was ranked by 79 fellows (44.9%) as the most influential factor, followed by having positive experiences with a clinical mentor (27.3%). Endocrinology exposure during medical school was sparse, with only 2.8% noting the availability of an endocrinology student interest group, while 59.7% reported inadequate endocrinology exposure during their medical school curriculum.

Conclusion

The majority of current endocrinology fellows/trainees report that exposure to the field during medical school was limited, and that their endocrinology elective and mentorship experiences during residency were the most influential factors for pursuing endocrinology as a subspecialty. Improved integration of endocrinology experiences between medical school and residency may enhance career interest in endocrinology.

### Pathway for a diverse and sustainable emergency medicine clinician-scientist workforce: recommendations from the 2024 SAEM consensus conference [^8d54bdfb]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

The third highest ranked strategy is EM research exposure in required or elective medical school EM curriculum and EM rotations. This could be as simple as one didactic session facilitated by a recorded national curriculum created by EM specialty societies. For programs with clinician–scientist faculty, sessions could be augmented by brief presentations of recent or ongoing local EM research projects. Institutions that do not have faculty clinician–scientists could partner with those that do and have those faculty provide virtual research presentations. Overall, this approach provides a structured opportunity for EM clinician–scientists to serve as role models and engage medical students in their work. A limitation of this approach is that many required and elective EM rotations occur in the later stages of medical school training after many students have already made their specialty decisions. Therefore, additional strategies aimed at earlier engagement with EM would be complementary.

Most of the remaining strategies focus on EM clinician–scientists engaging as mentors in existing undergraduate and medical student research training programs and infrastructures. At the national level, examples include the National Medical Fellowships‐Service‐Learning Programs (NMF) and the Leon Haley Bridges to EM Academy. NMF provides students opportunities to gain experience with enhancing the delivery of health care in areas of critical clinical/public health need. The goal of these programs is to enhance the delivery of healthcare in underserved communities and to provide learning opportunities for students from a range of backgrounds. The Haley Academy provides a 2‐week mentorship program for rising second‐year medical students to increase interest in EM. During the program, the students participate in didactics that focus on health care issues in a variety of communities, reducing health disparities among all populations, and applying to residency programs. Additionally, these students are exposed to academic/research careers as a potential career pathway in emergency medicine. The program is currently only able to host 12 participants annually.

### Activities performed by ASCO-sponsored oncology student interest groups in latin America: assessing members' preferences and leaders' challenges [^47f98f90]. JCO Global Oncology (2022). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

One hundred forty-two medical students from four OSIGs responded to the first survey, from 285 registered members of the five OSIGs that were invited to participate (response rate: 50%). Despite several attempts to contact the OSIG group of Universidad del Rosario—Colombia regarding their participation in this study, no answer was obtained from its group leaders. The university with the highest response rate was School of Medicine of National Autonomous University of Mexico having 30 of 49 members (61%) completing the survey, followed by UNMSM (25 of 45 [56%]), ITESM (58 of 119 [49%]), and Universidad Anahuac (29 of 72 [40%]). The median age of OSIG members was 21 years (interquartile range, 20-22), most were women (92 [65%]), and the majority were in the first 4 years of medical school (134 [94%]). Most OSIG members (87 [61%]) said their school offered activities/courses focused on oncology as part of their curricula, but only (49 [35%]) considered their school's training on basic oncology to be good or excellent. Sociodemographic characteristics and answers to these questions according to each university are shown in Table 1.

Sociodemographic Characteristics of Group Members According to Their University

Factors Influencing Interest in Oncology

OSIGs and their activities, being mentored by medical doctors specialists in oncology, and participating in courses focused on oncology were the three main factors that members associated with a moderate-to-high influence on medical students' interest in oncology (Fig 1). Moreover, when asked about the motivators for pursuing an oncology-related medical specialty, respondents answered: (1) it is interesting for doing research (93 [66%]), (2) it has an essential role in society (82 [64%]), (3) it is an attractive specialty (82 [58%]), (4) has scientific prestige (46 [32%]), and (5) it has an elevated social status (8 [6%]; Fig 2).

### Why continuing uncertainties are no reason to postpone challenge trials for coronavirus vaccines [^e07e045a]. Journal of Medical Ethics (2020). Medium credibility.

The (uncertain) risks of an S-CHI

In recent proposals, S-CHI participants would be competent adults. Risks would be minimised both by selecting participants to be young and in good health, and by providing them priority access to high-quality medical care during the trial.We follow several prominent sources in assessing the risks to such participants by reference to their age group’s infection fatality rate in the general population;under that approach, based on current evidence, and even before highly effective therapeutics are developed, overall mortality under these circumstances is expected to be lower than that of kidney donation,and far below 1% absolutely,and hence to be consistent with limits on individual risk. Furthermore, recent S-CHI proposals include additional risk minimisation measures, and enhanced consent processes aimed at maximally promoting participants’ understanding of these risks.

But commentators remain concerned. Christine Grady explains:

We don’t yet know why some people get sick and others don’t… There’s so much emerging information about this sort of clinical course of infection and also susceptibility to infection that it makes an assessment that it’s OK to subject a certain age group to risk a little bit too fast for me… I wouldn’t take [a S-CHI] off the table, but I certainly wouldn’t say we’re ready for it now.

National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) trialist Matthew Memoli warns, ‘Where you’re going to give somebody a virus on purpose, you really want to understand the disease so that you know that what you’re doing is a reasonable risk.’Holly Fernandez-Lynch adds: ‘The ethical issues become more challenging for emerging infectious diseases that are not yet fully understood and that lack effective treatments… it becomes much harder to minimize risks when you don’t totally understand disease impact or transmission and when there are no proven therapeutic interventions…’Kerry Bowman asks: ‘You have consent, but is it really well-informed? Do people fully understand? Because if we don’t understand the virus itself, I wonder about the quality of informed consent that you can ask of people.’

These commentators’ remarks are united in grounding concern about S-CHIs in the current uncertainty surrounding COVID-19 and its risks. Yet despite this common theme, they suggest several distinct potential arguments. Let us unbundle these arguments and address each.

### A call to restore your calling: self-care of the emergency physician in the face of life-changing stress-part 1 of 6 [^152fafaf]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Few practicing emergency physicians will avoid life-changing stressors such as a medical error, personal illness, malpractice litigation, or death of a patient. Many will be unprepared for the toll they will take on their lives. Some may ultimately experience burnout, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicidal ideation. Medical education, continuing education, and maintenance of certification programs do not teach physicians to recognize helplessness, moral distress, or maladaptive coping mechanisms in themselves. Academic physicians receive little instruction on how to teach trainees and medical students the art of thriving through life-changing stressors in their career paths. Most importantly, handling a life-changing stressor is that much more overwhelming today, as physicians struggle to meet the daily challenge of providing the best patient care in a business-modeled health care environment where profit-driven performance measures (eg, productivity tracking, patient reviews) can conflict with the quality of medical care they wish to provide.Using personal vignettes and with a focus on the emergency department setting, this 6-article series examines the impact life-changing stressors have on physicians, trainees, and medical students. The authors identify internal constraints that inhibit healthy coping and tools for individuals, training programs, and health care organizations to consider adopting, as they seek to increase physician satisfaction and retention. The reader will learn to recognize physician distress and acquire strategies for self-care and peer support. The series will highlight the concept that professional fulfillment requires ongoing attention and is a work in progress.

### Approaches to ensure an equitable and fair admissions process for medical training [^04381cb4]. Communications Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Concluding remarks

History has shown that one-size-fits-all assessments of applicants do not work. The 2023 SCOTUS decision confirmed there remains value in considering each applicant’s lived experience to help contextualize each applicant. However, holistic review in and of itself is not enough, it must be combined with equitable admissions standards and processes and targeted universal support for all learners. Despite virtually all medical schools using elements of holistic review, relatively little progress has been made in the United States in diversifying the workforce and achieving equitable health outcomes. We argue that to effect real and enduring change, medical schools must embed equity into every aspect of admissions and support of learners. Centering equity requires a collective impact community to help us learn together and accelerate the impact of solutions and change, and efforts at each medical school to develop and implement equitable strategies that make sense given their mission, goals, priorities and resources.

Although we focus on admissions into medical schools in the United States, some recommendations can be applied globally and to other health professions. The 2013 World Health Organization guidelines for transforming and scaling up health professions’ education recognized severe health workforce shortages worldwide and gave recommendations for alleviating this deficit. One key recommendation was for the broader health professions education enterprise to consider using targeted admissions policies in order to improve the socio-economic, ethnic, and geographical diversity of students, as presented here.

### Curriculum development: a how to primer [^eccb50a7]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Following a systematic approach to develop and evaluate curricula provides a structure to frame teaching and learning and in doing so makes this process accessible to all Family Medicine educators regardless of previous experience. The process may be applied to develop an entirely new curriculum or to modify an existing one. Curriculum development begins with conducting a needs assessment and developing a written rationale for the curriculum followed by determining and prioritising what content will be included in the curriculum. The third step is to clearly articulate the goals and write measurable objectives. Remaining goal oriented helps educators refrain from adding superfluous material. The fourth step is focused on how the curriculum will be delivered by selecting educational strategies. In the fifth step, educators determine what resources are needed on a practical level to implement the curriculum followed by the actual implementation. Finally, educators evaluate the curriculum and use those results to make changes.

The process we have presented encourages Family Medicine educators to systematically move through each step of curriculum development rather than take an ad hoc approach. By doing so, the educator becomes an expert in both their clinical subject and how best to educate learners in the topic. A structured approach helps ensure the work already being done can be shared widely through publication and presentation, if desired. Through the sharing of the curriculum development process, evaluation results or educational innovations with the broader scholarly community, Family Medicine educators and medical educators generally learn from one another’s experiences and the entire field is enriched.

### Pilot study assessing student interest in combined residency training pathways with radiation oncology [^6e1db7da]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Historically, graduate medical education (GME) in radiation oncology (RO), was once a component of training in general radiology. However, since 1974 therapeutic radiology (the original name for RO) split from diagnostic radiology and has had its own residency training program through the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and board certification process through the American Board of Radiology. This division was rationalized by the unique and dramatically different skill set that a radiation oncologist requires, including understanding the pathophysiology and patterns of spread for all human cancers, the biology and physics of radiation delivery, the proper integration of radiation with surgical and systemic treatments, and the management of short- and long-term effects of radiation.

RO is unique among cancer subspecialties in that students apply for it as a residency program during medical school, rather than as a fellowship program during residency, as is done for medical oncology, pediatric oncology, and all of the surgical oncologic subspecialties.Although some medical students may know that they want to pursue an oncologic subspecialty during medical school, it is likely that many solidify this interest through additional years of training and subspecialty rotations during their residency. In addition, RO content is not a required component of the preclinical or clinical curricula at most US medical schools, and it may be intimidating for most students to consider such a highly specialized area of medicine as RO, when their prior knowledge of it is often very limited at the time that they need to apply.Finally, not all medical schools have an associated RO department or residency program, and thus medical students might never have a reasonable opportunity to be exposed to the field. One potential solution to this problem is to develop alternative GME pathways into RO for students who discover RO later in their education, or who may not want to sacrifice a more general medical education to pursue it. The American Board of Internal Medicine has a track record of supporting these opportunities. For instance, among 23 combined pathways, 9 include a combination with internal medicine, and 32% of all residents in a combined pathway program (n = 1857/2251) are involved in a combination with internal medicine (IM). 7 The largest of these programs is IM-Pediatrics (n = 1501), followed by IM-Emergency Medicine (n = 148), and IM-Psychiatry (n = 116).An important benefit of these pathways includes enabling students to pursue 2 specialties that mutually benefit their career interests in a shorter duration of training than either program alone, by mutually granting credit in 2 related disciplines. Combining a more generalized field like IM with a highly specialized field like RO may also be perceived as valuable to students from diverse, marginalized, and/or underrepresented, backgrounds in medicine who have broader ambitions in a career trajectory that includes addressing health disparities locally or globally and/or have less awareness of RO early in medical school compared with their non UIM counterparts.Similarly, a combined pathway may appeal to students with career interests in diverse pathways, including administrative medicine, industry, or leadership in a cancer center or in government. However, the appeal of these potential alternative pathways in RO to students has not previously been assessed. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine students’ views on a combined pathway program between RO and IM, as well as other related medical specialties.
