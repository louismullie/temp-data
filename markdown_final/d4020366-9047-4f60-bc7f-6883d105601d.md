## Question

Inhaled albuterol for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether inhaled albuterol can be used for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and what the evidence and references show about this question. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about albuterol's mechanism and labeling to see if it has any antiarrhythmic properties. Then, I should verify what guideline-endorsed agents actually perform pharmacological cardioversion. Next, I should check if any evidence links albuterol to AF termination versus AF provocation. After that, I will analyze mechanistic plausibility and safety, integrate contemporary guideline recommendations, and finally outline safer, evidence-based alternatives for rhythm conversion and for treating bronchospasm in patients with AF.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and labeled indications of albuterol. Albuterol is a short-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist indicated for bronchospasm in asthma and COPD; it is not an antiarrhythmic and has no sodium or potassium channel–blocking properties associated with AF cardioversion, and its labeling highlights cardiovascular effects including tachycardia, palpitations, blood pressure changes, arrhythmias, and hypokalemia, with explicit caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders including cardiac arrhythmias, which makes me pause before considering any off-label arrhythmia use [^113MK7dL] [^114QdmqC] [^112QYRBD].

> Next, I should review what agents are actually recommended for pharmacological cardioversion of AF. Guideline-supported options are class Ic agents (flecainide, propafenone) in appropriate patients and class III agents (ibutilide, dofetilide, amiodarone), with procedural cardioversion prioritized when unstable; none of these recommendations list adrenergic bronchodilators, and there is emerging investigation of inhaled flecainide, not inhaled albuterol, for rapid conversion in recent-onset AF, which is an important distinction I need to keep in mind [^114C7n2g] [^115puGtm] [^115wfL9T] [^112zZHFi] [^113JyQEd] [^116SN75T].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should check whether any evidence supports albuterol for AF termination. I find no guideline, trial, or review endorsing albuterol for cardioversion, and if anything, labeling and case experience associate beta-agonists with tachyarrhythmias including AF, not AF termination; one recent case with AF and COPD describes albuterol exposure in the clinical course but not as a cardioversion therapy, which reinforces the absence of efficacy data and the concern for pro-arrhythmic potential rather than conversion benefit [^114C7n2g] [^115puGtm] [^114QdmqC] [^115UidUx] [^112fbg4n].

> I will now examine mechanistic plausibility. Pharmacologic conversion of AF typically leverages sodium channel blockade to suppress abnormal automaticity or potassium channel blockade to prolong atrial refractoriness; in contrast, beta2-stimulation increases intracellular cAMP, augments calcium currents, and can promote triggered activity, which is mechanistically pro-arrhythmic in atrial tissue, and albuterol's propensity to shift potassium intracellularly can precipitate hypokalemia and further increase arrhythmogenic risk, so on mechanistic grounds albuterol would be expected to worsen atrial arrhythmias rather than terminate them [^113MK7dL] [^112QYRBD].

> Let me integrate guideline recommendations to be sure I'm not overlooking a niche scenario. Contemporary ACC/AHA/HRS and ESC guidance delineate electrical cardioversion when unstable and list specific antiarrhythmic drugs for pharmacological conversion when stable; they do not include sympathomimetic bronchodilators in any cardioversion algorithm, and their rate and rhythm control sections repeatedly emphasize agents with proven antiarrhythmic effects and explicit safety frameworks, which indirectly argues against any role for albuterol in this setting [^114C7n2g] [^115puGtm] [^115wfL9T].

> Wait, I should double-check my safety conclusion wording. I initially thought "contraindicated", but the FDA labeling actually says "use with caution" in patients with cardiovascular disorders, including arrhythmias; that means it is not formally contraindicated, yet from a cardioversion standpoint it should still be avoided because there is no benefit and there is clear pro-adrenergic, pro-arrhythmic risk, especially via tachycardia and hypokalemia. For AF patients with concurrent bronchospasm, I should favor non-adrenergic options like inhaled anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium), consider ICS when appropriate, and if a beta-agonist is unavoidable, use the lowest effective dose with close monitoring for heart rate and potassium, recognizing this is a risk-mitigation step, not an endorsement for arrhythmia treatment [^113MK7dL] [^112QYRBD].

> Let me think about the evidence-based alternatives for cardioversion to give a complete, practical answer. In hemodynamically unstable AF, perform immediate synchronized electrical cardioversion; in stable recent-onset AF, consider pharmacologic cardioversion with class Ic agents if structurally suitable or with class III agents such as ibutilide or amiodarone depending on LV function and comorbidities, and adhere to anticoagulation protocols around cardioversion, including preprocedural anticoagulation or TEE-based strategies when AF duration is ≥ 48 hours or uncertain, and continuation of anticoagulation for at least four weeks afterward to reduce thromboembolic risk [^114C7n2g] [^115puGtm] [^1114beyh] [^114JeqJh] [^116ueM4P] [^1137Z9YZ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, is there any scenario where inhaled therapy is being explored for rhythm conversion that could be confused with albuterol. Yes, inhaled flecainide has early data showing rapid conversion in a subset of patients with recent-onset AF, but this is an antiarrhythmic delivered by the inhaled route and is not a beta-agonist; confusing the delivery route with the pharmacologic class would be a mistake, so I need to emphasize that the investigational inhaled antiarrhythmic is flecainide, not albuterol [^116SN75T].

> Final answer: Inhaled albuterol is not indicated, recommended, or evidence-supported for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation; it lacks antiarrhythmic mechanisms, carries pro-adrenergic and hypokalemia-related pro-arrhythmic risks, and is absent from all cardioversion algorithms in major guidelines, so clinicians should avoid using it for AF conversion and instead employ guideline-endorsed rhythm control agents or electrical cardioversion as clinically appropriate, while treating coexisting bronchospasm with non-adrenergic options when possible [^113MK7dL] [^114C7n2g] [^115puGtm].

Inhaled albuterol is **not effective for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation** and is not recommended by guidelines. It lacks antiarrhythmic properties, does not restore sinus rhythm, and **may worsen AF by increasing heart rate and causing hypokalemia** [^113MK7dL] [^114QdmqC]. Albuterol should be avoided in patients with AF unless needed for bronchodilation; instead, use **standard rhythm-control agents** (flecainide, propafenone, amiodarone, ibutilide, or electrical cardioversion) [^111pjzec] [^1137M2Xt].

---

## Pharmacological properties of albuterol

Albuterol is a selective **beta-2 adrenergic agonist** that causes bronchodilation via smooth muscle relaxation [^113MK7dL]. At higher doses, it can also stimulate beta-1 receptors — raising heart rate and myocardial contractility — and may cause **hypokalemia** through an intracellular potassium shift [^114QdmqC].

---

## Mechanism of action relevant to atrial fibrillation

AF is characterized by disorganized atrial electrical activity and rapid ventricular response. Effective cardioversion requires agents that prolong atrial refractoriness or slow conduction [^112zZHFi]. Albuterol **lacks these properties** and may increase sympathetic tone, which may exacerbate AF [^114QdmqC].

---

## Clinical evidence regarding albuterol and atrial fibrillation

There is **no clinical evidence** supporting albuterol for AF cardioversion. Albuterol may also worsen AF by increasing heart rate and causing hypokalemia, thereby promoting arrhythmias [^114QdmqC] [^113MK7dL].

---

## Current clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend albuterol for AF cardioversion**. Recommended pharmacological options include:

- **Class IC antiarrhythmics**: Flecainide, propafenone (for recent-onset AF without structural heart disease) [^111pjzec].
- **Class III antiarrhythmics**: Amiodarone, ibutilide (for patients with structural heart disease or heart failure).
- **Electrical cardioversion**: For hemodynamically unstable patients or when pharmacological cardioversion fails.

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

Albuterol use in patients with AF carries **significant risks**:

- **Increased heart rate**: May worsen AF symptoms and hemodynamics [^114QdmqC].
- **Hypokalemia**: Increases risk of arrhythmias [^113MK7dL].
- **Proarrhythmic potential**: May exacerbate existing arrhythmias [^112QYRBD].

## Comparison with standard pharmacological cardioversion agents

| **Agent** | **Mechanism** | **Efficacy** | **Safety** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Flecainide | Sodium channel blocker | High efficacy in recent-onset AF | Contraindicated in structural heart disease [^112zZHFi] |
| Propafenone | Sodium channel blocker | High efficacy in recent-onset AF | Contraindicated in structural heart disease [^112zZHFi] |
| Amiodarone | Potassium channel blocker | Effective in structural heart disease | - Delayed conversion <br/> - Multiple adverse effects [^114K7uPf] |
| Ibutilide | Potassium channel blocker | Effective in recent-onset AF | - Risk of QT prolongation <br/> - Torsades de pointes [^116ueM4P] |
| Albuterol | Beta-2 agonist | No evidence of efficacy | - Risk of increased heart rate <br/> - Hypokalemia |

---

## Clinical scenarios where albuterol might be considered

Albuterol may be used for bronchodilation in patients with concurrent asthma or COPD, but **not for AF cardioversion** [^114qfxNr]. If used, monitor closely for increased heart rate and hypokalemia [^114QdmqC].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Inhaled albuterol is **not effective for AF cardioversion** and is not guideline-recommended [^114C7n2g]. It may worsen AF by increasing heart rate and causing hypokalemia [^114QdmqC]. Use standard antiarrhythmic agents or electrical cardioversion for rhythm control, and reserve albuterol for bronchodilation when necessary, with careful monitoring [^1137M2Xt].

### Old and new antiarrhythmic drugs for converting and maintaining sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation: Comparative efficacy and results of trials [^112zZHFi]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

In managing atrial fibrillation (AF), the main therapeutic strategies include rate control, termination of the arrhythmia, and the prevention of recurrences and thromboembolic events. Safety and efficacy considerations are important in optimizing the choice of an antiarrhythmic drug for the treatment of AF. Recently approved antiarrhythmics, such as dofetilide, and promising investigational drugs, such as azimilide and dronedarone, may change the treatment landscape for AF.

For medical conversion of recent-onset AF, class IC antiarrhythmic drugs, administered as an oral bolus, have been demonstrated to be the most efficacious pharmacologic conversion agents. Intravenous ibutilide and oral dofetilide both have efficacies superior to placebo in controlled trials for converting persistent AF. Comparative trials in paroxysmal AF have demonstrated that flecainide, propafenone, quinidine, and sotalol are equally effective in preventing recurrences of AF. Amiodarone has been demonstrated to be more efficacious than propafenone or sotalol in the Canadian Trial of Atrial Fibrillation.

In persistent AF, twice-daily dofetilide has been shown to be as or more effective than low-dose sotalol given twice daily for the maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with AF. Trials have demonstrated that subjective adverse effects are less frequent with class IC drugs, sotalol, and dofetilide compared with such drugs as quinidine. In patients without structural heart disease, flecainide, propafenone, and D, L-sotalol are the initial drugs of choice, given their reasonable efficacy and low incidence of adverse effects.

### Albuterol [^113MK7dL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Albuterol, similar to all sympathomimetic amines, should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular disorders, especially those with coronary insufficiency, cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension. It should also be used cautiously in patients with convulsive disorders, hyperthyroidism, or diabetes mellitus, as well as in individuals who are unusually responsive to sympathomimetic amines. Clinically significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have been observed in individual patients and could be expected to occur in some after the use of any beta-adrenergic bronchodilator.

Large doses of intravenous albuterol have been reported to aggravate preexisting diabetes mellitus and ketoacidosis. As with other beta-agonists, albuterol may produce significant hypokalemia in some patients, possibly through intracellular shunting, which has the potential to produce adverse cardiovascular effects. The decrease is usually transient and does not require supplementation.

- **Information for patients**: The action of albuterol tablets may last up to 8 hours or longer. Albuterol tablets should not be taken more frequently than recommended. Do not increase the dose or frequency of albuterol tablets without consulting your physician. If you find that treatment with albuterol tablets becomes less effective for symptomatic relief, your symptoms get worse, and/or you need to take the product more frequently than usual, you should seek medical attention immediately. While you are taking albuterol tablets, other asthma medications and inhaled drugs should be taken only as directed by your physician. Common adverse effects include…

### Effect of electrical cardioversion on 1-year outcomes in patients with early recurrence after catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation [^112CcpU6]. Clinical Cardiology (2021). Low credibility.

The primary and secondary clinical outcomes were the one-year incidence of AF recurrence and rehospitalization after catheter ablation, respectively. In this study, AF recurrence was defined based on the symptoms reported by the patients or the record of AF/atrial flutter (AL)/atrial tachycardia (AT) documented on the Holter electrocardiography during the follow-up period. Patients who underwent repeated catheter ablation, surgical ablation, repeated ECV, or pharmacologic cardioversion due to AF/AL/AT during follow-up were also considered to have AF recurrence. ECV was deemed successful if sinus rhythms were continuously recorded for at least 1 hour after the shock. Pharmacologic cardioversion included oral or intravenous administration of AADs due to AF/AL/AT. Rehospitalization included hospitalization for all reasons except for repeat ECV.

A matched cohort was constructed between ECV patients and non-ECV patients. Each case of ECV was matched to three non-ECV patients by propensity score matching (PSM). The matched variables considered for the PS analysis were presented in Table 1. Continuous data were presented as mean ± standard deviation and analyzed by Student's t-test in normal distribution, or median (25–75th percentiles) analyzed by Wilcoxon rank sum test in non-normal distribution. Categorical data were presented as numbers and percentages (%), analyzed by the Chi square test. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to compare rates of AF recurrence and rehospitalization between groups, as well as calculate outcomes.

### Proventil HFA [^115UidUx]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2019). Low credibility.

Adverse reaction information concerning Proventil® HFA Inhalation Aerosol is derived from a 12-week, double-blind, double-dummy study. This study compared Proventil HFA Inhalation Aerosol, a CFC 11/12 propelled albuterol inhaler, and an HFA-134a placebo inhaler in 565 asthmatic patients. Overall, the incidence and nature of the adverse reactions reported for Proventil HFA Inhalation Aerosol were comparable to those for a CFC 11/12 propelled albuterol inhaler.

Adverse events reported by less than 3% of patients receiving Proventil HFA Inhalation Aerosol, occurring more frequently than in placebo patients, and potentially related to Proventil HFA Inhalation Aerosol include:

- **Neurological and muscular symptoms**: Dysphonia, ataxia, leg cramps, hyperkinesia, somnolence
- **Respiratory and chest-related symptoms**: Chest pain, tinnitus, palpitation
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Dry mouth, eructation, flatulence
- **Metabolic and endocrine symptoms**: Diabetes mellitus
- **Psychiatric symptoms**: Anxiety, depression
- **Other symptoms**: Increased sweating, edema, rigors, rash

Additionally, palpitation and dizziness have been observed with Proventil HFA Inhalation Aerosol.

Adverse events reported in a 4-week pediatric clinical trial comparing Proventil HFA Inhalation Aerosol and a CFC 11/12 propelled albuterol inhaler occurred at a low incidence rate and were similar to those observed in previous studies.

### What characterizes episodes of atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion? Experience from patients with an implantable atrial cardioverter [^114jwCzE]. American Heart Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Episodes of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation may cause disabling symptoms. Asymptomatic episodes, however, are more common than symptomatic ones. The aim of the study was to investigate whether episodes of atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion differ from those in which the patient does not seek this therapy.

- **Methods**: We studied 21 patients with atrial fibrillation treated with an implanted atrial cardioverter. The device displayed intracardiac electrograms from episodes of atrial fibrillation in which the patient received cardioversion and from episodes that did not lead to a hospital visit or cardioversion. The heart rate (mean, highest, and lowest) and the degree of ventricular interval irregularity were analyzed with these electrograms.

- **Results**: There were 132 episodes of atrial fibrillation available for analysis, of which 73 led to cardioversion and 58 did not. Episodes leading to hospital or clinic visits and therapy had a higher maximum ventricular rate (130 vs. 115/min, P = 0.0004) than episodes that did not cause the patients to seek therapy. This difference in heart rate was most prominent at the beginning of the episode but tended to become more similar during the episode. There were no differences in ventricular cycle length irregularity between the two types of episodes. Moreover, treated episodes also had a significantly longer duration (mean duration 33 vs. 9 hours, P = 0.002).

- **Conclusions**: Episodes of atrial fibrillation that cause the patient to seek cardioversion are characterized by higher maximum ventricular rates and longer durations.

### Strategies for optimizing efficacy of electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation [^114yjQ4t]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Direct Cardioversion (DCCV) is a cornerstone in the management of atrial fibrillation (AF) and is the quickest way to convert AF to sinus rhythm. Overall, the procedure is effective and safe, but the efficacy of DCCV can be reduced due to modifiable and non-modifiable patient characteristics or procedural factors. Additionally, inadequate preparation, such as a lack of QRS-synchronization or omitting preprocedural imaging of the left atrial appendage (LAA), could lead to significant harm.

This manuscript discusses a brief history of electrical cardioversion, the currently available cardioverter settings/configuration with the highest success rate, the common barriers to successful cardioversion, strategies to overcome these barriers, and suggested protocols to ensure a high level of patient safety.

### Cardioversion in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation: Observational study using prospectively collected registry data [^116DFXb1]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

After anticoagulation treatment for stroke prevention has been prescribed to appropriate patients (those with increased risk of stroke), there are two main treatment approaches for atrial fibrillation:

- **Restoration of sinus rhythm**: This can be achieved by direct or pharmacological cardioversion. Rhythm control can potentially relieve symptoms and prevent progression of atrial fibrillation and left atrial remodeling.

- **Rate control**: The alternative treatment is to allow atrial fibrillation to continue but to control the ventricular rate. Several randomized controlled trials have shown that this treatment strategy is non-inferior to rhythm control when considering endpoints such as stroke rates and mortality. Previous studies also indicate that rates of hospital admission for rate control are lower than those for rhythm control.

Guidelines in Europe and America support both strategies but stress the need for better knowledge about their efficacy and safety. However, the recently reported Early Treatment of Atrial Fibrillation for Stroke Prevention Trial (EAST-AFNET 4) showed that early rhythm control was superior to guideline-mandated management, which consisted largely of rate control until or unless symptoms became refractory.

The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD-AF (GARFIELD-AF) is a worldwide prospective study of adult patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The registry includes information on baseline patient characteristics, rate of interventions such as cardioversions, and clinical outcomes.

### Ventolinhfa [^114QdmqC]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Overdosage: The expected signs and symptoms of albuterol overdose are those of excessive beta-adrenergic stimulation and the exaggeration of its associated symptoms, such as:

- **Cardiovascular symptoms**: seizures, angina, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia with rates up to 200 beats/min, arrhythmias, palpitations
- **Neurological symptoms**: nervousness, headache, tremor, dizziness, fatigue, malaise, insomnia
- **Musculoskeletal symptoms**: muscle cramps
- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: dry mouth, nausea
- **Metabolic symptoms**: hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, metabolic acidosis

As with all inhaled sympathomimetic medications, cardiac arrest and even death may be associated with an overdose of VentolinHFA.

Treatment consists of the discontinuation of VentolinHFA along with appropriate symptomatic therapy. The judicious use of a cardioselective beta-receptor blocker may be considered; however, it is important to note that such medication can induce bronchospasm. There is insufficient evidence to ascertain whether dialysis is beneficial for VentolinHFA overdose.

### A perspective on rate control in the treatment of atrial fibrillation [^111bFAM9]. Clinical Cardiology (2004). Low credibility.

Until recently, the standard approach to therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF) was the restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm, known as rhythm control. This approach, although difficult to accomplish and associated with potential serious adverse effects of antiarrhythmic agents, was guided by the belief that rhythm control led to better survival, fewer symptoms, improved exercise tolerance, a lower risk of stroke, better quality of life, and the absence of a need for long-term anticoagulation. However, four clinical trials comparing rate control with rhythm control have failed to demonstrate these advantages, indicating that rate control should be considered a legitimate primary therapeutic option, particularly for patients at risk for stroke. The decision to pursue rate or rhythm control should be made on a case-by-case basis.

### 2023 ACC/AHA/ACCP/HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: A report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^115Z6nqd]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

The 2024 guidelines from the American College of Cardiology, American Heart Association, American College of Chest Physicians, and Heart Rhythm Society (ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS) provide specific recommendations for managing bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).

The primary recommendation for patients experiencing life-threatening bleeding while on dabigatran is to administer idarucizumab to rapidly reverse the anticoagulation effect.

If idarucizumab is unavailable, the guidelines suggest considering the administration of activated prothrombin complex concentrate to counter the anticoagulation effect of dabigatran.

### 2024 ESC guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation developed in collaboration with the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (EACTS) [^1166nw74]. European Heart Journal (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for atrial fibrillation, specifically with respect to rhythm control and electrical cardioversion, the EACTS/ESC 2024 guidelines recommend considering the repetition of transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) before cardioversion if a thrombus has been identified on initial imaging.

### Recognising and managing albuterol-induced lactic acidosis [^112fbg4n]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

A male in his 70s with a history of COPD, systolic congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus presented to the emergency department with a 3-day history of progressively worsening dyspnoea. He reported a productive cough, wheezing, and chest tightness, but denied fever, chills, weight loss, orthopnoea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, or chest pain. The patient had been using his albuterol/ipratropium combination inhaler with increasing frequency over the previous days, but his symptoms persisted. He had a 50-pack-year smoking history and was a smoker. He denied any alcohol or drug use. His home medications included as-needed albuterol/ipratropium, pantoprazole, losartan, metoprolol, torsemide, and warfarin.

On arrival, his vitals were as follows: the patient was afebrile with a heart rate of 112 beats per minute, a respiratory rate of 28 breaths per minute, a blood pressure of 128/80 mm Hg, and an oxygen saturation of 94% on 2 L of oxygen via nasal cannula. On physical examination, the patient was in mild respiratory distress, and lung auscultation revealed diffuse expiratory wheezing. Heart sounds were normal, and there was no lower extremity oedema.

### Maintenance of sinus rhythm with metoprolol CR initiated before cardioversion and repeated cardioversion of atrial fibrillation: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study [^1175YaAn]. European Heart Journal (2007). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to assess the effect of metoprolol in combination with repeated cardioversion on the maintenance of sinus rhythm (SR).

- **Methods and results**: Consecutive outpatients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) were randomized to treatment with metoprolol CR or placebo in a double-blind manner. The study treatment was started at least one week before direct current (DC) cardioversion. Patients were followed once a week during the first six weeks after cardioversion. In the case of relapse during this period, a second cardioversion was performed. The total treatment duration was six months. A total of 168 patients were randomized to receive metoprolol (n = 83) or placebo (n = 85). The dose of study treatment at cardioversion was 169 ± 47 mg in the metoprolol group and 180 ± 40 mg in the placebo group (P = 0.12). In intention-to-treat analysis, 46 patients (55%) in the metoprolol group and 34 patients (40%) in the placebo group had SR one week after cardioversion (P = 0.04), and 38 patients (46%) in the metoprolol group compared with 22 patients (26%) in the placebo group had SR after six months (P < 0.01).

- **Conclusion**: A treatment strategy of metoprolol CR started before cardioversion, combined with prompt second cardioversion in case of early relapse (1–6 weeks), significantly increases the proportion of patients in SR during six months of follow-up.

### The 2020 Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Rhythm Society comprehensive guidelines for the management of atrial fibrillation [^112XuvQr]. The Canadian Journal of Cardiology (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of atrial fibrillation, particularly in relation to rhythm control, the CCS/CHRS 2020 guidelines recommend offering a rhythm control strategy to patients with established atrial fibrillation who remain symptomatic despite rate control therapy, or when rate control therapy is unlikely to control symptoms. It is advisable to consider rhythm control over rate control for patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation.

### Assessment of rhythm and rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation [^111bjw4d]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2006). Low credibility.

A recent series of randomized prospective clinical trials compared rate control with rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and found no significant difference in primary outcomes between the two strategies. However, these trials lacked clear criteria for defining "successful" rate or rhythm control. Various measures have been used to gauge the success of antiarrhythmic drug therapy, including time to first recurrence of AF, any AF recurrence, AF burden, and a reduction in symptoms.

Determining the success of antiarrhythmic therapy can be relatively straightforward by using how patients feel during therapy as a key endpoint. Most patients are satisfied with a major reduction in symptomatic AF episodes and can live comfortably with occasional episodes of AF. For those who are bothered by even infrequent, brief AF episodes, a treatment regimen that eliminates nearly all AF recurrences is required, although often hard to achieve. Catheter ablation may be necessary to achieve a successful outcome in these patients. Suppression of AF in a patient at high risk of stroke does not, however, remove the need for concomitant warfarin therapy.

The endpoints of ventricular rate control are not clear, and the recently published rhythm versus rate control trials lacked standard criteria for judging acceptable rate control. One relatively simple method is to achieve a 24-hour heart rate that mimics expected normal sinus rhythm. It is important to achieve good rate control to minimize symptoms and the risk of tachycardia-mediated cardiomyopathy.

### Albuterol [^112QYRBD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Drug interactions**: The concomitant use of albuterol and other oral sympathomimetic agents is not recommended as such combined use may lead to deleterious cardiovascular effects. This recommendation does not preclude the judicious use of an aerosol bronchodilator of the adrenergic stimulant type in patients receiving albuterol. Such concomitant use should be individualized and not given on a routine basis. If regular coadministration is required, alternative therapy should be considered.

- **Monamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants**: Albuterol should be administered with extreme caution to patients being treated with monoamine oxidase inhibitors or tricyclic antidepressants, or within two weeks of discontinuation of such agents, because the action of albuterol on the vascular system may be potentiated.

- **Beta-blockers**: Beta-adrenergic receptor blocking agents not only block the pulmonary effect of beta-agonists, such as albuterol, but may produce severe bronchospasm in asthmatic patients. Therefore, patients with asthma should not normally be treated with beta-blockers. However, under certain circumstances, such as prophylaxis after myocardial infarction, there may be no acceptable alternatives to the use of beta-adrenergic blocking agents in patients with asthma. In this setting, cardioselective beta-blockers could be considered, although they should be administered with caution.

- **Diuretics**: The ECG changes and/or hypokalemia that may result from the administration of nonpotassium-sparing diuretics (such as loop or thiazide diuretics) can be acute.

### A comparison of rate control and rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113kJ4ki]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There are two approaches to the treatment of atrial fibrillation: one is cardioversion and treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm, and the other is the use of rate-controlling drugs, allowing atrial fibrillation to persist. In both approaches, the use of anticoagulant drugs is recommended.

- **Methods**: We conducted a randomized, multicenter comparison of these two treatment strategies in patients with atrial fibrillation and a high risk of stroke or death. The primary endpoint was overall mortality.

- **Results**: A total of 4060 patients (mean [± SD] age, 69.7 ± 9.0 years) were enrolled in the study; 70.8 percent had a history of hypertension, and 38.2 percent had coronary artery disease. Of the 3311 patients with echocardiograms, the left atrium was enlarged in 64.7 percent, and left ventricular function was depressed in 26.0 percent. There were 356 deaths among the patients assigned to rhythm-control therapy and 310 deaths among those assigned to rate-control therapy (mortality at five years, 23.8 percent and 21.3 percent, respectively; hazard ratio, 1.15 [95 percent confidence interval, 0.99 to 1.34]; P = 0.08). More patients in the rhythm-control group than in the rate-control group were hospitalized, and there were more adverse drug effects in the rhythm-control group as well. In both groups, the majority of strokes occurred after warfarin had been stopped or when the international normalized ratio was subtherapeutic.

- **Conclusions**: Management of atrial fibrillation with the rhythm-control strategy offers no survival advantage over the rate-control strategy.

### Is emergency department cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation safe and effective [^115KVxuq]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a very common dysrhythmia presenting to emergency departments (EDs). Controversy exists regarding the optimal clinical therapy for these patients, which typically focuses on rhythm rate-control and admission or cardioversion and discharge home.

- **Clinical question**: Is ED cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation safe, effective, and does it result in positive meaningful patient outcomes?

- **Evidence review**: Five observation studies with nearly 1600 ED patients with atrial fibrillation treated with either rate-control or cardioversion were reviewed and results compiled.

- **Results**: Overall, ED cardioversion for recent-onset AF seems safe and effective, with success rates ranging from 85.5% to 97% in these studies. Although further research should seek to identify patients at low risk for thromboembolic complication, more rigorously assess patient satisfaction, and show cost savings, emergency physicians should feel comfortable using this approach in select patients.

- **Conclusion**: ED cardioversion for recent-onset AF seems safe and effective.

### Rhythm versus rate control trials in atrial fibrillation [^116sBWFF]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

The recent completion of five trials comparing the strategy of rhythm control versus the strategy of rate control in the management of atrial fibrillation has significantly advanced our understanding of the treatment of this common clinical problem. The background to this research question is outlined, followed by an overview of the five trials and their results. Data on important clinical events from four of the trials are pooled and presented. The aggregate results of the trials do not demonstrate any clear advantage of the rhythm control approach. The findings elevate rate control to the position of an acceptable primary therapy in the types of patients studied and underline the concept that the primary goal of antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation at this time is control of symptoms. Under these circumstances, a "safety first" approach is prudent, and monitoring for adverse drug effects is mandatory. The results underscore the importance of continuous anticoagulation in patients with stroke risk factors. Finally, the results from these trials help to set the agenda for future research on rhythm management in atrial fibrillation.

### Antiarrhythmics for maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation [^112KJifn]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most frequent sustained arrhythmia, frequently recurring after restoration of normal sinus rhythm. Antiarrhythmic drugs have been widely used to prevent recurrence, but the effect of these drugs on mortality and other clinical outcomes is unclear. This is an update of a review previously published in 2008 and 2012.

- **Objectives**: To determine, in patients who have recovered sinus rhythm after having atrial fibrillation, the effects of long-term treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs on death, stroke, embolism, drug adverse effects, and recurrence of atrial fibrillation.

- **Search methods**: We updated the searches of CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library (2013, Issue 12 of 12), MEDLINE (to January 2014), and EMBASE (to January 2014). The reference lists of retrieved articles, recent reviews, and meta-analyses were checked.

- **Selection criteria**: Two independent authors selected randomized controlled trials comparing any antiarrhythmic drug with a control (no treatment, placebo, drugs for rate control) or with another antiarrhythmic drug in adults who had atrial fibrillation and in whom sinus rhythm was restored. Post-operative atrial fibrillation was excluded.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. Studies were pooled, if appropriate, using Peto odds ratio (OR). All results were calculated at one year of follow-up.

- **Main results**: In this update, three new studies with 534 patients were included, making a total of 59 included studies comprising 21,305 patients.

### Pharmacologic conversion of atrial fibrillation: A systematic review of available evidence [^113JyQEd]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

This report reviews the efficacy of currently available antiarrhythmic agents for the conversion of atrial fibrillation (AF) to normal sinus rhythm (NSR). A systematic search of English-language literature was conducted using computerized databases such as MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Contents. The search also included manual searching of reference lists and contact with expert informants. Published studies involving humans that described the use of antiarrhythmic therapy for conversion of AF to NSR were considered, and only studies examining agents currently available in the United States were included. Studies focusing exclusively on antiarrhythmic therapy for the conversion of postsurgical AF were excluded.

The methodology and results of each trial were assessed, with attempts to acquire additional information from investigators as needed. Assessment of methodological quality was incorporated into a levels-of-evidence scheme. Eighty-eight trials were included, of which 34 (39%) included a placebo group (level I data).

- **Efficacy of antiarrhythmic agents**: We found that in recent-onset AF of less than 7 days, intravenous (i.v.) procainamide, high-dose i.v. or high-dose combination i.v. and oral amiodarone, oral quinidine, oral flecainide, oral propafenone, and high-dose oral amiodarone are more effective than placebo for converting AF to NSR. In recent-onset AF of less than 90 days, i.v. ibutilide is more effective than placebo and i.v. procainamide. In chronic AF, oral dofetilide converts AF to NSR within 72 hours, and oral propafenone and amiodarone are effective after 30 days of therapy.

The report concludes with evidence suggesting the relative efficacy of specific antiarrhythmic agents in different durations of AF.

### Selection of drugs in pursuit of a rhythm control strategy [^111KZeoc]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

A rhythm control strategy based on a combination of antiarrhythmic drugs and electrical cardioversion(s) has emerged as a viable alternative for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. This is particularly the case when the arrhythmia is associated with symptoms that may be poorly tolerated or with congestive heart failure. Several classes of antiarrhythmic drugs are available to restore sinus rhythm by chemical cardioversion and to help maintain it once it has been achieved.

In our discussion, we will detail aspects of their efficacy and safety and attempt to outline a pragmatic clinical approach to their use. Some newer drugs are currently under investigation and hold promise for improved efficacy and/or a more favorable side effect profile, which will be mentioned in this article.

### Antiarrhythmics for maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of atrial fibrillation [^111BE3yT]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most frequent sustained arrhythmia, and it often recurs after the restoration of normal sinus rhythm. Antiarrhythmic drugs have been widely used to prevent recurrence. This is an update of a review previously published in 2006, 2012, and 2015.

- **Objectives**: To determine the effects of long-term treatment with antiarrhythmic drugs on death, stroke, drug adverse effects, and recurrence of atrial fibrillation in people who had recovered sinus rhythm after having atrial fibrillation.

- **Search methods**: We updated the searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase in January 2019, and ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP in February 2019. We checked the reference lists of retrieved articles, recent reviews, and meta-analyses.

- **Selection criteria**: Two authors independently selected randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any antiarrhythmic drug with a control (no treatment, placebo, drugs for rate control) or with another antiarrhythmic drug in adults who had atrial fibrillation and in whom sinus rhythm was restored, spontaneously or by any intervention. We excluded postoperative atrial fibrillation.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed quality and extracted data. We pooled studies, if appropriate, using Mantel-Haenszel risk ratios (RR), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). All results were calculated at one year of follow-up or the nearest time point.

- **Main results**: This update included one new study (100 participants) and excluded one previously included study because of double publication. Finally, we included 59 studies.

### Pharmacological cardioversion for atrial fibrillation and flutter [^112EyzHx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac dysrhythmia, associated with significant morbidity and mortality. There are two approaches to managing atrial fibrillation: controlling the ventricular rate or converting to sinus rhythm, with the expectation that this would abolish its adverse effects.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in adults on the annual risk of stroke, peripheral embolism, and mortality.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Issue 3, 2002), MEDLINE (2000 to 2002), EMBASE (1998 to 2002), CINAHL (1982 to 2002), and Web of Science (1981 to 2002). We hand-searched the following journals: Circulation (1997 to 2002), Heart (1997 to 2002), European Heart Journal (1997 to 2002), and Journal of the American College of Cardiology (1997 to 2002). We also selected abstracts published on the website of the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (2001, 2002).

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials or controlled clinical trials of pharmacological cardioversion versus rate control in adults (> 18 years) with acute, paroxysmal, or sustained atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, of any duration and any aetiology.

- **Data collection and analysis**: One reviewer applied the inclusion criteria and extracted the data. Trial quality was assessed and the data were entered into RevMan.

- **Main results**: We identified two completed studies: AFFIRM (n = 4060) and PIAF (n = 252). We found no difference in mortality between rhythm control and rate control, with a relative risk of 1.14.

### Cardioversion in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation: Observational study using prospectively collected registry data [^1139n1hJ]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

In this study of a large sample of patients with recent onset atrial fibrillation who were followed up for two years, a small number received cardioversion at baseline. Importantly, we found that patients treated with baseline cardioversion appeared to have a significantly lower mortality risk during follow-up, after adjustment for known confounders (event rates per 100 patient years: 2.52 vs. 3.87, weighted hazard ratio: 0.75, 95% confidence interval: 0.67 to 0.85, P < 0.001). Our analyses show that most patients treated with cardioversion receive a direct approach. Event rates for all-cause mortality in these patients, given differences in baseline risk, appear similar to those for patients who received pharmacological cardioversion.

Of the 44,201 patients included in the analysis of cardioversion versus no cardioversion at baseline, an attempt was made to restore sinus rhythm in only 14.9%. Given that the study population consisted of patients with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation, this number seems low. Studies suggest that recent onset atrial fibrillation responds favorably to rhythm control because a longer duration of atrial fibrillation could make cardioversion less likely to succeed. Additionally, patients may experience symptom relief after rhythm control even when not obviously symptomatic before cardioversion. Therefore, international guidelines suggest a rhythm control strategy should be considered with the aim of reducing atrial fibrillation-related symptoms and improving quality of life.

### Open-label, multicenter study of flecainide acetate oral inhalation solution for acute conversion of recent-onset, symptomatic atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm [^116SN75T]. Circulation. Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2022).

Oral and intravenous flecainide is recommended for cardioversion of atrial fibrillation. In this open-label, dose-escalation study, the feasibility of delivering flecainide via oral inhalation (flecainide acetate inhalation solution) for acute conversion was evaluated. We hypothesized that flecainide delivered by oral inhalation would quickly reach plasma concentrations sufficient to restore sinus rhythm in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods**: Patients (n = 101) with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (for ≤ 48 hours) self-administered flecainide acetate inhalation solution using a nebulizer (30 mg [n = 10], 60 mg [n = 22], 90 mg [n = 21], 120 mg [n = 19], and 120 mg in a formulation containing saccharin [n = 29]). Electrocardiograms and flecainide plasma concentrations were obtained, cardiac rhythm was monitored using a 4-hour Holter, and adverse events were recorded.

- **Results**: Conversion rates increased with dose and with the maximum plasma concentrations of flecainide. At the highest dose, 48% of patients converted to sinus rhythm within 90 minutes from the start of inhalation. Among patients who achieved a maximum plasma concentration > 200 ng/mL, the conversion rate within 90 minutes was 50%; for those who achieved a maximum plasma concentration < 200 ng/mL, it was 24%. Conversion was rapid, with a median time to conversion of 8.1 minutes from the end of inhalation, and conversion led to symptom resolution in 86% of the responders. Adverse events were typically mild and transient and included cough, throat pain, and throat irritation.

### Cardioversion in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation: Observational study using prospectively collected registry data [^116hWz9T]. BMJ (2021). Low credibility.

The objective of the study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent cardioversion compared to those who did not have cardioversion in a large dataset of patients with recent onset non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

- **Design**: Observational study using prospectively collected registry data (Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD-AF-GARFIELD-AF).

- **Setting**: 1317 participating sites in 35 countries.

- **Participants**: 52,057 patients aged 18 years and older with newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation (up to six weeks' duration) and at least one investigator-determined stroke risk factor.

- **Main outcome measures**: Comparisons were made between patients who received cardioversion and those who had no cardioversion at baseline, and between patients who received direct cardioversion and those who had pharmacological cardioversion. Overlap propensity weighting with Cox proportional hazards models was used to evaluate the effect of cardioversion on clinical endpoints (all-cause mortality, non-hemorrhagic stroke or systemic embolism, and major bleeding), adjusting for baseline risk and patient selection.

Results showed that 44,201 patients were included in the analysis comparing cardioversion and no cardioversion, and of these, 6,595 (14.9%) underwent cardioversion at baseline. The propensity score-weighted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality in the cardioversion group was 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.63 to 0.86) from baseline to one year follow-up and 0.77 (0.64 to 0.93) from one year to two year follow-up.

### Success of serial external electrical cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation in maintaining sinus rhythm; a randomized study [^114piPuu]. European Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

The aim of this prospective, randomized study was to determine the efficacy of a serial external electrical cardioversion strategy in maintaining sinus rhythm after 12 months in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation.

- **Methods and results**: Ninety patients with persistent atrial fibrillation lasting more than 72 hours but less than 1 year were randomized in a one-to-one fashion to repetition of up to two electrical cardioversions in the event of relapse of atrial fibrillation detected within 1 month of the previous electrical cardioversion (Group AGG), or to non-treatment of atrial fibrillation relapse (Group CTL). ECGs were scheduled at 6 hours, 7 days, and 1 month. Clinical examination and ECGs were repeated during the 6-month and 12-month follow-up examinations. Echocardiography was repeated during the 6-month follow-up examination. Clinical and echocardiographic characteristics were similar in the two groups. All patients were treated with antiarrhythmic drugs before electrical cardioversion and throughout follow-up. After 12 months, sinus rhythm was maintained in 53% of Group AGG patients and in 29% of Group CTL patients (P < 0.03). After 6 months, left ventricular ejection fraction had recovered significantly only in Group AGG (56.8 ± 9.0% at enrollment vs. 60.4 ± 9.4% at 6 months, P < 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: These results demonstrate that an aggressive policy towards persistent atrial fibrillation by means of repetition of electrical cardioversion after early atrial fibrillation recurrence is useful in maintaining sinus rhythm after 12 months.

### Rate control versus rhythm control in atrial fibrillation: Lessons learned from clinical trials of atrial fibrillation [^111yoNhZ]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Ample evidence supports the statement that in patients with atrial fibrillation in whom treatment is warranted, either rhythm control or rate control are acceptable primary therapeutic options. If a rhythm control strategy is chosen, it is important to consider that recurrence of atrial fibrillation is not treatment failure per se. Occasional recurrence, with cardioversion if necessary, may be quite acceptable. The latter will depend on the frequency, duration, and symptoms associated with recurrence, and may require a change in the rhythm control therapy, e.g. change the antiarrhythmic drug or initiate or redo atrial fibrillation ablation. A rhythm control strategy should also include careful attention to and treatment of comorbidities such as hypertension, heart failure, and diabetes.

If a rate control strategy is chosen, treatment with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker is almost always required to achieve adequate rate control. Digoxin is often useful to obtain satisfactory rate control in combination with a beta blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It may be useful as primary therapy in the presence of hypotension or heart failure. Satisfactory ventricular rate control is usually a resting rate of less than 110 beats per minute, although resting rates below 90 beats per minute are probably wiser. Finally, when pursuing a rhythm control strategy, because recurrence of atrial fibrillation is common, rate control therapy should be a part of the treatment regimen.

### Multicenter, phase 2, randomized controlled study of the efficacy and safety of etripamil nasal spray for the acute reduction of rapid ventricular rate in patients with symptomatic atrial fibrillation (ReVeRA-201) [^114jAuLb]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2023). High credibility.

A total of 87 patients were screened, with 69 randomized and 56 receiving the study drug. No patients were lost to follow-up. Thirteen randomized patients were not included in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population as they were no longer eligible to receive the study drug. Reasons included a baseline heart rate of less than 110 bpm (n = 5), conversion to sinus rhythm (n = 3), hemodynamic instability (n = 1), technical issues with the ECG cardiac monitoring device (n = 3), and site misinterpretation of the protocol (n = 1). These reasons for exclusion were independent of the treatment assigned, which was blinded at the time of the decision.

Of the 56 patients in the mITT population, 27 received etripamil and 29 received placebo. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between the treatment groups. The median age was 64 years (range, 45–88) in the etripamil group and 66 years (range, 35–83) in the placebo group. Thirty-nine percent of participants were female, and 75%, 18%, and 7% of participants had a history of paroxysmal, persistent, and permanent atrial fibrillation, respectively. There was minimal imbalance in the pre-enrollment use of oral β-blockers and antiarrhythmic drugs between the etripamil and placebo groups.

### Amiodarone versus placebo and class Ic drugs for cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation: a meta-analysis [^114K7uPf]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2003). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis compared amiodarone with placebo and class Ic drugs for the cardioversion of recent-onset atrial fibrillation (AF), which is defined as lasting less than seven days. Despite the lack of trials that convincingly support its efficacy, amiodarone is widely used for conversion of recent-onset AF.

- **Methods**: We searched Medline and EMBASE databases, as well as the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, for randomized trials on recent-onset AF comparing amiodarone to placebo or class Ic drugs. Data were combined according to a fixed effect model. The primary endpoint was the rate of conversion at 24 hours. To study the time-dependency of the drugs, efficacy at 1 to 2 hours, 3 to 5 hours, 6 to 8 hours, and at 24 hours was analyzed.

- **Results**: We found six studies randomizing amiodarone versus placebo (595 patients) and seven studies versus class Ic drugs (579 patients). There was no significant difference between amiodarone and placebo at 1 to 2 hours, but significant efficacy was found after 6 to 8 hours (relative risk [RR] 1.23, p = 0.022) and at 24 hours (RR 1.44, p < 0.001). Efficacy with amiodarone was inferior to class Ic drugs for up to 8 hours (RR 0.67, p < 0.001), but no difference was seen at 24 hours (RR 0.95, p = 0.50). There were no major adverse effects.

- **Conclusions**: Amiodarone is superior to placebo for cardioversion of AF, and even though the onset of conversion is delayed, its efficacy is similar at 24 hours compared with class Ic drugs. These results favor amiodarone as a reasonable alternative for patients with recent AF in whom class Ic and other, more rapidly acting antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated or not desired.
