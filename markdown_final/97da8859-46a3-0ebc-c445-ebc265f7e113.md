## Question

Which of the following inborn errors of metabolism gives rise to zinc deficiency?

Answer Choices:
A. Acrodermatitis enteropathica
B. Wilson's disease
C. Menkes disease
D. Haemochromatosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which inborn error of metabolism causes zinc deficiency among the listed options. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which entities on the list are truly inborn errors of metabolism. Then, I should verify the pathophysiology of each candidate, especially whether it directly impairs zinc absorption or handling. Next, I will check for any confounders where zinc deficiency might be secondary rather than primary. Finally, I will confirm the correct answer and briefly explain why the others do not fit mechanistically.

> Let me first confirm the candidates. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a classic inborn error of zinc metabolism, Wilson disease is an inborn error of copper metabolism, Menkes disease is an inborn error of copper metabolism, and hereditary hemochromatosis is an inborn error of iron metabolism, so all four are IEMs but only one is primarily a zinc disorder [^c02ea757] [^42f6e99d] [^721ba51f].

> Now, I will examine acrodermatitis enteropathica. Wait, let me verify the genetics and mechanism. AE is an autosomal recessive disorder due to SLC39A4 mutations encoding the ZIP4 intestinal zinc transporter, which impairs zinc absorption and causes profound zinc deficiency with periorificial dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhea; zinc supplementation reverses the phenotype, confirming the primary zinc defect [^c02ea757] [^bcfdfa17] [^e1f086be].

> Next, I should review Wilson disease. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. Wilson disease is a copper overload disorder from ATP7B mutations; zinc therapy is used to block copper absorption via enterocyte metallothionein induction, and prolonged high-dose zinc can rarely cause copper deficiency, but the primary defect is copper accumulation, not zinc deficiency, so Wilson disease does not cause zinc deficiency as its pathophysiology [^42f6e99d] [^9260d36f] [^7c2366b6].

> I will now examine Menkes disease. Let me think about this carefully. Menkes is an X-linked recessive copper deficiency disorder from ATP7A mutations, leading to low serum copper and ceruloplasmin; it is a copper transport defect, not a zinc disorder, so it does not cause zinc deficiency as the primary metabolic lesion [^721ba51f].

> For hemochromatosis, I should confirm the metal involved. Hereditary hemochromatosis is an iron overload disorder due to HFE-related dysregulation of iron homeostasis; it does not directly impair zinc absorption or transport, so it is not a cause of zinc deficiency [^notfound].

> But wait, what if the question is trying to trick me with secondary zinc deficiency in other IEMs. Let me reconsider. Some organic acidemias and other IEMs can produce acrodermatitis enteropathica–like rashes in the setting of amino acid deficiencies, and serum zinc may even be normal, which is a different entity often termed acrodermatitis dysmetabolica; that is not a primary zinc transporter defect like AE, so it does not change the answer here [^167a6419] [^6cb6a61d].

> Putting this together, the only inborn error on the list that directly causes zinc deficiency is acrodermatitis enteropathica due to impaired intestinal zinc absorption from SLC39A4 mutations, whereas Wilson disease, Menkes disease, and hemochromatosis are disorders of copper or iron metabolism that do not primarily cause zinc deficiency [^c02ea757] [^42f6e99d] [^721ba51f].

> Final answer: A. Acrodermatitis enteropathica.

---

The correct answer is **A. Acrodermatitis enteropathica**. This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in **SLC39A4**, which encodes the ZIP4 zinc transporter, leading to impaired intestinal zinc absorption and severe zinc deficiency [^c02ea757] [^bcfdfa17]. The classic triad includes periorificial and acral dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhea, and symptoms resolve with zinc supplementation [^e1f086be]. Wilson's disease (copper overload), Menkes disease (copper deficiency), and hemochromatosis (iron overload) do not cause primary zinc deficiency.

---

## Pathophysiology of acrodermatitis enteropathica

- **Genetic defect**: Mutations in SLC39A4 cause defective ZIP4, impairing zinc absorption across the intestinal mucosa [^c02ea757] [^bcfdfa17].
- **Clinical manifestations**: Zinc deficiency causes dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, growth failure, immune dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric symptoms [^e1f086be] [^68d0dae8].
- **Treatment**: Lifelong zinc supplementation reverses symptoms and prevents complications [^e1f086be] [^c02ea757].

## Clinical features of acrodermatitis enteropathica

| **System** | **Clinical manifestations** |
|-|-|
| Dermatologic | - Periorificial and acral dermatitis <br/> - Alopecia <br/> - Nail dystrophy <br/> - Poor wound healing [^e1f086be] [^c02ea757] |
| Gastrointestinal | - Diarrhea <br/> - Malabsorption <br/> - Growth failure [^e1f086be] [^c02ea757] |
| Immunologic | - Increased susceptibility to infections <br/> - Impaired immune function [^35381c3a] [^68d0dae8] |
| Neurologic | - Irritability <br/> - Depression <br/> - Cognitive impairment <br/> - Seizures (rare) [^e1f086be] [^68d0dae8] |

---

## Diagnosis and management

Diagnosis is based on **clinical features**, low serum zinc, and genetic testing for SLC39A4 mutations [^c02ea757] [^bcfdfa17]. Management is lifelong **zinc supplementation** at 1–3 mg/kg/day in divided doses, with regular monitoring of zinc levels and clinical response [^e1f086be] [^d6a1315e].

---

## Comparison with other inborn errors of metabolism

- **Wilson's disease**: Copper overload from ATP7B mutations; zinc is used therapeutically to block copper absorption, not because of zinc deficiency [^42f6e99d] [^9260d36f].
- **Menkes disease**: Copper deficiency from ATP7A mutations; does not cause zinc deficiency [^721ba51f].
- **Hemochromatosis**: Iron overload from HFE mutations; does not cause zinc deficiency [^notfound].

---

Acrodermatitis enteropathica is the **only inborn error of metabolism among the options that directly causes zinc deficiency** through impaired intestinal absorption, and it is effectively treated with zinc supplementation [^c02ea757] [^e1f086be].

### Established and emerging treatments for patients with inborn errors of metabolism [^725023a0]. NeoReviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are inherited defects in a metabolic pathway resulting in clinical disease. The overall goal of therapy is to restore metabolic homeostasis while minimizing the deleterious effects of the interruption. Conventional treatments focus on decreasing substrate, providing product, and replacing deficient enzyme or cofactor. We discuss examples of established, novel, and emerging therapies to provide a framework for understanding the principles of management for patients with IEMs.

Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) include many disorders for which current treatments aim to ameliorate disease manifestations, but are not curative. Advances in the field of genome editing have recently resulted in the in vivo correction of murine models of IEM. Site-specific endonucleases, such as zinc-finger nucleases and the CRISPR/Cas9 system, in combination with delivery vectors engineered to target disease tissue, have enabled correction of mutations in disease models of hemophilia B, hereditary tyrosinemia type I, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, and lysosomal storage disorders. These in vivo gene correction studies, as well as an overview of genome editing and future directions for the field, are reviewed and discussed herein.

### Zinc deficiency [^35381c3a]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Zinc plays an essential role in numerous biochemical pathways. Zinc deficiency affects many organ systems, including the integumentary, gastrointestinal, central nervous system, immune, skeletal, and reproductive systems. This article aims to discuss zinc metabolism and highlights a few of the diseases associated with zinc deficiency.

Recent Findings

Zinc deficiency results in dysfunction of both humoral and cell-mediated immunity and increases the susceptibility to infection. Supplementation of zinc has been shown to reduce the incidence of infection as well as cellular damage from increased oxidative stress. Zinc deficiency is also associated with acute and chronic liver disease. Zinc supplementation protects against toxin-induced liver damage and is used as a therapy for hepatic encephalopathy in patients refractory to standard treatment. Zinc deficiency has also been implicated in diarrheal disease, and supplementation has been effective in both prophylaxis and treatment of acute diarrhea.

Summary

This article is not meant to review all of the disease states associated with zinc deficiency. Rather, it is an introduction to the influence of the many roles of zinc in the body, with an extensive discussion of the influence of zinc deficiency in selected diseases. Zinc supplementation may be beneficial as an adjunct to treatment of many disease states.

### Clinical zinc deficiency as early presentation of Wilson disease [^516ec02e]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Low credibility.

Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of the copper metabolism caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ATP-ase Cu(2+) transporting polypeptide (ATP7B) gene. The copper accumulation in different organs leads to the suspicion of Wilson disease. We describe a child with clinical zinc deficiency as presenting symptom of Wilson disease, which was confirmed by 2 mutations within the ATP7B gene and an increased copper excretion.

### Inherited disorders of transition metal metabolism: an update [^c5df7894]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2017). Low credibility.

Elements with a biological role include six trace transition metals: manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc and molybdenum. Transition metals participate in group transfer reactions such as glycosylation and phosphorylation and those that can transfer an electron by alternating between two redox states such as iron (3+/2+) and copper (2+/1+) are also very important in biological redox reactions including the reduction of molecular oxygen and the transport of oxygen. However, these trace metals are also potentially toxic, generating reactive oxygen species through Fenton chemistry. Recently, a role of trace metals in host defence ("nutritional immunity") has been recognized. The host can deprive the pathogen of a trace metal or poison it with a toxic concentration. Disorders leading to low concentrations of a trace metal can often be treated by supplementing that metal; disorders leading to excessively high concentrations can often be treated with chelating agents such as penicillamine and disodium calcium edetate. This update will address: i) the manganese/zinc transporters (because two new treatable disorders were described in 2016 - SLC39A8 deficiency and SLC39A14 deficiency); ii) copper transporter disorders because we need to improve the treatment of patients with neurological symptoms due to Wilson's disease; and iii) iron homeostasis because recent progress in research into the metabolism of iron and its regulation helps us better understand several inborn errors affecting these pathways.

### Psychiatric signs and symptoms in treatable inborn errors of metabolism [^8d744455]. Journal of Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment

With proper therapy, disease progress can be halted and symptoms can be improved. Treatment is aimed at removing excess accumulated copper and preventing its re-accumulation. Chelation therapy drugs approved for treating WD include penicillamine (with maintenance dose 750–1,000 mg/day administered in two divided doses) and trientine (750 or 1,000 mg used for maintenance in two or three divided doses). Both of these drugs act by chelation or binding of copper, causing its increased urinary excretion. Metallothionein inducer drugs are also approved for treating WD. Zinc acts by blocking the absorption of copper in the intestinal tract. This action both depletes accumulated copper and prevents its re-accumulation. Patients with severe hepatitis or liver failure may require a liver transplant. Little is known about treating psychiatric conditions in WD. Clinical improvement in WD with treatment is generally limited to the first 5 years of symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are, therefore, essential.

### Nutrition and hair: deficiencies and supplements [^9f7a4c4c]. Dermatologic Clinics (2013). Low credibility.

Hair follicle cells have a high turnover. A caloric deprivation or deficiency of several components, such as proteins, minerals, essential fatty acids, and vitamins, caused by inborn errors or reduced uptake, can lead to structural abnormalities, pigmentation changes, or hair loss, although exact data are often lacking. The diagnosis is established through a careful history, clinical examination of hair loss activity, and hair quality and confirmed through targeted laboratory tests. Examples of genetic hair disorders caused by reduced nutritional components are zinc deficiency in acrodermatitis enteropathica and copper deficiency in Menkes kinky hair syndrome.

### Considerations in older infants (...) [^5977e89c]. AAFP (2006). Low credibility.

METHYLMALONICACIDURIA DISORDERS The most common genetic causes of methylmalonicaciduria are deficiencies in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity and in enzymatic synthesis of cobalamin. Pernicious anemia and dietary cobalamin deficiency also can result in abnormal methylmalonicacid metabolism. Metabolic ketoacidosis is the clinical hallmark of methylmalonicaciduria in infants. Therapy consists of protein restriction, restriction of methylmalonate precursors, and pharmacologic doses of vitamin B 12. MCAD DEFICIENCY The most common fatty acid oxidation disorder is MCAD deficiency. The majority of infants diagnosed with MCAD deficiency are homozygous for the A985G missense mutation and have northwestern European ancestry. Infants with MCAD deficiency appear to develop normally but present with rapidly progressive hypoglycemia, lethargy, and seizures, typically secondary to acute vomiting or fasting.

Treatment of MCAD deficiency includes frequent cornstarch feeds and avoidance of fasting. Parents must have a basic understanding of the metabolic deficit in their child and should carry a letter from their treating physicians to alert emergency caregivers about the need for urgent attention in a crisis situation. GALACTOSEMIA There are three known enzymatic errors in galactose metabolism. The most common defect is confirmed by measuring decreased activity of erythrocyte galactose 1-phosphate uridyltransferase. Clinical manifestations of galactosemia include lethargy, hypotonia, jaundice, hypoglycemia, elevated liver enzymes, and coagulopathy. It is important to distinguish the galactosemia disease genotype from asymptomatic variant genotypes, which can be picked up as “positive” in newborn screening.

GAUCHER's DISEASE Type 1 Gaucher's disease, the most common lysosomal storage disorder, typically presents with hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and destructive bone disease. Types 2 and 3 Gaucher's disease present with strabismus, bulbar signs, progressive cognitive deterioration, and myoclonic seizures. Treatment options for type 1 Gaucher's disease include regular infusions with recombinant human acid β-glucosidase.

### Wilson's disease [^42f6e99d]. Lancet (2007). Excellent credibility.

Progressive hepatolenticular degeneration, or Wilson's disease, is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism. Knowledge of the clinical presentations and treatment of the disease are important both to the generalist and to specialists in gastroenterology and hepatology, neurology, psychiatry, and paediatrics. Wilson's disease invariably results in severe disability and death if untreated. The diagnosis is easily overlooked but if discovered early, effective treatments are available that will prevent or reverse many manifestations of this disorder. Studies have identified the role of copper in disease pathogenesis and clinical, biochemical, and genetic markers that can be useful in diagnosis. There are several chelating agents and zinc salts for medical therapy. Liver transplantation corrects the underlying pathophysiology and can be lifesaving. The discovery of the Wilson's disease gene has opened up a new molecular diagnostic approach, and could form the basis of future gene therapy.

### Micronutrient status in phenylketonuria [^b4bd4e59]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) encompass an 'at risk' group for micronutrient imbalances. Optimal nutrient status is challenging particularly when a substantial proportion of nutrient intake is from non-natural sources. In PKU patients following dietary treatment, supplementation with micronutrients is a necessity and vitamins and minerals should either be added to supplement phenylalanine-free l-amino acids or given separately. In this literature review of papers published since 1990, the prevalence of vitamin and mineral deficiency is described, with reference to age of treatment commencement, type of treatment, dietary compliance, and dietary practices. Biological micronutrient inadequacies have been mainly reported for zinc, selenium, iron, vitamin B12 and folate. The aetiology of these results and possible clinical and biological implications are discussed. In PKU there is not a simple relationship between the dietary intake and nutritional status, and there are many independent and interrelated complex factors that should be considered other than quantitative nutritional intake.

### Picture of the month-diagnosis (...) [^c02ea757]. JAMA Network (2009). Excellent credibility.

Based on the history, clinical picture, and low alkaline phosphatase level, we considered zinc deficiency with an acrodermatitis enteropathica–like picture. This was confirmed. The skin lesions and child's irritability improved rapidly and the stools normalized within 3 days. Follow-up blood work 2 weeks later showed that the level of alkaline phosphatase, a zinc-dependent metalloenzyme, had also normalized. Further analyses revealed a very low zinc level in his mother's breast milk and a normal maternal blood zinc level of 76. 5 μg/dL. Zinc deficiency in infancy can be either acquired or the consequence of a genetic defect. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 in 500 000 children. 2Owing to a defect of the gene SLC39A4localized on chromosome 8, the transmembranous protein Zip4, acting as a zinc transporter in the intestine, is defectively produced. If zinc deficiency manifests in a fully breastfed infant, acquired zinc deficiency is the most likely explanation. While preterm infants are more prone to develop zinc deficiency due to diminished prenatal zinc storage, postnatal intestinal zinc absorption, and a higher zinc demand, the most frequent reason for acquired zinc deficiency in fully breastfed term infants is a zinc secretion defect of the maternal breast gland. 4Zinc supplementation usually resolves the symptoms very quickly, but attempts to increase zinc levels in breast milk through maternal zinc supplementation have not been successful. It is not uncommon to initially mistake the disorder for diaper rash, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, psoriasis, atopic eczema, or other skin conditions and delay appropriate treatment.

In the presence of the typical skin lesions, the clinician should always consider zinc deficiency as the underlying cause, especially when the lesions are accompanied by diarrhea and/or a low alkaline phosphatase level. Owing to therapeutic consequences, the specific diagnosis should always be elaborated.

### Zinc: an essential micronutrient [^68d0dae8]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Zinc is an essential micronutrient for human metabolism that catalyzes more than 100 enzymes, facilitates protein folding, and helps regulate gene expression. Patients with malnutrition, alcoholism, inflammatory bowel disease, and malabsorption syndromes are at an increased risk of zinc deficiency. Symptoms of zinc deficiency are nonspecific, including growth retardation, diarrhea, alopecia, glossitis, nail dystrophy, decreased immunity, and hypogonadism in males. In developing countries, zinc supplementation may be effective for the prevention of upper respiratory infection and diarrhea, and as an adjunct treatment for diarrhea in malnourished children. Zinc in combination with antioxidants may be modestly effective in slowing the progression of intermediate and advanced age-related macular degeneration. Zinc is an effective treatment for Wilson disease. Current data do not support zinc supplementation as effective for upper respiratory infection, wound healing, or human immunodeficiency virus. Zinc is well tolerated at recommended dosages. Adverse effects of long-term high-dose zinc use include suppressed immunity, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, anemia, copper deficiency, and possible genitourinary complications.

### Acrodermatitis caused by nutritional deficiency and metabolic disorders [^6217f485]. Clinics in Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Both the metabolism and dietary intake of vitamins and minerals are essential to homeostatic function in the body. Dietary excess or deficiency, as well as genetic and acquired disorders in metabolism, can present dermatologically and systemically. More specifically, disorders in metabolism of zinc, biotin, essential fatty acids, and vitamin B, can appear with acrally distributed dermatoses. Recognition of the dermatologic manifestations associated with nutritional disorders is important for early diagnosis and management.

### Insights into the management of Wilson's disease [^8cd94e5b]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

Wilson's disease is a rare, inherited autosomal recessive disease of copper metabolism, in which the causative gene, ATP7B , results in absent or reduced function of the ATP7B transporter important for biliary excretion of copper and incorporation of copper into caeruloplasmin. Affected patients accumulate excessive copper within the liver, brain and other tissues. A disease mainly of children, adolescents and young adults; clinical features vary from the asymptomatic state to chronic liver disease, acute liver failure, and neuropsychiatric manifestations. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion and is based on a combination of clinical signs, biochemical tests, hepatic copper content assay and mutation analysis of the ATP7B gene; to date, there are more than 500 mutations of ATP7B in patients with Wilson's disease. Early recognition and treatment can result in an excellent prognosis whereas untreated disease is almost always fatal. Drug therapies include chelating agents, such as penicillamine or trientine, and zinc salts. Liver transplantation is curative correcting the underlying pathophysiology and is traditionally indicated in acute liver failure or end-stage liver disease refractory to medical therapy. This review provides an overview of various aspects of Wilson's disease including molecular basis of the disease, clinical features, diagnostic and management strategies with their current limitations.

### Acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption [^6cb6a61d]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 1: What is the best diagnosis? 
A. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome
B. Zinc deficiency
C. Lyell syndrome
D. Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA)
E. Generalized bullous impetigo

Answers: 
A. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome – Incorrect. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is caused by the release of 2 exotoxins (epidermolytic toxins A and B). It usually begins with fever within 24 to 48 hours. Large blisters appear, followed by tissue-paper–like wrinkling of the skin. In our case, the patient presented with this condition for 3 weeks, but the skin bacterial culture was negative.
B. Zinc deficiency – Incorrect. Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare, genetic, autosomal recessive disease characterized by typical periorificial dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhea.Because the patient’s plasma zinc level was normal, this diagnosis was excluded.
C. Lyell syndrome – Incorrect. Toxic epidermal necrolysis rarely affects children and adolescents (ie, only 20% in the United States).The medications most frequently prescribed for treating toxic epidermal necrolysis are phenobarbital, carbamazepine, piroxicam, aminopenicillins, and allopurinol. Our patient did not take any medication prior to the onset of the disease.
D. MMA – Correct. MMA is a rare, autosomal recessive, inborn error of metabolism characterized by the accumulation of methylmalonic acid caused by a deficiency of methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) mutase (MUT) that catalyzes the conversion of methylmalonic-CoA to succinyl-CoA, which requires vitamin B12. The main manifestations include lethargy, hypotonia, vomiting, seizures, and respiratory distress. Patients present with superficial scalded skin over erythematous underlying tissues, stomatitis, cheilitis, and alopecia. These cutaneous manifestations are called acrodermatitis metabolica entheropathica–like syndrome.
E. Generalized bullous impetigo – Incorrect. The general condition of our patient was altered, which is not the case in patients with generalized bullous impetigo. In fact, these patients have no systemic symptoms and normal laboratory findings (hemogram, liver and renal function tests, and urinalysis).

### Psychological presentations without hepatic involvement in Wilson disease [^30502981]. Pediatric Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Wilson disease is an autosomal recessive inborn error of copper metabolism that leads to neurologic symptoms and variable degrees of hepatic damage. The most common characteristic signs clinically are liver disease, psychiatric disease, neurologic disease, or a combination of these. Early recognition by means of clinical signs and an early initiation of therapy using chelators or zinc-salts are essential for a good outcome and prognosis. This report describes a male suffering from Wilson disease who exhibited an unusual presentation that included psychological manifestations without hepatic involvement. He was initially treated for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and a seizure disorder until brain imaging established the diagnosis of Wilson disease.

Ceruloplasmin—interpretation for Wilson disease states that this 132-kDa glycoprotein contains six copper atoms per molecule and copper within ceruloplasmin accounts for 90% of circulating copper. Serum ceruloplasmin is an acute-phase reactant and is elevated by acute inflammation and by hyperestrogenemia in pregnancy, estrogen supplementation, and use of some oral contraceptive pills. Physiologically, levels are very low in early infancy to the age of 6 months, peak in early childhood at approximately 30–50 mg/dl, then settle to the adult range. In Wilson disease, serum ceruloplasmin is decreased in most patients, but a value within the normal range does not exclude the diagnosis. A level typically below the laboratory determined lower level of normal (usually approximately 20 mg/dl) has been considered consistent with Wilson disease, and diagnostic if associated with KF rings. Other disorders associated with low ceruloplasmin include nonselective renal protein loss, protein-losing enteropathy, severe chronic liver disease with global hepatic synthetic defect, absolute copper deficiency, after gastric or bariatric surgery, and chronic ingestion of zinc in excess. As a screening or diagnostic test, serum ceruloplasmin has major limitations and may be particularly uninformative diagnostically in children.

Wilson disease—zinc treatment targets and overtreatment: Adequacy of zinc treatment is assessed by 24-h urinary copper excretion, which should be <100 μg (<1.6 μmol)/24 h on stable treatment; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization may be a good marker and correlates with maintaining 24-h urinary copper below 100 μg/24 h, and elevated NCC normalizes with effective treatment. Overtreatment is suspected when urinary copper is very low (<20 μg [<0.3 μmol]/24 h) with low serum copper and lower ceruloplasmin, necessitating dose reduction or brief interruption if other hematologic or neurologic side effects occur; neurological changes are uncommon but may develop when depletion is severe and prolonged, usually after 5–15 years or more of treatment.

Wilson disease—zinc dosing and administration: Dosing is in milligrams of elemental zinc, with 150 mg/day in three divided doses for larger children and adults; for smaller children <50 kg the dose is 75 mg/day in three divided doses, and for children less than 5 years-old 50 mg/day in two divided doses has been postulated. Zinc must be taken at least twice daily, the actual salt used does not appear to make a difference with respect to efficacy, and taking zinc with food interferes with zinc absorption and treatment effectiveness.

Wilson disease (WD)—management of asymptomatic patients: Asymptomatic patients require treatment; however, urgency for starting treatment is greater if there is any evidence of organ damage due to either inflammation or structural damage. Treatment with a chelating agent, such as D-penicillamine or trientine, or with zinc effectively prevents disease progression and symptomatic disease. The starting dose of medication may be the same as for maintenance dosing. Individualization is important in children who are less than 3 years-old, and zinc appears preferable for these very young asymptomatic children, but there is no consensus as to whether treatment should be started without evidence of organ damage because of possible adverse effects of treatment on development.

Wilson disease treatment monitoring—Zinc: Maintenance control aims for 24-h urinary Cu excretion < 100 μg/24 h, and treatment failure on chronic therapy is indicated by 24-h urinary Cu excretion >100 μg/24 h (previously normal/near-normal). Initially, 24-h urinary copper excretion may drop below the achieved target range because of drug failure or nonadherence and then increase gradually over time; reinitiation of an oral chelator increases urinary copper excretion, whereas starting zinc decreases urinary excretion of copper.

Wilson disease—zinc adherence and monitoring: Adherence to long-term zinc therapy can be challenging because the three-times-daily dosing must be strictly away from meals, and clinical monitoring needs to be stringent. Rise in serum aminotransferases may be an early sign of poor adherence or treatment failure, increased 24-h urinary copper excretion suggests poor adherence or increased dietary copper intake, and urinary zinc can be checked for adherence with target values of >1–2 mg/24 h.

Guidance statements 23–24—overtreatment thresholds and actions indicate that overtreatment may be signaled by cytopenias or retention of tissue iron with raised serum ferritin and is confirmed by a low serum copper and a very low 24-h urinary copper output; for oral chelators, 24-h urinary copper excretion below the therapeutic target, specifically <100 μg/24 h or <1.6 μmol/24 h, suggests overtreatment, and for zinc therapy, 24-h urinary copper <20 μg/24 h (<0.3 μmol/24 h) suggests overtreatment. Once overtreatment is confirmed, dose reduction or brief interruption of medical therapy should be instituted with close follow-up for reassessment. Treatment failure may occur during treatment initiation or chronic therapy; concurrent diseases and nonadherence must be excluded; and pharmacological therapy should be changed or adjusted to correct treatment failure, with liver transplantation potentially required for more advanced liver disease or liver failure.

Wilson disease—alternating zinc and trientine intensive regimen is described as four doses with usually 4–5 h between administration; elemental zinc (50 mg in adults, 25 mg in children) is taken as the first and third doses and trientine (approximately 10 mg/kg) as the second and fourth; any patient starting this regimen should be simultaneously evaluated for liver transplantation; patients who are slow to respond or failing this regimen should be promptly considered for liver transplant; responders may be transitioned to full-dose zinc or full-dose trientine (or D-penicillamine) as monotherapy after approximately 3–6 months when disease stabilization is achieved; this treatment strategy remains investigational despite some supportive data.

### Wilson disease [^d3f49ba0]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2018). Medium credibility.

Wilson disease (WD) is a potentially treatable, inherited disorder of copper metabolism that is characterized by the pathological accumulation of copper. WD is caused by mutations in ATP7B, which encodes a transmembrane copper-transporting ATPase, leading to impaired copper homeostasis and copper overload in the liver, brain and other organs. The clinical course of WD can vary in the type and severity of symptoms, but progressive liver disease is a common feature. Patients can also present with neurological disorders and psychiatric symptoms. WD is diagnosed using diagnostic algorithms that incorporate clinical symptoms and signs, measures of copper metabolism and DNA analysis of ATP7B. Available treatments include chelation therapy and zinc salts, which reverse copper overload by different mechanisms. Additionally, liver transplantation is indicated in selected cases. New agents, such as tetrathiomolybdate salts, are currently being investigated in clinical trials, and genetic therapies are being tested in animal models. With early diagnosis and treatment, the prognosis is good; however, an important issue is diagnosing patients before the onset of serious symptoms. Advances in screening for WD may therefore bring earlier diagnosis and improvements for patients with WD.

### Insights into trace metal metabolism in health and disease from PET: "PET metallomics" [^721ba51f]. Journal of Nuclear Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Essential trace metals are important in many cellular and physiologic processes, including ubiquitous enzymatic reactions and protein folding. For example, copper-dependent enzymes include cytochrome-c oxidase, superoxide dismutase, and ceruloplasmin, which participate in aerobic respiration, antioxidant defense, and hepatic iron release, respectively, all of which depend on the redox activity of copper as it cycles between its 2 principal oxidation states, Cu(I) and Cu(II). Zinc is essential for the catalytic function and structure of many proteins with roles in, inter alia, metabolism, gene regulation, chromatin structure, and neurotransmission. Iron is essential in hemoglobin, respiration, and DNA and RNA synthesis, whereas manganese is important to enzymes that destroy reactive oxygen species and produce urea and nitric oxide. In healthy states, metal homeostasis is tightly controlled, and its deregulation is implicated as cause or consequence of many human diseases. Mutations in copper transporters ATP7B and ATP7A result in, respectively, Wilson’s disease (WD) (characterized by copper overload) and Menkes disease (characterized by systemic copper deficiency and fatal in childhood). Copper imbalance is implicated in neurodegeneration and cancer, although whether as cause or consequence is unclear. Abnormal zinc levels occur in diabetes and cystic fibrosis, and both zinc and copper accumulate in amyloid plaques in Alzheimer disease. The study of trace metals in biology and medicine, historically known as inorganic biochemistry or bioinorganic chemistry, is growing in importance, becoming fashionably known as “metallomics.”

Adherence—lifelong therapy expectations emphasize that once Wilson disease is conclusively diagnosed and treatment initiated, pharmacological treatment is lifelong, with the only exception after liver transplantation when chelators or zinc can be stopped although treatments for maintenance of the liver graft are required. Survival with effective pharmacological treatment approaches the normal longevity of the patient’s country, and with hepatic Wilson disease, effective treatment instituted early makes it unlikely that neurological abnormalities will develop.

### Adult liver disorders caused by inborn errors of metabolism: review and update [^5f2e9bca]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) are a group of genetic diseases that have protean clinical manifestations and can involve several organ systems. The age of onset is highly variable but IEMs afflict mostly the pediatric population. However, in the past decades, the advancement in management and new therapeutic approaches have led to the improvement in IEM patient care. As a result, many patients with IEMs are surviving into adulthood and developing their own set of complications. In addition, some IEMs will present in adulthood. It is important for internists to have the knowledge and be familiar with these conditions because it is predicted that more and more adult patients with IEMs will need continuity of care in the near future. The review will focus on Wilson disease, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, citrin deficiency, and HFE-associated hemochromatosis which are typically found in the adult population. Clinical manifestations and pathophysiology, particularly those that relate to hepatic disease as well as diagnosis and management will be discussed in detail.

Wilson disease (WD)—maintenance therapy timing, criteria, and monitoring: After adequate treatment with a chelator, stable patients may continue on a lower dosage of drug or treatment may be changed to zinc, but strict criteria for eligibility for maintenance therapy cannot be specified. Typically, patients will have been treated for 1–5 years, but some will be suitable after only 6–12 months of treatment, and they will be clinically well with normal (or near-normal and improving) serum aminotransferase levels and hepatic synthetic function and with 24-h urinary copper excretion repeatedly in the therapeutic range on chelation treatment. Transitioning to maintenance therapy entails clinical and biochemical monitoring in the first 2–6 months (as opposed to standard 6-month intervals) to ensure effective therapy. Chelation therapy has a long track record of success as maintenance therapy, but adverse effects do cause discontinuation in a minority, more often with D-penicillamine. Long-term maintenance treatment with zinc is associated with few side effects, except for gastric intolerance; however, zinc requires multiple daily doses to be effective, and whichever therapy is chosen, regular follow-up should be continued because adherence remains an issue in many patients and late failures sometimes occur.

Table 2 
Characteristics of zinc-induced anemia in WD

Age: Age when presented with anemia, y years, m months, MDS Myelocytic dysplasia syndrome

There are multiple causes of hypocupremia, mainly including copper malabsorption induced by short bowel syndrome, gastrointestinal surgery, Menkes disease and excessive zinc exposure due to WD, acne, and zinc-containing dental fixatives. The characteristics of hypocupremia-associated anemia in different etiologies are similar. It may present as significant neutropenia, all forms of anemia (normocytic, macrocytic or microcytic), or thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy shows vacuolated myeloid and erythroid precursors, myelocytic dysplasia syndrome (MDS) or ring sideroblasts. The exact mechanism of hypocupremia-related anemia is unclear and may involve the followings: Copper is a cofactor in many enzymatic redox reactions and can stimulate the transformation of divalent iron to trivalent iron which participates in the hematopoietic process. Copper promotes release of iron from hepatocytes and iron absorption from enterocytes. Ceruloplasmin and transferrin are involved in iron transfer. Copper also accelerates the maturation and release of immature RBCs. When copper is deficient, iron metabolism is disturbed, which affects the hematopoiesis process. Another copper dependent enzyme, cytochrome C oxidase, is also involved in the mechanism of anemia. Under low copper conditions, impaired cytochrome C oxidase affects the mobilization of stored iron, leading to iron deposition in tissues. This may explain why the ferritin level was not low, different from iron-deficiency anemia. Because copper is a component of proteins which function in the structure and physiology of the central nervous system, hypocupremia can also cause demyelination of the central nervous system similar to vitamin B12 deficiency. Typical features include abnormal gait, paresthesias, myasthenia, hypertonia, or hyperreflexia. The MRI of brain is usually normal, while T2-hyperintense signal can be seen in the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Our patient had a gait disorder, without other clinical symptoms of ataxia, myelopathy, and peripheral neuropathy. There were no abnormal changes on brain MRI. The reason for abnormal gait could not be ascertained because further studies of spinal cord MRI, and cerebrospinal fluid were refused by parents. Usually it may take longer time to develop copper deficiency in WD, but due to our patient’s very strict diet control, higher zinc dose, and her relative low body weight, it took a shorter time to remove the excess copper accumulation in her body. The patient had not been back to us for years which prevented our clinicians identifying possible adverse effects promptly. Her hypocupremia-associated anemia was not diagnosed until she returned to our liver specialist.

### Dementia, diarrhea, desquamating shellac-like dermatitis revealing late-onset cobalamin C deficiency [^bf042448]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Nutritional deficiencies can also have characteristic skin findings with intertriginous involvement (Table I).Zinc deficiency manifests as acrodermatitis enteropathica with symmetric, intertriginous dermatitis, specifically around the perineum, along with treatment-resistant seborrheic dermatitis, and diarrhea. Niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency or pellagra presents with photo-distributed dermatitis that can have a parchment-like appearance, neuropathy, diarrhea, and dementia. Biotin (vitamin B7) deficiency can also manifest with severe seborrheic dermatitis and changes in periorificial, perianal, and intertriginous locations.A seborrheic dermatitis might be seen in hyperammonemia, which can also be associated with seizures, ataxia, depression, lassitude, nausea, and vomiting. Similarly, deficiencies in riboflavin (vitamin B2), pyridoxine (vitamin B6), biotin, and essential fatty acids all manifest with intertriginous dermatitis, and such findings should prompt a consideration of nutritional disease.We checked biotin levels in our patient as long-term use of antiepileptic medication has been associated with biotin deficiency.

Table I 
Metabolic and nutritional deficiencies with intertriginous skin involvement

Although cobalamin C deficiency is the most common inherited disorder of vitamin B12 metabolism and the most common form of MMA, the late-onset form displays a broad phenotypic spectrum of varied neuropsychiatric manifestations. Screening occurs with plasma amino acids, total plasma homocysteine level, and urine organic acids, with the diagnosis confirmed by findings of hyperhomocysteinemia, low plasma methionine, and elevated MMA.Final confirmation occurs by genotyping of the MMACHC gene.Recent developments in newborn screening allow for early detection of inborn errors of metabolism and have been mandated in Texas since 2015.Our patient was not screened because the mandate was implemented years after his birth.

Early detection of MMA cobalamin C is essential because patients respond well to hydroxocobalamin therapy, often with early neurologic improvement and resolution of systemic symptoms. Changes seen on magnetic resonance imaging have also been shown to be reversed with treatment.

By increasing awareness that skin eruptions resembling acrodermatitis enteropathica can be an initial systemic sign of an inborn error of metabolism, physicians can diagnose and potentially limit resultant neuropsychiatric damage. This particularly distinctive, brown shellac-like erosive desquamation should raise suspicion for aminoacidopathies.

### Zinc deficiency-associated dermatitis in infants during a nationwide shortage of injectable zinc-Washington, DC, and Houston, Texas, 2012-2013 [^537494af]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2014). Low credibility.

Editorial Note

Zinc is an essential trace element that functions as a cofactor for certain enzymes involved in metabolism and cell growth ; zinc supports immune function, protein metabolism, development of the gastrointestinal tract, and genetic processes. Acute zinc deficiency disorder is characterized by dermatitis around the limbs and body orifices, diarrhea, and impaired immune function, whereas chronic zinc deficiency disorder can lead to liver or kidney failure. A rare genetic disorder, acrodermatitis enteropathica, shares the same clinical manifestations as acute zinc deficiency disorder but is a metabolic disorder of zinc absorption. Zinc is a standard component in PN. Premature infants administered PN require 400 μ g/kg/body weight/day of zinc to maintain serum levels and promote growth, whereas 200 μ g/kg/body weight/day of zinc is sufficient for full-term infants on PN. Additionally, PN might be needed for prolonged periods for very low birth weight infants (<1,500 g) and infants with chronic gastrointestinal dysfunction.

What is already known on this topic?

Nationwide shortages of parenteral micronutrients have continued to occur in recent years. These shortages can lead to clinically significant micronutrient deficiencies among patients who depend on prolonged parenteral nutrition. Premature infants are especially vulnerable, and certain micronutrient deficiencies can be lethal.

What is added by this report?

The nationwide shortage of injectable zinc that began in late 2012 led to seven reported cases of zinc deficiency disorder in vulnerable infants. Among these infants, six experienced severe dermatitis, and three experienced invasive bacterial infections. The Food and Drug Administration is now temporarily permitting the importation and sale of an injectable zinc product.

What are the implications for public health practice?

Hospitals with limited stocks of injectable zinc should consider reserving supplies for infants with the highest risk for deficiency (e.g. those who are premature [born at <37 weeks’ gestation] or have very low birth weight [<1,500 g] and those with chronic or permanent gastrointestinal dysfunction). If shortages occur, monitoring patients on parenteral nutrition for signs and symptoms of micronutrient deficiencies is crucial.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^9260d36f]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease—zinc (zinc salts) mechanism, effectiveness, and adverse effects are summarized: Zinc inhibits the intestinal uptake of copper by inducing enterocyte metallothionein, an endogenous chelator with a greater affinity for copper than for zinc; ingested copper binds to cytoplasmic metallothionein and is excreted in the feces as enterocytes are shed, and because copper also enters the gastrointestinal tract from saliva and gastric secretions, zinc can help rebalance copper and remove tissue copper, albeit relatively slowly. Zinc may also improve hepatic resistance to copper toxicity by inducing hepatocellular metallothionein and may reverse Cu-mediated interference with nuclear receptors and thus improve hepatocellular metabolism. Gastritis is the most common adverse effect, occurring in approximately one third of patients, and in one survey approximately 38% of patients changed the zinc salt due to gastrointestinal symptoms; in children, zinc sulfate may be problematic with a report of gastric perforation. Zinc treatment to block dietary copper absorption is effective in the majority of but not all patients with WD, though in the initial studies some individuals failed to have adequate blockage of dietary copper; hepatic deterioration was occasionally reported in WD on zinc monotherapy and was fatal in one case, early paradoxical neurological deterioration is uncommon with zinc but may occur, and elevation in serum lipase or amylase may occur without clinical or radiologic evidence of pancreatitis.

Zinc

Pathophysiology and Presentation

Zinc is essential in the structural integrity of essential proteins such as histones, zinc-finger proteins, tight junctions, alkaline phosphatase, and DNA/RNA polymerase. Zinc is absorbed through-out the intestine and competes for the same sites of absorption as copper and iron.

In adults, the most severe manifestation is the characteristic acrodermatitis enteropathica. Though commonly described as an autosomal recessive disease in children caused by impaired zinc transport, an acquired form of acrodermatitis enteropathica has been noted in nutritionally impaired adults. The hyperkeratotic “crusting” lesions commonly involves the eyes, mouth and perianal areas and is associated with significant edema and diarrhea. Patients may have poor wound healing with fistulization as zinc deficiency affects tight junctions.Mild eosinophilia may be present on blood tests as well as tissue samples.

Risk Factors

Absorption may be impaired by pancreatic insufficiency, malabsorptive states, inflammatory bowel disease as well as gastrointestinal resections. Pregnancy, alcoholism, cirrhosis, total parenteral nutrition, and diuretics, have also been associated with deficiency. One study noted approximately 70% of hemodialysis patients were noted to be zinc deficient.

Diagnosis and Treatment

Plasma zinc levels may be suppressed in the context of severe inflammation however they are accurate when associated with clinical findings.Modest supplementation about 30 to 45 mg/day is sufficient and should be given two hours after any iron supplementation. Long term treatment especially with doses > 50mg/d should be closely monitored as it has been associated with low copper status as well as side effects of diarrhea and GI distress.

### Acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica from a ketogenic diet [^37183cdc]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Zinc plays multiple important physiologic roles; it is a catalyst for many metabolic reactions, a structural component of numerous proteins, and is involved in gene expression and other regulatory functions.Zinc deficiency, whether acquired or congenital, can lead to the typical signs and symptoms of AE. AE classically presents with a triad of alopecia, dermatitis, and diarrhea. However, only 20% of the cases present with all 3, as observed in the present case.More advanced presentations include growth delay, hypogonadism, hypoguesia, poor wound healing, and increased risk for secondary bacterial infection of skin lesions.Diagnosis usually relies on a thorough patient history, physical exam, and investigation of serum zinc levels, but a high index of suspicion is necessary. Biopsy may be helpful, but histopathology is identical to other forms of nutritional deficiency dermatitis, such as niacin deficiency and necrolytic migratory erythema.Practitioners should be aware of the need for vitamin and mineral supplementation in patients on a ketogenic diet, especially those on a liquid formulation. Additionally, particularly given the rising popularity of the ketogenic diet, it is important to be aware of its potential side effects and their dermatologic manifestations; these include the possibility of prurigo, scurvy, and, as in our patient, acquired AE.

### Acrodermatitis dysmetabolica: lessons from two pediatric cases [^9125ed41]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Acrodermatitis dysmetabolica (AD) is a dermatologic manifestation associated with inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs), distinct from acrodermatitis enteropathica, which occurs solely due to zinc deficiency.

Case Presentation

This report presents two pediatric cases: a 30-month-old girl with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) experiencing AD secondary to severe isoleucine deficiency due to a protein-restricted diet, showing improvement with dietary adjustments, and a 2.5-month-old boy infant with propionic acidemia (PA) who developed AD alongside septic shock, which progressed despite intervention.

Conclusions

These cases emphasize the importance of identifying AD in IMDs and the critical need for meticulous monitoring of amino acid levels, as deficiencies may lead to severe complications.

### The potential and limitations of intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids to study inborn errors of metabolism [^172c4579]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) comprise a diverse group of individually rare monogenic disorders that affect metabolic pathways. Mutations lead to enzymatic deficiency or dysfunction, which results in intermediate metabolite accumulation or deficit leading to disease phenotypes. Currently, treatment options for many IEMs are insufficient. Rarity of individual IEMs hampers therapy development and phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity suggest beneficial effects of personalized approaches. Recently, cultures of patient‐own liver‐derived intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids (ICOs) have been established. Since most metabolic genes are expressed in the liver, patient‐derived ICOs represent exciting possibilities for in vitro modeling and personalized drug testing for IEMs. However, the exact application range of ICOs remains unclear. To address this, we examined which metabolic pathways can be studied with ICOs and what the potential and limitations of patient‐derived ICOs are to model metabolic functions. We present functional assays in patient ICOs with defects in branched‐chain amino acid metabolism (methylmalonic acidemia), copper metabolism (Wilson disease), and transporter defects (cystic fibrosis). We discuss the broad range of functional assays that can be applied to ICOs, but also address the limitations of these patient‐specific cell models. In doing so, we aim to guide the selection of the appropriate cell model for studies of a specific disease or metabolic process.

### Trace elements injection 4 (tralement) [^e3ab6eec]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4  Hepatic Accumulation of Copper and Manganese

Copper is primarily eliminated in the bile and excretion is decreased in patients with cholestasis and/or cirrhosis. Hepatic accumulation of copper and manganese have been reported in autopsies of patients receiving long-term parenteral nutrition containing copper and manganese at dosages higher

than recommended.

Patients receiving parenteral nutrition with cholestasis and/or cirrhosis are at increased risk of manganese brain deposition and neurotoxicity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Administration of copper to patients with cholestasis, and/or cirrhosis may cause hepatic accumulation of copper. Administration of copper to patients with Wilson disease, an inborn error of copper metabolism with defect in hepatocellular copper transport, may cause both increased hepatic accumulation of copper and aggravation of the underlying hepatocellular degeneration.

For patients with cholestasis, biliary dysfunction, or cirrhosis, monitor hepatic and biliary function during long-term administration of Tralement. If a patient develops signs or symptoms of hepatic or biliary dysfunction during the use of Tralement, obtain serum concentrations of copper and ceruloplasmin as well as manganese whole blood concentrations. Consider using individual trace element products in patients with hepatic and/or biliary dysfunction [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] .

5.5  Aluminum Toxicity

Tralement contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Preterm infants, including preterm neonates, are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum.

Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including preterm infants and premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration or lower daily amounts.

Exposure to aluminum from Tralement is no more than 0.1 mcg/kg/day. When prescribing Tralement for use in parenteral nutrition containing other small volume parenteral products, the total daily patient exposure to aluminum from the admixture should be considered and maintained at no more than 5 mcg/kg/day [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] .

5.6  Monitoring and Laboratory Tests

Monitor blood zinc, copper, manganese, and selenium concentrations, fluid and electrolyte status, serum osmolarity, blood glucose, liver and kidney function, blood count, and coagulation parameters during use of parenteral nutrition containing Tralement [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)].

### Carnitine supplementation for inborn errors of metabolism [^b26dad88]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Inborn errors of metabolism are genetic conditions which can lead to abnormalities in the synthesis and metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates, or fats. It has been proposed that in some instances carnitine supplementation should be provided to infants with a suspected metabolic disease as an interim measure, particularly whilst awaiting test results. Carnitine supplementation is used in the treatment of primary carnitine deficiency, and also where the deficiency is a secondary complication of several inborn errors of metabolism, such as organic acidaemias and fatty acid oxidation defects in children and adults.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness and safety of carnitine supplementation in the treatment of inborn errors of metabolism.

Search Methods

We searched the Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 4) and MEDLINE via Ovid (1950 to July week 4 2007), LILACS (15/05/2008) and Iranmedex (15/05/2008) and also the reference lists of retrieved articles.Date of most recent search of the Group's Inborn Errors of Metabolism Register: 27 October 2011.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing carnitine supplementation (in different dose, frequency, or duration) versus placebo in children and adults diagnosed with an inborn error of metabolism.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and assessed the eligibility of the identified trials.

Main Results

No trials were included in the review.

Authors' Conclusions

There are no published or ongoing randomised controlled clinical trials relevant to this review question. Therefore, in the absence of any high level evidence, clinicians should base their decisions on clinical experience and in conjunction with preferences of the individual where appropriate. This does not mean that carnitine is ineffective or should not be used in any inborn error of metabolism. However, given the lack of evidence both on the effectiveness and safety of carnitine and on the necessary dose and frequency to be prescribed, the current prescribing practice should continue to be observed and monitored with care until further evidence is available. Methodologically sound trials, reported according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, are required. It should be considered whether placebo-controlled trials in potentially lethal diseases, e.g. carnitine transporter disorder or glutaric aciduria type I, are ethical.

Pregnancy—breastfeeding considerations in Wilson disease include potential copper transfer risks and limited drug data. Because ATP7B in mammary tissue evidently plays a role in the delivery of copper into breast milk, concentrations of breast milk copper in mothers with WD may be increased during the newborn's metabolic transition into breast milk and has potential to harm the infant. Women need to be aware of the possible risks; appropriate arrangements for evaluating the baby (regular checks of complete blood count) are advisable. Few data are available about the excretion of trientine into breast milk. Bioavailability of zinc from breast milk is ordinarily quite high, and little is known about the effect of pharmacological doses of zinc on breast milk concentrations.

### Diet management in congenital diarrheas and enteropathies-general concepts and disease-specific approach, a narrative review [^e1f086be]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Acrodermatitis enteropathica

Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE; MIM #) affects zinc uptake and can be inherited (congenital) or acquired. AE is associated with zinc deficiency. Clinical symptoms vary, reflect the consequences of zinc deficiency, and range in severity from mild to severe. Common signs and symptoms of AE include diarrhea, dermatitis, poor growth, anorexia, dysgeusia, mood changes, neurologic and cerebral disturbances, alopecia, nail deformity, recurrent infections, and rarely, ophthalmic and hepatic abnormalities. If left untreated, AE can be fatal; however, symptoms can reverse with enteral zinc supplementation.

The congenital form of AE results from SLC39A4 / ZIP4 mutations and impairs the active transport of zinc across the duodenal mucosa. A mutation in SLC30A2, a gene encoding the zinc transporter ZnT2, can lead to a decreased zinc secretion in breast milk and transient AE, such as in breastfed neonates. Acquired forms of AE are variable and include zinc-deficient breast milk or concurrent conditions such as malabsorptive disorders (e.g. cystic fibrosis, celiac disease, cholestatic liver disease) or in cases in which the duodenal surface area is bypassed (e.g. surgery, postpyloric/jejunal nutrition support).

Nutritional management

Treatment of AE is 1 to 3 mg zinc/kg/d, divided twice or thrice daily. Zinc supplements exist in different forms, including zinc sulfate, gluconate, or acetate. Each form contains a different percentage of elemental zinc that needs to be considered when calculating treatment doses. To date, there is very little evidence assessing the bioavailability, absorption, and tolerability of the different forms of zinc in AE or other conditions. In addition, there are known zinc-drug and zinc-nutrient interactions to consider as part of monitoring response to zinc therapy for AE. Antibiotics (e.g. quinolone and tetracycline), penicillamine, and diuretics can interact with zinc. Zinc can also interfere with the absorption of iron, copper, and calcium. As such, zinc supplements should be taken apart from certain medications and iron, copper, or calcium supplements. Zinc toxicity, which has only been documented to occur from supplementation, is also a risk, thus zinc concentrations need to be monitored in patients treated for AE. Beyond supplementation, there is no special diet to follow for congenital or inherited AE.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for Wilson's disease, more specifically with respect to clinical and laboratory monitoring, EASL/ERN-Rare Liver 2025 guidelines recommend to monitor adequacy of treatment with zinc salts during all stages of treatment by measuring 24-hour urinary copper excretion and serum non-ceruloplasmin-bound copper or serum exchangeable copper whenever available.

### Acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption in metabolic disorders: acrodermatitis dysmetabolica is proposed as a better term [^167a6419]. Pediatric Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Acrodermatitis acidemica is a recently proposed term for the rash that is similar to acrodermatitis enteropathica, which is encountered in organic acidemias. However, acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption may be seen in metabolic disorders other than organic acidemias.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical features of acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption secondary to metabolic disorders.

Methods

Clinical and demographic features of 12 patients with acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption were prospectively evaluated between 2004 and 2006 in this single-center study.

Results

Among the 12 patients, underlying metabolic disorders included maple syrup urine disease (n = 5), methylmalonic acidemia (n = 3), phenylketonuria (n = 2), ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (n = 1), and propionic acidemia (n = 1). Mean age at first presentation was 29.9 months. Mean duration of acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption at the time of presentation was 25.2 days. The diaper area was involved in all presentations. Plasma zinc level was measured in 62.5% (n = 10) of the presentations and all had normal levels. All phenylketonuria cases had a low plasma phenylalanine level, and a low plasma isoleucine level was observed in the propionic acidemia case and all maple syrup urine disease cases. The rash responded dramatically to appropriate diet management in all cases.

Conclusion

In this study, acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption was noted in various metabolic disorders, including organic acidemias. We suggest that acrodermatitis dysmetabolica might be a better term for acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption occurring secondary to metabolic disorders other than acquired zinc deficiency.

### Recurrent pruritic polymorphic lesions associated with weight loss [^88833179]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is a disease associated with this clinic? 
A. Zinc Deficiency
B. Short bowel syndrome
C. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
D. Glucagonoma
E. Niacin deficiency

Answer: 
A. Zinc Deficiency – Incorrect. The zinc deficiency in AE is caused by a genetic defect of dietary zinc absorption. Serum Zinc levels are low and the clinical manifestations reverse with a therapeutic zinc regimen.
B. Short bowel syndrome – Incorret. In this syndrome related to EFAD, malabsorption of both macronutrients and micronutrients occurs. Intestinal failure describes the state when an individual's gastrointestinal function is inadequate to maintain his or her nutrients and hydration status without intravenous or enteral supplementation.
C. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma – Incorrect. This pathology is associated with PNP in most cases. The search for malignancy in PNP should be conducted through a comprehensive physical examination targeting the liver, spleen, and lymph nodes.
D. Glucagonoma – Correct. Glucagonoma is an alpha-cell pancreatic tumor that releases glucagon. Its main clinical features are NME, glossitis, angular cheilitis, normocytic normochromic anemia, conjunctivitis, ponderal loss, diabetes mellitus, hypoaminoacidemia, zinc deficiency, deep venous thrombosis, thinning hair, ungual dystrophy, and neuropsychiatric disorders. The computed tomography scan of the patient's abdomen revealed an expanding mass in the head of the pancreas.
E. Niacin deficiency – Incorrect. Deficiency of Niacin or vitamin B3—a water-soluble vitamin—causes pellagra. This deficiency occurs due to dietary deficiency, malabsorption, chronic alcoholism, metabolic derangement, and drug induced.

### A multidisciplinary approach to the diagnosis and management of Wilson disease: 2022 practice guidance on Wilson disease from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^752458b5]. Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Wilson disease—monitoring and adherence assessment during therapy includes targeted examination, history, and laboratory surveillance. Physical examination should look for evidence of liver disease and neurological symptoms; for patients on D-penicillamine, cutaneous changes should be sought, and history should include questioning about psychiatric symptoms, especially depression. Repeat examination for KF rings should be performed if there is a question of adherence. Laboratory testing at baseline and over time should include liver biochemistries, tests of hepatic synthetic function, total blood count, indices of copper metabolism (including 24-h urinary copper excretion), and routine urinalysis for those on chelation therapy. Estimated NCC may provide the best guide to treatment efficacy but may be incalculable if either parameter is below the laboratory detection limit. Evidence of nonadherence includes clinical worsening, elevation of liver tests, and increased urinary copper excretion; hepatic deterioration may follow. Disproportionately low urinary copper excretion on chelation relative to steady state values can indicate overtreatment and is often accompanied by lower serum ceruloplasmin and serum copper and therefore lower NCC; neutropenia, anemia, and hyperferritinemia can also be present. Recently stopped chelation therapy or subtherapeutic dosages may also yield low 24-h urinary copper excretion, but typically with elevated NCC or CuEXC or increased serum copper. In patients taking zinc, adherence can be checked by measuring serum zinc or 24-h urinary zinc excretion.

### Epidemiology and economic burden of Wilson disease in France: a nationwide population-based study [^c480e4c4]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Wilson disease (WD) is a rare inherited copper metabolism disorder, characterized by progressive pathological copper overload in many organs, primarily the liver and brain.This autosomal recessive disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene that encodes the copper‐transporting ATPase ATP7B.Abnormality in ATP7B function affects copper incorporation in ceruloplasmin and its release into the bile, which eventually leads to copper accumulation and cell death. Excessive copper released from the hepatocytes consequently enters the blood, binds to albumin, and is delivered and progressively deposited in other organs.In the absence of medical treatment, WD progresses to a multisystem disease, associated with a wide spectrum of clinical symptoms, including neurologic abnormalities, acute or chronic liver failure, ophthalmological manifestations, and psychiatric disorders, and can even become fatal.These symptoms vary widely and present usually between 5 and 30 years of age but may also occur later in life (late‐onset WD).

The understanding and management of this copper overload disease has steadily evolved over the years, but diagnosis remains difficult owing to the clinical variability and limited knowledge of the natural course of the disease. While early diagnosis and lifelong treatment can lead to better outcomes, WD is deemed fatal if left untreated.WD management involves a combination of dietary control and lifelong medications, including copper chelators (D‐penicillamine and trientine salts) or zinc salts, to establish normal copper homeostasis, prevent disease progression, and reduce the risk of mortality.However, non‐adherence to treatment is high (about 30%) and differs depending on the phenotypic presentation.Liver transplantation is an alternative recommended in European Association for Study of Liver (EASL) and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) guidelines for cases presenting with acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis with no effect of pharmacological treatment but is often associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

### Acrodermatitis enteropathica: case report and review of the literature [^5d53f2dd]. Pediatric Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) is a rare hereditary disorder caused by impaired absorption of zinc from the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterized by acral and periorificial dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhea. Symptoms usually begin on weaning from breast or formula feeding. We report a full-term, 21-month-old boy with typical skin lesions and decreased plasma zinc level (12 micro g/dl). The patient was given zinc sulfate 40 mg/day and at the end of 1 month his condition had improved significantly. After reviewing the literature we emphasize the important role of zinc in human metabolism and the difference between AE and acquired zinc deficiencies.

### Acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica as a presenting sign of celiac disease [^b5365f10]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder AE results from a zinc transporter protein (ZIP4) loss of function mutation encoded by the SLC39A4 gene on chromosome 9.As part of the regulatory system for zinc homeostasis, ZIP4 enables intracellular zinc transport from the lumen of the small intestine and, when absent, leads to systemic zinc deficiency.Periorificial and acral dermatitis, alopecia, and diarrhea in association with epidermal necrosis on histology point to the diagnosis.Although most literature on zinc deficiency dermatitis focuses on this heritable variant and its presentation in young children, a variety of scenarios producing acquired zinc deficiency in adulthood manifest similar clinicopathologic findings.,,Anorexia nervosa, alcoholism, intestinal malabsorption, and diets high in mineral binding phytate are the most common causes of acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica.Low zinc intake also results in zinc deficiency; however, the recommended daily intake of 8 mg for women and 11 mg for men is easily attained in developed countries.Dietary zinc deficiency must not be completely overlooked, as the extensive use of proton-pump inhibitors, decreased consumption of meat and fish, and diets abundant in phytate-rich foods are not uncommon.

As zinc interacts with a multitude of molecular structures, it is not surprising that cellular and systemic zinc levels are tightly regulated. Of the anatomic sites involved in zinc homeostasis, including the kidneys, skin, and sites of tissue repair, the small intestine is thought to be the central avenue for homeostasis.Thus, acrodermatitis enteropathica may develop when gastrointestinal pathologies decrease the absorption of zinc across the luminal membrane of the small intestine.

Celiac disease is a chronic gastrointestinal condition characterized by the inability to tolerate gliadin, the alcohol-soluble fraction of gluten. This results in an immunologically mediated inflammatory response to the ingestion of gluten and ultimately leads to damage of the intestinal mucosa with comorbid malabsorption. Common symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, flatulence, weight loss, growth delay in children, and fatigue. Diagnosis is determined with positive immunoglobulin A antitissue transglutaminase and antiendomysial antibodies—both of which were positive in our patient. Although small bowel biopsies are the gold standard to confirm gluten-sensitive enteropathy, classic findings are frequently patchy when taken from the distal duodenum. In contrast, literature supports the superior reliability of duodenal biopsies from the bulb, which were unfortunately not obtained in our patient.

### Acrodermatitis dysmetabolica in a child with cystic fibrosis [^6947341e]. Pediatric Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Acrodermatitis dysmetabolica is an umbrella term encompassing the other metabolic causes of an erosive periorificial and acral dermatitis that mimics acrodermatitis enteropathica. Causes include acquired zinc, amino acid, biotin, and fatty acid deficiencies. We present the case of an exclusively breastfed, 2-month-old boy with known cystic fibrosis admitted with failure to thrive and erosive dermatitis. A diagnosis of acrodermatitis dysmetabolica was made when investigations revealed a normal zinc level but low amino acid levels.

### Clinical phenotype in individuals with birk-landau-perez syndrome associated with biallelicPathogenic variants [^8237cd2f]. Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

SLC30A9 encodes ZnT-9, a ubiquitously expressed transmembrane protein, which is known to play a role as a zinc transporter. Perez et al. in the same study in which they report on the disease, offer immunofluorescence-based evidence that the protein colocalizes with cytosolic vesicles and especially the endoplasmic reticulum. In vitro, cells expressing the in-frame deletion variant have been found to have lower levels of cytosolic zinc, but disturbances of zinc metabolism in vivo have not yet been demonstrated, and notably, in those of our patients where testing was possible, serum zinc levels were normal. Of interest, people with BLPS do not manifest many of the classical signs of systemic zinc deficiency, such as dermatitis and diarrhea.This could reflect the fact that a transporter defect would only deplete intracellular, rather than total body, zinc, the consequences of which are not known. It is also possible that ZnT-9 has more physiologic functions than have yet been identified. ZnT-9 is designated as a zinc transporter partly due to homology with other related proteins, but the possibility that it also plays a role in the transport of other metal ions, as is the case for other SLC30 transporters, has not yet been fully explored.

The reported SLC30A9 protein–truncating variants are likely to mediate a loss-of-function effect through nonsense-mediated decay. Furthermore, both the initially reported in-frame deletionand the novel missense variant reported here are also likely to exert a loss-of-function effect as they are predicted to affect the cation efflux domain of the protein and will potentially disrupt the structure of its transmembrane helices. We hypothesize that this would impair the regulation of zinc transport (and any other ions for which the protein may act as a transporter), leading to disturbances of metal ion homeostasis at the cellular or subcellular level.

We note that childhood-onset renal impairment does not appear to be an essential feature of BLPS and has only been identified in 2 of our probands (F1(II-2) and F2). Sensorineural hearing impairment has now been reported in individuals from 4 affected families—our families 1, 2, and 4, as well as the individual described by Kleyner et al.(Table 2).

### Hyperzincaemia and hypercalprotectinaemia: a new disorder of zinc metabolism [^136e3b1e]. Lancet (2002). Excellent credibility.

Background

Calprotectin (complex of S100A8 and S100A9) is the major calcium and zinc-binding protein of phagocytes. We report a new syndrome with recurrent infections, inflammation, and hyperzincaemia associated with excessively high plasma concentrations of calprotectin.

Methods

We measured calprotectin in plasma and protein fractions by ELISA assay and zinc by atomic absorption spectrometry. Plasma proteins were fractionated by size exclusion chromatography and electrophoresis. Mass spectra of purified proteins were determined by MALDI-TOFMS.

Findings

We assessed five patients, two of whom are related. All patients had much the same biochemical findings of hyperzincaemia (77-200 micromol/L, reference range 11-18 micromol/L) and raised plasma calprotectin concentrations (1.4-6.5 g/L, reference range <1 mg/L). All patients presented with recurrent infections, hepatosplenomegaly, anaemia, and evidence of systemic inflammation. Three patients had cutaneous inflammation and three presented in infancy with severe growth failure. Size exclusion chromatography showed that zinc and calprotectin were associated in a broad fraction with molecular weight range 100-300 kDa. Analysis by electrophoresis and mass spectrometry showed that the patients' protein contained normal S100A8 and S100A9 subunits.

Interpretation

Dysregulation of zinc metabolism associated with accumulation in plasma of S100A8 and S100A9 defines a new disease, which encompasses a pathological role for dysregulation of two members of the large S100 protein family.

### Zinc supplements for treating thalassaemia and sickle cell disease [^325127c5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Haemoglobinopathies, inherited disorders of haemoglobin synthesis (thalassaemia) or structure (sickle cell disease), are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality throughout the world. The WHO estimates that, globally, 5% of adults are carriers of a haemoglobin condition, 2.9% are carriers of thalassaemia and 2.3% are carriers of sickle cell disease. Carriers are found worldwide as a result of migration of various ethnic groups to different regions of the world. Zinc is an easily available supplement and intervention programs have been carried out to prevent deficiency in people with thalassaemia or sickle cell anaemia. It is important to evaluate the role of zinc supplementation in the treatment of thalassaemia and sickle cell anaemia to reduce deaths due to complications.

Objectives

To assess the effect of zinc supplementation in the treatment of thalassaemia and sickle cell disease.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings.Date of most recent search: 01 February 2013.

Selection Criteria

Randomised, placebo-controlled trials of zinc supplements for treating thalassaemia or sickle cell disease administered at least once a week for at least a month.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors assessed the eligibility and risk of bias of the included trials, extracted and analysed data and wrote the review. We summarised results using risk ratios or rate ratios for dichotomous data and mean differences for continuous data. We combined trial results where appropriate.

Main Results

We identified nine trials for inclusion with all nine contributing outcome data. Two trials reported on people with thalassaemia (n = 152) and seven on sickle cell anaemia (n = 307).In people with thalassaemia, in one trial, the serum zinc level value showed no difference between the zinc supplemented group and the control group, mean difference 47.40 (95% confidence interval -12.95 to 107.99). Regarding anthropometry, in one trial, height velocity was significantly increased in patients who received zinc supplementation for one to seven years duration, mean difference 3.37 (95% confidence interval 2.36 to 4.38) (total number of participants = 26). In one trial, however, there was no difference in body mass index between treatment groups.Zinc acetate supplementation for three months (in one trial) and one year (in two trials) (total number of participants = 71) was noted to increase the serum zinc level significantly in patients with sickle cell anaemia, mean difference 14.90 (95% confidence interval 6.94 to 22.86) and 20.25 (95% confidence interval 11.73 to 28.77) respectively. There was no significant difference in haemoglobin level between intervention and control groups, at either three months (one trial) or one year (one trial), mean difference 0.06 (95% confidence interval -0.84 to 0.96) and mean difference -0.07 (95% confidence interval -1.40 to 1.26) respectively. Regarding anthropometry, one trial showed no significant changes in body mass index or weight after one year of zinc acetate supplementation. In patients with sickle cell disease, the total number of sickle cell crises at one year were significantly decreased in the zinc sulphate supplemented group as compared to controls, mean difference -2.83 (95% confidence interval -3.51 to -2.15) (total participants 130), but not in zinc acetate group, mean difference 1.54 (95% confidence interval -2.01 to 5.09) (total participants 22). In one trial at three months and another at one year, the total number of clinical infections were significantly decreased in the zinc supplemented group as compared to controls, mean difference 0.05 (95% confidence interval 0.01 - 0.43) (total number of participants = 36), and mean difference -7.64 (95% confidence interval -10.89 to -4.39) (total number of participants = 21) respectively.

Authors' Conclusions

According to the results, there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to indicate any benefit of zinc supplementation with regards to serum zinc level in patients with thalassaemia. However, height velocity was noted to increase among those who received this intervention.There is mixed evidence on the benefit of using zinc supplementation in people with sickle cell disease. For instance, there is evidence that zinc supplementation for one year increased the serum zinc levels in patients with sickle cell disease. However, though serum zinc level was raised in patients receiving zinc supplementation, haemoglobin level and anthropometry measurements were not significantly different between groups. Evidence of benefit is seen with the reduction in the number of sickle cell crises among sickle cell patients who received one year of zinc sulphate supplementation and with the reduction in the total number of clinical infections among sickle cell patients who received zinc supplementation for both three months and for one year.The conclusion is based on the data from a small group of trials,which were generally of good quality, with a low risk of bias. The authors recommend that more trials on zinc supplementation in thalassaemia and sickle cell disease be conducted given that the literature has shown the benefits of zinc in these types of diseases.

### Wilson's disease: an update [^f4ac64f9]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Wilson's disease (WD) is an inborn error of copper metabolism caused by a mutation to the copper-transporting gene ATP7B. The disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is characterized by excessive copper deposition, predominantly in the liver and brain. Diagnosis of the condition depends primarily on clinical features, biochemical parameters and the presence of the Kayser-Fleischer ring, and a new diagnostic scoring system has recently been proposed. Mutations in ATP7B can occur anywhere along the entire 21 exons, which makes the identification of gene defects particularly challenging. Identification of carriers and presymptomatic family members of affected individuals is achieved by polymerase-chain-reaction-based marker analysis. The traditional treatment for WD is based on copper chelation with agents such as D-penicillamine, but use of this drug has been questioned because of reported side effects. The use of agents such as trientine and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate has been advocated, although results of long-term trials are awaited. In selected cases, orthotropic hepatic transplantation can reverse the basic metabolic abnormality in WD and improve both hepatic and neurological symptoms. Studies of the underlying defects in ATP7B and its suspected modifiers ATOX1 and COMMD1 are expected to unravel the disease's genotype-phenotype correlation, and should lead to the design of improved drugs for ameliorating the suffering of patients.

Acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruptions, not related to zinc deficiency, have been rarely reported in some metabolic disorders. Reported patients usually had low levels of essential amino acids, particularly isoleucine. Here we report a girl who first presented with an acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption and eventually had the diagnosis of Hartnup disease with a normal isoleucine level. We discuss the probable cause of her skin lesions and the differential diagnosis with pellagra.

### Zinc deficiency in children with environmental enteropathy-development of new strategies: report from an expert workshop [^c1e0f113]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Zinc deficiency is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. The WHO/UNICEF strategy for zinc supplementation as adjunctive therapy for diarrhea is poorly implemented. A conference of experts in zinc nutrition and gastrointestinal disorders was convened to consider approaches that might complement the current recommendation and what research was needed to develop these approaches. Several key points were identified. The design of novel zinc interventions would be facilitated by a better understanding of how disturbed gut function, such as environmental (or tropical) enteropathy, affects zinc absorption, losses, and homeostasis. Because only 10% of zinc stores are able to be rapidly turned over, and appear to be rapidly depleted by acute intestinal illness, they are probably best maintained by complementary regular supplementation in a primary prevention strategy rather than secondary prevention triggered by acute diarrhea. The assessment of zinc status is challenging and complex without simple, validated measures to facilitate field testing of novel interventions. Zinc bioavailability may be a crucial factor in the success of primary prevention strategies, and a range of options, all still inadequately explored, might be valuable in improving zinc nutrition. Some therapeutic actions of zinc on diarrhea seem attributable to pharmacologic effects, whereas others are related to the reversal of deficiency (ie, nutritional). The distinction between these 2 mechanisms cannot be clarified given the insensitivity of serum zinc to identify subclinical deficiency states. Why zinc seems to be less effective than expected at all ages, and ineffective for secondary prevention of diarrhea in children <12 mo of age, remains unclear. It was concluded that a reframing of the current recommendation is warranted with consideration of how to better optimize and deliver zinc and whether to provide a complementary public health primary prevention zinc strategy. This requires careful consideration of the zinc product to be used as well as strategies for its delivery.

### Acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica from a ketogenic diet [^a72ab31f]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) is a condition of zinc deficiency and is either congenital or acquired. The congenital form is caused by an autosomal recessive genetic defect resulting in decreased zinc absorption, whereas acquired AE is due to reduced zinc intake or absorption from other causes. Up to one-third of some populations in developing countries are at risk of zinc deficiency, which has been associated with increased disease and stunting of growth in children.In developed countries, AE most commonly affects individuals with risk factors such as alcoholism, vegetarianism, premature infancy, and malnourishment.Here, we present a unique case of AE in a child on a ketogenic diet.

Wilson disease (WD) dietary management—infants aged 0–6 months: There is no RDA for copper intake for infants; an adequate intake (AI) level of 0.2 mg/day is set for infants, and young infants with WD should receive breastmilk or standard formula to meet these needs. Breastmilk on average provides 0.36 mg/L copper, and first‑year intake can range 480–1020 mL/day (16–34 oz/day), bringing copper intake to 0.19–0.41 mg/day, which is 96%–204% of the AI. If breastmilk is not an option, infant formulas are an appropriate alternative with average copper content 0.4–0.6 mg/L, giving 0.18–0.57 mg/day on standard formula (90%–285% of the AI); partially and fully hydrolyzed formulas run slightly higher still. Both copper and zinc are required for early postnatal development, and those who feed an unaffected infant born to a mother who has WD must also take into account the potential adverse effects of WD medication secreted into breastmilk.

Zinc

General aspects

Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient which has an important role in the functioning of hundreds of enzymes, in insulin metabolism and acts as an efficient antioxidant. Consequently many observations relate to Zn deficiency, although clinical signs of deficiency are quite modest. Zn is found mainly in cereals, meat, seafood and dairy products. Although usual intakes of Zn are harmless, the range between safe and unsafe is relatively narrow. Because Zn has no storage form, there is need for a constant supply and Zn availability to cells is particularly well regulated, albeit poorly understood. Zn absorption can be reduced by iron or inflammatory bowel diseases. It is transported across cell membranes via two families of transporters: ZnT which stimulate Zn efflux and Zip which stimulate its influx. Over 20 transporters are identified and most are intracellular. The implication and regulation of Zn transporters in chronic diseases has been reviewed. Concerning metabolic diseases (insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, diabetes), Zn is considered important mainly because 1) it plays a major role in the stabilization of insulin hexamers and the pancreatic storage of the hormone and 2) it is an efficient antioxidant, while oxidative stress is considered to be a main component in initiation and progression of insulin resistance and diabetes.

Severe Zn deficiency is not frequent but concerns have nevertheless been raised about Zn levels in diabetic patients because of increased excretion due to polyuria. Whereas some studies have reported Zn deficiency in type 2 diabetes [,-], others failed to find significant differences with healthy subjects. In type 1 diabetes, Zn deficiency is expected to increase the pancreatic damage. A recent report described reduced levels of Zn in obese, insulin resistant subjects. Lower Zn plasma concentrations were found in type 2 diabetics but they were not related to glycemic status or diabetes duration or components of the metabolic syndrome. Interestingly it was reported that diabetic have elevated levels of copper and it could be that copper is in fact linked to metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Nevertheless, reduced Zn levels in diabetics appear to be related to increased risk for coronary artery disease and mortality.

### Severe infant rash resistant to therapy due to zinc deficiency [^527f5606]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Pediatric skin diseases are a common presenting complaint to emergency medicine physicians but often pose a significant diagnostic challenge. Skin eruptions that are unusually severe for the diagnosis in question, lasting beyond the typical time of resolution, or not responding to conventional therapy should raise concern of a misdiagnosis. We present the case of a severe rash not responding to conventional atopic dermatitis therapy that led to a diagnosis of transient neonatal zinc deficiency. Clinicians caring for children should be aware of zinc deficiency and its corresponding clinical presentation, because it is readily treatable and may lead to the avoidance of unnecessary treatments and prevention of serious complications.

Micronutrients

Most medical foods available in the United States are supplemented with vitamins and minerals to provide micronutrients in amounts that meet recommendations. When a medical food does not contain adequate amounts of micronutrients or an individual's intake is inadequate, a vitamin and mineral supplement should be included in the treatment plan. Additional biochemical monitoring (Table 2) is indicated when there is a question about inadequate or excessive intake.

Minerals, including copper, manganese, and zinc,as well as selenium,have been reported as being deficient in the diet for PAH deficiency. However, these minerals are now added to most medical foods. Iron deficiency (without anemia) has been reported among individuals with PAH deficiency, and routine evaluation of iron status is recommended.

Vitamin B 12, as well as B 6, deficiency may occur if there is inadequate consumption of medical food or animal protein.Severe megaloblastic anemia has been reported in adolescents and adults with PAH deficiency who are off-diet.Because B 12 deficiency can cause neurological deficits,including memory loss, such symptoms could be erroneously attributed to high blood PHE. Supplementation is indicated if B 12 markers remain low.In addition, higher than normal plasma B 12 levels have been reported in some on-diet individuals with PAH deficiency.Both excessive and inadequate intakes of the fat-soluble vitamins A and D are possible with inappropriate medical food intake. Monitoring for clinical signs with subsequent biochemical testing is warranted.

There may be concerns with bone density that are unique to PAH deficiency. Decreased bone mineral density and bone mineral content, indicated by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, have been noted. Osteopenia, defined as bone mineral density one or more SDs from normal reference for age and sex, is also seenbut cannot be attributed to vitamin D concentrations alone. Some reports indicate that bone density is associated with adherence to nutrition therapy,whereas others note decreased density across groups, stratified by calcium and phosphorus intakesand/or as compared with controls without PAH deficiency.Aberrant findings in protein markers, correlating to bone resorption or absorption, have also been reported. Further research is warranted to look at the effects of PAH deficiency itself, PAH deficiency management, and nutrient intake on bone density.

Anthropometrics

With adequate nutrient intake, appropriate growth can be expected for individuals with PAH deficiency. Impaired linear growth has been noted in children with PAH deficiency who had low plasma prealbumin concentrations.There is conflicting evidence as to whether or not the rates of overweight and obesity in children with PAH deficiency are similar to those of the general population.

### Zinc sulfate [^d6a1315e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5 Recommended Dosage and Monitoring in Adult and Pediatric Patients

• Zinc sulfate injection provides 1 mg/mL, 3 mg/mL, or 5 mg/mL of zinc.

• Zinc sulfate injection in a concentration of 1 mg/mL is recommended for use in pediatric patients, particularly those weighing less than 12 kg.

• The dosage of zinc sulfate injection should be individualized based on the patient’s clinical condition, nutritional requirements, and the contribution of oral or enteral zinc    intake.

 Adults 

The recommended adult dosage is 3 mg/day for metabolically stable patients, with potential need for a higher daily dosage in monitored patients with small bowel fluid loss or excess stool or ileostomy output.

 Pediatric Patients 

The recommended pediatric dosage is shown in Table 1 by age and estimated weight. The dosages in Table 1 are general recommendations intended for most pediatric patients.

However, based on clinical requirements, some patients may require a higher dosage.

 Table 1: Recommended Dosage of Zinc Sulfate Injection for Pediatric Patients by Age and Estimated Weight

*Term neonates have higher requirements in the first 3 months of life

 Monitoring 

Monitor zinc concentrations during treatment. Also monitor patients clinically for signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency, especially in pediatrics. Zinc concentrations may vary depending on the assay used and the laboratory reference range. The collection, processing, and storage of the blood samples for zinc analysis should be performed according to the laboratory’s sample requirements. Zinc concentrations in hemolyzed samples are falsely elevated due to release of zinc from erythrocytes. The lower end of the reported range in healthy adults in serum is 60 mcg/dL.

In keratinocytes specifically, zinc is important for wound healing, cellular survival, and inhibition of inflammation, offering a biological rationale to the chronic inflammatory and necrotic pathology of NAE when deficient.Rather than a causal relationship with HCV, NAE may instead be driven by a zinc deficiency that ultimately mediates development of the dermatologic condition. Although hepatic dysfunction can be commonly triggered by HCV, sarcoidosis is the likely cause in our patient, which may have led to his mildly low zinc serum levels.

Zinc levels in active NAE skin lesions have been found to be significantly lower than unaffected skin of the same patient, reinforcing a possible role for zinc in NAE pathophysiology.Additionally, zinc monotherapy has shown clinical improvement in NAE patients with and without zinc serum abnormalities, suggesting a critical role for zinc in the pathophysiology of NAE regardless of serum evidenced deficiency. Although many patients with NAE have normal zinc serum levels, the protein-bound zinc that is found in plasma comprises only 0.1% of total body zinc, meaning an abnormal zinc value is a rather delayed sign of deficiency.Other theories behind NAE pathophysiology and hepatocellular dysfunction are rooted in hyperglucagonemia as the predominate source of dermatologic necrosis.The interplay between low zinc levels and other metabolic abnormalities induced by hepatocellular dysfunction may likely all contribute to NAE development; however, the necessity versus sufficiency of the specific elements in this pathogenesis conceptual model remains unclear.

This is a case report of a 4-month-old full-term, fully breastfed boy who presented with a persistent periorificial and groin rash associated with poor weight gain and irritability. His serum zinc level was low. The mother's breast milk zinc level was found to be low despite her serum zinc levels being normal, confirming the diagnosis of transient neonatal zinc deficiency. Mutational analysis revealed a novel mutation in the mother's SLC30A2 gene, which encodes a zinc transporter expressed in mammary gland epithelial cells.

### Malnutrition and a rash: think zinc [^86b19fcc]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Endemic zinc deficiency is recognised to be a common and serious problem in developing countries. However, it may be seen in routine practice in the UK, and can be easily overlooked. Malnutrition from any cause in conjunction with an undiagnosed cutaneous problem should alert the clinician to the diagnosis. Investigations may be unreliable, and if in doubt, a therapeutic trial of zinc supplementation is indicated. We present three cases of malnourished patients, in whom zinc deficiency was diagnosed after the development of cutaneous features. The malnutrition resulted from alcoholism in two cases and anorexia nervosa in the third. The heterogeneity of underlying causes of zinc deficiency is discussed, along with its effects, treatment and zinc homeostasis.

### Zinc acetate (Galzin) [^ca34c294]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Zinc acetate is not recommended for the initial therapy of symptomatic patients because of the delay required for zinc-induced increase in enterocytic metallothionein and blockade of copper uptake. Symptomatic patients should be treated initially, using chelating agents. During initial therapy, neurological deterioration may occur as stores of copper are mobilized. Once initial therapy has been completed, and the patient is clinically stable, maintenance treatment with zinc acetate can be considered, but patients may be continued on initial therapy as clinically indicated.

Information for Patients

Patients should take GALZIN® on an empty stomach, at least one hour before or two to three hours after meals. Capsules should be swallowed whole, not opened or chewed. In the rare event of gastric intolerance of zinc, generally occurring with the morning dose, this dose may be taken between breakfast and lunch. Patients must be clinically monitored to determine the adequacy of zinc acetate therapy. Since strict adherence to the zinc regimen is essential for optimal control of copper distribution and metabolism, the physician must reinforce the need for compliance at each contact with the patient.

Monitoring Patients

Patients should be monitored primarily by assessment of existing signs and symptoms of Wilson’s disease and 24-hour urine copper. Neuropsychiatric evaluations including speech as well as liver function tests including bilirubin and aminotransferases, should be done as appropriate.

### Zinc deficiency: a spot diagnosis [^8397da3c]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

The most common cause of Bitot’s spots is vitamin A deficiency. This was excluded as vitamin A serum levels were found to be normal. Serum zinc, however, was decreased (0.51 mg/L; normal range 0.75–1.30 mg/L). 2 weeks after oral zinc supplementation (zinc sulfate 200 mg three times a day), serum zinc increased (1.04 mg/L) and the lesion and accompanying ocular surface symptoms disappeared completely after 6 weeks (figure 2). No primary cause of the zinc deficiency could be found by an internist.

Figure 2 
Complete resolution of the Bitot’s spot, 6 weeks after zinc supplementation.

A Bitot’s spot is a textbook clinical sign that is traditionally associated with vitamin A (retinol) deficiency.In this case, however, it was related to an isolated zinc deficiency. Zinc is a trace element that is needed in the hepatic synthesis of retinol-binding protein, which mobilises retinol from the liver.Zinc deficiency can therefore lead to lower bioavailability of vitamin A. Other mechanisms have been proposed as well.There is little recent research on the synergistic effects between vitamin A and zinc. One study suggests that vitamin A deficiency in children is managed best by supplementing both vitamin A and zinc, instead of vitamin A alone.Our patient, however, solely had a zinc deficiency, which responded promptly to zinc supplementation. The lack of a clear cause for zinc deficiency in this patient is a limitation of this case report. Causes of zinc deficiency include decreased intake (such as a vegetarian diet), malabsorption (eg, gastrointestinal disorders, such as Crohn’s disease), cirrhosis and sickle cell disease.

### MEDNIK syndrome: a novel defect of copper metabolism treatable by zinc acetate therapy [^fcc7a349]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

MEDNIK syndrome-acronym for mental retardation, enteropathy, deafness, neuropathy, ichthyosis, keratodermia-is caused by AP1S1 gene mutations, encoding σ1A, the small subunit of the adaptor protein 1 complex, which plays a crucial role in clathrin coat assembly and mediates trafficking between trans-Golgi network, endosomes and the plasma membrane. MEDNIK syndrome was first reported in a few French-Canadian families sharing common ancestors, presenting a complex neurocutaneous phenotype, but its pathogenesis is not completely understood. A Sephardic-Jewish patient, carrying a new AP1S1 homozygous mutation, showed severe perturbations of copper metabolism with hypocupremia, hypoceruloplasminemia and liver copper accumulation, along with intrahepatic cholestasis. Zinc acetate treatment strikingly improved clinical conditions, as well as liver copper and bile-acid overload. We evaluated copper-related metabolites and liver function retrospectively in the original French-Canadian patient series. Intracellular copper metabolism and subcellular localization and function of copper pump ATP7A were investigated in patient fibroblasts. Copper metabolism perturbation and hepatopathy were confirmed in all patients. Studies in mutant fibroblasts showed abnormal copper incorporation and retention, reduced expression of copper-dependent enzymes cytochrome-c-oxidase and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase, and aberrant intracellular trafficking of Menkes protein ATP7A, which normalized after rescue experiments expressing wild-type AP1S1 gene. We solved the pathogenetic mechanism of MEDNIK syndrome, demonstrating that AP1S1 regulates intracellular copper machinery mediated by copper-pump proteins. This multisystem disease is characterized by a unique picture, combining clinical and biochemical signs of both Menkes and Wilson's diseases, in which liver copper overload is treatable by zinc acetate therapy, and can now be listed as a copper metabolism defect in humans. Our results may also contribute to understand the mechanism(s) of intracellular trafficking of copper pumps.

### Reproductive health and liver disease: practice guidance by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases [^03ffda9f]. Hepatology (2021). High credibility.

Wilson disease (WD) and reproductive health—AASLD guidance notes that WD is associated with mutation in the ATP7B gene, which encodes the copper transporting P-type ATPase ATP7B, and that ATP7B is expressed on the ovaries, uterus, and placenta with possible direct effects of copper on pregnancy outcomes. Women with WD have higher rates of infertility and spontaneous abortion, and oligomenorrhea and amenorrhea may indicate some degree of hormonal dysregulation. Preconception counseling is desirable to optimize pregnancy outcomes. Treatment of WD includes chelating agents such as trientine and D-penicillamine to increase urinary copper excretion or zinc salts to reduce intestinal copper absorption; D-penicillamine is associated with teratogenicity in humans, trientine is associated with teratogenicity in nonhuman animals, and zinc is not teratogenic. Limited cohort data are cited, including a large cohort of 282 pregnant women with WD, 162 of whom were on chelating agents.

### The potential and limitations of intrahepatic cholangiocyte organoids to study inborn errors of metabolism [^a841215c]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Medium credibility.

3.4 Liver specific metabolism

Other metabolic processes, such as metal‐ and drug‐metabolism, are liver specific. Wilson disease (277900) represents a genetic defect in copper metabolism. Mutations in the gene ATPase copper transporting beta (ATP7B, 606882) lead to accumulation of toxic amounts of copper in the liver. Patients currently rely on life‐long symptomatic treatment. Therapy development would benefit from organ and patient specific models, that can model the more than 500 different known mutations in ATP7B.

Therefore, we investigated copper metabolism in patient ICOs (c.[1288dup(;)1288dup] p.[(Ser430Lysfs*5)(;)(Ser430Lysfs*5)]). Under normal culture conditions no morphological, growth rate, nor longevity differences were observed between healthy control (HC) and Wilson disease patient ICOs (Figure 2D, 0.03 mM CuCl 2). However, patient ICOs showed increased sensitivity to copper treatment, with an IC 50 of 0.28 mM CuCl 2 compared to 0.33 mM in HC ICOs (Figure 2C,D). Putatively, similar storage diseases may be phenotyped with ICOs through provision of relevant substrates.

### Zinc sulfate injection (zinc sulfate) [^f7bc96ac]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.5	Recommended Dosage and Monitoring in Adult and Pediatric Patients

Zinc sulfate injection provides 1 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL of zinc.
Zinc sulfate injection in a concentration of 1 mg/mL is recommended for use in pediatric patients, particularly those weighing less than 12 kg.
The dosage of zinc sulfate injection should be individualized based on the patient’s clinical condition, nutritional requirements, and the contribution of oral or enteral zinc intake.

Adults

The recommended adult dosage is 3 mg/day for metabolically stable patients, with potential need for a higher daily dosage in monitored patients with small bowel fluid loss or excess stool or ileostomy output.

Pediatric Patients

The recommended pediatric dosage is shown in Table 1 by age and estimated weight. The dosages in Table 1 are general recommendations intended for most pediatric patients. However, based on clinical requirements, some patients may require a higher dosage.

Table 1: Recommended Dosage of Zinc Sulfate Injection for Pediatric Patients by Age and Estimated Weight

*Term neonates have higher requirements in the first 3 months of life

Monitoring

Monitor zinc concentrations during treatment. Also monitor patients clinically for signs and symptoms of zinc deficiency, especially in pediatrics. Zinc concentrations may vary depending on the assay used and the laboratory reference range. The collection, processing, and storage of the blood samples for zinc analysis should be performed according to the laboratory’s sample requirements. Zinc concentrations in hemolyzed samples are falsely elevated due to release of zinc from erythrocytes. The lower end of the reported range in healthy adults in serum is 60 mcg/dL.

### Genome-wide association study of toxic metals and trace elements reveals novel associations [^0541c6bb]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Another example is that the P(1B)-type heavy metal ATPases (HMAs) are diverse in terms of tissue distribution, subcellular localization and metal specificity. Functional studies of HMAs have shown that these transporters can be divided into two subgroups based on their metal–substrate specificity: a copper (Cu)/silver (Ag) group and a zinc (Zn)/cobalt (Co)/cadmium (Cd)/lead (Pb) group.

However, it is not known if all of these mechanisms involved in the ADME of metals are operating and valid in humans. One way to examine such mechanisms in humans is to evaluate if genetic variation in the genes encoding the critical proteins involved in these ADME steps are related to circulating levels of relevant metals. Mendelian disorders such as Wilson's disease and Menke's disease are examples of direct genetic influence on metal ADME steps. The former is an autosomal recessive disorder involving a mutation in ATP7B gene, causing abnormal hepatic copper deposition, and the latter is an X-linked recessive disorder involving a mutation in the ATP7A gene, causing copper deficiency. Additionally, hereditary factors and environmental factors together have been suggested to influence blood levels of cadmium and lead in healthy individuals. A twin study using genetic linkage analysis showed significant linkage for lead and suggestive linkage for cadmium, mercury, selenium and zinc.

Today, we have the ability to investigate genetic variation at multiple sites across all chromosomes through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This approach has the advantage that associations with genetic variation mapping to any gene, not just some pre-specified subset, can be investigated. So far, there has been one GWAS that examined the levels of copper, zinc and selenium, revealing several loci with biologically relevant genes. For example, the locus showing association with zinc contains genes for the Zn-containing enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and the locus associated with selenium includes genes involved in the metabolism of sulphur-containing amino acids. Identification of these loci may help to identify population subgroups that may be more susceptible to deficiency or toxicity.

Using a GWAS approach, our study aimed to investigate genetic variants associated with serum levels of a range of metals in a cohort of 949 individuals. The metals were aluminium, cadmium, cobalt, copper, chromium, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lead and zinc. To our knowledge, this is the first GWAS studying serum levels of toxic metals, in a comprehensive manner and not restricted to trace elements.

### SLC30A9 mutation affecting intracellular zinc homeostasis causes a novel cerebro-renal syndrome [^72a5e2fc]. Brain (2017). Low credibility.

Few cerebro-renal syndromes have been described to date. Perez et al. identify a novel autosomal recessive cerebro-renal syndrome in a consanguineous Bedouin kindred, caused by a mutation in SLC30A9. The mutation disrupts the role of SLC30A9 in Zn 2+ transport, leading to impaired regulation of cytosolic zinc homeostasis.

### Inborn errors of enzymes in glutamate metabolism [^0229ead8]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2020). Medium credibility.

In all other inborn errors of glutamate metabolism, glutamate concentrations have not been reported, therefore precluding conclusions. If these are presumed to be normal, this points to the regulation of glutamate levels by other enzymes of glutamate metabolism. The pathogenesis of these other errors is often ascribed to deficiency or toxic accumulation of substrate or product of the defective enzyme, as explicated in the main text above. However, as seen in GLS hyperactivity, normal concentrations of glutamate and glutamine in plasma and CSF do not exclude local alterations, which might contribute to the pathophysiology as well. Even more locally oriented, in the patient with GABAT deficiency no abnormalities were detected in plasma or CSF, but locally decreased glutamate concentrations in the semi‐oval region of the brain were detected on brain MRS and might possibly play a pathogenic role. 90 Also, mildly decreased glutamine concentrations or mildly increased glutamate concentrations may have been detected but attributed to pre‐analytical conditions rather than a reflection of in vivo metabolism as glutamine is easily spontaneously interconverted into glutamate. The study of glutamate and glutamine and their ratio in carefully collected body fluids—as performed in GS deficiency and GLS hyperactivity—may elucidate alterations of glutamate and glutamine levels in inborn errors of glutamate metabolism. Several in vivo techniques are available to study glutamate and glutamine separately, for an overview see Ramadan et al. 91

Inborn errors of metabolism that have a related biochemical ground often have similar clinical features. Drawing phenotypic parallels of all 17 inborn errors (both HPO phenotypic subclasses and their correlated superclasses) provided interesting leads towards similar pathophysiology. Neurologically, developmental delay, seizures and hypotonia are more common in these inborn errors compared to the prevalence in Mendelian disorders in general and in disorders with metabolic abnormalities, in line with the role of glutamate as the main neurotransmitter (Table S1). It is however remarkable that the patient with GLS hyperactivity and glutamate excess in the brain did not develop seizures. Glutamate induces myelination of axons and it is therefore not surprising that white matter and myelin abnormalities are frequently reported in patients with an inborn error of glutamate metabolism. 2 Although this is an a‐specific sign seen in many disorders, it is more prevalent in glutamate related disorders than in all Mendelian disorders (14‐16×) and in all disorders with metabolic abnormalities (9‐13×). Patients with inborn errors of glutamate metabolism caused by defects of glutamate receptors and transporters also present with neurological disorders, like seizures, ataxia and developmental delay, underlying the clinical importance of balanced glutamate metabolism for the human brain. 14

### Glycerophospholipids: roles in cell trafficking and associated inborn errors [^ef3ec1b0]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2025). Medium credibility.

7 Discussion

Knowledge about inborn errors of GPL metabolism is rapidly expanding. To 38 such conditions at the time of writing (Table 1) should be added the 34 other genes of PI or PItds metabolism that have been associated with clinical phenotypes. Several steps of GPL metabolism and several enzymes with GPL substrates are not yet associated with an inborn error.

A vast literature clearly shows the physiological importance of GPLs for vesicular trafficking, cell signalling, blood clotting, apoptosis, and other vital pathways, but it does not suggest general methods for the diagnosis and treatment of genetic deficiencies of these pathways. No single biochemical test currently identifies a large fraction of these conditions. Broad molecular testing has been the main method of discovery and diagnosis.

The known inborn errors of GPL metabolism permit a bird's‐eye clinical overview of the field. Neurological, ophthalmological, and skeletal features are recurrent findings. Neurological signs occur in 23 of the 38 conditions listed in Table 1 (61%), particularly intellectual deficiency (16/38, 42%) and spastic paraplegia (12/38, 32%). Perhaps the high prevalence of these features reflects the importance of GPLs for vesicular trafficking at synapses and in motoneuron axons. Epilepsy (8 conditions, 21%), basal ganglia pathology (8, 21%) and peripheral neuropathy (5,13%) are recurrent findings.

Eye involvement affecting photoreceptor cells and/or the neuroretina occurs in 14/38 conditions (37%), with retinopathy in 5, optic atrophy in 6, maculopathy in 2, and rod‐cone dystrophy in one. Skeletal dysplasia occurs in three inborn errors of GPL metabolism, two involving PS metabolism. Although the numbers are small, the association of skeletal dysplasia plus retinal or optic nerve disease should evoke an inborn error of GPL metabolism.

In patients presenting with more than one of the above findings, a disorder of GPL metabolism is a consideration. However, the clinical presentations of most patients would not strongly suggest a specific diagnosis. For the foreseeable future, molecular testing, such as exome or genome sequencing, will likely remain the principal diagnostic method.

### Galactorrhea with menstrual irregularity: something other than a prolactinoma? [^bec4a34d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Discussion

Also known as progressive hepatolenticular degeneration, Wilson’s disease is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism first described by Kinnier Wilson in 1912. Since that time, our understanding of the disease has steadily progressed, so that we can now trace the disease to a mutation in the ATP7B gene on chromosome 3. Although inherited, Wilson’s disease can result from over 300 mutations of the gene in question, and affected individuals may be heterozygous for two different mutations that manifest in combination. Consequently, a positive family history is often not elicited, as was the case in our patient.

Clinical manifestations of the condition can be diverse including both acute disease such as fulminant hepatitis and Coomb’s negative hemolytic anemia, and chronic disease such as hepatic cirrhosis, Parkinsonism-like syndromes, neuropsychiatric illness and aminoaciduria. Diagnosis depends on the demonstration of a copper-overload state as evidenced by the presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings within the cornea, and high levels of urinary and hepatic copper, estimated respectively by a 24-hour sample, and by means of liver biopsy. Treatment modalities include elemental zinc, which interferes in copper absorption, and chelators such as d-penicillamine, trientine and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate. Liver transplantation remains the only curative therapy available.

Inborn errors of metabolism—Inborn errors of metabolism are an important diagnostic consideration in children with hepatic steatosis; there are more than 1000 recognized monogenic disorders with an estimated incidence of 1 in 2500 births, many presenting with liver dysfunction or hepatomegaly in infancy or the first 3 years of life, and suspicion should be heightened if there are atypical signs such as early onset particularly before 3 y of age, rapidly progressive or acute disease, absence of overweight/obesity, or additional involvement of other organ systems, particularly neurological signs or symptoms.

### Dystonia [^bb36ec43]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Combined dystonia

Dystonia with another movement disorder and/or occurrence of other neurological or systemic features is referred to as combined dystonia. As there are many potential causes, syndromic associations are used to narrow down diagnostic possibilities. Deciding which movement disorders or other features dominate is key. For example, foot dystonia and mild parkinsonism in a young adult is suggestive of a genetic cause of Parkinson’s disease (such as a LRRK2 mutation). Many centres now have panels of genetic tests that are performed according to the specific syndromic clustering.

Two treatable disorders are worth emphasising: Wilson’s disease and dopa responsive dystonia. Dystonia and liver abnormalities and/or psychiatric symptoms raise the possibility of Wilson’s disease.This autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism has a mean age of 18 for neurological presentation, often with a mixed movement disorder.Full blood count, liver function tests, and serum caeruloplasmin are useful initial investigations.Twenty four hour urine copper and slit lamp examination (for Kayser-Fleischer rings) can be organised if serum caeruloplasmin is low, neuro-imaging is abnormal, or there is a high index of suspicion for Wilson’s disease. First line treatments include copper chelating agents that increase urinary copper excretion or zinc salts that inhibit the intestinal absorption of copper. Dopa responsive dystonia encompasses a group of genetically and clinically heterogeneous disorders that often manifest with diurnal fluctuation of dystonia (worse at end of the day).Most patients have a deficiency in an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of dopamine, and some forms are dramatically responsive to low doses of levodopa. The typical age of onset is in early childhood with a progressive limb dystonia. However, owing to the variability of presentation and difficulties making a laboratory diagnosis, many patients with young onset dystonia (<40 years) may receive a trial of levodopa to assess for the possibility of dopa responsive dystonia.
