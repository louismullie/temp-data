## Question

Chagas' disease in the US

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about Chagas' disease in the United States. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the current epidemiology and geographic distribution. Then, I should verify transmission pathways and high-risk populations. Next, I will examine clinical manifestations and natural history. After that, I need to check the diagnostic algorithm for acute, congenital, and chronic infection. I will then review screening recommendations and practical implementation. Finally, I will assess treatment indications, monitoring for cure or reactivation, and systemic public health challenges, ensuring each step is supported by appropriate references.

> Let me first confirm the epidemiological framework and burden in the United States, because that anchors downstream screening and diagnostic thresholds. Estimates suggest roughly 238,000 to 350,000 people living with Trypanosoma cruzi infection in the US, with fewer than 1% identified through formal diagnosis, and the burden is concentrated among persons born in Mexico, Central America, and South America who now reside in the US [^1163w9qZ] [^112Cu9vL] [^113EKwnd]. Hold on, I should verify the domestic transmission context before concluding this is only an imported disease, because autochthonous transmission has been documented in multiple states and surveillance is not uniform nationally [^116VnSKN].

> I need to ensure the geographic distribution and surveillance status are characterized precisely. Autochthonous human infections have been identified in eight states including California, Arizona, Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, and Arkansas, yet Chagas disease is not nationally notifiable and reporting varies across jurisdictions, with notifiability in eight states and two California county health jurisdictions, implying likely underrecognition of locally acquired disease [^116VnSKN]. Wait, let me verify Texas specific data, because it illustrates the point about detection gaps; Texas documented 50 probable or suspected autochthonous cases during 2013–2023, predominantly central and southern, which likely underestimates true occurrence given low testing and awareness [^1139wnHx].

> Next, I will examine transmission pathways in the US setting, while remembering that relative contributions differ from Latin America. Vector-borne transmission exists but appears comparatively inefficient because triatomines in the US less frequently colonize human dwellings, and only a small number of confirmed human vector transmissions have been reported despite high T. cruzi infection prevalence in vectors and wildlife reservoirs, suggesting underrecognition rather than absence of risk [^116VnSKN] [^117AnkuE]. Congenital transmission occurs in about 1% to 5% of pregnancies in infected mothers and is epidemiologically important in the US, with modeling estimates of dozens to several hundred cases annually in the context of at-risk immigration patterns, and this route grows in relative importance where vector control is effective [^114A2mML] [^113Eb1f5] [^112i3xFJ]. I should confirm transfusion and transplantation risks in the modern era; universal blood donor screening began in 2007 and rapidly identified hundreds of infected donations, and donor-derived organ transmission has been documented and requires informed screening and vigilant post-transplant monitoring due to reactivation risk with immunosuppression [^112bWaof] [^111nniSo] [^111ZwPc9] [^115vKgpZ].

> Now I will stratify high-risk populations for targeted screening, but wait, I should verify that family contact tracing is included because shared exposures and vertical transmission cluster risk. Priority groups include adults born or with prolonged residence in endemic Latin American regions, family members of confirmed cases, women of childbearing age who could vertically transmit, and immunosuppressed individuals including transplant recipients and people with HIV who are at risk of severe reactivation; occupational and peridomestic exposures in US endemic areas, such as among hunters and agricultural workers, can also elevate risk and justify testing when exposure history is compelling [^113EKwnd] [^115R7oM6] [^114A2mML] [^112fnVD1] [^115vKgpZ] [^111ijAqZ] [^116VnSKN].

> I will now examine clinical manifestations and disease course so I can link phenotype to testing and management. The acute phase often presents as asymptomatic or as non-specific febrile illness after an incubation of about one to two weeks, lasting up to two months, with infants at highest risk for severe myocarditis and meningoencephalitis, which I should not overlook in neonatal evaluations [^117PQtmC]. Let me consider the chronic phase next; about 20% to 40% of chronically infected persons develop complications over decades, dominated by Chagas cardiomyopathy with heart failure, arrhythmias, thromboembolism and sudden death, while gastrointestinal megasyndromes occur in a smaller subset and neurologic complications include stroke which may be the first manifestation in some patients [^112Cu9vL] [^114Pv642] [^113PGraY] [^114AkXS8].

> I should confirm prognosis to contextualize treatment urgency. In advanced Chagas cardiomyopathy, long-term mortality is very high, with reports of approximately 85% mortality at ten years, and the US burden translates to tens of thousands of disability-adjusted life-years annually, supporting aggressive early detection and prevention of progression [^1163w9qZ] [^112Cu9vL].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic algorithm for chronic infection, and I need to double-check that no single serologic test suffices. Chronic T. cruzi infection requires two distinct serologic assays using different antigenic targets or methods to confirm infection, with a third distinct assay if results are discordant, which is standard because sensitivity and specificity vary by assay and by region of origin of infection, and FDA-cleared IgG options exist but with performance variability especially in Mexican and some Central American lineages [^112uAjCQ] [^113v42vJ] [^116ZiyqC] [^116GaC1D]. Wait, let me verify the implication; parallel or serial strategies should be adapted to prevalence and resource constraints, but definitive diagnosis still hinges on concordant positivity on two tests, which I must document carefully in the chart [^112uAjCQ].

> For acute and congenital infection, I need to check that direct and molecular detection take precedence due to high parasitemia in early life. In suspected acute or congenital cases, microscopic examination of fresh anticoagulated blood or buffy coat and Giemsa-stained smears can show motile trypomastigotes, while PCR is highly useful for early detection and for monitoring reactivation in immunosuppressed patients, recognizing that maternal IgG can persist up to 9 to 12 months and therefore serology for infants should be timed or repeated appropriately to confirm or exclude congenital infection, and congenital infection is managed as an acute infection for therapeutic purposes [^116s6NLb] [^112Sfp7v] [^115vKgpZ] [^116FU6ze] [^116ZiyqC] [^111iVExX].

> Once infection is confirmed, I should ensure systematic evaluation for end-organ involvement because it guides staging and treatment choices. Baseline and annual electrocardiography are recommended to detect cardiomyopathy progression, with echocardiography and ambulatory ECG monitoring used to assess structure and arrhythmia burden as indicated, and barium studies considered when gastrointestinal symptoms suggest megaesophagus or megacolon, and abnormal findings warrant cardiology or gastroenterology referral for comprehensive management [^112Y5DTL] [^1158nLPf].

> I will now synthesize screening recommendations, but hold on, I should reconcile seemingly conflicting guidance on pregnancy screening. Provider-directed screening is recommended for adults with epidemiologic risk from Latin American endemic regions, for family members of confirmed cases, and especially for women of childbearing age because treating before pregnancy can prevent congenital transmission and is cost-saving at very low maternal prevalence thresholds, while screening of at-risk people with HIV at entry to care and monitoring of transplant recipients with serial PCR are also recommended due to reactivation risks [^113EKwnd] [^112fnVD1] [^111PUboK] [^115vKgpZ]. Wait, I initially recalled that routine universal screening in pregnant US residents is not recommended by CDC unless exposure to triatomines is a concern, which remains true, but targeted programs for at-risk pregnant people are supported by cost-effectiveness analyses and calls to add Chagas screening to domestic refugee and humanitarian entrant evaluations, so local policy and risk assessment should guide implementation while acknowledging the national gap in uniform recommendations [^112VydWH] [^115LSaZS] [^112VhyZT]. I should also confirm healthcare setting screening; universal blood donor screening has been in place since 2007, organ donors from endemic areas should be targeted for screening with restrictions on heart donation, and recipients of organs from infected donors require scheduled molecular monitoring to preempt donor-derived disease [^112bWaof] [^115Hd9TA] [^115vKgpZ].

> Next, I will evaluate treatment protocols and indications, and I need to verify the strength of recommendations by clinical context. Benznidazole and nifurtimox are the available trypanocidal agents, strongly recommended for all acute infections including congenital cases where cure exceeds 90% in the first year, and for all children with chronic infection, while in adults aged roughly 19 to 50 without advanced cardiac disease treatment is generally offered, with individualized consideration in older adults without organ damage, and treatment is not recommended in those with established specific organ damage due to unclear benefit in that stage [^113AwtjD] [^117MdZV9] [^114eL7cs] [^112bWaof] [^112socL3] [^116Ht96U] [^117FSsJV]. Wait, let me reconsider one nuance; while some summaries state both drugs are available, practical access and tolerability can influence choice and adherence, so counseling and close follow-up for adverse effects remain essential to achieve therapeutic goals [^115e4ueB].

> I should confirm how to monitor for cure and for reactivation because misinterpretation is common. Serologic titers decline slowly and seroreversion can require years to decades, making it the accepted but delayed test of cure, whereas in immunosuppressed patients serial quantitative PCR is critical to detect reactivation early, since a single positive PCR does not prove reactivation in chronic infection but falling cycle thresholds and rising parasite loads do, prompting preemptive therapy [^116CvTzt] [^115vKgpZ].

> I will now identify major systemic barriers that could derail otherwise sound clinical plans, and I need to check provider awareness data. Many US clinicians do not routinely consider Chagas disease in at-risk patients, with notable gaps among obstetrician-gynecologists that threaten prevention of congenital transmission, and health system reviews show incomplete diagnostic workups and low confirmatory testing rates that delay care and miss opportunities for early treatment [^111fvAMG] [^111D4GeA]. Hold on, I should also verify surveillance gaps; Chagas disease is not nationally notifiable, underreporting is likely, and the annual economic impact of undiagnosed and untreated disease exceeds one hundred million dollars, underscoring the need for improved surveillance and targeted screening in high-burden regions [^116VnSKN] [^1171paCC] [^112Cu9vL].

> Bringing this together for practical care, I should double-check that the clinical flow is clear and implementable. For any patient born in or with long residence in Latin America or with relevant US exposures, I should obtain two distinct serologic assays and, if discordant, a third, then stage with ECG and echocardiography if indicated, and offer treatment based on age and organ involvement while arranging long-term serologic follow-up; in pregnancy and newborn care, I should screen mothers at risk per local protocols, evaluate exposed infants with microscopy and PCR early and repeat serology at 9 to 12 months if initially negative due to maternal IgG, treat congenital or acute infections promptly, and in immunosuppressed or transplant settings, coordinate serial PCR monitoring to detect reactivation early, while counseling all patients on vector avoidance in US endemic areas and engaging public health partners where reporting is required [^112uAjCQ] [^112Y5DTL] [^113AwtjD] [^116s6NLb] [^116ZiyqC] [^115vKgpZ] [^116VnSKN].

---

Chagas disease in the US is primarily a **chronic infection in Latin American immigrants** [^112Cu9vL], with an estimated 240,000–350,000 cases [^115e4ueB] and 20%–30% risk of cardiomyopathy or gastrointestinal disease [^114Pv642]. Autochthonous transmission is **rare but documented** in southern states [^116VnSKN], with 29 confirmed and 47 suspected local cases (2000–2018). Diagnosis requires **two distinct serologic tests** [^112uAjCQ] [^113v42vJ], and early treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox is most effective [^117MdZV9]; chronic cases need ongoing cardiac monitoring [^112Cu9vL] [^1158nLPf]. Screening is recommended for immigrants from endemic areas [^112Cu9vL], women of childbearing age [^112fnVD1], and first-degree relatives of confirmed cases [^115R7oM6]. Major barriers include low provider awareness [^111fvAMG], limited access to care [^112Nj9i2], and lack of routine screening, especially for congenital infection [^114A2mML] [^114Sgr3j].

---

## Epidemiology and prevalence

- **Estimated burden**: 240,000–350,000 cases [^112Cu9vL], mainly among immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America [^115e4ueB].
- **Autochthonous cases**: 29 confirmed and 47 suspected [^116VnSKN] in eight states (California, Arizona, Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, Arkansas) from 2000–2018 [^115smeVR].
- **Congenital transmission**: Estimated 63–315 cases [^116xEgJQ] annually [^113Eb1f5].

---

## Transmission routes

- **Vector-borne**: triatomine bugs in the southern US [^116VnSKN]; autochthonous transmission is rare but documented.
- **Congenital**: Mother-to-child transmission occurs in the US [^114A2mML] [^114eL7cs].
- **Blood transfusion and organ transplantation**: Blood transfusion [^111nniSo] and organ transplantation [^111ZwPc9]: Rare due to screening, but still possible.

---

## Clinical manifestations

Clinical manifestations include an **acute phase** that is often asymptomatic or mild [^117PQtmC], though severe cases such as myocarditis or meningoencephalitis are rare [^112Sfp7v]. In the **chronic phase**, 20%–30% [^114Pv642] of patients develop cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, heart failure, or gastrointestinal disease (megacolon, megaesophagus) [^115e4ueB] [^112Cu9vL].

---

## Diagnostic methods

- **Serologic testing**: Two distinct assays (ELISA, IFA) required for chronic infection [^112uAjCQ] [^113v42vJ].
- **Acute infection**: PCR [^112uAjCQ] or direct parasitological methods [^112Sfp7v].
- **Congenital infection**: PCR or microscopic examination [^116s6NLb]; serology not recommended due to maternal antibody persistence [^116FU6ze].

---

## Treatment options

Treatment options include **antiparasitic therapy** with benznidazole or nifurtimox [^117MdZV9], which is most effective in acute or early chronic infection [^115e4ueB]. Chronic disease management involves **cardiac monitoring, ECG, echocardiogram** [^1158nLPf], and specialist referral as needed [^112Cu9vL].

---

## Public health challenges

Key public health challenges include **underdiagnosis due to low provider awareness** [^111fvAMG] and limited screening [^112Nj9i2]. Additional barriers include restricted access to care for immigrants and uninsured populations [^114Sgr3j] and limited, inconsistent surveillance across states [^117PQtmC].

---

## Current public health initiatives

Current public health initiatives include **blood donor screening** [^111nniSo] in place since 2007. Targeted screening is recommended for **immigrants from endemic areas, women of childbearing age, and first-degree relatives** [^112Cu9vL] [^112fnVD1] [^115R7oM6]. Provider education aims to increase awareness [^111fvAMG] and improve diagnosis [^112Nj9i2].

---

Chagas disease in the US is a significant public health issue [^112Cu9vL], primarily affecting immigrants from Latin America [^114Pv642]. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent **severe complications** [^117PQtmC], but barriers such as low awareness and limited access to care persist [^114Sgr3j].

## References

### Chagas disease [^115e4ueB]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

Chagas disease, caused by infection with the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a leading neglected tropical disease in the United States. An estimated 240,000 to 350,000 persons in the United States are infected, primarily immigrants from Mexico, Central America, and South America, where the disease is endemic. The parasite is transmitted by the triatomine bug but can also be passed through blood transfusion, organ transplant, or congenitally. Approximately 30% of infected persons later develop cardiac and/or gastrointestinal complications. Health care providers should consider screening at-risk patients with serologic testing. Early diagnosis and treatment with benznidazole or nifurtimox can help prevent complications.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^112Cu9vL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Chagas disease (CD) is a neglected tropical disease of substantial public health importance. In the United States, more than 300,000 people are estimated to be infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the protozoan that causes the disease. The vast majority were infected while living in endemic areas of Latin America and are in a chronic phase of the disease. While most remain asymptomatic for life, 20%–30% eventually develop Chagas cardiomyopathy, and up to 10% may suffer damage to the gastrointestinal or nervous systems. CD causes a heavy burden of morbidity and mortality, resulting in an estimated global annual loss of more than 800,000 disability-adjusted life-years, including more than 27,000 annually in the United States. Only about 1% of estimated US cases have been identified, usually through blood donor screening, and most people are unaware they are infected with T. cruzi. Provider-directed screening is essential because early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes and limit mother-to-child transmission. Screening programs for CD are highly cost-effective, but with the paradigm of limited testing, estimated total annual healthcare costs from CD in the United States exceed $130,000,000. However, not all US providers are aware of CD and testing poses certain challenges.

The Pan American Health Organization has provided overall guidelines on diagnosis and management of CD. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website also provides specific recommendations for healthcare providers. Here we examine considerations for screening and diagnosis of CD in the United States.

### Evaluation and management of congenital Chagas disease in the United States [^114A2mML]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2019). Low credibility.

Chagas disease is underappreciated as a health concern in the United States. Approximately 40,000 women of childbearing age living in the United States have chronic Chagas disease. Most of them are unaware that they have an infection that is transmissible to their offspring. The estimated US maternal-to-infant transmission rate of *Trypanosoma cruzi* is 1% to 5%. Ten percent to 40% of neonates with congenital *T. cruzi* infection have clinical signs consistent with a congenital infection, but no findings are unique to Chagas disease. If left untreated, 20% to 40% of infants with Chagas disease will later develop potentially fatal cardiac manifestations. Molecular testing can confirm the diagnosis in neonates. Treatment is well tolerated in infancy and usually results in cure. Screening of at-risk women during pregnancy can identify maternal infection and allow early assessment and treatment for congenital *T. cruzi* infection.

Awareness in the medical community

Low awareness of Chagas disease (CD) extends to the medical community, creating a major barrier for patients seeking treatment. Because CD is not routinely screened in primary care, people usually find out they are infected after giving blood. By 2007, most states began screening blood donations for Trypanosoma cruzi to prevent infections through transfusions. Sofia was one of the first cases detected after she donated blood in 1997, but she was unable to initiate treatment until 2008:

I thought I had a doctor, a clinic who could help me. But Chagas taught me this is not always so. Because nobody, I mean nobody knew what Chagas disease is. My doctor didn't know and he sent me to a specialist, and every week I went to a different doctor, but nobody knew what to do with me. And following a year, I gave up.

When donors test positive for Trypanosoma cruzi, they receive notification from the Red Cross through a letter or phone call and are advised to consult their doctor. Several respondents described struggles in obtaining help from the medical system after their blood tested positive because providers are unaware of what CD is:

They explained to me I had been bitten by a chinche [kissing bug] and not to worry too much, to talk to my doctor, but I started to search and nobody could help me because they didn't know what the disease was. (Denver, 42, El Salvador)

Victoria was diagnosed after giving blood in El Salvador and began getting treatment from an infectious disease specialist, riding from her village to the clinic in the back of a truck. However, she had to stop because she could no longer continue.

### Parasites - American trypanosomiasis (also known as Chagas disease) [^112uAjCQ]. CDC (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chagas disease, more specifically with respect to serology, the CDC 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining serologic tests for antibodies to the parasite for the diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease. It is advised to obtain at least two tests using different techniques, such as ELISA and IFA, and detecting antibodies to different antigens, because a single test is not sufficiently sensitive and specific to make the diagnosis.

### Chagas disease, an endemic disease in the United States [^116VnSKN]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). High credibility.

Autochthonous human T. cruzi infections have been identified in eight states: California, Arizona, Texas, Tennessee, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, and Arkansas. A systematic literature review found 29 confirmed and 47 suspected cases of locally acquired Chagas disease during 2000–2018; shared risk factors included rural residence, history of hunting or camping, and agricultural or outdoor work. These numbers likely greatly underrepresent underlying human infections. The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists created a surveillance case definition for T. cruzi infection and Chagas disease in June 2024; however, human Chagas disease is not a nationally notifiable disease, and thus the true prevalence or incidence of autochthonous Chagas disease remains unknown. Human Chagas disease is a notifiable disease in eight states (Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Washington) and two California health jurisdictions (San Diego County and Los Angeles County).

### An estimate of the burden of Chagas disease in the United States [^116xEgJQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2009). Low credibility.

Chagas disease causes the highest burden of any parasitic disease in the Western hemisphere. By applying published seroprevalence figures to immigrant populations, we estimate that 300,167 individuals with *Trypanosoma cruzi* infection live in the United States, with 30,000–45,000 cardiomyopathy cases and 63–315 congenital infections annually. *T. cruzi* causes a substantial disease burden in the United States.

### Serological diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease: Is it time for a change [^114VxVht]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2016). Low credibility.

Chagas disease has spread to areas that are nonendemic for the disease with human migration. Since no single reference standard test is available, serological diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease requires at least two tests. New-generation techniques have significantly improved the accuracy of Chagas disease diagnosis by the use of a large mixture of recombinant antigens with different detection systems, such as chemiluminescence. The aim of the present study was to assess the overall accuracy of a new-generation kit, the Architect Chagas (cutoff, ≥ 1 sample relative light units/cutoff value [S/CO]), as a single technique for the diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease. The Architect Chagas showed a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval, 99.5 to 100%) and a specificity of 97.6% (95% CI, 95.2 to 99.9%). Five out of six false-positive serum samples were a consequence of cross-reactivity with *Leishmania* spp., and all of them achieved results of < 5 S/CO. We propose the Architect Chagas as a single technique for screening in blood banks and for routine diagnosis in clinical laboratories. Only gray-zone and positive sera with a result of ≤ 6 S/CO would need to be confirmed by a second serological assay, thus avoiding false-positive sera and the problem of cross-reactivity with *Leishmania* species. The application of this proposal would result in important savings in the cost of Chagas disease diagnosis and therefore in the management and control of the disease.

### Chagas disease infection prevalence and vector exposure in a high-risk population of Texas hunters [^111ijAqZ]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Low credibility.

Chagas disease, caused by the vector-borne parasite *Trypanosoma cruzi*, remains one of the most significant neglected tropical diseases affecting the Americas. Identifying high-risk populations is important for understanding Chagas disease transmission and directing public health resources. We recently hypothesized that Texas hunters may be at an elevated risk for contracting Chagas disease because of opportunities for vector exposure and contact with the blood of infected reservoirs.

To assess their unique exposure risks, we conducted a statewide screening program of Texas hunters. A total of 885 study participants were interviewed and tested for *T. cruzi* infection; 18 screened positive on a rapid, point-of-care test; however, none were found positive through confirmatory testing. We did find a high prevalence of reported direct contact with wildlife blood as well as triatomine and other arthropod disease vectors. This large-scale screening program represents a novel approach to better understand the vector-borne disease risk in this unique population.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Chagas disease [^117FSsJV]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Chagas disease, particularly concerning antitrypanosomal therapy, the PAHO/WHO 2019 guidelines recommend not offering trypanocidal therapy to adult patients with chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection and specific organ damage.

### What do we know about Chagas disease in the United States [^1138B8At]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2016). Low credibility.

Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects more than 5 million people worldwide, leading to serious heart and gastrointestinal disease in a proportion of chronically infected patients. Important modes of transmission include vector-borne, congenital, and through blood transfusion or organ transplant from an infected donor. Vector-borne transmission of Chagas disease occurs in the Americas, including the southern half of North America, where the specific vector insects (triatomines), T. cruzi, and infected reservoir mammalian hosts are found.

In the United States, there are estimated to be at least 300,000 cases of chronic Chagas disease among people originally from countries in Latin America where Chagas disease is endemic. Fewer than 30 cases of locally acquired infection have been documented in the United States, although a sylvatic transmission cycle has been known to exist in this country for at least a century. Studies defining risks for locally acquired infection and effective prevention strategies are needed to help prevent domestic transmission of T. cruzi. To help address Chagas disease in the United States, improved health-care provider awareness and knowledge, better tools for screening and diagnosing patients, and wider availability of treatment drugs are needed.

### Mother-to-child transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi [^112i3xFJ]. Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society (2014). Low credibility.

Among the world's most neglected tropical diseases, Chagas disease is vector-borne and caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. T. cruzi infection is endemic to South and Central America as well as Mexico. Due to population migration, T. cruzi is increasingly becoming a public health problem in nonendemic settings. Success with vector control strategies has led to a relative increase in the burden attributable to congenital transmission of T. cruzi. In endemic settings, approximately 5% of infected pregnant women transmit to their offspring. Congenital T. cruzi infection is generally asymptomatic, and parasitological and serological testing is required for diagnosis. This review highlights research gaps with a focus on:

- **Improving screening, diagnostic, and treatment options**: Efforts are needed to enhance the tools available for managing and addressing congenital T. cruzi infection.

- **Designing epidemiologic studies to understand risk factors for congenital T. cruzi**: Research is crucial to identify and understand the factors contributing to the transmission of the disease from mother to child.

### Chagas disease and stroke [^114AkXS8]. The Lancet Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Chagas disease is a neglected infectious disease in the tropics and an emerging health problem in Europe and the United States. In the past decade, a link has been recorded between ischaemic stroke and Trypanosoma cruzi infection in several epidemiological studies, and an increase in stroke prevalence is expected with the ageing of the population infected with T. cruzi in Latin America. Heart failure, mural thrombus, left ventricular apical aneurysm, and several types of cardiac arrhythmias are associated with stroke in Chagas disease. Stroke could also be the first sign of Chagas disease in asymptomatic patients and those with mild systolic dysfunction, so patients with stroke who are from endemic regions should be screened for T. cruzi infection. The most frequent stroke syndrome seen in patients with Chagas disease is partial anterior circulation infarction. Stroke recurrence has been estimated to occur in 20% of patients, and secondary prevention measures include chronic anticoagulation in cardioembolic chagasic stroke. So far, no studies have been done to assess the effect of chagasic stroke on vascular dementia.

### Chagas disease surveillance activities - seven states, 2017 [^115R1ynv]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

Chagas disease, a potentially life-threatening condition caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, has become a concern in the United States due to human emigration from Latin America, where Chagas disease is endemic. It is estimated that as many as 8 million people living in Mexico, and Central and South America have Chagas disease. Most cases of Chagas disease in the United States are chronic infections; however, rare cases of acute congenital infections and autochthonous vectorborne transmission have been reported.

To understand how data are collected and used, a review of state-level public health surveillance for Chagas disease was conducted through semistructured interviews with health officials in six states: Arizona, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas, where Chagas disease is reportable, and one state, Massachusetts, where it was previously reportable. States implemented surveillance in response to blood donor screening for Chagas disease and to identify the route of disease transmission.

Many states reported primarily chronic cases and had limited ability to respond to local transmission because acute cases were infrequently reported. Surveillance remains important in states with large populations of immigrants or frequent travelers from countries with endemic disease and for states with a risk for local transmission. Surveillance efforts can also help increase awareness among providers and assist in linking patients with Chagas disease to treatment to help prevent cardiac and gastrointestinal complications.

Consequences of Nonendemic Label

The classification of the United States as nonendemic for Chagas disease has led to critical issues such as low physician and veterinary awareness of possible human and animal exposure to *T. cruzi*, which prevents appropriate differential diagnosis and could subsequently contribute to potential underreporting. The nonendemic label is coupled with the portrayal of Chagas disease as an essentially foreign or an exclusively travel-related issue in the media. Such misrecognition impedes effective disease management and underscores the need to reevaluate Chagas disease's endemic status.

We propose that Chagas disease in the United States be classified as endemic, and more specifically, hypoendemic, acknowledging its presence and effects while emphasizing the need for heightened awareness and surveillance. We recognize that the burden of locally acquired human disease in the United States does not approach the levels seen in some regions of Latin America, but we hope that labeling the United States as Chagas disease–endemic will also raise awareness for this neglected disease across its endemic range. This reclassification reflects a broader understanding of epidemiology that aligns with a One Health approach, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. It also acknowledges the United States' foundational and ongoing dependence on the highly variable modes of human migration and settlement. By incorporating ecological, social, and geographic relationships, this shift paves the way for expanding research and interventions.

### Congenital Chagas disease: Estimating the potential risk in the United States [^113Eb1f5]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2009). Low credibility.

Economic hardship and political turmoil have stimulated the migration of a Trypanosoma cruzi-infected population from Latin American countries to the United States and Europe, resulting in cases of Chagas disease transmitted through blood, organ donation, and vertical transmission. Hispanic immigrant women of reproductive age in the United States from Chagas disease-endemic countries numbered 2,384,644 in 1990 and 5,841,538 in 2000. Considering the prevalence rates for T. cruzi infection in their countries of origin and the risk of newborns from infected mothers acquiring congenital infection as 1.33% and 5%, it is estimated that the number of T. cruzi-infected newborns was 85–318 in 1990 and 166–638 in 2000. Diagnosis of infection in the mother and at-risk newborns is crucial. A high rate of cure, almost 100%, can be achieved when offspring are treated early. Health authorities, professional associations, physicians, and Hispanic groups should give greater attention to this issue.

### Regarding perspective piece from July 2016 "What do we know about Chagas disease in the United States?" [^113vTBzK]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Dear Sir:

We are interested in the Perspective Piece, "What do we know about Chagas disease in the United States?" written by Montgomery and others that was published recently in the journal. A study of Trypanosoma cruzi prevalence and incidence that we performed in 2000 among 11,430 cardiac surgery patients in two large hospitals in Houston and Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore provides additional data on the epidemiology of Chagas disease in the United States. This study was not cited in the perspective by Montgomery and others.

We detected six patients (0.05%) who were repeatedly reactive by enzyme immunoassay and were subsequently confirmed as positive by radioimmunoprecipitation assay. All six had received blood transfusions. However, four of the six patients with available pretransfusion samples were positive prior to their surgery. Five of the six patients were Hispanic, and one patient had never traveled outside of the United States. He was a consulting geologist who had a history of frequent field trips to rural areas of Texas where previous cases of autochthonous T. cruzi had been reported.

Two of the patients in this study had undergone heart transplants, including the patient who had not traveled outside the United States. Preserved tissues from hearts removed at surgery were tested by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of parasite DNA, and in both cases, were positive for T. cruzi. None of the medical providers, including their cardiologists, surgeons, and pathologists, had considered the diagnosis of Chagas disease in any of these patients.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^113EKwnd]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Chagas disease affects an estimated 326,000–347,000 people in the United States and is severely underdiagnosed. A key barrier is the lack of awareness and clarity regarding screening and diagnosis. This article provides straightforward recommendations aimed at simplifying the identification and testing of people at risk for U.S. healthcare providers.

A multidisciplinary working group of clinicians and researchers with expertise in Chagas disease agreed on six main questions and developed recommendations based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, following a review of the relevant literature on Chagas disease in the United States.

Individuals who were born or resided for prolonged periods in endemic countries of Mexico and Central and South America should be tested for Trypanosoma cruzi infection. Family members of people who test positive should also be screened. Women of childbearing age with risk factors and infants born to seropositive mothers deserve special consideration due to the risk of vertical transmission. Diagnostic testing for chronic T. cruzi infection should be conducted using two distinct assays.

Increasing provider-directed screening for T. cruzi infection is key to addressing this neglected public health challenge in the United States.

### Chagas disease: Epidemiology and barriers to treatment [^114rDdRH]. The American Journal of Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic human infection by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, known as Chagas disease, results in heart failure and death in 20%-30% of affected individuals. Recognition and treatment of the infection are difficult. Disease control requires the elimination of the vector, the reduviid bug, that infests housing of poor quality in endemic areas. In South America, control has largely succeeded in the Southern Cone countries — Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, southern Brazil and São Paulo, and Paraguay — but lags severely in the Northern Triangle (Central American) countries: El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.

Surges in poverty and violence in Central America have increased immigration of persons at risk for Chagas disease to the United States, and immigrants with Chagas disease face multiple barriers to obtaining effective care. These include issues with financing and payment for health care, limited effectiveness of screening and diagnosis, limited effectiveness of available treatment, and lack of provider awareness, public health education, and research. Each of these barriers presents a unique public health challenge.

### Vector blood meals and Chagas disease transmission potential, United States [^117AnkuE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Chagas disease is a vector-borne disease caused by *Trypanosoma cruzi* trypanosomes. Although these parasites are rarely transmitted by insects in the United States, there is concern that vector transmission may increase. Chagas disease, endemic to most of Latin America, can be transmitted to mammals by over 130 species of blood-feeding insect vectors (subfamily Triatominae). In the United States, the most common result of a triatomine bite is an allergic reaction, including anaphylaxis, elicited in sensitized persons. Despite only 7 cases of vector transmission to humans reported in the United States, *T. cruzi* trypanosomes are present in more than 20 wildlife species. In Latin America, 8–10 million persons are infected with these parasites, and an estimated 300,000 of the approximately 13 million persons from disease-endemic areas now living in the United States carry the parasite. Although vector transmission of *T. cruzi* trypanosomes is a minimal risk, 9 of the 11 triatomine species in the United States are potential vectors, and parasite transmission could increase because of climate change.

One critical aspect of transmission is parasite reservoirs; hence, the epidemiologic importance of identifying animal sources of the vectors' blood meals, the likelihood of these vectors also feeding on humans, and their incidence of *T. cruzi* infection. Blood meals consumed by insect vectors have been detected by using several molecular techniques, but assays are challenging because of degradation of the blood in the vector's gut, PCR inhibition, the often small size of a blood meal, and the difficulty of distinguishing blood sources.

### Molecular mechanisms of myocarditis caused by Trypanosoma cruzi [^115KaAmc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to examine American trypanosomiasis, or Chagas disease, which is a lifelong and persistent infection caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. It represents the most significant cause of morbidity and mortality in South and Central America. Due to immigration and additional risks from blood transfusion and organ transplantation, the number of reported cases of Chagas disease has recently increased in Europe and the United States. The disease results from a moderate to intense, lasting inflammatory response that triggers local expression of inflammatory mediators and activates and recruits leukocytes to various tissues to eliminate the parasites.

Recent findings indicate that this long-term inflammatory process leads to biochemical, physiological, and morphological alterations, and clinical changes in the digestive, nervous, and cardiac systems (e.g. myocarditis, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, autonomic dysfunctions, and microcirculatory disturbances). Indeed, the pathogenesis of Chagas disease is intricate and multifactorial. The roles of the parasite and the immune response in initiating and maintaining the disease remain controversial.

In summary, this review discusses the knowledge of strategies employed by the parasite to persist in the host and host defense mechanisms against Trypanosoma cruzi infection. These interactions can result in either equilibrium (absence of the disease) or disease development, particularly in the cardiac system.

### Chagas cardiomyopathy — where do we stand following a hundred years [^116TfpBU]. Progress in cardiovascular diseases (2010). Low credibility.

A hundred years from its description, Chagas cardiomyopathy remains a challenging disease. Although successful vector-control strategies have decreased the incidence of Chagas disease in several Latin American countries, both migration to urban areas and immigration have spread the disease worldwide; now, blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and vertical transmission are a concern. The pathogenesis of Chagas cardiomyopathy involves complex host-parasite interactions, where low-grade but incessant systemic infection and triggered autoimmune reaction are the main mechanisms for its development, with the contribution of autonomic damage and microvascular disturbances.

Chagas cardiomyopathy is the most important clinical presentation of Chagas disease and comprises a wide range of manifestations, including heart failure, arrhythmias, heart blocks, sudden death, thromboembolism, and stroke. Recently, simple clinical prognostic scores have been developed to identify high-risk patients and help with management. The treatment of Chagas cardiomyopathy focuses mostly on managing heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolism. The role of specific antiparasitic therapy in the chronic form is not yet defined, and a randomized trial is now underway to address this crucial point. In this article, we review the main clinical aspects of Chagas cardiomyopathy and underscore some upcoming challenges for the appropriate control, diagnosis, and management of this complex disease.

### Prevalence of Chagas disease among family members of previously diagnosed patients in Los Angeles, California [^115R7oM6]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Low credibility.

Chagas disease (CD), caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, affects over 6 million people globally, including more than 300,000 in the United States. It imposes a greater burden in terms of disability-adjusted life-years than any other parasitic disease in the Americas, where it is a leading cause of heart failure. Timely treatment with antitrypanosomal drugs improves morbidity and mortality from CD and eliminates the potential for congenital transmission. This treatment must be administered while patients are still in the asymptomatic, indeterminate phase of the disease, when they are likely unaware of the infection, underscoring the importance of systematic screening programs. However, less than 1% of people with the disease in the United States have received diagnosis and etiologic treatment, highlighting an urgent need to implement effective interventions for screening and detecting cases.

In the United States, CD is concentrated among people born in Latin America, although local transmission and infection are periodically documented. Blood donations have been screened since 2007; however, routine screening does not occur within primary care centers or during pre- and postnatal care, and many US physicians are unfamiliar with CD. The World Health Organization recommends screening relatives of T. cruzi-infected individuals. Congenital transmission affects the distribution of CD within families; in addition, relatives, including siblings and spouses, are likely to share exposures and risk factors, resulting in an elevated risk of CD. In this investigation, we assess the prevalence…

### Chagas disease diagnostic practices at four major hospital systems in California and Texas [^111D4GeA]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Low credibility.

Chagas disease (CD) is a parasitic disease that affects approximately 300,000 people living in the United States. CD leads to cardiac and/or gastrointestinal disease in up to 30% of untreated people. However, end-organ damage can be prevented with early diagnosis and antiparasitic therapy.

- **Methods**: We reviewed electronic health records of patients who underwent testing for CD at four hospital systems in California and Texas between 2016 and 2020. Descriptive analyses were performed as a needs assessment for improving CD diagnosis.

- **Results**: In total, 470 patients were tested for CD. Cardiac indications made up more than half (60%) of all testing, and the most frequently cited cardiac condition was heart failure. Fewer than 1% of tests were ordered by obstetric and gynecologic services. Fewer than half (47%) of patients had confirmatory testing performed at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

- **Discussion**: Four major hospital systems in California and Texas demonstrated low overall rates of CD diagnostic testing, testing primarily among older patients with end-organ damage, and incomplete confirmatory testing. This suggests missed opportunities to diagnose CD in at-risk individuals early in the course of infection, when antiparasitic treatment can reduce the risk of disease progression and prevent vertical transmission.

### Molecular typing of Trypanosoma cruzi isolates, United States [^115ZsKrE]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

In Latin America, an estimated 10–12 million persons are infected with Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease and a major contributor to heart disease within the region. Autochthonous human infections in the United States have been reported in six persons, with the most recent case reported from Louisiana. In addition, the parasite is euryxenous; it is able to infect a broad range of hosts, including domestic dogs, woodrats, raccoons, opossums, armadillos, and nonhuman primates.

Associations between host species and parasite genotype have been suggested and are important in understanding the domestic and sylvatic cycles of T. cruzi. Although studies conducted on U.S. isolates suggest an association between T. cruzi genotype and host, these studies were limited because of low sample numbers, low host diversity, and narrow geographic distribution. In the investigation, we used the molecular typing scheme proposed by Brisse et al, in which isolates are delineated into one of the six lineages (types I and IIa–IIe) on the basis of size polymorphisms of several PCR markers. We then expanded characterization of U.S. isolates and show additional evidence for correlations between host specificity and genotype of T. cruzi.

### Chagas disease after organ transplantation — United States, 2001 [^111ZwPc9]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2002). Low credibility.

Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is caused by the protozoan parasite *Trypanosoma cruzi*. Chagas disease following solid-organ transplantation has occurred in Latin America, where the disease is endemic, but it has not been previously reported in the United States. This report describes three cases in the United States of *T. cruzi* infection associated with the transplantation of organs from a single donor. The CDC and U.S. organ transplantation organizations will consider whether to recommend screening potential donors for *T. cruzi* infection and, if so, which donors to screen, how to screen, and what actions to take if the screening tests are positive.

### Chagas disease and the US blood supply [^112bWaof]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

To describe new developments in blood-bank screening and management of patients with chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection in the United States.

- **Recent findings**: The first US Food and Drug Administration licensed serological test for T. cruzi blood screening went into widespread usage in January 2007. More than 500 confirmed T. cruzi-infected donations were detected by mid-June 2008. Until recently, drug therapy was recommended for acute and congenital infections, but seldom for chronic infections, which were believed to respond poorly. However, in the 1990s, efficacy was demonstrated in two placebo-controlled trials of benznidazole in children with chronic T. cruzi infection. In 2006, a nonrandomized, nonblinded trial demonstrated that benznidazole treatment may slow progression of cardiomyopathy and decrease mortality risk in infected adults.

- **Summary**: Blood-bank screening will continue to detect T. cruzi-infected donors. Based on recent data, antitrypanosomal treatment is recommended for all acute and congenital T. cruzi infections, reactivated infection, and chronically infected children. In adults aged 19–50 years without advanced heart disease, treatment should generally be offered; management should be individualized for older adults. Less toxic, more effective drugs, a sensitive, specific assay for response to treatment, and improved healthcare access would promote more effective management.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^115vKgpZ]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Screening and diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients

Immunosuppressed hosts with acute *T. cruzi* infection (e.g. donor-derived infection) are at risk for severe manifestations such as meningoencephalitis or acute myocarditis. Recipients of blood components, organs, or tissue from an infected donor should be monitored by serial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in blood weekly during months 1–2, every 2 weeks during months 3–4, monthly during months 5–6 post-transfusion or transplant, then based on the clinical scenario.

Immunosuppression in an individual with chronic *T. cruzi* infection may lead to reactivation, characterized by a return to high levels of parasitemia. In transplant recipients, manifestations of reactivation vary depending on host characteristics and immunosuppressive regimen; reactivation myocarditis can be life-threatening. A positive PCR result does not constitute a diagnosis of reactivation, because this occurs in patients with chronic infection in the absence of reactivation. Serial monitoring by quantitative PCR, using a schedule similar to that outlined above, provides early detection of reactivation based on falling cycle threshold (Ct) values, reflecting rising parasite loads. The US CDC provides consultation on the management of patients and acts as a reference laboratory to monitor for reactivation by serial PCR. The most common manifestations of reactivation in human immunodeficiency virus (*HIV*)–*T. cruzi* co-infected patients include central nervous system (CNS) mass lesions, with or without meningoencephalitis, and myocarditis. Diagnosis varies depending on the clinical presentation.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^115bj8Gn]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Uncertainties and complexities around Chagas disease (CD) testing processes in the United States pose a major barrier to increasing screening coverage, perpetuating a situation where less than 1% of the estimated population with the disease has been tested. This document provides clear, straightforward guidance to healthcare personnel to facilitate screening and diagnosis of people at risk, so they can receive timely and appropriate care.

While more research is needed on the epidemiology of CD in the United States, including congenital and vector-borne transmission and the burden of disease in specific populations, as well as on the performance of diagnostic tools in the heterogeneous US patient population, this document presents practical recommendations based on the best information currently available.

Ensuring proactive screening of patients will require concerted efforts to increase provider awareness, convey accurate information to the public about CD and its risks, and improve access to and performance of diagnostic technology and tools.

### Prognostic impact of Chagas disease in the United States [^1127CTe5]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

A prior publication from our group reported that Chagas disease is underdiagnosed in the United States. This review summarizes several aspects of Chagas disease, including modes of transmission, emphasizing the need for clinicians to be more aware of the disease and its consequences. Trypanosoma cruzi is present in many animal species spread throughout most of the United States. Chagas disease also reaches the North American continent through immigration, making it more prevalent than expected.

Apart from immigration, non-endemic countries should be aware of transmissions through blood transfusions, organ transplantations, or mother-to-child infections. In conclusion, it is possible that many chagasic cardiomyopathies are being misdiagnosed as "primary dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathies". Recognizing the evident threat of Chagas disease in the United States will increase clinician awareness and facilitate the correct diagnosis and treatment of this cardiomyopathy. Health authorities should ensure the generalized screening of T. cruzi in blood donors, organ donors, and pregnant women born in or who have resided in endemic areas.

### Chagas disease: An overview of clinical and epidemiological aspects [^113djF3f]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Chagas disease, caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a significant health problem in Latin America and an emerging disease in non-endemic countries. In recent decades, the epidemiological profile of the disease has evolved due to new patterns of immigration and successful control of its transmission, leading to the urbanization and globalization of the disease. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most important and severe manifestation of human chronic Chagas disease, characterized by heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, heart blocks, thromboembolic phenomena, and sudden death.

This article presents an overview of the clinical and epidemiological aspects of Chagas disease. It focuses on various clinical aspects of the disease, including chronic Chagas disease without detectable cardiac pathology, dysautonomia, specific features, and the principles of treatment of chronic cardiomyopathy.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^116ZiyqC]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Because parasitemia levels can fluctuate, the serologic status of infants born to mothers with chronic Chagas disease (CD) should be monitored even if the infant has negative PCR results early in life. Transferred maternal IgG antibodies persist in infants for up to 12 months. If an infant first evaluated at 3 months of age or older has a positive CD screening T. cruzi IgG test, performed through a commercial laboratory, repeat screening should be performed when the infant reaches 9 to 12 months of age. If antibodies remain detectable, confirmatory serologic testing through the CDC is appropriate to establish or exclude congenital infection. An increase in antibody titer over time after 9 months of age, documented at the CDC, indicates congenital infection.

- **Algorithm for evaluation of congenital Chagas disease**: For infants older than or equal to 3 months of age, follow the guidelines provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

- **Recommendations**: Diagnostic testing for chronic T. cruzi infection should be conducted using two distinct assays based on different antigens or formats, following Pan American Health Organization and CDC guidelines. If the results are discordant, a third distinct test should be performed. Confirmed diagnosis requires positive results by at least two tests.

Screening by clinical and public health laboratories in populations with low T. cruzi infection prevalence should be conducted using a high-sensitivity test, bearing in mind the anticipated false-positive rate.

### Chagas disease, an endemic disease in the United States [^1139wnHx]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Texas has undertaken extensive efforts to document human Chagas disease; cases were first made reportable in the state in 2013. The first known autochthonous case of human Chagas disease in the United States occurred in an infant in 1955 in Corpus Christi, Texas, in a home known to be infested with triatomines.

However, parasite transmission to humans in the region has occurred since prehistoric times, given, for example, a paleoparasitology study that recovered T. cruzi DNA in a mummified body (dated to 1,150 BP) of a man from western Texas with signs of megacolon. During 2013–2023, the Texas Department of State Health Services documented 50 probable and confirmed cases that were considered autochthonous, either because the area of vector exposure was known or because of a lack of travel to or previous residence in Chagas disease–endemic areas of Latin America.

- **Case stages**: Of those 50 cases, 3 were diagnosed at the acute stage, 44 at the chronic asymptomatic (indeterminate) stage, and 3 at the chronic symptomatic (determinate) stage. Based on CDC guidelines, diagnosis of chronic Chagas disease requires positive results by more than 2 tests that detect antibodies to different antigens, because no single test is sufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnosis. Of the 47 reported chronic cases, 31 (66%) were confirmed with serologic testing at CDC.

- **Acute cases**: Of the 3 acute cases, 2 were acquired in central Texas (Austin–Round Rock metropolitan area); the third case was acquired in the Rio Grande Valley region of South Texas.

A Spearman correlation test indicated that there was no significant statistical correlation present.

### The Trypanosoma cruzi antigen and epitope atlas: antibody specificities in Chagas disease patients across the Americas [^111JX9Ct]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Although the cellular and molecular mechanisms that produce diverse antibody repertoires and underpin antibody affinity maturation in response to infection are largely understood, a comprehensive description of their specificities in different infected individuals has been hindered by the lack of powerful tools.

Synthetic peptides have historically been used to map continuous antibody-binding epitopes or to find key residues for protein binding at a small scale. With the introduction of peptide arrays, it became possible to display large numbers of peptides on a solid surface at addressable positions. Given the sustained increase in the densities achieved by the in situ synthesis of peptides using maskless photolithography, it is now possible to display complete proteomes on a single slide, opening the door to high-throughput serological screenings.

Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a lifelong infection caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi. Despite being discovered approximately 100 years ago, the condition remains a major social and public health problem in Latin America and is regarded as a neglected tropical disease by the World Health Organization.

After initial infection, the parasite evades immune-mediated elimination and mounts long-lasting chronic intracellular infections. Due to the low parasitemia observed during the chronic stage of the disease, serological methods are the preferred choice for the diagnosis of infection. Although available diagnostic tests give satisfactory results in most cases, there is currently…

### Putting Chagas disease on the global health agenda [^113PGraY]. BMC Medicine (2023). Low credibility.

A successful parasite is one that can reproduce for as long a time as possible without immediately killing the host. As such, mortality from chronic Chagas disease (CD) is usually caused by long-term effects on major organs. Chronic CD typically impacts the heart and/or gastroenterological system. Heart disease occurs in 30–40% of chronic Chagas cases. Chronic myocarditis, increased cardiomyopathy, cardiomegaly, and thinning of the ventricle walls have been observed in autopsy. In 2018, *Circulation*, a journal of the American Heart Association, released an updated statement on the specifics of Chagas heart disease, highlighting the need for further research on the pathogenesis of the parasite in this organ. At present, the mode of pathogenicity of the parasite in causing disease is not well understood. CD manifests in the gastrointestinal tract as an enlargement of tissues. Megaesophagus and megastomach have both been observed in chronic Chagas sufferers. Clinically, this means that individuals with chronic CD may experience arrhythmias, heart failure, sudden cardiac arrest, and live with difficulty swallowing and processing foods, alongside stomach pain and constipation. As such, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated that CD was associated with 0.275 DALYs in 2019.

Named after Dr. Carlos Ribeiro Justiniano Chagas, a Brazilian physician, the disease and its transmission vector was first described in Brazil in 1909. Today, CD is endemic to South and Central America, with approximately 6 million individuals infected and 12,000 yearly deaths. The WHO estimates that 75 million people…

### Chagas disease and domestic medical screening guidance for newly arrived individuals under a humanitarian-based immigration status: A call for action [^115LSaZS]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). High credibility.

Chagas disease is considered one of the most important neglected tropical diseases in the Western Hemisphere, given its morbidity, mortality, and societal and economic burden. The United States has the fifth highest global burden of Chagas disease. Every year, thousands of migrant people from Latin America and throughout the globe travel to the U.S.-Mexico border searching for asylum. The U.S. CDC's Guidance for the U.S. Domestic Medical Examination for Newly Arriving Refugees provides recommendations to safeguard the health of individuals who enter the United States with a humanitarian-based immigration status, as defined by the CDC's guidance under key considerations and best practices. We encourage the inclusion of Trypanosoma cruzi infection screening recommendations in this guidance as an important step toward understanding the risk and burden of Chagas disease in this vulnerable population, strengthening their access to care, and contributing to the 2030 objectives of the WHO's neglected tropical diseases road map.

### Chagas disease and domestic medical screening guidance for newly arrived individuals under a humanitarian-based immigration status: A call for action [^112VhyZT]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2022). High credibility.

The U.S. CDC first published Guidance for the U.S. Domestic Medical Examination for Newly Arriving Refugees (formerly known as Domestic Medical Screening Guidelines) in 2006. The document provides health-care professionals with evidence-based recommendations to safeguard the health of individuals entering the United States with a humanitarian-based immigration status, as defined by the CDC's guidance under Key Considerations and Best Practices. The guidance emphasizes prevention, prompt identification, and treatment of communicable and noncommunicable diseases of individual and public health importance. The document includes disease-specific aspects of tuberculosis, malaria, Hansen's disease, soil-transmitted helminthiasis, strongyloidiasis, schistosomiasis, hepatitis B and C, and sexually transmitted infections such as syphilis, HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. The guidance lacks a screening recommendation for Trypanosoma cruzi infection — the most important parasitic disease in the Western Hemisphere based on its morbidity, mortality, and societal and economic burden.

A substantial number of individuals from Chagas disease–endemic areas seek entry to the United States with a humanitarian-based immigration status and are eligible for comprehensive domestic medical screening. In 2019, approximately 34.5% of the 46,508 individuals granted asylum originated from Latin American countries endemic for Chagas disease. An estimated 6 to 7 million people have left Venezuela since 2014, and Venezuelans are now the fifth-largest South American immigrant population in the United States.

### Updated estimates and mapping for prevalence of Chagas disease among adults, United States [^116CvTzt]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Six million persons are estimated to have Chagas disease in the Americas; 20%–30% of those cases will progress to cardiac or gastrointestinal disease. Early treatment of infection with the causative parasite, *Trypanosoma cruzi*, provides the best chance to decrease progression risk; cure rates are greater than 60% in those treated as children. Cure rates among adults are unclear; the accepted test of cure is reversion to negative serologic test results, which requires years to decades. The time to negative serologic results is inversely proportional to the duration of infection. Because the date of *T. cruzi* infection is nearly always unknown, age is commonly used as a proxy for duration. Infected persons are typically asymptomatic for decades.

In those with established Chagas cardiomyopathy, antiparasitic treatment is unlikely to alter heart disease progression. Thus, early, active screening during the asymptomatic period is essential to achieve timely diagnosis and effective treatment. Since the establishment of regional control programs in the 1990s, many Latin American countries have mounted community- and facility-based programs, most commonly focused on screening children and pregnant women. No such large-scale programs exist in the United States.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chagas disease, more specifically with respect to work-up, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend considering additional investigations at the clinician's discretion, as indicated by the patient's symptoms or signs, such as:

- **Echocardiography**: Useful in assessing cardiac involvement.
- **24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring**: Helps in detecting arrhythmias.
- **Barium studies of the esophagus or colon**: Recommended for evaluating gastrointestinal complications.

### Chagas disease [^114do5M9]. Lancet (2018). Low credibility.

Chagas disease is an anthropozoonosis originating from the American continent that has spread beyond its original boundaries due to migration. It is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which was identified in the first decade of the 20th century. Once acute infection resolves, patients can develop chronic disease, characterized by cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, megaviscera, and, more rarely, polyneuropathy and stroke, in up to 30–40% of cases.

Despite more than a century since its discovery, many challenges remain unresolved. Epidemiological control and diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic methods must be improved. In particular, the efficacy and tolerability profile of therapeutic agents is far from ideal. Moreover, the affected population is older and more complex, including immunosuppressed patients and those with cancer. Nonetheless, in recent years, our understanding of Chagas disease has expanded, and international networking aimed at altering the course of this deadly disease during the 21st century has begun.

### Chagas cardiomyopathy: An update of current clinical knowledge and management: A scientific statement from the American Heart Association [^114Pv642]. Circulation (2018). High credibility.

Chagas disease, resulting from the protozoan *Trypanosoma cruzi*, is an important cause of heart failure, stroke, arrhythmia, and sudden death. Traditionally regarded as a tropical disease found only in Central America and South America, Chagas disease now affects at least 300,000 residents of the United States and is growing in prevalence in other traditionally non-endemic areas. Healthcare providers and health systems outside of Latin America need to be equipped to recognize, diagnose, and treat Chagas disease and to prevent further disease transmission.

- **Methods and results**: The American Heart Association and the Inter-American Society of Cardiology commissioned this statement to increase global awareness among providers who may encounter patients with Chagas disease outside of traditionally endemic environments. In this document, we summarize the most updated information on the diagnosis, screening, and treatment of *T. cruzi* infection, focusing primarily on its cardiovascular aspects. This document also provides quick reference tables, highlighting salient considerations for a patient with suspected or confirmed Chagas disease.

- **Conclusions**: This statement provides a broad summary of knowledge and practice in the diagnosis and management of Chagas cardiomyopathy. It is our intent that this document will serve to increase the recognition of Chagas cardiomyopathy in low-prevalence areas and to improve care for patients with Chagas heart disease around the world.

### Updated estimates and mapping for prevalence of Chagas disease among adults, United States [^114Sgr3j]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Effectively addressing Chagas disease is complicated by the heterogeneity of healthcare systems in the United States. States play a major role in determining services for indigent, uninsured, and undocumented persons who are at highest risk for Chagas disease; thus, there is no universal pathway for these individuals to receive affordable healthcare. Nevertheless, most states have programs to cover uninsured pregnant women, infants, and young children. As a result, prenatal testing and evaluation of newborns and older children of infected women constitute high-priority, cost-effective aspects of Chagas disease control that should be within our immediate reach.

Managing the chronic sequelae of Chagas disease is complex and costly, with access to such care for uninsured patients varying widely from state to state. Federally qualified health centers may lack the capacity to provide access to specialty services such as infectious diseases, cardiology, and gastroenterology.

- **Strategies to enhance awareness**: Among relevant providers, including primary care physicians, obstetricians, cardiologists, and gastroenterologists, such strategies are urgently needed. Targeting locations with the highest Chagas disease burden will improve screening, management, and healthcare access.

Early treatment has the potential to prevent congenital transmission and decrease the future burden of cardiomyopathy and other chronic sequelae of Chagas disease. Screening asymptomatic persons at epidemiologic risk will be essential to achieve these goals. Population-based surveys in high-prevalence areas could identify those eligible.

### Chagas disease [^1163w9qZ]. Lancet (2018). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on Chagas disease:

- **Definition**: Chagas disease is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, and is associated with cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, as well as megaviscera.

- **Pathophysiology**: Chagas disease is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi.

- **Epidemiology**: The total estimated number of people with Chagas disease in the US is 238,091.

- **Disease course**: The transmission of the Trypanosoma cruzi parasite in humans causes tissue damage and an acute inflammatory response; with the persistence of infection, a chronic inflammatory response is elicited. This results in Romana sign, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, myocarditis, pericardial effusion, meningoencephalitis, cardiomyopathy, megaviscera, polyneuropathy, stroke, and death.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The risk of mortality in advanced disease is as high as 85% at 10 years.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^112Y5DTL]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Individuals who receive a confirmed diagnosis of Chagas disease should follow specific recommendations even if they are asymptomatic. For those testing positive for T. cruzi infection, an electrocardiogram is strongly recommended and carries high importance. An echocardiogram is also recommended, albeit with a lower importance, and a chest X-ray can be considered if an echocardiogram is unavailable (conditional, low importance).

- **Diagnosis**: Individuals with T. cruzi infection may either exhibit no evidence of organ involvement (indeterminate form) or show organ involvement, with or without symptoms. Those with any manifestations would likely test seropositive. It's crucial to determine whether the patient exhibits the indeterminate form of Chagas disease (CD) or has progressed to Chagas cardiomyopathy or other end-organ involvement to tailor a treatment plan accordingly. A normal echocardiogram and ECG suggest the indeterminate form of CD.
In situations where an echocardiogram is not available, a chest X-ray may suffice as an alternative. The ECG should be performed annually to identify progression to Chagas cardiomyopathy. This is necessary even for individuals receiving antitrypanosomal treatment. The echocardiogram may need to be repeated depending on the patient's clinical status.

- **Referral and special considerations**: Patients exhibiting cardiac symptoms or abnormalities in one or more tests should be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation. Those with immunosuppressive conditions require special attention due to the risk of reactivation and should be referred to an infectious disease specialist. Additionally, patients from the Southern Cone countries of South America, including Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay, may possess an increased risk for gastrointestinal complications.

### Screening and treatment of Chagas disease in organ transplant recipients in the United States: Recommendations from the Chagas in transplant working group [^115Hd9TA]. American Journal of Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Donor-derived transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, has emerged as an issue in the United States over the past 10 years. Acute T. cruzi infection causes substantial morbidity and mortality in the post-transplant setting if not recognized and treated early. We assembled a working group of transplant infectious disease specialists, laboratory medicine specialists, organ procurement organization representatives, and epidemiologists with expertise in Chagas disease. Based on a review of published and unpublished data, the working group prepared evidence-based recommendations for donor screening and follow-up testing and treatment of recipients of organs from infected donors.

We advise targeted T. cruzi screening of potential donors born in Mexico, Central America, and South America. Programs can consider transplantation of kidneys and livers from T. cruzi-infected donors with informed consent from recipients. However, we recommend against heart transplantation from infected donors. For other organs, we recommend caution based on the anticipated degree of immunosuppression. Our recommendations stress the need for systematic monitoring of recipients by polymerase chain reaction and microscopy of buffy coat, with advance planning for immediate antitrypanosomal treatment if recipient infection is detected. Data on the management and outcomes of all cases should be collected to inform future guidelines and assist in coordination with public health authorities.

### Physician awareness of Chagas disease, USA [^111fvAMG]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Survey results suggest substantial knowledge deficits among physicians, especially among obstetricians and gynecologists. The apparent lack of knowledge in the obstetrics and gynecology community is of particular concern because Chagas disease can be transmitted congenitally. Because Chagas disease may also be transmitted by organ transplantation, the proportion of respondents from this specialty who indicated they never consider risk for Chagas disease in their patients (39%) is also notable. In fact, many physicians surveyed never consider the risk for Chagas disease in their patient population (29%–60%) and are not at all confident that their knowledge of Chagas disease is current (27%–68%).

The study has some limitations. The conclusions are drawn from a study in which convenience samples from selected populations were used and are thus not generalizable to larger healthcare provider populations in the United States. The high participation rate of transplant surgeons may reflect a fluctuation in membership numbers. In addition, transplant surgeons may have an increased interest in Chagas disease because of recent instances of transplant-associated transmission.

These preliminary data suggest a substantial knowledge deficit regarding Chagas disease among healthcare providers, which could have a negative effect on patient health if Chagas disease is not recognized and appropriately treated. CDC plans to conduct larger scale KAP surveys of physicians in areas where blood donor screening results suggest relatively high prevalence in the underlying communities.

### Likely autochthonous transmission of Trypanosoma cruzi to humans, South Central Texas, USA [^115smeVR]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). High credibility.

Chagas disease, caused by Trypanosoma cruzi, is a major neglected tropical disease affecting the Americas. The epidemiology of this disease in the United States is incomplete.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of Chagas disease [^113v42vJ]. Lancet (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Chagas disease, specifically concerning serology, the PAHO/WHO 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining a combination of two serological tests with antigens that detect different antibodies against Trypanosoma cruzi (ELISA, HI assay, or IDIF assay). A third test should be considered if there are conflicting results, as this is regarded as the diagnostic gold standard for making a definitive diagnosis in patients with suspected chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection.

### Blood donor screening for Chagas disease — United States, 2006–2007 [^111nniSo]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2007). Low credibility.

Chagas disease, a zoonotic disease caused by the bloodborne parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, affects an estimated 11 million persons throughout much of Latin America. In endemic areas, *T. cruzi* is transmitted primarily by triatomine insects (i.e. kissing bugs); infection also can occur via blood transfusion, congenital transmission, organ transplantation, laboratory incident, and ingestion of triatomine-contaminated food or drink.

To evaluate an investigational assay for detecting *T. cruzi* infection in blood donations, the American Red Cross conducted a clinical trial during August 2006-January 2007, screening 148,969 blood samples at three blood-collection centers in the United States. In January 2007, after the new assay was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), other centers began screening donors for *T. cruzi*. This report describes the results of the American Red Cross study, which identified 32 donations (approximately one in 4,655) as confirmed positive for *T. cruzi* antibodies. As blood-donation screening for Chagas disease becomes more widespread, public health officials and health-care providers should anticipate increased numbers of questions regarding the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of Chagas disease.

### Chagas disease infection among migrants at the Mexico/Guatemala border [^111o2Hzn]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2017). Low credibility.

Chagas disease results in the largest burden, in terms of disability-adjusted life-years, of any parasitic disease in the Americas. Monitoring Chagas disease among migrants is critical to controlling its spread and to serving the needs of the migrant community. Therefore, we determined the prevalence and correlates of Chagas disease in regional and international migrant populations at the Mexico/Guatemala border.

Data were collected as part of a larger study of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and migration. Participants were a sample of recent regional and international migrants who used an illicit substance or had recent problem drinking. Trypanosoma cruzi infection was classified as testing positive on two different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Interviewer-administered surveys captured sociodemographics, migration history, Chagas disease knowledge, and access to care. We enrolled 389 recent migrants, and the prevalence of Chagas disease was 3.1%. Only 19% of the participants reported having ever heard of the disease, and less than 1% had been previously tested.

Trypanosoma cruzi-positive participants were more likely to have been born in a rural area or town than a city (92% yes versus 59% no, P = 0.02) and have recently lived in a house with a makeshift roof (33% yes versus 8% no, P < 0.01), walls (42% yes versus 13% no, P < 0.01), or floor (50% yes versus 21% no, P < 0.02), or cinderblock walls (92% yes versus 63% no, P = 0.04). With migration rapidly changing the distribution of Chagas disease, more work needs to be done to create targeted surveillance.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^114eL7cs]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Infants in whom congenital CD is suspected should undergo evaluation using existing CDC-based recommendations (strong, moderate).

Edwards et al. (2019) provides a comprehensive review of the diagnosis and treatment of congenital CD, which is summarized below. Infants born to women with suspected or confirmed CD, and infants with clinical features of congenital infection born to women at risk for CD, should undergo evaluation as soon as possible after birth to detect hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia, and as indicated, pneumonitis, heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or meningoencephalitis. The cure rate for treatment in the first year of infection exceeds 90%, and treatment is well-tolerated.

- **Algorithm for evaluation**: Infants ≤ 3 months of age born to a mother with suspected or confirmed Chagas disease, or infants with symptoms of congenital Chagas disease born to an at-risk mother with unknown serological status, should follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

Abbreviations: CCD, congenital Chagas disease; PCR, polymerase chain reaction.

If the mother's infection status is unknown, serologic testing for T. cruzi immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies should be performed to determine infant risk. Diagnosis of congenital infection relies on the detection of motile trypomastigotes through microscopic examination of a wet mount of fresh anticoagulated blood or a buffy coat specimen (collected in a microhematocrit tube), detection of parasites on Giemsa-stained blood smears, and/or PCR testing.

### Screening for Chagas disease should be included in entry-to-care testing for at-risk people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) living in the United States [^111PUboK]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Chagas disease screening of at-risk populations is essential to identify infected individuals and facilitate timely treatment before end-organ damage occurs. Coinfected people with human immunodeficiency virus (PWH) are at risk for dangerous sequelae, specifically Trypanosoma cruzi reactivation disease. Recently published national recommendations indicate that at-risk PWH, particularly those from endemic areas or born to women from endemic areas, should be screened via a sensitive anti-T. cruzi IgG assay. However, immunocompromised patients with negative serologic results may warrant further investigation.

Reactivation should be suspected in at-risk, untreated PWH with low CD4 cell counts presenting with acute neurologic or cardiac symptoms; these patients should be promptly evaluated and treated. One pragmatic solution to improve Chagas disease screening among PWH and thereby reduce T. cruzi-related morbidity and mortality is to incorporate Chagas disease screening into the panel of tests routinely performed during the entry-to-care evaluation for at-risk PWH.

### Neglected parasitic infections in the United States: Chagas disease [^114VHxk2]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2014). Low credibility.

Chagas disease, caused by the protozoan parasite *Trypanosoma cruzi*, can lead to severe cardiac and gastrointestinal disease. Most individuals acquire this infection through contact with vector bugs carrying *T. cruzi* in endemic areas of Latin America. The infection can also be acquired by congenital, transfusion, transplantation, and foodborne transmission. Although an estimated 300,000 persons with Chagas disease reside in the United States, little is known about the burden of chagasic heart disease. It is not known how often congenital or vector-borne transmission of *T. cruzi* occurs in the United States, though it is recognized that infected mothers and infected vector bugs are found in this country. Improved diagnostic tests and treatment drugs are needed to enhance patient care. Research is essential to define transmission risks and develop strategies to prevent new infections and reduce the burden of disease.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^112fnVD1]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Low credibility.

Should women of childbearing age from Latin America be screened? Screening women of childbearing age who have lived in a region of Mexico, South, or Central America with endemic Chagas disease (CD) can effectively identify cases and prevent congenital transmission of the disease (strong, moderate). Congenital transmission of CD from an infected mother to her unborn child is a potentially important mode of disease transmission in the United States. Several US surveys of pregnant women from high-risk groups have shown a substantial prevalence of T. cruzi infection. From a public health perspective, treating women before pregnancy can prevent congenital transmission and provide health benefits for the mother. Targeted and universal screening for CD in US mothers is cost-saving for all rates of congenital transmission > 0.001% and all levels of maternal prevalence > 0.06%, compared with no screening.

- **Key studies on congenital transmission of Chagas disease in the United States**: Studies indicate a significant prevalence of T. cruzi infection, which supports the recommendation for targeted screening.

Which clinical conditions warrant diagnostic testing for Chagas disease in people from endemic countries of Latin America?

### Congenital Chagas disease: current diagnostics, limitations and future perspectives [^116pW7PC]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Congenital transmission is an important route of *Trypanosoma cruzi* infection, both in Latin America and internationally, with considerable populations of infected women of child-bearing age residing in the United States and Europe. This review examines recent literature on congenital Chagas disease, with a focus on the changing clinical spectrum and potential new diagnostic tools.

- **Recent findings**: Vertical transmission occurs in approximately 5–10% of births from *T. cruzi*-infected mothers. Historically, congenital Chagas disease was associated with high levels of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Bolivian birth cohort data from the early 1990s to the present indicate that the incidence of symptomatic neonatal disease has declined. Treatment with trypanocides is greater than 90% effective and well tolerated in infants. Programs face challenges from the multistep screening algorithm, low sensitivity of microscopy, and high loss to follow-up.

- **Summary**: Congenital Chagas disease remains an important contributor to the global disease burden because of *T. cruzi*. PCR and related molecular techniques represent the most sensitive diagnostic modalities for early detection but require further optimization for resource-limited settings. Several novel diagnostic tests show promise for the future, but further validation and adaptation to field settings are needed.

### Recommendations for screening and diagnosis of Chagas disease in the United States [^116GaC1D]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). High credibility.

Four IgG serological tests have FDA clearance for the diagnosis of chronic T. cruzi infection: two are T. cruzi lysate-based enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISAs) - the Ortho T. cruzi ELISA and Hemagen Chagas' kit ELISA; a recombinant antigen-based ELISA (Wiener Chagatest Recombinante 3.0); and a recombinant antigen-based immunochromatographic strip test (InBios Chagas Detect Plus). All four tests have high manufacturer-reported sensitivity and specificity, but post-clearance performance data are sparse, especially in US-resident populations. In US-based evaluations, the Wiener Chagatest Recombinante 3.0 assay consistently showed high specificity and intermediate sensitivity.

- **Geographic variation in sensitivity**: Investigations confirm variation in assay performance by geographic origin of infections, with sensitivity generally highest in specimens from South America, intermediate in Central America, and lowest in those from Mexico, Panama, and southern Peru. These differences are often attributed to T. cruzi genetic differences but do not correlate entirely with the predominant lineages as currently identified.

- **Need for further evaluations**: Further diagnostic test evaluations in robust sets of specimens from at-risk US populations are needed to provide an adequate evidence base for recommendations for the use of specific assays. However, prospective parallel testing by multiple assays in population-level screening may be prohibitively expensive. In a serial testing scenario, the population is screened by a single test and only those with positive results receive a second test.

### Chagas disease, an endemic disease in the United States [^117KNfbn]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

In the United States, triatomines, commonly known as kissing bugs, are blood-sucking insects that occur naturally in the southern half of the country and have been identified in 32 states. Although available data are inadequate to prove that triatomines are increasing in geographic distribution or abundance — largely owing to a lack of standardized surveillance over time — they are increasingly recognized due to frequent encounters with humans in domestic and peridomestic habitats and increased research attention. Invasion into homes, human bites, subsequent allergic reactions or exposure to T. cruzi parasites, and an increasing frequency of canine diagnoses have led to growing public awareness.

Of all 11 triatomine species found in the United States, 9 have been found to be naturally infected with T. cruzi. Of those, 4 species (Triatoma sanguisuga, T. gerstaeckeri, T. protracta, and T. rubida) are commonly found in human dwellings, raising concerns about increased opportunities for vector-borne transmission to humans. Although triatomine colonization, defined as the presence of flightless immature nymphal stages in the domicile, occurs in the United States, metrics of colonization are lower than those observed in Chagas disease-endemic communities in rural Latin America. Numerous investigations of triatomines in the United States have revealed they harbor T. cruzi parasites, with infection prevalence ranging from 30% to over 50%. Triatoma sanguisuga and T. protracta kissing bugs have the largest overall presence.

### Chagas disease surveillance activities - seven states, 2017 [^117PQtmC]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). High credibility.

Chagas disease is spread via contact with infected vector insects (triatomines, also known as "kissing bugs"), congenitally, and rarely through organ transplantation or blood transfusion from an infected donor. T. cruzi vectors and infected mammalian reservoirs are found throughout the United States. The acute stage of Chagas disease is often asymptomatic, or flu-like symptoms will develop that can last up to 2 months after the 1–2-week incubation period. Infants are at higher risk for developing severe manifestations, such as myocarditis or meningoencephalitis during the acute stage. If untreated, infection becomes chronic.

Most patients with chronic infection remain asymptomatic; however, 20%–30% develop cardiac or gastrointestinal complications, which can be fatal. Chagas disease is likely having an underrecognized impact on the health care system and economy because of limited screening and treatment and a lack of awareness among health care professionals. With an undefined prevalence of disease and risk for transmission in the United States, surveillance for Chagas disease could help improve understanding of Chagas disease–associated cardiac morbidity and mortality, gastrointestinal disease, and risk for congenital and autochthonous infections. Timely recognition and treatment can prevent chronic infection and reduce health care needs.
